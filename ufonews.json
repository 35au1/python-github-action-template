            "article_content": "The emergence of DeepSeek sent some tech stocks tumbling.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek? The AI chatbot is topping app store charts\n\nChina-based AI app DeepSeek, which sits atop the app store charts, made its presence widely known Monday by triggering a sharp drop in share prices for some tech giants.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the top AI chipmaker, plunged more than 17% in early trading on Monday, losing nearly $590 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3.5%.\n\nThe DeepSeek chatbot, known as R1, responds to user queries just like its U.S.-based counterparts. Early testing released by DeepSeek suggests that its quality rivals that of other AI products, while the company says it costs less and uses far fewer specialized chips than do its competitors.\n\nThe product could upend the AI industry, putting pressure on other firms to lower their costs while intensifying competition between U.S. and Chinese companies, analysts told ABC News.\n\nConcerns about data security and censorship also may expose DeepSeek to the type of scrutiny endured by social media platform TikTok, the experts added.\n\n\"This is a big moment,\" Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, who specializes in AI, told ABC News.\n\nDeepSeek did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nHere's what to know about DeepSeek, and its implications for the future of AI.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is a chatbot fueled by an algorithm that selects words based on lessons learned from scanning billions of pieces of text across the internet.\n\nWhile made in China, the app is available in multiple languages, including English. DeepSeek soared to the top of Apple's App Store chart over the weekend and remained there as of Monday.\n\nThe company said it experienced some outages on Monday affecting user signups. \"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" DeepSeek said in a statement.\n\nDeepSeek is fully available to users free of charge. By contrast, ChatGPT retains a version available for free, but offers paid monthly tiers of $20 and $200 to access additional capabilities.\n\nDevelopers of the system powering the DeepSeek AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published a research paper indicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors do.\n\nDeepSeek also says that it developed the chatbot for only $5.6 million, which if true is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by U.S. companies in the sector.\n\n\"The lower cost to train DeepSeek means it can be offered at a lower cost,\" Oren Etzioni, CEO of Allen Institute for AI and a computer science professor at the University of Washington, told ABC News. \"That puts pressure on other companies to lower their prices.\"\n\nDeepSeek's developers opted to release it as an open-source product, meaning the code that underlies the AI system is publicly available for other companies to adapt and build upon.\n\nLlama, the AI model released by Meta in 2017, is also open source. By contrast, ChatGPT as well as Alphabet's Gemini are closed-source models.\n\nProponents of open source say that publicly available code allows a wide community of AI engineers to identify and fix flaws in a system, or tailor it for a purpose separate from its originally intended function.\n\nSupporters of closed source argue that the best way to safeguard AI is to keep the computer code private so it stays out of the hands of bad actors who might repurpose it for malicious ends.\n\nIn a June 5, 2023 file photo, Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT creator takes part in a talk at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel. Amir Cohen/Reuters\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek flexes the strength of the Chinese tech sector in an industry previously viewed by many analysts as one dominated by U.S. firms, experts said.\n\nFor some, the sudden arrival of a top China-based competitor raises concerns about data security and content manipulation similar to those leveled at TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.\n\nRegarding the former users on social media have posted numerous examples of DeepSeek choosing to forego answers on topics potentially sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of anti-government protestors.\n\n\"It's clear that there's some censorship built into the system,\" Marcus said. \"We don't want governments in control of what people can say.\"\n\nBoth foreign-owned and U.S.-based AI chatbots pose data concerns, however, since users sometimes enter personal or intimate information, which in turn could be used for commercial purposes, Marcus added.\n\n\"You have to assume that anything you type into a large language model could be seen by someone else,\" Marcus said.\n\nStill, DeepSeek's low-cost technological advance using outdated chips marks a major new entry into the AI market, Sosnick said, in turn forcing people to \"rethink assumptions that they had.\"\n\nThe emergence of a relatively cost-efficient alternative to other AI chatbots helps explain Monday's dip in the share value of Nvidia, which premises future growth on increased demand for new, expensive chips, Etzioni said.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Nvidia described DeepSeek as \"an excellent AI advancement,\" noting how the firm leveraged \"widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant\" \u2013 the latter apparently referring to controls put in place by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China.\n\nEtzioni said the open-source nature of DeepSeek also could challenge the profitability of other AI firms aiming to charge third parties for access to their products.\n\n\"We're soon going to see many models built on DeepSeek,\" Etzioni said."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant made big waves Monday, becoming the top-rated app in the Apple Store and sending tech stocks into a downward tumble. What\u2019s all the fuss about?\n\nThe Chinese start-up, DeepSeek, surprised the tech industry with a new model that rivals the abilities of OpenAI\u2019s most recent model\u2014with far less investment and using reduced-capacity chips. The U.S. bans exports of state-of-the-art computer chips to China and limits sales of chipmaking equipment. DeepSeek, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, reportedly had a stockpile of high-performance Nvidia A100 chips from times prior to the ban\u2014so its engineers could have used those to develop the model. But in a key breakthrough, the start-up says it instead used much lower-powered Nvidia H800 chips to train the new model, dubbed DeepSeek-R1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen up to now that the success of large tech companies working in AI was measured in how much money they raised, not necessarily in what the technology actually was,\u201d says Ashlesha Nesarikar, the CEO of AI company Plano Intelligence, Inc. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be paying a lot more attention to what tech is underpinning these companies\u2019 different products.\u201d\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nOn common AI tests in mathematics and coding, DeepSeek-R1 matched the scores of Open AI\u2019s o1 model, according to VentureBeat. U.S. companies don\u2019t disclose the cost of training their own large language models (LLMs), the systems that undergird popular chatbots such as ChatGPT. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told an audience at MIT in 2023 that training ChatGPT-4 cost over $100 million. DeepSeek-R1 is free for users to download, while the comparable version of ChatGPT costs $200 a month.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s $6 million number doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the cost of building a LLM from scratch, Nesarikar says; that cost may represent a fine-tuning of this latest version. Nevertheless, she says, the model\u2019s improved energy efficiency would make AI more accessible to more people in more industries. The increase in efficiency could be good news when it comes to AI\u2019s environmental impact, as the computation cost of generating new data with an LLM is four to five times higher than a typical search engine query.\n\nBecause it requires less computational power, the cost of running DeepSeek-R1 is a tenth of the cost of similar competitors, says Hanchang Cao, an incoming assistant professor in Information Systems and Operations Management at Emory University. \u201cFor academic researchers or start-ups, this difference in the cost really means a lot,\u201d Cao says.\n\nDeepSeek achieved its efficiency in several ways, says Anil Ananthaswamy, author of Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI. The model has 670 billion parameters, or variables it learns from during training, making it the largest open-source large language model yet, Ananthaswamy explains. But the model uses an architecture called \u201cmixture of experts\u201d so that only a relevant fraction of these parameters\u2014tens of billions instead of hundreds of billions\u2014are activated for any given query. This cuts down on computing costs. The DeepSeek LLM also uses a method called multi-head latent attention to boost the efficiency of its inferences; and instead of predicting an answer word-by-word, it generates multiple words at once.\n\nThe model further differs from others like o1 in how it reinforces learning during training. While many LLMs have an external \u201ccritic\u201d model that runs alongside them, correcting errors and nudging the LLM toward verified answers, DeepSeek-R1 uses a set of rules internal to the model to teach it which of the possible answers it generates is best. \u201cDeepSeek has streamlined that process,\u201d Ananthaswamy says.\n\nAnother important aspect of DeepSeek-R1 is that the company has made the code behind the product open-source, Ananthaswamy says. (The training data remains proprietary.) This means that the company\u2019s claims can be checked. If the model is as computationally efficient as DeepSeek claims, he says, it will probably open up new avenues for researchers who use AI in their work to do so more quickly and cheaply. It will also enable more research into the inner workings of LLMs themselves.\n\n\u201cOne of the big things has been this divide that has opened up between academia and industry because academia has been unable to work with these really large models or do research in any meaningful way,\u201d Ananthaswamy says. \u201cBut something like this, it\u2019s within the reach of academia now, because you have the code.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The United States\u2019 recent regulatory action against the Chinese-owned social video platform TikTok prompted mass migration to another Chinese app, the social platform \u201cRednote.\u201d Now, a generative artificial intelligence platform from the Chinese developer DeepSeek is exploding in popularity, posing a potential threat to US AI dominance and offering the latest evidence that moratoriums like the TikTok ban will not stop Americans from using Chinese-owned digital services.\n\nDeepSeek, an AI research lab created by a prominent Chinese hedge fund, recently gained popularity after releasing its latest open source generative AI model that easily competes with top US platforms like those developed by OpenAI. However, to help avoid US sanctions on hardware and software, DeepSeek created some clever workarounds when building its models. On Monday, DeepSeek\u2019s creators limited new sign-ups after claiming the app had been overrun with a \u201clarge-scale malicious attack.\u201d\n\nWhile DeepSeek has several AI models, some of which can be downloaded and run locally on your laptop, the majority of people will likely access the service through its iOS or Android apps or its web chat interface. Like with other generative AI models, you can ask it questions and get answers; it can search the web; or it can alternatively use a reasoning model to elaborate on answers.\n\nDeepSeek, which does not appear to have established a communications department or press contact yet, did not return a request for comment from WIRED about its user data protections and the extent to which it prioritizes data privacy initiatives.\n\nAs people clamor to test out the AI platform, though, the demand brings into focus how the Chinese startup collects user data and sends it home. Users have already reported several examples of DeepSeek censoring content that is critical of China or its policies. The AI setup appears to collect a lot of information\u2014including all your chat messages\u2014and send it back to China. In many ways, it\u2019s likely sending more data back to China than TikTok has in recent years, since the social media company moved to US cloud hosting to try to deflect US security concerns\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a panic over Chinese AI to remind people that most companies in the business set the terms for how they use your private data\u201d says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab. \u201cAnd that when you use their services, you\u2019re doing work for them, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nWhat DeepSeek Collects About You\n\nTo be clear, DeepSeek is sending your data to China. The English-language DeepSeek privacy policy, which lays out how the company handles user data, is unequivocal: \u201cWe store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\u201d\n\nIn other words, all the conversations and questions you send to DeepSeek, along with the answers that it generates, are being sent to China or can be. DeepSeek\u2019s privacy policies also outline the information it collects about you, which falls into three sweeping categories: information that you share with DeepSeek, information that it automatically collects, and information that it can get from other sources."

            "article_content": "Uncommon Courses is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.\n\nTitle of course:\n\n\u201cInvestigating the Paranormal\u201d\n\nWhat prompted the idea for the course?\n\nMy training and professional work have been in Mesoamerican archaeology, but I\u2019ve had a lifelong fascination with paranormal concepts. In fact, I considered studying the UFO community for my doctoral research in cultural anthropology.\n\nI eventually fused these two interests in my book \u201cSpooky Archaeology: Myth and the Science of the Past,\u201d which examines why archaeology shows up so much in ideas about the mysterious and weird. Most people are familiar with pop culture characters like Indiana Jones seeking magical artifacts. Perhaps less immediately obvious is just how common archaeological topics are in paranormal and conspiracy culture.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popularity of paranormal ideas \u2013 from television shows and thousands of podcasts to UFOs on the front page of The New York Times and in government investigations \u2013 made it clear that a course on paranormal culture would be an excellent way for students to get a taste of social science research.\n\nWhat does the course explore?\n\nThe material begins with premodern ideas of magic, myth and metaphysics. The narrative that \u201cWestern\u201d societies tell of the development of the modern world is that the Enlightenment cast off supernatural thinking in favor of science. The historical reality, however, is not so simple.\n\nAs science based on observation of material evidence emerged in the 17th through 19th centuries, so did a paranormal worldview: theories about a nonmaterial or hidden reality beyond the mundane, from monsters to psychic powers. Some of these ideas were tied to older religious notions of the sacred or strange but not divine phenomena. Others were new \u2013 particularly those suggesting the hidden existence of prehistoric extinct creatures or lost cities.\n\nIn either case, the key element was that proponents of these ideas often tried to support their existence with the kind of evidence used in science, though their \u201cproofs\u201d fell short of scientific standards. In other words, the paranormal is in conflict with the knowledge and worldview of modernity but also attempts to use the concepts of modernity to oppose it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe class examines how this tension produced 20th century \u201c-ologies\u201d like parapsychology, which examines evidence for consciousness beyond matter, and cryptozoology, which searches the ends of the Earth for creatures tied to the mythic past. We also learn about UFOlogy, whose proponents have collected alleged contacts with technology and beings from beyond this world ever since the Cold War, as great earthly powers filled the skies with secretive hi-tech aircraft and spaceships.\n\nAs the class concludes, we examine how the \u201c-ologies\u201d declined after the Cold War, alongside the cultural capital of science, whose height of public respect was in the mid-20th century. Since then, proving the existence of paranormal things to institutional scientists has become less important in paranormal communities than promoting them to a broader public.\n\nWhy is this course relevant now?\n\nBeyond public interest in paranormal topics, the paranormal is entwined with sociocultural forces that have dramatically increased the role of conspiracy rhetoric in the United States and elsewhere. At their core, both types of belief claim to have figured out some kind of supposedly hidden knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the conspiracy theories that are now commonplace in American political discourse are more rooted in paranormal ideas than in previous decades. Conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination or even 9/11 were still largely within the materialist realm. People argued that \u201cthe truth\u201d had been covered up, but their arguments did not rely on metaphysical ideas. Today, major conspiracy theories involve secret cabals, mystical symbols and code words, demonic forces and extraterrestrial entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s a critical lesson from the course?\n\nEvidence must be interrogated on its own, regardless of whether it fits your perspective. I find time and again that students have a hard time approaching evidence without bias, whether that bias is conscious or not: \u201cknowing\u201d that something must be true, or must be absurd.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne person apparently makes a death bed confession of faking a famous Loch Ness Monster photo, pleasing skeptics. Another claims to have seen a Bigfoot at close range, pleasing believers. Without further evidence, both are stories: no more, no less.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t to draw an equivalence between the bigger concepts. Not all narratives are equally well-founded. But students learn how to collect evidence, rather than simply rely on their gut sense of what is plausible or not.\n\nWhat will the course prepare students to do?\n\nThis course is meant to help students discern useful and reliable information about claims and events, separating them from irrelevant or inaccurate narratives or sources. The goal is not just \u201ccritical thinking\u201d aimed at combating disinformation, though that is part of what they should learn. Students practice evaluating evidence but also develop an approach for analyzing and understanding phenomena behind it: how factors like history, culture and institutions of authority, such as science and government, shape what people trust and what they believe.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

            "article_content": "Now is a good\u2014if, perhaps, mind-boggling\u2014time to be a reader. Especially one with a smartphone.\n\nDriven in no small part by social media influencers in book-focused online spaces\u2014such as \u201cBookTok\u201d or \u201cBookstagram\u201d\u2014the publishing industry is in the midst of a dramatic shift. There are the financial tailwinds to consider: Book sales are in solid shape . Last year set a record for six-figure publishing deals . Barnes and Noble is staging a \u201c comeback .\u201d Spotify recently reported higher profit margins, boosted by interest in their audiobook offerings . Independent bookstores are \u201c in demand .\u201d (More than half of the indie bookstores recently surveyed by the American Booksellers Association said their sales had increased from 2023 to 2024.)\n\nThen there\u2019s literature\u2019s widening grip on popular culture itself: Celebrities aren\u2019t merely fashion or beauty or beverage moguls anymore. They\u2019re bookfluencers , too. (As The Cut asked last year, \u201c Why Does Every Famous Woman Have a Book Club Now? \u201d) Fashion designers are hosting free book pop-ups and presenting their collections at bookstores . Literary events aren\u2019t the boilerplate marketing ventures of yore; with photo-collage stations, , flash tattoos and Botox , they\u2019re en vogue. The is booming.\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t actually reading , you want to seem like the kind of person who might.\n\nAs , \u201cOver the past several years, TikTok has dramatically reshaped nearly every aspect of the book business.\u201d That\u2019s specifically thanks to TikTok users, whose viral content can bump a book several rungs up the bestseller ladder. And long before BookTok exploded into the mainstream, Bookstagram and BookTube (YouTube\u2019s books community) joined global readers in online literary communion: sharing library \u201chauls\u201d; offering line-by-line criticism; and advocating for literature\u2019s necessity in the political sphere (and vice versa).\n\nAt the start of every year, publishers, editors, agents, booksellers, and authors are (rightfully) asked for their insight into the road ahead. Which books will be most popular? What hurdles will publishing encounter? With this article, we wanted to do something a bit different: Ask the readers.\n\nThe 21 influencers (or \u201ccreators,\u201d as some prefer to be called) interviewed for this story are nothing if not readers. Some boast hundreds of thousands of followers; others operate in smaller, more intimate communities. Some work in the publishing industry itself; others have jobs in marketing, medicine, hospitality, and beyond. Although their interests, expertises, and platforms are disparate, they\u2019re united by their love of books. And as they contend with the volatility of their platforms, many are reassessing their futures\u2014and the future of publishing altogether.\n\nHere\u2019s what they believe is in store for their fellow influencers, their attentive readers, and curious publishers in 2025.\n\nCourtesy of Chinelo Ikem, Sara Hildreth, Zoranne Host, and Brittany Pham Clockwise from left: Chinelo Ikem, Sara Hildreth, Brittany Pham, and Zoranne Host.\n\nPrediction No. 1: Influencer Dominance\n\nInfluencers\u2019 impact will be impossible to ignore in 2025.\n\nOnce upon a time, a glowing review in The New York Times or a segment on NPR\u2019s Fresh Air might have proved a book\u2019s golden ticket. Today, publishers don\u2019t necessarily covet such accolades any less, but their attentions are increasingly pulled in the direction of social media, where virality\u2014accomplished through readers\u2019 genuine enthusiasm\u2014can reap even grander rewards.\n\nAll of the sources interviewed for this story agreed that the influence of bookish social media will only continue to grow in the coming months, regardless of what happens to specific platforms such as TikTok. (More on that later.) Similarly, they believe that more and more publishers will invest time and resources in influencer and creator campaigns they might have previously spurned.\n\nAhead, the influencers explain, in their own words:\n\n\u201c[Publishers] are throwing more money at influencers. A lot of that has to do with the fact that it has become clear the way [influencers] are engaging with literature is changing the way readers engage with literature.\u201d \u2014Michael LaBorn, , tastemaker for Left Unread Books, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cI can attribute pretty much my entire life path to being on Bookstagram when I was 14 or 15...I was there in 2016 when Bookstagram was the reason books were taking off and bringing in money for publishers...I\u2019ve always been someone who wants to prioritize creators and influencers because I\u2019m like, \u2018You guys have your hands in the pot.\u2019\u201d \u2014Giselle Gonzalez, @hopelessbooklover_, book publicist for Tor Publishing Group\n\n\u201cThe best kind of marketing is word of mouth, which is [what] influencers [do]. If they tell you to read something, you\u2019re going to read it. I don\u2019t think that publishers are at the point yet where they\u2019re truly understanding that.\u201d \u2014Sera Wright,\n\n\u201cI really foresee [bookfluencers\u2019 platforms] continuing to grow, because...a lot of people are starting to realize they\u2019re allowed to read for fun again, [for the first time] since they were kids. Publishers are directly listening to [those] readers in a way I haven\u2019t seen in the past.\u201d \u2014Eden Yonas,\n\n\u201c[Social media] brings the publishing industry and the readers so much closer together. We\u2019re able, as readers, to tell the publishing industry exactly what we want to see and what we like and what we don\u2019t like, and the publishing industry can take that information and create the things we think readers want to see. That conversation has never been possible on this scale before.\u201d \u2014Megan Tripp, @booksnblazers, social media director at Penguin Random House\n\n\u201cBook influencers have become not so much outside of the publishing industry, but inside of it...Publishers are literally going to be looking at what content creators are doing to know which books to push.\u201d \u2014Chinelo Ikem, @interestedinblackbooks\n\nStill, influencers understand the forces they\u2019re up against: antiquated views about the \u201cfun app for teens\u201d; algorithmic signals over which they have no control; general internet fatigue; and their lack of easily identifiable credentials. Even within their own ranks, there\u2019s debate over individual influencers\u2019 publishing expertise. But what they can do for a book is undeniable, if difficult to quantify.\n\n\u201cInfluencers do influence. It\u2019s hard to concretely measure [their impact] a lot of the time, and I think that\u2019s why people tend to have less than favorable thoughts about [influencers]\u2014or don\u2019t really want to put a lot of resources behind them. That\u2019s been a pinnacle of my career: focusing on proving [their impact] to the publishing industry.\u201d \u2014Megan Tripp, @booksnblazers, social media director at Penguin Random House\n\n\u201cBook influencers are talking to and hearing from other readers, which is ironically the group that\u2019s been left out of literary taste-making for so long. I think there\u2019s plenty of room for traditional literary criticism alongside the types of more personal reviews that book influencers provide.\u201d \u2014Sara Hildreth, @fictionmatters, writer of the FictionMatters Substack and co-host of the podcast\n\n\u201cWhen I did eventually leave [my job in] publishing, I came to this realization that everything I was doing with my [YouTube] channel was far more impactful than anything I was going to be able to achieve as a single employee in a single publisher.\u201d \u2014Jananie K. Velu, @thisstoryaintover, tastemaker for Boundless Press, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cWhen the work that you do threatens the ecosystem [of traditional media], it\u2019s really hard. A lot of those channels are how publishers and other industries recognize that you\u2019re a real person\u2014worthy of their attention, worthy of their time. That [difficulty] is amplified by wanting to read books by authors of color. That\u2019s amplified by me being a Black woman. It gets exponentially harder to do a lot of the work because of the ways things are gate-kept. I think publishers do understand [influencers\u2019 impact]. But I think they want us to think they don\u2019t, so that they don\u2019t have to compensate us and treat us in a way that they would if they publicly valued us.\u201d \u2014Traci Thomas, @thestackspod, creator and host of podcast and writer of the Unstacked Substack\n\nCassandra Colby; Courtesy of Traci Thomas, Megan Tripp, and Seth Betzler Clockwise from left: Naomi Darling, Traci Thomas, Seth Betzler, and Megan Tripp.\n\nPrediction No. 2: Diversifying Platforms\n\nNothing will replace BookTok. But publishing will look to diversify which social platforms it invests in as influencers and readers do the same.\n\nEarlier this month, BookTok vanished. Temporarily. Had it lasted, the rapture might have concluded : TikTok\u2019s parent company, the Chinese-owned ByteDance, was directed to sell the app to a non-Chinese owner by January 19 or face a ban in the U.S. After ByteDance failed to meet the deadline, TikTok went for Americans\u2014a period during which the app presented users with a pop-up screen indicating the incoming president would work with the company behind the scenes.\n\nHours later, TikTok was back online\u2014and, with it, the BookTok influencers undergoing extreme emotional whiplash. After his inauguration on Monday, President Donald Trump signed that gave TikTok 75 days to seek a new solution. But while the app remains operational in the U.S. for the time being, many of its users\u2014both those dwelling inside the U.S. and those outside of it\u2014are unsettled. If TikTok can disappear that quickly, what\u2019s to stop it from happening again? Even if TikTok does survive, what form will it take in the future? Will its algorithm remain the same? And is it not concerning to watch tech companies bow to a presidential administration?\n\nWith these questions in mind, book influencers\u2014both those prominent on TikTok and those who have largely ignored the app\u2014are reassessing the path forward. No one knows what\u2019s next for any platform. But they can agree on the smartest next move: Diversify your reach. Start a YouTube channel (if you haven\u2019t already). Invest in Instagram Reels. Launch a Substack newsletter. TikTok will likely remain overwhelmingly popular, but it isn\u2019t enough to depend on the app anymore. Get your audiences to follow you, regardless of the platform you\u2019re broadcasting from.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything will replace BookTok\u2014the algorithm and the community are unlike anything else I\u2019ve ever experienced on the internet. But social media is inherently mercurial, and something new and totally unique will rise up at some point and dominate.\u201d \u2014Steph Pilavin, , tastemaker for Celestial, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already on a few different platforms, but nothing captures the informal nature that TikTok does\u2026[If TikTok ultimately disappears], I hope we do find a home somewhere, whether it\u2019s YouTube Shorts or somehow\u2014unlikely\u2014revitalizing Instagram Reels.\u201d \u2014Azanta Thakur, @azantareads\n\n\u201cI believe many content creators will go to YouTube to continue to create short-form content and longer-form videos. Those that may be tired of social media will head over to create Substack newsletters and content in community with other readers. I believe is a flash in the pan and won\u2019t be a long-term trend.\u201d \u2014Carmen Alvarez, @tomesandtextiles\n\n\u201cI think new energy and style will be on Bookstagram, and that is wonderful.\u201d \u2014Cree Myles, @creemyles, writer and curator for Penguin Random House\u2019s All Ways Black who has previously written for ELLE.com\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s alt-right move and data privacy issues have made people pretty weary of Instagram. I think people are also intimidated by YouTube\u2019s structure and the amount of effort needed to produce videos on there, in comparison to TikTok. Taking all of this into consideration, I am really interested in seeing what individual endeavors bookish creators will take on. I, personally, decided to reach out to my friend Emma Berry about starting an online bookish magazine to serve as a place for readers to have the same conversations they would have on these other platforms.\u201d \u2014Sera Wright,\n\nSome believe, thanks to the sheer number of platforms available\u2014and users\u2019 increasing desire for more intimate interactions\u2014that follower counts might become a less important metric for publishers to assess in 2025. The better gauge of an individual creator\u2019s power? The strength of their community, online or in-person.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been selling books, no matter what my platform size was. And I think that a lot of people, including publishers, don\u2019t always realize that.\u201d \u2014Naomi Darling, @fromthemixedupdesk, tastemaker for Boozhoo Books, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have 55,000 followers to ask for books and promote them. The way that platforms have changed, their algorithms have made [follower count] not matter as much. You can have a smaller following, and your stuff still gets out there.\u201d \u2014John Caleb Grenn, @jcgrenn_reads\n\n\u201cThe metric for success I\u2019ve always used is community-building. Having a bazillion views on a video is great. But what I really like is when the comment section is thriving.\u201d \u2014Megan Tripp, @booksnblazers, social media director at Penguin Random House\n\n\u201cBecause reading can be such a solitary experience, there\u2019s this need to talk about it, which is why book clubs exist. And because so much book media, especially mainstream book media, is failing\u2014not necessarily because of the people who are making it, but because of the way their institutions are crumbling\u2014there really are not a lot of outlets for good, meaningful conversation around books\u2026One of the things that online spaces do is enable people to create a community in which to talk about art that excites them and interests them, which is such a human desire.\u201d \u2014Traci Thomas, @thestackspod, creator and host of podcast and writer of the Unstacked Substack\n\n\u201cWith the current political landscape, readers are increasingly drawn to book clubs that prioritize meaningful conversations, representation, and personal connection rather than simply selecting popular titles. There\u2019s ample opportunity for smaller, mission-driven literary spaces to grow and have a lasting cultural impact.\u201d \u2014Glory Edim, @wellreadblackgirl, writer and creator of the Well-Read Black Girl literary community\n\n\u201cI think these online platforms are fantastic for finding your group. And then from there, if you\u2019re in Chicago or maybe even, like, a small town in Indiana, can you guys get together and do something? I think that\u2019s where things will definitely take off in 2025\u2014because then it\u2019s no longer just about the book.\u201d \u2014Morgan Menzies, @prettylittlebookshelf, host of Pretty Little Bookshelf book club\n\nCourtesy of Cree Myles, Michael LaBorn, Glory Edim, and John Caleb Grenn Clockwise from left: Cree Myles, Michael LaBorn, Glory Edim, and John Caleb Grenn.\n\nPrediction No. 3: Genre Remixes\n\nExpect the continued rise of new-adult and genre fiction\u2014especially romance\u2014and the resurgence of dystopian and horror.\n\nAs with fashion, trends in literature are often cyclical, borne on the tide of a wider national mood. But as celebrities are to skinny jeans and \u201cIt bags,\u201d bookish creators are to dark academia and , themselves spurring popularity for specific genres, styles, tropes, and themes in books. (Just look at the largely social-driven rise of romantasy and smut.) Here\u2019s what they predict will take off next:\n\n\u201cI most definitely think we\u2019re in a rom-com renaissance\u2014a rom-com-aissance, if you will\u2014and I think that\u2019s only going to continue in 2025.\u201d \u2014Seth Betzler, @dramakingbooks\n\n\u201cI have a feeling that dystopia is going to have a little resurgence. Am I excited about that? I don\u2019t know. Do I think it\u2019s going to be done well? I\u2019m also unsure.\u201d \u2014Jananie K. Velu, @thisstoryaintover, tastemaker for Boundless Press, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cBecause creators are so overwhelmingly focused on genre fiction at the moment, that\u2019s what the focus for publishers has been.\u201d \u2014Giselle Gonzalez, @hopelessbooklover_, book publicist for Tor Publishing Group\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of pregnancy horror, women\u2019s body horror, all sorts of queer horror. When things crumble and people are afraid, reclaiming topics through horror always sees a huge surge.\u201d \u2014Steph Pilavin, , tastemaker for Celestial, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cI attended YALLFest [a book festival for young-adult literature] and, in general, my conversations were all leaning adult\u2014in that a lot of YA authors were leaving YA to publish adult fiction, because that\u2019s what publishing was looking for. It\u2019s romance that\u2019s driving it. It\u2019s smut; it\u2019s intimacy.\u201d \u2014Azanta Thakur, @azantareads\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen an increase of classic fantasy coming back: classic tropes from the early 2000s and \u201990s. I definitely noticed dystopian is making its comeback, which makes sense because, in 2024 and a little bit in 2023, we had a resurgence of vampires and paranormal books.\u201d \u2014Zoranne Host, , tastemaker for Fantasy & Frens, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cI think there will be a rise of books that challenge a reader\u2019s attention span. I think there are going to be authors who write books like [Katie Kitamura\u2019s] Audition that are like, \u2018You better put your phone down and read every word on this page, or you\u2019re not going to have a clue what\u2019s happening in my book.\u2019 I like that. I hope we see more of that.\u201d \u2014Sara Hildreth, @fictionmatters, writer of the FictionMatters Substack and co-host of the podcast\n\nCourtesy of Steph Pilavin, Azanta Thakur, Giselle Gonzalez, and Morgan Menzies Clockwise from left: Steph Pilavin, Azanta Thakur, Giselle Gonzalez, and Morgan Menzies.\n\nPrediction No. 4: A New Normal\n\nPublishing will adapt to the current climate in politics and tech\u2014for better or worse.\n\nWith a new presidential administration in office, creators are bracing for the impact of a \u201cred wave.\u201d How exactly that might manifest in the books world remains a major question\u2014and certainly not all bookfluencers found the election results disappointing. But regardless of their personal politics, readers understand publishers are paying close attention to those politics.\n\nIn the wake of Trump\u2019s election in November, Hachette Book Group launched a new conservative-focused imprint called Basic Liberty, to be led by editor and The Heritage Foundation advisor Thomas Spence. (The move prompted outcries on social and protests from Hachette employees.) And though major publishing houses have maintained such conservative imprints for years, many creators fear that books intended to stir conspiracy and controversy might become all the more commonplace. Still others have expressed concerns that people from marginalized backgrounds\u2014already enormously underrepresented in publishing\u2014will have an even more difficult time getting their books on shelves.\n\n\u201cI think publishers are all kind of regrouping right now and looking to see how they\u2019re going to capitalize on the next four years.\u201d \u2014Carmen Alvarez, @tomesandtextiles\n\n\u201cWith this red wave, are [publishers] going to continue to seek out diverse voices? Indigenous media, in general, is sort of having a renaissance, a boom. Is that going to last?\u201d \u2014Naomi Darling, @fromthemixedupdesk, tastemaker for Boozhoo Books, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cRight now, unfortunately, the best-selling books on The New York Times [bestseller] list are still very white, and I think that will continue to stay the same. There\u2019s definitely been a trend away from diversifying your reading, because people are so sick and tired of hearing \u2018PC\u2019 stuff. I think, unfortunately, we\u2019re going to continue going in that direction.\u201d \u2014Azanta Thakur, @azantareads\n\nWith those worries in mind, many influencers are thinking deeply about how their platforms can be utilized for action and advocacy in 2025.\n\n\u201cBookTok has become a lot more advocacy-focused than it used to be. There are conversations happening about how to actually measure change in the industry. I don\u2019t think those conversations were happening two years ago...I think that BookTok is the most powerful bookselling platform in the world. If it were to [consistently] champion marginalized people, we would bring change to the industry with shocking speed.\u201d \u2014Michael LaBorn, , tastemaker for Left Unread Books, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201c[Bookish influencer content] brings more transparency around the industry to readers\u2014and vice versa. Readers can demand more transparency from the industry, and the industry has to respond and do something about it.\u201d \u2014Megan Tripp, @booksnblazers, social media director at Penguin Random House\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a huge push in holding publishers accountable. People have realized that they can gather this community and act as a force, instead of in response. I\u2019ve been seeing book content creators take charge more, look to where they can mobilize on- and offline, and really inspire.\u201d \u2014Steph Pilavin, , tastemaker for Celestial, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\nOf course, the new presidential administration isn\u2019t the only shift underway. With so much volatility and change in the tech sector, social users are increasingly wary of how quickly they can be stripped of their platforms, and how much they stand to lose in the process. Should apps such as TikTok change their algorithm (or, even worse, evaporate altogether), influencers fear that fewer books\u2014especially those without significant marketing budgets at major publishing houses\u2014will garner the attention they deserve.\n\n\u201c[Should apps ultimately disappear,] what I worry about is that authors from marginalized groups will have less \u2018discoverability,\u2019 because we know publishing already doesn\u2019t prioritize their books, and many authors from those communities cite social media as a way they were able to break through. I worry for those authors.\u201d \u2014Traci Thomas, @thestackspod, creator and host of podcast and writer of the Unstacked Substack\n\n\u201cI think creators are going to be a little bit more cautious now of the fact that it\u2019s so easy to lose your platform, which for a lot of us is our livelihood. Especially me, I am a disabled creator, and this is how I make most of my income. So I know I\u2019m definitely going to be moving forward with an awareness of how easily that can be lost.\u201d \u2014Cait Jacobs, @caitsbooks, author of Medievally Blonde, soon to be published with Harper Voyager\n\nLaurelEye Imagery Book influencer and author Cait Jacobs.\n\nNor are the apps themselves the only threat, as artificial intelligence grows increasingly powerful\u2014and prominent. After Trump recently signed an executive order revoking government policies he claims \u201c[hinder] AI innovation and impose onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI,\u201d the next four years look to reinforce AI\u2019s dramatic growth. Influencers have little doubt the dismissal of such \u201cguardrails\u201d will impact publishing\u2019s own approach to AI.\n\n\u201cWe made a blueprint of destruction, and we\u2019re following it. I see that seeping more into the book world.\u201d \u2014Sera Wright,\n\n\u201cWith AI getting more and more explosive, how are [authors] going to [compete]? Do you just get fed up and say, \u2018Ah, I\u2019m kind of done?\u2019\u201d \u2014John Caleb Grenn, @jcgrenn_reads\n\n\u201cI think publishing is reaching toward AI as an option to write more stories or market more books, to really cheat at the game, and I think unfortunately that will continue [in 2025].\u201d\u2014Azanta Thakur, @azantareads\n\nEven if their favorite authors and editors aren\u2019t altogether replaced with AI, influencers have noticed a troubling harbinger anyway: a trend in expedited production schedules to feed reader demand.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of publishers are pushing authors to write faster, write more, edit faster, get things out faster, so readers aren\u2019t waiting. It creates a binge effect, like Netflix...The authors who can do that and do it well, I\u2019m in awe of. But I do think that [pressure] becomes a disservice to the books we get sometimes.\u201d \u2014Seth Betzler, @dramakingbooks\n\nCourtesy of Eden Yonas, Jananie K. Velu, Carmen Alvarez, and Sera Wright Clockwise from left: Eden Yonas, Jananie K. Velu, Sera Wright, and Carmen Alvarez.\n\nPrediction No. 5: Rise of the Indies\n\nBookTok has made it easier for independent authors to get their books in the hands of readers. Even with TikTok\u2019s instability, the indie intrigue will continue.\n\n\n\nTo confront their disillusionment with traditional publishing, some authors and creators are looking toward small or independent publishing to inject fresh air into a stifled books scene. One prominent example? The recent launch of Bindery Books, a publisher working directly with influencers (a sample of which were interviewed for this article) to select and publish books that might otherwise have gone overlooked. Content creators who partner with Bindery are known as \u201ctastemakers,\u201d and they\u2019re supplied with the tools to launch and run their own imprints, the sales from which they reap a percentage of returns. Influencers\u2014including those not currently working with Bindery\u2014see the company as an indicator that alternative publishing routes are growing in prominence.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting frustrated with traditional publishing in a lot of ways and how they\u2019re not supporting their authors\u2026I\u2019ve definitely seen a shift across my book platforms where people want to uplift independent authors, find them, and help them go viral.\u201d \u2014Steph Pilavin, , tastemaker for Celestial, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a big trend toward self-publishing and indie books, which is great. I never used to read indie books before BookTok really kept pushing those stories naturally to the top of my For You Page.\u201d \u2014Azanta Thakur, @azantareads\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way that indie is going to head back into the closet. I think the indie space is going to get stronger and stronger, and I think that readers as a whole are getting on board with the idea that [indie publishing] can be done well.\u201d \u2014Michael LaBorn, , tastemaker for Left Unread Books, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\nAt the same time, traditional publishing employees are working hard to adapt to the erratic pace of the internet, in some cases scooping up self-published books and re-publishing them under their house\u2019s banner.\n\n\u201cIndie authors are now able to get a lot of attention, a lot of new readers, because of just one video going viral. A lot of indie authors are getting publishing deals because of that, while other indie authors who don\u2019t go the trad pub [route] are just getting readership they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have.\u201d \u2014Cait Jacobs, @caitsbooks, author of Medievally Blonde, soon to be published with Harper Voyager\n\n\u201cSelf-publishing is an amazing feat, and some amazing books are self-published. But then when the book gets picked up [by a traditional publisher], the audience and the reach is so much wider. I definitely have noticed a trend with that amongst romantasy books.\u201d \u2014Zoranne Host, , tastemaker for Fantasy & Frens, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\n\u201cFrom my personal experience, [traditional publishers] are trying always to adapt to the environment around us, and I think will continue to make strides. I think we expect publishers to adapt as fast as readers, and that\u2019s just not the case. The goal is always to listen to readers, to hear what they\u2019re saying, and implement those changes as quickly as possible.\u201d \u2014Giselle Gonzalez, @hopelessbooklover_, book publicist for Tor Publishing Group\n\nPrediction No. 6: On Course for Crossover\n\nBookish communities will increasingly experiment in content outside their niche. Publishers and advertisers will pay heed.\n\nMovie stars know the value of cross-sector promotion. Why settle for life as an actor when you can also grow your own beauty company or hawk your own whiskey? Similarly, influencers are eager to break out of the one-lane formula\u2014and widen their audiences.\n\nThey aren\u2019t planning to stop posting about books. But they also want to share their makeup dupes, tag their favorite denim brands in the comments, promote upcoming movies, and, ideally, get paid for it. A number of creators are already seeing success doing just that. Others want publishers to treat them more like beauty and fashion influencers: brought closer into the fold, selected for focus groups, brand trips, and ad campaigns.\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways that other companies are trying to tap into [bookish communities like] BookTok. In the same way that brand trips and things like that happen for beauty creators and skin care creators, they\u2019re starting to happen for creators in the books space.\u201d \u2014Eden Yonas,\n\n\u201cThe Shelves and the City event that HarperCollins put on [in 2024] was literally an event for content creators to celebrate content creators. They flew us out to New York City, they got our hotel, they got us a luxury tour bus around the city, took us out to dinner, took us out for drinks, took us to a bookstore tour, and it felt genuinely like we were being appreciated in that moment.\u201d \u2014Sera Wright,\n\n\u201cWe may see some creators expanding. They were doing books, but maybe now they\u2019re also showing you their skin care routine and where they get their hair done.\u201d \u2014Morgan Menzies, @prettylittlebookshelf, host of Pretty Little Bookshelf book club\n\n\u201cI feel like ads [and partnerships] directly from publishers are the hardest to come by. But what I do a lot are ads that are book-adjacent. One of was with the paint company Sherwin Williams. I pitched to them this five-tier bookshelf, and I took five of my favorite books in different genres and I color-matched each one, and then painted the shelves that color [in Sherwin Williams paint]. Stuff like that is a bit more sustainable, just because those brands have more of a budget.\u201d \u2014Steph Pilavin, , tastemaker for Celestial, an imprint of Bindery Books\n\nBut a dependence on brand-friendly aesthetics\u2014particularly, aesthetics that social algorithms favor\u2014brings up its own concerns.\n\n\u201cI notice, sometimes, the people whose content gets really pushed forward are young women who look beautiful, because who doesn\u2019t want to see hot women on the internet? I don\u2019t think that someone\u2019s content or book review should be popular just because they\u2019re beautiful, but that does happen a lot.\u201d \u2014Chinelo Ikem, @interestedinblackbooks\n\n\u201cSome of the more polished people [online] have a very cohesive image that you can see as aspirational, not necessarily realistic. Those people tend to have the most followers, too.\u201d \u2014Brittany Pham, @scienceowlreads\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little harder to get off the ground if you\u2019re not as comfortable being the face of a personal brand.\u201d \u2014Megan Tripp, @booksnblazers, social media director at Penguin Random House\n\nOne final prediction: Reading, now and always, will matter. Representation in reading will matter. The influencers interviewed for this story made myriad mention of books\u2019 necessity to a healthy democracy, particularly as book bans threaten the liberties of would-be readers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always worth investing in books,\u201d says Cree Myles. \u201cDespite the bad and ugly I\u2019ve seen and learned about publishing, at the end of the day, I believe in books. And I truly believe in book people.\u201d\n\nAhead, here\u2019s what a handful of those book people recommend you read next."

            "article_content": "Over the weekend, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released an AI chat app including a \u201creasoning\u201d AI model comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1, causing a stir among American AI companies as DeepSeek rose to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store.\n\nDeepSeek is a Hangzhou, China-based company providing generative AI models and AI integration. Its first products to make waves in the American market are the GPT-4-like DeepSeek-V3 and R1, an advanced \u201creasoning model.\u201d Like ChatGPT, DeepSeek-V3 and R1 quickly answer natural-language prompts.\n\nNVIDIA and Microsoft stock fell on Monday after the buzzy debut. Overall, the stock market reflected a sudden dip in confidence in U.S. AI makers. DeepSeek\u2019s success sparked conversation about whether U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to AI chips limited or encouraged competition.\n\nFor tech professionals, DeepSeek offers another option for writing code or improving efficiency around day-to-day tasks. Along with DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model being able to explain its reasoning, it is based on an open-source family of models that can be accessed on GitHub.\n\nWhat is remarkable about DeepSeek?\n\nLike OpenAI\u2019s o1 (formerly known as Strawberry), the reasoning model slows down its prediction capabilities to \u201creason through\u201d its work, which helps it provide more accurate answers. In particular, reasoning models have scored well on benchmarks for math and coding.\n\nDeepSeek said DeepSeek-V3 scored higher than GPT-4o on the MMLU and HumanEval tests, two of a battery of evaluations comparing the AI responses.\n\nDeepSeek said one of its models cost $5.6 million to train, a fraction of the money often spent on similar projects in Silicon Valley.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 and R1 can be accessed through the App Store or on a browser. Visitors to the DeepSeek site can select the R1 model for slower answers to more complex questions. When selected, the R1 model creates lengthy answers that explain in a conversational style how it arrived at its conclusions.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the DeepSeek chat site warned service may be disrupted, though the chatbot was functioning normally.\n\nDeepSeek also offers an APII, which operates through the OpenAI SDK or software compatible with the OpenAI SDK.\n\nSEE: OpenAI announced Operator, an AI agent that can take multi\u2013step actions in a web browser, such as choosing flights.\n\nWhat does DeepSeek\u2019s V3 and R1 launch mean for the AI industry?\n\n\u201cWe can fully expect an ecosystem of applications will be built on R1 as well as several global cloud providers offering its models as a consumable API,\u201d said Gartner Distinguished VP Analyst Arun Chandrasekaran in an email to TechRepublic. \u201cDeepseek\u2019s future success is predicated on its ability to continuously innovate (rather than being a one-off success), build a developer ecosystem on its products and overcome cultural barriers, given its country of origin.\u201d\n\nChandrasekaran said DeepSeek\u2019s low cost, efficiency, benchmark results, and open weights make it remarkable.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 was trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs. U.S. manufacturers are not, under export rules established by the Biden administration, permitted to sell high-performance AI training chips to companies based in China.\n\n\u201cThe potential power and low-cost development of DeepSeek is calling into question the hundreds of billions of dollars committed in the U.S,\u201d said Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, according to a note to clients acquired by ABC News.\n\nDeepSeek further differentiates itself by being an open source, research-driven project, while OpenAI increasingly focuses on commercial efforts.\n\n\u201cDeepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.,\u201d Silicon Valley insider and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen posted on X on Friday.\n\nGartner said the global AI semiconductor industry will reach $114,048 in 2025. Gartner predicted the power required for data centers to run newly-added AI servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours by 2027.\n\nDeepSeek introduces multimodal models\n\nOn Monday, DeepSeek followed up its success with another surprise: the Janus-Pro family of multimodal models. These models can analyze and generate images."

            "article_content": "Be they the industry\u2019s biggest players or the growing cast of upstarts seeking to steal their glory, 2025 promises to be a transformative year for agencies.\n\nSo, to coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, each day this week we are spotlighting agencies that we believe are poised to make a major impact through their work and activities in the months ahead.\n\nThe featured agencies, which we are revealing in a series of articles published each day this week, hail from all corners of the world and represent a diverse range of specialisms. Some are well-established networks, others up-and-coming indies. But what they all have in common is that they have earned The Drum Recommends status based on their achievements in 2024.\n\nSo delve in now as we hear from our first 10 Agencies to Watch about how they are planning to tackle what promises to be one of the most intriguing and potentially disruptive years the marcomms business has ever seen.\n\nOne of the key players in the Stagwell stable, the New York-based \u2018technology-first creative agency\u2019 is positioning itself at the forefront of the marketing AI race.\n\nCode and Theory\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDan Gardner, co-founder: AI transformation is CX transformation. CX is about to go to a new level as AI will allow a brand to simulate real-time, human-like interactions. Most people see this as chatbots, but it\u2019s more than that. The old constructs of the internet will be reinvented in a meaningful way that offers value to consumers by not only delivering information but also communicating with them on an emotional level. This is where the genuine innovation opportunity lies: combining technology and creativity for superior customer experiences.\n\nCMOs, CIOs and CTOs will finally sit at the same table, not because they want to, but because they have to. AI, data, and customer experience are crashing into each other so violently that no one department can own the process any more. The only way forward is collaboration, and the stakes are too high to ignore. Companies that fail to unite these roles will see competitors blow past them with speed and agility.\n\nPublishers will take the lead with technology. Building a sustainable future for publishers involves focusing on brands as a differentiator, regaining control over distribution (and data) and integrating AI to amplify human ingenuity. This will allow publishers to build genuine ecosystems of trust and deliver the kind of storytelling experience that will resonate, ensuring the industry\u2019s place as a cornerstone of informed societies.\u201d\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGardner: Building AI accelerators. We made ourselves \u2018Client Zero\u2019 with AI \u2013 because how can clients trust us to transform their businesses if we haven\u2019t mastered it ourselves? We\u2019re deploying 19 AI platforms (so far) \u2013 everything from OpenAI (also a client) to Midjourney and Adobe Firefly (another client).\n\nExpanding our network in terms of skillset and scale. Stagwell strategically decided to align all of its digital transformation agencies under the Code and Theory Network to deliver unparalleled creative and technology capabilities at scale. Together, we\u2019re positioned to deliver comprehensive value for clients from concept to continuity, serving as strategic partners in AI-driven transformation. Last month we added to the network and to our global aspirations by acquiring Create. Group, the leading digital agency based in the UAE. Expect to see our network only grow stronger in the coming months.\n\nFocusing on verticalization. We\u2019re going big on verticalization in 2025. This has a dual effect: it gives our clients confidence knowing their assigned team has deep industry expertise, and it imbues team members with an opportunity to develop a distinct skill set.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGardner: NBC \u2018Powering the future of data journalism\u2019: With trust in media at an all-time low, NBC partnered with Code and Theory to reimagine its election coverage Big Board, ensuring precision and credibility throughout the most consequential election in a generation (and beyond).\n\nNFL \u2018No Flags, Just Wins\u2019: The NFL dominates American sports \u2013 it accounted for 93 of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in all of 2023. But even as the nation\u2019s most-watched sport, the NFL needed to modernize its app to bring the game closer to its die-hard fan base and new fans alike. So the NFL called an audible and called in Code and Theory to transform its app into more than just a game-day companion, but an experience that fuels the rhythm of the game \u2013 every play, day and week, on- and off-season.\n\nYeti \u2018Map The Gaps\u2019: Google has mapped 98% of the world, 100 countries and 10m miles of concrete roads. But naturally, wilderness enthusiasts prefer the paths less paved. For Yeti, this posed an opportunity to take the Hopper M20 (our most versatile cooler yet), map hidden trails across the globe and make the outdoors more accessible to everyone. We built, designed and launched Map The Gaps \u2013 A Yeti campaign to take Google Street View way off the street, showing the world where the Hopper was built to go and inspiring Street View users around the world to explore the paths less paved.\n\nThe 600-strong agency network was acquired by Accenture Song in April 2024 and has continued to go from strength to strength, as recognized in being named Agency of the Year (250+ staff) at The Drum Awards for Agency Business.\n\nUnlimited\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nChris Mellish, group chief executive officer: In 2025, the industry will be shaped by rapid technological advancements, but without a deep understanding of people and channels, tech risks becoming noise. While AI is top of mind, it must be used carefully \u2013 not as a lazy answer to every question, but as a tool to drive efficiencies, deliver better insights, and ultimately create more impactful work for brands.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMellish: This year is going to be very busy for all the right reasons! Last year, TMW alone won 24 pitches, totaling \u00a37.9m in new revenue, including Suzuki, Oak Furnitureland, People\u2019s Postcode Lottery and Rail Delivery Group. We have a bit of a hot streak going on in the new business front across all our brands \u2013 our research agency, Walnut Unlimited, B2B communications and content marketing agency, Nelson Bostock and healthcare comms agency, Health Unlimited. We are now the go-to CRM agency of record for McDonald\u2019s \u2013 our first with Accenture Song. This is just the beginning of what\u2019s to come.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMellish: Lots of work to be proud of. From our integrated creative agency TMW\u2019s work for Suzuki Swift \u2018The Best Kept Secret on the Road\u2019 defying category norms against increasingly formulaic car ads, to our Pride in London work launching last year\u2019s festival with a visual style as daring, fearless and authentic as the community themselves.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nNobody knows Kraft Heinz better than its in-house agency, whose string of hit-making work cleverly leveraging the company\u2019s brand equity shows no sign of stopping.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nPlaying it safe isn\u2019t an option any more. This year, it\u2019s all about brands making moves that people can\u2019t stop talking about. \u2018Culture Sparks\u2019 are the way forward \u2013 those unexpected moments that break through the noise and leave an impact.\n\nBrands are also bringing creativity closer to home. The shift to incorporating an in-house model is real, and it\u2019s not just about speed \u2013 it\u2019s about being in sync. When creative teams live the brand\u2019s ambition every day, the work becomes sharper, more agile, and more authentic.\n\nRelevance is the ultimate flex in 2025. It\u2019s not about chasing trends but creating them.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nOur growth is proof that bringing together the power of creativity with direct connection to brand teams and strategy works at The Kitchen North America. In just three years, we\u2019ve gone from four to 19 brands and 35 to 135+ powerhouse creatives across two offices. We now work on 70% of the media plan for 90% of the brands, crafting full 360 campaigns, social-first content and cultural moments that hit different. As the creative agency of record for select brands, we don\u2019t just answer briefs \u2013 we create them. This isn\u2019t just growth; it\u2019s impact, built on trust and bold ideas that keep Kraft Heinz ahead of the curve.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe brought nostalgia back with the Napoleon Dynamite x Ore-Ida campaign, proving that tater-tot-protecting pants do exist. The Oscar Mayer\u2019s Bologna Song became a literal form of payment, and when a viral moment such as Dua Lipa\u2019s Pickle x Diet Coke popped off, we didn\u2019t just watch \u2013 it sparked an idea for Claussen to launch \u2018Just the Brine\u2019 within days.\n\nNow entering its fifth year, Fight or Flight is soaring thanks to its highly creative campaigns for B2B brands. The London-based outfit was the third-placed Independent Agency of the Year at The Drum Awards Grand Finale 2024.\n\nFlight or Fight\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDavid Woodward, co-founder: As the influence of brand inside B2B organizations rises, one thing we\u2019re seeing is closer alignment between the brand and communications teams. Increasingly, B2B brand campaigns are being driven by earned tactics, and vice versa, comms teams are more frequently being tasked with promoting and explaining brand messages. We\u2019re still seeing more traditional uses of B2B comms (for example, to support product), but in particular, this \u2018culture swap\u2019 of brand and comms is leading to better, more noticeable, more memorable and more emotively arresting work.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWoodward: We see 2025 as a continuation of our aggressive expansion into new markets and new opportunities. In 2024, alongside significant expansion in the UK, Fight or Flight achieved almost 100% growth in North America, driven partly by brand-level engagements for AI companies in sectors such as life sciences and HR. We expect the fast rate to continue as we further diversify our sector offerings into fintech and ESG.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWoodward: We\u2019re particularly proud of our work for St John Ambulance, which wanted to encourage more people and workplaces to take its life-saving CPR training. Our research found that a third of men were too embarrassed to give a woman CPR, with potentially life-threatening consequences.\n\nWe created the world\u2019s first life-saving bra \u2013 The CPR Bra \u2013 which included simple visual prompts on how to perform CPR on a woman. We then persuaded celebrities to wear the bra and help close the CPR gender gap. Our story went pretty much everywhere, including a 13-minute live slot on BBC Breakfast, turning ER into PR.\n\nOur campaign for DrDoctor focused on \u2018the DNA problem.\u2019 DNAs (Did Not Attends) are patients who miss their hospital appointments. In the UK, there are 7 million DNAs every year and they cause huge operational issues for an already stretched NHS. To help Hospital Trusts understand why DNAs happen, we created DoNnA, the world\u2019s first AI patient, trained on data taken from the largest-ever survey of DNA patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelmed by the bullish Dimi Albers, the Amsterdam-headquartered agency has expanded into a global powerhouse with a presence in 30 offices across Europe, North America and Latin America.\n\nDept\n\nDimi Albers, global CEO: What trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nIn 2025, we\u2019ll finally see AI move from an efficiency and cost-cutting tool to a force to reimagine how businesses operate, make decisions, and interact with consumers. As AI transformation takes center stage \u2013 and swift, strategic, and solutions-oriented applications of AI become a priority \u2013 the organizations that enable their people to transform with AI will distinguish themselves in an emerging sea of sameness.\n\nAlbers: What does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nRebels with a B Corp cause: we are purpose-driven and invested, committed to building lasting client relationships and positively impacting culture, brands, and the world. We\u2019re the first global agency to be B-Corp certified, and we\u2019re currently undergoing recertification \u2013 a first in the industry. This means we\u2019re building the plane as we fly it. While the agency world has been helping other brands sell sustainability (sometimes greenwash) for ages, it\u2019s only been in the past few years that the industry has started to look inward and think about sustainability, ethics, and inclusion practices within our industry. Being a part of the B Corp Community helps us do that \u2013 and especially at our size, has helped us build the muscles around how to do that early.\n\nAlbers: What work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nFor Just Eat Takeaway, a cross-discipline team of 35 creatives, technologists and producers brought fans of Squid Games together on a multisensory campaign spanning above-the-line, experiential, influencers and an AI-powered game.\n\nFor Cosnova, we built Kenna, an AI-enabled virtual assistant that can help customers explore new products and trends. Kenna is available across multiple channels including social, events, and POS.\n\nIn partnership with Coca-Cola, we created \u2018Neon Nights,\u2019 an AI-powered short story about a boy named Max. Using 12 generative tools and with over 600 hours of production, the film was submitted to Runway\u2019s AI Film Festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by recently secured private equity investment, the ambitious UK-based social media and influencer agency is now targeting the US market.\n\nCoolr\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAdam Clyne, chief executive officer: Predictions for 2025? From a social media agency owner? Really?! We\u2019re only three weeks into the year, and already we\u2019ve seen Meta replace fact-checking with community notes, a TikTok ban that lasted all of 12 hours, and Instagram switching up the grid layout\u2026 yet again. And that\u2019s before we even consider the broader macroeconomic and political shifts \u2013 from the Middle East and Ukraine to a new president in the US, and here at home, a government grappling with economic challenges.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: predicting trends when everything feels in constant flux is no easy task. But if I had to point to one key trend, it\u2019s this: the marketing community will need to embrace the chaos! We\u2019ll need to get comfortable operating in an environment of constant change, navigating uncertainty, and staying agile. Plans will evolve, and both agencies and clients will need to collaborate more closely than ever to adapt to external forces.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nClyne: 2024 was a phenomenal year for Coolr. The agency grew by almost 75% and towards the end of the year we secured investment from Growth Capital Partners, a leading private equity firm, to help scale Coolr to the next level.\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant investments in people and technology to strengthen our strategic capabilities \u2013 from insights and planning to cutting-edge measurement. As we approach a headcount of 150 full-time employees in the UK, we\u2019re focused on creating a robust operational structure to support our growth.\n\nThe big milestone for 2025? Expanding Coolr into the US. We\u2019re actively building a comprehensive plan to take our proposition across the Atlantic. It\u2019s an exciting step, and we\u2019re determined to make Coolr a major player in the US market.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nClyne: 2024 was filled with creative highlights that we\u2019re incredibly proud of. We teamed up with Martine McCutcheon and Lidl to put a fresh spin on Gina G\u2019s classic song, creating \u2018Oh, Ah, Just a Lidl Bit!\u2019 \u2013 a campaign that set social media alight and delivered a standout moment for supermarkets.\n\nFor Deliveroo, we championed local restaurants with the \u2018Local\u2019 campaign, working alongside Top Jaw and nano influencers to celebrate independent food businesses across the UK.\n\nAnd with Bupa, we sparked vital conversations about mental health, particularly focusing on the 58% of men who struggle to open up about these issues. It was work that truly mattered, and we were proud to play a role in starting those important discussions.\n\nThe Omnicom media agency has developed an uncanny knack for working on some of the most talked-about campaigns of recent times, including the acclaimed Barbie movie media blitz and Jaguar\u2019s hotly debated \u2018Copy Nothing\u2019 makeover rollout.\n\nHearts and Science\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nGarrett O\u2019Reilly, chief executive officer: AI will likely feature heavily as it\u2019s already a focal point for lots of people and its transformational impact will continue into 2025. One particular area I think it will start to tangibly impact will be AI-driven search. The growing prevalence and usage of AI assistants on devices will grow and will have profound disruptive effects on consumer behavior and fundamentally change how people find answers to all sorts of questions. Brands will need to optimize sales and their purchase funnels in accordance with that and we\u2019ll have to adapt our services to help clients adjust to (and win in) this new reality.\n\nIf the first few weeks of 2025 are indicative of what\u2019s to come, there will also be uncertainty in policies and platform governance. In the face of this, our industry must remain focussed on responsible marketing \u2013 even if this centers on self-control and self-governance over third-party regulation. This means it\u2019s on us, as an industry, to foreground all aspects of responsible marketing: diversity, equity, inclusion, environmental sustainability, data protection and ethical investment practices.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m optimistic that this shifting landscape will drive greater media diversification as we find new ways to deliver value for clients. Agencies will play a critical role in guiding brands toward more innovative solutions, new partnerships and experimentation.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nO\u2019Reilly: We\u2019re particularly excited to continue leveraging our sponsorship of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, ensuring its huge bank of empirical evidence, research and insights benefit both our agency and our clients. This will include evolving our industry-leading Category Entry Points tool, which is driving business growth for an increasing range of clients.\n\nOur Access All Agency initiative will return for a second year \u2013 bigger and better. The program, launched as an educational initiative for rising stars among our media owner partners, aims to deepen their understanding of how agencies operate and thus drive greater collaboration.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nO\u2019Reilly: 2024 was our most successful year to date in terms of industry awards, and that speaks volumes. But what\u2019s particularly pleasing was lots of our work became part of wider culture and in doing so generated disproportionate visibility for our clients\u2019 brands.\n\nA big focus for us was delivering the biggest account transition in the UK for over a decade as we onboarded Allwyn. While this was a great success in operational terms, we\u2019re immensely proud of the work we\u2019ve already delivered for them this year. The highlight of 2024 for me has to be supporting Team GB and ParalympicsGB. Our work drove a double-digit rise in consideration for the brand and every ticket sold contributed to the UK\u2019s haul of 189 medals.\n\nIt was also great to be part of one of the most talked about campaigns of the year. Our work with Jaguar on its Copy Nothing campaign earned the title of YouGov\u2019s \u2018most improved brand\u2019 in December, outperforming all the Christmas ads\u2026. And there\u2019s still the actual car to come.\n\nThe female-led agency has the US in its sights having made its mark with eye-catching brand experiences for the likes of McDonald\u2019s, Netflix and Volvo in its UK home market.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nLouisa O\u2019Connor, managing director: Collective experiences will define 2025 \u2013 people value shared emotions and memories, and brands are seeing the impact this has on their resonance. We\u2019re also seeing the rise of the common influencer, which is reshaping marketing strategies; consumers are becoming the heroes versus paid creators, driven by the demand for authenticity. I think we\u2019ll also see nostalgia remain a key trend, with the focus shifting from retro aesthetics to simplification and a need to go back to basics as the tech world can feel overwhelming.\n\nIn experiential marketing, we see a lot of tech used for tech\u2019s sake. However, brands are moving away from that to focus on the human aspect, tapping into the niche needs of the individual instead of the masses. Consumers crave simplicity and look for brands to alleviate their pain points, which is now influencing how we design experiences. It\u2019s less about what an activation will look like on a camera and more about the emotion that an experience can create.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nO\u2019Connor: This will be our fourth year of trading, and as we expand, we have two main priorities. Firstly, we are focused on growing our content and broadcast team. Working with many social-first brands, we want to push our live streaming, content creation, scriptwriting and show curation capabilities. Secondly, the US is calling. Having activated there a few times already, we believe now is the time to solidify our presence and serve our existing US clients more holistically. Some of the most exciting events in the world are hosted there, so it\u2019s a no-brainer for us to expand our offering and bring our Seen Presents way to the US market.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nO\u2019Connor: It was our second year delivering Netflix\u2019s presence at Cannes Lions, where we brought seven different titles to life in unique and participatory ways. Not only does this project showcase our team\u2019s creativity, but it also blends our strategy, content and production capabilities to deliver something truly spectacular. It\u2019s a huge logistics and production challenge: building six floors above the Croisette, with crane-only access, while the team is completely exposed to the elements.\n\nWe ended 2024 preparing for Live Fest \u2013 one of the biggest events in TikTok\u2019s calendar \u2013 consisting of four live events in six days and logistics for 600 creators from around the world. From hospitality, activations, complex live streaming, red carpet logistics, RFID systems and talent sourcing and booking \u2013 it truly touched every area of our business. It was a mammoth effort and a career highlight for us all.\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team. Weekly Marketing Stay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team. The Drum Insider Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\n\nThe serial Ad of the Day and The Drum Awards winner shows no sign of slowing down on its convention-defying advertising for the likes of Bodyform and Curry\u2019s.\n\nAMV BBDO\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nSam Williams, head of strategy: Bringing a human face to big data: \u201cData driven creative\u201d is a phrase that\u2019s dominated the industry for the last decade, but the risk is hyper-targeting without the humanity. It\u2019s time to show that the power of emotion can be applied just as effectively in performance media as in storytelling formats. At AMV we\u2019ve built a proprietary data tool called Kaleidoscope, which allows us to track consumer emotions at scale by time, day of the week and by geography \u2013 giving us an emotional lens which can be overlaid onto demographic data.\n\nLearn from AI, then break the rules: We see AI is a powerful way of quickly getting to creative ground zero. But we have to remember that its output is limited by convention and the data available to it \u2013 this grounds it in uniformity, not bravery. AI can accelerate the beginning of the creative process by showing us the expected, then giving us the confidence to break the rules and do something stand out. Afterall, no AI would have told us the creative way to launch new Sheba Gravy Pouches was by pitting \u201ccatfluencers\u201d against each other in the ultimate Gravy Race.\n\nBeyond inclusivity to accessibility: It\u2019s time to stop seeing accessibility as a creative hindrance and see it as a creative tool we can use to make the experience richer for all. It\u2019s no longer enough to make your cast and production crew inclusive, your output must be accessible too. It\u2019s a belief we\u2019ve pushed on our Curry\u2019s C4 diversity win and an ethos we\u2019re now rolling out across the agency briefing and production process.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nXavier Rees, group CEO: Last year, we rediscovered our best selves \u2013 a powerhouse of strategy and creativity. We were back in the room for some of the industry\u2019s most competitive pitches, securing four major account wins in the last four months of 2024 alone, including Mercedes F1 Team, E.ON Next and Philips Personal Care. And we continued to craft impactful and effective work that real people love for clients, including Guinness\u2019 largest-ever global campaign, more taboo-breaking campaigns for Bodyform, and bold work for Currys, which is really impacting on sales.\n\nIf last year was about setting the stage for success, 2025 is about delivering on that promise. In January, we strengthened our Executive Leadership Team with Jo Arden joining as group chief strategy officer and Jemima Monies as group chief growth officer. The roles further consolidate our focus on driving business transformation and creative excellence across AMV BBDO and Redwood BBDO. Jo and Jemima will work alongside the Leadership Teams of both agencies, including AMV BBDO joint chief creative officers Nick and Nadia. We have new, exciting campaigns coming out for much-loved brands Whiskas, Decathlon, Sheba and Maltesers, and we\u2019re gearing up to launch our Channel 4 Diversity in Advertising Awards-winning work for Currys, in May.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nNadja Lossgott, chief creative officer: Bodyform \u2018Never Just a Period\u2019: the work sees Bodyform widening the conversation around menstruation with another viral punch. Directed by the brilliant Lucy Forbes, \u201cNever Just a Period\u201d humorously brings to life the gap between what girls are taught to expect and the reality of menstrual experiences, and how absurd it is to have been given so little knowledge about their own bodies.\n\nCurrys \u2018Beyond Techspectations \u2013 IRL\u2019: The Drum Ad Of The Day, Currys \u2018Beyond Techspectations\u2019 series ventures into mockumentary territory in AMV BBDO\u2019s film \u201cAmazing Us (IRL)\u201d, showing online shoppers venturing into a real-life Currys store and discovering the joy of shopping in person \u2013 even if they struggle to give up some of their digital habits, such as swiping right and trying to magnify images.\n\nSheba \u2018Gravy Race\u2019: AMV BBDO has enlisted eight celebrity felines with a combined 55 million TikTok and Instagram followers to compete in a bracket-style tournament where they raced each other to lick up Sheba\u2019s new Gravy Indulgence cat food. By breaking with the clich\u00e9s of pet food advertising, the Gravy Race delivered an entertaining piece of content that cut through the sea of sameness.\n\nMercedes F1 \u2018Every Dream Needs a Team\u2019: As the 2024 F1 season came to an end at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on December 8, we helped the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team to pay tribute to Lewis Hamilton in a heartfelt global campaign.\n\nRSPCA \u2018For Every Kind\u2019: The RSPCA unveile its major new brand positioning with AMV BBDO\u2019s film \u2018For Every Kind,\u2019 a rallying cry for every kind of person to be kind in every possible way to every kind of animal.\n\nFounded in 1985, the stalwart agency was snapped up by Havas in early 2024 to spearhead its B2B marketing efforts and looks well-placed to leverage its newfound scale.\n\nLedger Bennett\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAndrea Glenn, CEO: AI... just kidding. Clients are starting to realize they have a wealth of B2B opportunity in their businesses already, but organizational silos are holding them back from realizing their full B2B potential. Marketing and sales don\u2019t nor can work in siloes, nor customer and product. As such, clients look for more full-service offerings from agencies that both bind creative and media together and have the scale to do it. And they don\u2019t want CRM, ABM, web and so forth operating separately with a single partner each. Instead, they are on the hunt for consultative partners who can bring these functions together to deliver customer lifetime value. We\u2019re excited to see this unleash further opportunity in B2B, a space that remains ripe for growth for many businesses and agencies alike.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGlenn: We have some exciting plans this year, which would not have been possible without the scale Havas Media Network and Havas Group can offer. When looking at partners who could help us achieve our strategic objectives, global expansion \u2013 including in the markets we already operate \u2013 was key and this year, we are looking to increase our foothold in Ireland and the US particularly, where we will partner with Havas Media Network North America to build a full-service B2B offering to work with B2B and B2C brands. We\u2019re now in a position to provide a full-service offering to clients that straddle both B2B and B2C in North America. Our chief strategy officer will be relocating to New York to lead our North American expansion. In this context, our decision to be acquired by Havas Media Network UK last year and our shared pursuit of customer-centricity has been a brilliant mutual culture fit.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGlenn: GE Vernova \u2018How to Launch an ABM Campaign in Five Days\u2019: GE Vernova\u2019s marketing team needed to grow its sales pipeline by 4x for its new power orchestration solution \u2013 all within H1. To achieve this audacious goal, we held a kaizen (or continuous improvement) session. This involved taking our client\u2019s people out of their daily responsibilities and bringing them together around a single-minded purpose. In just five days, we identified priority audiences, began mapping accounts, created a value proposition, key messaging, and content strategy, developed a sales process, and launched 1-to-1 and 1-to-few ABM programs. This strategy garnered real results, including a x2 increase in pipeline within 30 days of the kaizen."

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I f*cked up,\u201d Justin Baldoni admitted to his It Ends With Us co-star Blake Lively in a 2 a.m. April 2023 voice message after delivering a less than enthusiastic response to a scene rewrite from the deflated Gossip Girl vet. \u201cI will admit and apologize when I fail, the Jane the Virgin alum added in the six-minute missive about the rooftop sequence from the Sony distributed hit. \u201cI\u2019m a very flawed man, as my wife will attest.\u201d\n\nFar from the first piece of private correspondence or communication between the co-stars and their various publicists unveiled since Lively filed a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint on December 20 with California\u2019s Civil Rights department, today\u2019s nearly two-year old and rambling voice message comes as a federal judge has penciled in a March 9, 2026 trial start date for the thespians\u2019 bitter dispute.\n\n\u201cBy Thursday, January 30, 2025, the parties shall submit a case management plan with deadlines which would enable trial to occur on that date,\u201d Judge Lewis J. Liman ordered today of the trial start. A dispute that has spilled over a variety of lawsuits, including Lively suing Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, his PR bosses and others on New Year\u2019s Eve, and the WME-dumped Baldoni, who sued the New York Times for $250 million on NYE, suing Lively, Ryan Reynolds and their PR chief Leslie Sloane for $400 million in a January 16 defamation and extortion case.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAll of which makes Baldoni\u2019s very early morning words of 21 months ago almost prophetic, almost: \u201cI\u2019m gonna piss you off, probably, but I will always apologize and find my way back to center. I\u2019m sorry I made you feel that way. I will, for sure, do better.\u201d\n\n(L-R) Blake Lively & Justin Baldoni in It Ends With Us Sony Pictures Releasing /Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIn the zone flooding that this seemingly never ending assortment of filings and statements is, Judge Liman Monday also sought to fast track a boil on the almost assured to be consolidated cases by moving up a planned February 12 hearing on Lively\u2019s January 22 move to have a protective order put on Baldoni\u2019s main attorney Bryan Freedman to essentially muzzle him in the media for \u201cin further unlawful retaliation against Ms. Lively, and demanded that he immediately cease and desist from making further defamatory, and retaliatory, statements relating to Ms. Lively.\u201d\n\nToday, Lively lawyer Michael J. Gottlieb wrote another letter to the judge over Freedman\u2019s alleged \u201cendless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements\u201d and seeking a halt to such.\n\nThe DC-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher attorney added of the combative Freedman: \u201cthere already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d While it was Lively\u2019s CRD filing that first brought a slew of text messages and emails by Baldoni\u2019s PR soldiers Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel to everyone\u2019s attention, Gottlieb said Monday that Freedman was exasperating \u201can arms race of selective public disclosures of text messages to the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Wayfarer Defendants\u2019 efforts are being financed by a billionaire who has pledged to spend $100 million to ruin the lives of Ms. Lively and her family,\u201d Gottlieb went on to say of Wayfarer co-founder Steve Sarowitz, who is a defendant in Livelly\u2019s filings, in the third such letter to the judge is just over as many days. \u201cMr. Freedman is using that money, his roster of current and former clients, and a blatant media and social media strategy to assassinate Ms. Lively\u2019s character in advance of trial.\u201d\n\nShifting from New York to Texas Lively and Reynolds (whose blockbuster Deadpool & Wolverine has been dragged directly into this with a January 7 evidence preservation letter sent to Disney and Marvel over the hypocritical Nicepool character) opened up a likely new legal front in Hays County, Texas. That is where lawyers for Lively and Reynold put a filing in the docket last week desiring that Jed Wallace, the online subcontractor supposedly hired by Baldoni\u2019s Crisis PR to turn social media against Lively, be ordered to sit for a deposition.\n\nWallace and his Street Relations company \u201cweaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums\u201d the Lone Star state filing proclaims.\n\nHard to tell if that voice message dropped by Baldoni\u2019s team did their client any favors or confirmed Lively\u2019s telling of events \u2013 with Reynolds and buddy Taylor Swift praising her rewrites to Baldoni\u2019s displeasure and alleged intimidation. What isn\u2019t hard to tell is that attorney Gottlieb and others on Team Blake are very concerned about the optics and impressions of their client and her Merc with a mouth spouse from the promised website from Freedman of such recordings, more IEWU BTS footage to counter Lively\u2019s version of events on set and who was really conducting a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against who. \u201cNeither the media nor public will have any way of knowing which communications Mr. Freedman has selectively omitted from disclosure,\u201d Gottlieb wrote today.\n\n\u201cMoreover, what Mr. Freedman\u2019s communications ignore\u2014and likely are designed to obscure\u2014is that Ms. Lively is in possession of numerous additional communications relating to her claims against the Wayfarer Parties,\u201d Gottlieb goes on to write Monday a.k.a. FAFO.\n\nNeither side responded to request for comment on the 2023 voicemail, the Texas filing, the moved up NYC hearing and next year\u2019s likely trial date. If either Lively\u2019s team or Baldoni\u2019s team get back to us, this post will be updated."

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com.\n\n\n\nBack to Healio\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nThe model, along with a traffic-light system, boosted sensitivity and specificity of agitation recognition.\n\nDuring agitation intervals, awake time and illumination were higher while respiratory rate was lower.\n\nAn interpretive machine learning model may be a feasible method for measuring agitation in dementia as well as in predicting certain environmental factors that are likely to contribute to the condition, according to a study.\n\n\u201cCurrent clinical practice for managing agitation in [people living with dementia] primarily relies on pharmaceutical interventions,\u201d Marirena Bafaloukou, BSc, a doctoral candidate and research assistant in machine learning for clinical data analysis at Imperial College London, and colleagues wrote in eClinical Medicine. \u201cIdentification and appropriate treatment of agitation are essential for mitigating associated risks, lowering health care expenses and alleviating carer strain.\n\nNew research determined that a machine learning tool may be a feasible and reliable method to detect agitation in those living with dementia. Image: Adobe Stock\n\nAgitation in dementia is usually identified by resource-challenging subjective clinical scales and direct patient observation, but clinical applications for data-driven methodology are limited in scope, Bafaloukou and colleagues wrote.\n\nAs such, the researchers sought to examine how real-world factors interact with and influence dementia-related agitation within home settings. They also attempted to apply an interactive, machine-learning monitoring tool to identify the conditions under which agitation is present in affected persons.\n\nThe Minder study, to date, has recruited 127 individuals who were aged 50 years or older, had a clinical diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment, along with either current or prior treatment in a psychiatric unit.\n\nPsychometric and cognitive assessment tools were administered during 3-month visits within the study, while additional weekly behavioral monitoring questionnaires were distributed to participants or partners to track the presence or absence of participants\u2019 behavioral symptoms based on established definitions of agitation.\n\nFor their proof-of-concept venture, the researchers utilized longitudinal data amounting to 32,896 person-days from 63 persons living with dementia collected using in-home monitoring devices over 512 weeks between December 2020 and March 2023. They incorporated a traffic-light stratification system to judge agitation probability and utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework to enhance interpretability. From these data, Bafaloukou and colleagues designed an interactive tool that allows for individualized, non-pharmacological interventions based on living conditions.\n\nThe performance of multiple machine learning models, including Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Adaptive Boosting (ADABoost) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared in their ability to identify agitation in the study population over an 8-day period. Among the principal features for identifying agitation were sleep/wake cycles, respiration, temperature regulation and indoor lighting.\n\nAccording to the results, LightGBM recorded the best agitation recognition performance, with a sensitivity of 71.32%\u00b17.38 and specificity of 75.28%\u00b17.38, while incorporating the traffic-light system increased specificity to 90.3%\u00b17.55.\n\nThe researchers further found, via data analysis of their interactive tool, that sleep, light and temperature adjustments were the most feasible in-home interventions for the study group.\n\nDuring weeks when agitation was present, data show, participants\u2019 average awake ratio was higher than in non-agitation weeks, while a similar correlation was found between agitation presence and level of interior illumination; however, this correlation was inverse with respect to respiratory rate, which was lower during non-agitation intervals.\n\n\u201cBy employing an agitation monitoring model in real-world settings, we could enhance the detection of missed agitation instances,\u201d Bafaloukou and colleagues wrote. \u201cUltimately improving patient care and contributing to the development of more precise definitions for agitation episodes."

            "article_content": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Monday that his office will be seeking arrest warrants for those accused of atrocities in Sudan\u2019s West Darfur region, which has seen reported ethnic cleansing by paramilitary forces that have been fighting government forces for 19 months. Karim Khan told the U.N. Security Council that crimes are being committed in Darfur \u201cas we speak and daily\u201d and are being used as a weapon of war. He said that conclusion is the result of \u201ca hard-edged analysis\u201d based on evidence and information collected by his office.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\n\nKhan told the council in January there were grounds to believe both government forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Force, which was born out of the Janjaweed, may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur.\n\nThe Biden administration, just before it left office this month, determined that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide in Sudan\u2019s civil war. And the ICC prosecutor told the council Monday that there are \u201cvery clear echoes\u201d in the current conflict of what happened 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of crimes, the perpetrators, the parties, tracked very closely with the same protagonists, the same targeted groups as existed in 2003\u201d and led the Security Council to refer Darfur to the ICC, Khan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same communities, the same groups suffering, a new generation suffering the same hell that has been endured by other generations of Darfuris, and this is tragic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuman Rights Watch in a major report last May said the Rapid Support Forces and their allied militias carried out attacks against the ethnic Masalit and other non-Arab groups in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, from April to June 2023, with attacks intensifying that November.\n\nAt least thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during the attacks, according to the report by the leading rights group.\n\n\u201cI can confirm today that my office is taking the necessary steps to put forward applications for warrants of arrest in relations to crimes we allege are being committed and have been committed in West Darfur,\u201d Khan told the council on Monday.\n\nHe gave no details on the specific crimes or the people the ICC wants arrested. But he did say his office is particularly concerned about a stream of allegations of gender crimes against women and girls, which he said were \u201ca priority\u201d for the ICC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the last six months have seen \u201ca tailspin into deeper suffering, deeper misery for the people of Darfur ,\u201d with famine present, conflict increasing, children targeted, girls and women subjected to rape and the whole landscape \u201cone of destruction.\u201d\n\nKhan had a simple message for those on the ground in El Geneina in West Darfur, the city of El Fasher in North Darfur, which is besieged by RSF forces, and elsewhere in Darfur: \u201cNow, better late than never, for goodness sake, comply with international humanitarian law, not as a charity, not out of some political necessity, but out of the dictates of humanity.\u201d\n\nKhan told the council he made efforts to engage with the RSF to obtain information relevant to the ICC\u2019s investigations, and members of his office met with representatives of the paramilitary force last week."

Many of the links above currently direct you to the latest Nvidia GPUs, so if you have bad luck finding an RTX 50-series card you might be better off with a previous-generation card. Given their power, RTX 40 cards will be viable for many years to come.\n\nPatience is a virtue (Image credit: Future) We still have to wait until January 30 for the official launch of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards. If you're a gaming enthusiast, the next couple of days might be excruciating. Worse still is the very real possibility you might not be able to get a card at launch given the low expected stock. This is why we advise you to be patient when checking for deals. You might get lucky right away, or it might take a few hours. And even if you don't get a GPU on day one, you'll likely get a chance later on, especially when the hype dies down. Regardless, be sure to keep checking in on this page.\n\nFolks are camping out for RTX 50 cards (Image credit: Reddit) IGN reports that folks are already camping outside retailers like Micro Center to get their hands on Nvidia's RTX 50-series cards (as posted on Reddit). As we said above, stock for the new Nvidia GPUs is very limited, so it's possible campers will be outside stores for a long while. That could prove challenging given the bitter January cold. In fact, Micro Center posted a YouTube video against this. \u201cWe do discourage camping at our locations for the 5090 and 5080,\" said the company. While we understand the enthusiasm for these new graphics cards, they're not worth getting frostbite over. That's why we encourage you to keep your eyes locked on this page for a chance to snag an Nvidia RTX 50-series card when they become available.\n\nIs the RTX 5070 really as powerful as an RTX 4090? (Image credit: Future) Nvidia turned heads when it claimed the RTX 5070 was as fast as the RTX 4090. This isn't actually true in terms of raw computing power, but if you enable DLSS 4, you're likely to enjoy games at high fps on this mid-grade card. So in that sense, the RTX 5070 seems like a decent upgrade for anyone with an older Nvidia GPU. However, if you want raw performance power, the RTX 5080 or beefier RTX 5090 are the best bets... even if they are far more expensive.\n\nWhich RTX 50 card to buy? (Image credit: Tom's Guide) If you're in the market for a new GPU for your gaming rig, then choosing between the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series graphics card might be difficult. The RTX 5090 is a powerhouse, based on our testing, but it also costs an eye-watering $2,000. The $999 RTX 5080 is also pretty enticing, though it lacks the power of its beefier sibling. For most folks, the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 might be the best choice. Not only are they $749 and $549 (respectively), but they should provide significant upgrades for those with older Nvidia cards. But regardless of your choice, it's going to cost a pretty penny to upgrade.\n\nWhat is RTX mega geometry? (Image credit: Nvidia) I spoke about this a little after my time at Nvidia's Editor's Day. But what is it exactly? Let me explain what this will bring to RTX 50-series users. All graphics you see in a game are built using a number of triangles. In the past, these were definitely more noticeable in the likes of PS1 games, but the vastly increased detail since then means you'll struggle to notice them. RTX Mega Geometry uses AI to bring in the next generation of this \u2014 Nvidia is allowing developers to stream in these details in real-time without the need to rebuild anything else. This means that you could render characters and details at 1 triangle per pixel. This is simply unheard of in even the most graphically impressive games available right now. I means your games can look at otherworldly levels of impressiveness. I got to check out the dragon demo in person, and to see this monster rendered at 1 triangle per pixel is truly bonkers.\n\nSecond, it actually eases pressure on the graphics card in some areas while ramping up the demands in other areas \u2014 AI is helping the RTX 50-series do more with less.\n\nDon't skip on RTX 40-series desktops \u2014 especially this cheap beast (Image credit: Future) As you've seen by the prices on Adorama, RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 pre-built PCs are expensive. But did you know that the vast majority of DLSS 4 features are coming to RTX 40-series PCs too? (Image credit: Nvidia) As you can see by the table here, the only thing not coming is multi frame generation. If that's a massive dealbreaker for you, then I suggest you hold out until the cards are available. If not (and I guarantee you'll still be able to play all the AAA games at impressive fidelity and frame rates on 40-series), this Alienware Aurora R16 deal is not one to be ignored! Alienware Aurora R16: was $2,209 now $1,799 at Dell This is a monster of a machine \u2014 packing Intel Core i7-14700F CPU, RTX 4070 SUPER GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a spacious 2TB SSD. Plus with a 1000W power supply and liquid cooling, if you did want to upgrade that GPU to 50-series, the PC will be ready for it.\n\nStock check: Not available yet (but there's a catch) (Image credit: Best Buy) If you're looking for the GPU specifically, product listings are live but you can't order yet. Use the links above to find them and keep them saved for when they do go live! HOWEVER, you can get some pre-builts from CyberPower PC on Adorama. So far, this seems to be the only way to grab one right now. If you're keen to get into the RTX 50-series systems but don't want to build it yourself, this is a good (if expensive) way to go. CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme liquid cooled desktop (AMD Ryzen 9 9900X, RTX 5080, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD): $2,299 @ Adorama\n\nCyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme liquid cooled desktop (Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, RTX 5090, 64GB RAM, 4TB SSD): $4,499 @ Adorama There are six of them, but these are the lowest-priced models you can get.\n\nDLSS 4 is a real upgrade (Image credit: Future) Since we posted our testing, CD Projekt Red issued its update to Cyberpunk 2077 that brings DLSS 4 into the mix. At the time of testing, multi frame generation was not available. But even with that in mind, the numbers are mightily impressive over the older DLSS 3.5. Swipe to scroll horizontally Cyberpunk 2077 settings RTX 5090 performance (frames per second) 4K Ultra (no DLSS) 57.32 4K Ultra (DLSS 3.5 frame generation) 97.6 4K Ultra (DLSS 4 frame generation 123.06 So as you can see, moving from that convolutional neural network to the transformer model is making it smarter and more efficient in boosting frame rates!\n\nRTX 5090 benchmarks: Here's what to expect (Image credit: Future) We put the RTX 5090 through its paces to show its performance gains over its older RTX 4090 sibling, and it's clear we're seeing improvements in rendering and ray tracing. In 3DMark's benchmark tests, we saw a considerable jump in performance by up to 28%. While these differences aren't exactly worth it for those who already own an RTX 4090, those with a 30-series GPU will see a worthwhile bump. Check out the benchmarks below: Swipe to scroll horizontally Benchmark RTX 5090 RTX 4090 % difference 3DMark Time Spy Extreme 18318 17472 4.62% 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra 31602 24073 23.82% 3DMark Port Royal 35937 25650 28.63%\n\nMore outrageous RTX 5090 pricing (Image credit: Overclockers UK Talk about a bump in price! Over on Overclockers UK, you'll find plenty of RTX 5090 GPUs for quite a hefty price. The MSI GeForce RTX 5090 Gaming Trio is set at a bonkers \u00a325,000, which is, uhm, a little much. Of course, this is just a placeholder price before pre-orders for the products go live, which is set to begin on January 30. Overclockers specifically states that \"pricing is not final and TBC.\" Here's hoping this isn't what's to come from scalpers down the line. While we wait for these products to go live, you can always click \"Notify Me\" at different retailers so you can be one of the first to grab Nvidia's RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs.\n\nBeware of scalper prices (Image credit: dertpert88 via Reddit) Speaking of astronomical prices for RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs, do everything you can to not give in to scalpers. A report from Wccftech shows that listings on eBay for pre-sale units are going for absurd prices, including this Asus ROG Astral RTX 5090 GPU for a whopping $7,000. Yikes! A quick glance on eBay shows prices range from $3,000 to $7,000 for an RTX 5090, and these are clearly bumped up from Nvidia's asking price ($1,999/\u00a31,939). Of course, it's great and all to be the first to get hands on an RTX 5090, but not at these prices. We're still looking for pre-orders to go live at retailers, and we'll get a better sense at what prices actually look like once they're available.\n\nRTX 5090 vs RTX 4090: How do they compare? (Image credit: Future) If you're wondering how an RTX 4090 measures up to an RTX 5090, we've got some interesting benchmarks to give you a taste of how well Nvidia's latest premium graphics card performs. Our Nvidia RTX 5090 desktop GPU benchmarks show off the real horsepower behind the next-gen GPU, with up to a 32% increase in frame rate in Far Cry 6 with 4K Ultra settings, 28% in Cyberpunk 2077 with 4K Ray Tracing at Ultra, and 25% in Borderlands 3 at 4K Ultra. That's a decent bump in frame rates, but that's also without DLSS 4. Check out our testing below, and you can get a better look at how the GPUs compare in our RTX 5090 vs RTX 4090 test. Swipe to scroll horizontally Game benchmark RTX 5090 (FPS) RTX 4090 (FPS) % difference Cyberpunk 2077 (4K Ray Tracing: Ultra) 57.32 41.11 28.28% Borderlands 3 (4K Ultra) 176.28 130.76 25.82% DiRT 5 (4K Ultra) 227.6 185.8 18.37% Far Cry 6 (4K Ultra) 161 109 32.30% Shadow of the Tomb Raider (4K Ultra) 166 129 22.29%\n\nReport: Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs at asking price are slim (Image credit: Nvidia) According to a new report from Wccftech, Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, particularly RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 graphics cards, will be even harder to get at Nvidia's proposed pricing. Apparently, not even after launch, as inventory levels are extremely low. As the report points out, Nvidia's profit margin for AIB partners is low, meaning custom RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 models will be sold at a much higher price, all so manufacturers can make a profit. I just posted about how pricey RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 custom GPU prices will look, and this looks to be the case once GPUs start becoming available. This leak comes from Chiphell, which talks about the RTX 5080 specifically. However, it's likely RTX 5090 will also be affected if the leak is accurate. We've still yet to see prices for both 5090 and 5080 custom GPUs at retailers, but if prices are raised by a lot, it's best to keep your eye on Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs from its official site to get them at their lowest cost possible.\n\nHands-on with an RTX 5090 (Image credit: Future) Just how good is an RTX 5090? Well, we got a chance to go hands-on with an RTX 5090, and we were blown away by how truly gorgeous two demanding PC games looked. In Black Myth: Wukong, the RTX 5090 was able to achieve well over 200 FPS with DLSS on and everything turned up to max settings in 4K. This alone is a massive step up for PC gaming, and DLSS 4 played a huge part in casting away any ghosting or artifacting. We also saw Black State, an upcoming third-person shooter, in action. Here's where we saw Nvidia Reflex drastically reduce latency. Plus, with the RTX 5090 powering the game's photorealistic style, it was easily the best-looking game out there. That's only a small taste of what an RTX 5090 boasts, and sure enough, it'll be a game changer for those after a gaming PC upgrade.\n\nRTX 5090 custom GPUs will be pricey (Image credit: Tom's Guide) We caught a glimpse of what RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 custom GPU prices will look like from Asus, MSI and Gigabyte, and they're quite a bit higher than Nvidia's asking price. According to the leak, we may see an Asus RTX 5090 for as much as $2,799 and an Asus RTX 5080 for $1,899. That's a considerable jump from Nvidia's official pricing \u2014 with an RTX 5090 going for $1,999 (\u00a31,939) and an RTX 5080 for $999 (\u00a3979). Still, some aren't as expensive, with an MSI RTX 5090 going for $2,199 and an MSI RTX 5080 for $1,139, if the listings prove to be accurate. Once pre-orders kick off, we'll get a better idea of what prices are looking like.\n\nMore RTX 5080 gaming desktops available (Image credit: Future) We're still seeing \"Notify When Available\" for RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs at all retailers, but Adorama's gaming desktops with RTX 5080 are still going strong. In fact, the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme for $2,769 we mentioned earlier is now temporarily on backorder. If you're looking to grab a whole desktop setup, there are still options available. That includes other CyberPowerPC models, such as this CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme for $2,419 with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, 32GB of RAM and 2TB SSD. Seeing as the RTX 5080 is set to be $999 (\u00a3979), we're sure many with a gaming desktop already set up will wait for stocks to be available. We'll keep you updated.\n\nLatency should not be a problem (Image credit: Future) Latency is one of those things that always comes up when talking about Nvidia\u2019s DLSS tech. While the frame generation feature makes games look smoother, it doesn\u2019t actually change latency since it\u2019s more of an AI trick than a brute-force upgrade powered by the GPU. When we saw DLSS 4 generating two extra frames on top of what DLSS 3 could do, it did raise a few eyebrows at the event. Would cramming in extra frames lead to noticeable latency? Thankfully, we were able to put those concerns to rest pretty quickly. Running around Night City, it was clear that those additional frames from Multi Frame Gen didn\u2019t add any extra latency compared to what we experienced with DLSS 3. Now, this potential issue depends a bit on your setup. If you\u2019re playing at lower frame rates, latency between frames can be more noticeable. But let\u2019s be real\u2014if you\u2019re targeting 100+ FPS (and with DLSS, that\u2019s pretty much the norm), most people won\u2019t notice a thing. It\u2019s smooth sailing all the way.\n\nAI is the key to everything (Image credit: Future) Nvidia is introducing a host of new RTX features, many of which prominently feature the term \u201cneural.\u201d These include Neural Rendering for full ray and path tracing, Neural Shaders that use AI to enhance in-game textures, and Neural Faces, which leverage generative AI trained on real human expressions to push past the uncanny valley. One feature that immediately stood out to me during the demos was RTX Neural Materials. Traditionally, game developers need to manually embed textures and define how objects interact with lighting and ambiance within the game world. RTX Neural Materials streamlines this process by using AI to compress the underlying data, resulting in up to a fivefold boost in processing speed. The end result is textures that look dramatically realistic \u2014 rather than just looking like shiny pieces of foil on the ground. Alongside this, RTX Mega Geometry is able to vastly increase the amount of detail on any character to really give this a shot of shooting past uncanny valley.\n\nRTX 5080 gaming PCs from $2,299 (Image credit: Future) While we're still waiting for RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs to become available, we're seeing RTX 5080-equipped gaming desktops trickle in at Adorama \u2014 and prices are starting at $2,299! Right now, this CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme desktop PC with an RTX 5080 is available for $2,299, and it also includes an AMD Ryzen 9 9900X CPU, 32GB of RAM and 2TB SSD. This is currently the lowest on offer, but more gaming desktops are available with an RTX 5080, including another CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme for $2,769 with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, 64GB of RAM and a 4TB SSD. Now that we're seeing gaming desktops on offer, we're sure to see RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs pre-orders be made available soon enough. Stay tuned as we keep an eye out for more to be made available.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 at 4K 240 FPS (Image credit: Future) Nvidia has made it abundantly clear that 4K 240 fps is the new target for its GPUs \u2014 something that companies are reacting to with monitors that reach these eyewatering levels of smoothness. I got to try Asus' impressive option out and I was blown away! And through some AI trickery, the GPU maker has done it. Multi-frame generation is the big thing coming to RTX 50-series GPUs \u2014 rather than just being able to generate one additional frame, it can now create three without any overt impact being made to the latency. That means rather than seeing frame rates of around 80 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 with everything turned up to 4K Ultra with path tracing, you can see that spike at a bonkers 265 FPS in my own testing.\n\nDLSS 4 explained (Image credit: Future) Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 4 is the next generation of Nvidias AI game enhancement tech, and it\u2019s very different from past generations. The key difference under the hood is moving away from the convolutional neural network (CNN). This older method works to find patterns in any in-game image to sharpen them up and make them smoother by increasing the number of frames. However, it\u2019s a bit of a flawed system that tries to analyze literally every little bit of the screen \u2014 leading to ghosting (seeing the outline of a fast-moving item on screen follow behind it).\n\n\n\nInstead, Nvidia has moved to a transformer model \u2014 the kind of thing you see the likes of ChatGPT running on. This adds the additional intelligence of DLSS being able to evaluate the importance of each pixel across an entire frame. That means if can think a few more steps ahead with greater efficiency. And in practice, it means vastly smoother edges with little to no ghosting on them, and a huge increase in frame rates (more on that later).\n\nRTX 5090 by the numbers (Image credit: Future) I understand the first thing on everyone\u2019s mind is evaluating the improvements in rendering performance without relying on AI enhancements. Nvidia has heavily emphasized terms like \u201cDLSS\u201d and \u201cneural,\u201d which has led many of our readers to question just how much of the progress comes down to raw processing power alone. To answer this question, our first benchmarks focused on this, and you're looking at a roughly 22-23% average increase in game frames per second (FPS) over the 4090.

Guarding the tomb of China's very first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, they had stood in place since the late 200s BC; making them more than 2,200 years old.\n\nAdvert\n\nQin Shi Huang is one of the most influential people in China's history as the first leader to unite the country after centuries of regional conflict.\n\nFinds in one of the pits at the tomb (China Photos/Getty Images)\n\nNew finding at the Terracotta Army\n\nDespite being found back in 1974, work continues on the site with new finds discovered over the years since.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd now, according to the head of the excavation project, Zhu Sihong, a first-of-its-kind find has been located in the area.\n\nAn area known as Pit 1 is where the biggest find to date has been located, with 3,000 figures in an area 230 metres long and 62 metres wide.\n\nBut it is in Pit 2 - home to war chariots and cavalry - where the newfound has been located.\n\nHere a brand new figure has been located.\n\nAdvert\n\nZhu, speaking to China's state broadcaster CCTV, said: \"Based on its location, we believe this figure was likely the highest-ranking military commander of this unit.\"\n\nTerracotta horses were also uncovered (Tim Graham/Getty Images)\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe find is a life-size - and decorated - figure believed to be that of a senior military official.\n\nAdvert\n\nNow, the hope is that it could be a huge point in understanding the Qin dynasty, which only ruled from 221BC to 207BC.\n\nAccording to CCTV, the armour is adorned with detailed patterns, ribbons, and floral knots.\n\nIt is only the tenth of its kind ever to be found in the tomb home to more than 8,000 statues and a size of more than 20 square miles.\n\n\u201cThese adornments on the high-ranking officers indicate how special they are,\u201d Xiuzhen Janice Li, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford, told Live Science.\n\nAdvert\n\nLi, who worked at Emperor Qin Shi Huang\u2019s Mausoleum Site Museum, added: \"The style and colour of the adornments featured the aesthetic taste and social status symbols of the time.\n\n\"The arrangement of the high-ranking officers in the military formation reflected the military strategy, such as [the] commanding system in the Qin dynasty.\"\n\nThe uncovered army (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe tomb\n\nFound back in 1974, the Terracotta Army and the tomb of Qin Shi Huang were discovered by accident.\n\nThis was after local farmer Yang Zhifa came across fragments of pottery when digging for a well.\n\nOnce uncovered, the tomb came as a genuine surprise with no historical documentation of it ever existing. The entire thing had sat untouched, and unknown, for 2,200 years.\n\nWhile the sculptures mostly look like the terracotta they are made of, they were actually painted at the time to represent the people they portrayed.\n\nTraces still exist but most of the paint didn't last the time, with reports that some of the painted surfaces started to flake and fade as soon as they were excavated.\n\nAs for the tomb of Qin Shi Huang - which is sealed airtight - it remains unopened to this day due to issues regarding preserving what is on the inside. There is also a fear of the tomb being boobytrapped due keep grave robbers out.\n\nAs of now, all archaeological proposals have been rejected by China."

This came after the plane\u2019s landing gear failed to deploy and it ended up bursting into flames.\n\nAdvert\n\nEarlier this month, officials said they had been extracting data from one of the black boxes on the jet while the other was damaged in the crash. It was found that both stopped recording about four minutes before the deadly incident.\n\nA new report said the cause is still not determined (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)\n\nAnd investigators have now referenced DNA findings that have been made during an inspection of the aircraft\u2019s remains.\n\nSouth Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board released a report, stating that feathers and bird blood stains had been found in both of the jet\u2019s engines.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe samples were sent to specialised organisations for DNA analysis, and a domestic organisation identified them as belonging to Baikal teals,\u201d it explained.\n\nBaikal teals are a species of migrating duck that breeds in eastern Russia and winters in East Asia.\n\nThe report went on to outline how pilots had noticed groups of birds when making their approach at the Korean airport. There were also recordings from security cameras of the plane coming close to birds during an aborted landing attempt.\n\nOfficials added that they would be overseeing the dismantling of engines and examination their contents as well as the analysation of black box and air traffic control data.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe report explained: \u201cThese all-out investigation activities aim to accurately determine the cause of the accident.\u201d\n\nThe plane crashed in December (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)\n\nAnd with the black boxes of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder having cut out, it could complicate efforts in doing so.\n\nAnalysts have said that the concrete structure in which the aircraft crashed into should have been built with lighter materials that could break more easily upon impact.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt was announced last week by South Korea\u2019s Transport Ministry that it is being removed.\n\nMuan airport is now set to remain closed until 18 April and the Transport Ministry said the preliminary report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization, Thailand, the US and France. It added that the plane was built in the US and its engines in France.\n\nFollowing the crash, Boeing said: \"We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.\"\n\nJeju Air also added: \"We deeply apologize to all those affected by the incident.

            "article_content": "Anyone could make a mistake in thinking that the \u201cfiction\u201d bit of science fiction absolves the genre of any responsibility to the real thing. To pick just the movie to illustrate the point, 2019\u2019s Chinese blockbuster The Wandering Earth envisioned mankind working in harmony to blast the Earth out of its orbit and into a new celestial realm to avoid being engulfed by a rapidly expanding Sun. The implausibility here simply beggars belief. Mankind working in harmony? As if.\n\nNeither are science movies depicting actual non-fictional science any more reliable. Two (fairly) recent examples \u2014 The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything, biopics of World War II codebreaker Alan Turing and rock star physicist Steven Hawking, respectively \u2014 got a vicious tut-tut from the scientific community for inexcusable deviations from the facts.\n\nNaturally, there are science movies that get things right. Not everything, of course, but enough to earn a thumbs up from the men in white coats. The following, in no particular order, is a collection of some that do it better than others.\n\nOppenheimer (2023)\n\nThe potent brew of science, ambition, and political power might not have landed with audiences, but Christopher Nolan\u2019s dense, multifaceted biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called \u201cfather of the atomic bomb,\u201d got the nod from physicists and historians alike who \u2014 with the usual provisos regarding story-related tweaks \u2014 praised both its scientific accuracy and moral integrity.\n\nManhattan Project historian Chris Griffith commended the film\u2019s depiction of the A-bomb Trinity test. \u201cFor too long, audiences have been conditioned to hear and see a nuclear explosion as one simultaneous event,\u201d he wrote on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists website. \u201cBut Nolan\u2019s Trinity explosion is correct: A light \u201cbrighter than a thousand suns\u201d flashes across the screen and, seconds later, the tremendous roar and blast wave reaches the observers.\u201d\n\nGattaca (1997)\n\nIn a bleak future where eugenics is the norm, and a person\u2019s life is determined by prenatal genetic selection, Vincent Freeman\u2019s (Ethan Hawke) dreams of becoming an astronaut are dashed when he is classified as \u201cIn-valid\u201d (i.e., conceived outside the eugenics program).\n\nPerhaps no other science fiction movie has touched such a raw nerve with scientists in its chosen field. What Gattaca presents as an Orwellian fait accompli is currently a deepening moral quagmire in which ever more sophisticated options for manipulating genetic attributes are available to \u2013 inevitably wealthy \u2013 potential parents.\n\nApart from tilting life\u2019s playing field in the direction of the rich, many bioethicists see in this the seeds of \u201cgenoism\u201d (prejudice against those perceived as genetically inferior) and a worrying acceptance of genetic determinism, an ideology that is the logical precursor to eugenics, a practice that seeks to \u201cimprove\u201d the human gene pool by weeding out inferior specimens. With roots in the late 19th century, eugenics drove the fascist concept of an Aryan master race and the attempted extermination of European Jews.\n\nThe Martian (2015)\n\nBelieve it or not, the most implausible thing about The Martian (impeccably adapted from Andy Weir\u2019s debut novel) is the dust storm that strands astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) on the red planet in the first place. Atmospheric pressure on Mars is too low for anything more than a gentle breeze.\n\nVirtually everything else, including the habitation pod, the ion impulsion drive, the spacesuits (closely based on emerging technology), and even Watney growing potatoes in his own dung, got the NASA seal of approval.\n\nFinding Nemo/Finding Dory (2002/2015)\n\nTo ensure maximum accuracy, Pixar consulted a team of marine biologists on various aspects of undersea flora and fauna, and the social behavior of fish. As shown, Ocellaris clownfish are native to Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef and live in groves of sea anemones, protected from the stings by an outer layer of mucus. They lay anything between a hundred and a thousand eggs (hence Marlin and Coral\u2019s joke about naming their multitude of offspring) and often get swept up in strong currents and deposited far from home.\n\nTropical fish, including clownfish, also \u201chitch a ride\u201d on the south-flowing East Australian Current, as Dory and Marlin do in the movie. Obviously, clownfish don\u2019t speak English, especially not with American accents, but they do communicate through sound, mostly with clicks, grunts, and croaks.\n\nOne trait of clownfish not shown in either movie is their propensity to change gender, an evolutionary quirk that maintains the species\u2019 essential male-female balance.\n\nInterstellar (2014)\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s cerebral sci-fi takes its fair share of liberties, but its depiction of wormholes (hypothetical connections between distant regions of space-time), the supermassive black hole Gargantua, and the effects of extreme time dilation, which causes time to pass more slowly on a planet under the gravitational influence of a black hole, all have their basis in theoretical physics.\n\nIt\u2019s all way too complex to get into, but suffice to say, Einstein would probably not have choked on his popcorn (unlike some science movies we could mention\u2026looking at you Star Trek 2009).\n\nHer (2013)\n\nA movie for anyone who has ever glanced at Siri with a twinkle in their eye \u2013 and who among us has not? In Spike Jonze\u2019s offbeat romantic drama, Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore Twombly, a man who forms a close emotional bond with his A.I. virtual assistant Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson).\n\nAmong those impressed by Her\u2019s feasibility was computer scientist, author, inventor, and futurist Ray Kurzweil. \u201cAlthough there are caveats I could (and will) mention about the details of the OS and how the lovers interact,\u201d he wrote in an extensive review, \u201cthe movie compellingly presents the core idea that a software program (an A.I.) can \u2014 will \u2014 be believably human and lovable.\u201d\n\nContact (1997)\n\nWith a novel by legendary cosmologist Carl Sagan as its, the science and the philosophy are likely to be top notch.\n\nStarring Jodi Foster as a SETI researcher chosen to make first contact with a race of alien beings, Contact became the subject of a 2011 review by SETI.org that, while pointing out several minor inconsistencies, deemed it \u201cIndescribably more accurate in its depiction of SETI than any Hollywood film in history.\u201d\n\nMinority Report (2002)\n\nClairvoyant \u201cpre-cogs\u201d able to visualize crimes before they\u2019re committed might stretch credulity, but predictive policing based on data rather than psychic energy is now a reality; one-third of all U.S. cities either use or are considering adopting predictive policing.\n\nStarring Tom Cruise as a cop who falls victim to the system he operates, Steven Spielberg\u2019s superior sci-fi gets a few other things dead on, including self-driving cars, personalized advertising, facial recognition scanners, and voice-controlled domestic management devices.\n\nDeep Impact (1998)\n\nIt might have lost out to Armageddon at the box office \u2014 both killer comet science movies hit screens the same year \u2014 but Deep Impact offers a far more plausible view of how such a scenario might be dealt with in reality (emphasis on \u201cmight.\u201d A competent administration, able and willing to follow the science is by no means a given these days).\n\n\u201cDeep Impact has the best combination of reasonably correct science, good special effects, a dramatic story, and a look at what a comet strike would mean to people individually and world-wide,\u201d wrote Emory University Physics Professor Dr. Sidney Perkowitz on Salon.com. \u201cI think that's the closest to reality a sci-fi film can get.\u201d High praise indeed since Perkowitz\u2019s trashing of the bogus science in 2003\u2019s The Core led to the creation of the Science and Entertainment Exchange, which collaborates with studios and filmmakers to encourage greater scientific accuracy in movies.\n\nMoon (2009)\n\nDuncan Jones\u2019s debut feature, starring Sam Rockwell as a lone astronaut in emotional freefall after a three-year mining mission on the dark side of the moon, received the ultimate accolade: a screening at NASA\u2019s Space Center Houston.\n\n\u201c[A professor there had] been reading online that we\u2019d done this film about helium-3 mining,\u201d said Jones, \u201cand that\u2019s something people at NASA are working on.\u201d At a Q&A following the screening, Jones was asked why the base in the film looked so sturdy and not like the lightweight structures designed for rocket transportation. Jones replied that, in the future, he imagined technology would exist to build bunker-like structures on the lunar surface without having to cart them there from Earth. \u201cA woman in the audience raised her hand,\u201d Jones recalled, \u201cand said, \u2018I\u2019m actually working on something called mooncrete which is concrete that mixes lunar regolith and ice water from the moon\u2019s polar caps.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the 2013, the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences\u2019s ranked Moon number 5 for quality, number 9 for accuracy, and number 3 for relevance on its \u201cCognitive Science Movie Index.\u201d\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nThe underlying premise of Michel Gondry's strange, haunting romance, that memory formation is intimately linked to emotional experience, is firmly rooted in science.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Joel (Jim Carey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) fail to recognize each other after they\u2019ve opted to have painful memories of their love affair erased \u2014 but the glimmer of a connection remains, implanted deep in their brains\u2019 emotional cores (or amygdalas, just to get technical).\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nGiven the inexorable rise of A.I., can a malevolent free-thinking supercomputer with working knowledge of the Harry Dacre songbook be far off?\n\nIn the meantime, plenty of other things glimpsed in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s futurist masterpiece have since come to pass, including electronic tablets, space robotics, personal in-flight TVs, space tourism, and videotelephony. Like many other sci-fi movies (including Alien), 2001 also depicts humans in suspended animation. Although this is far in the future for space travel, the FDA recently approved its medical use, allowing a patient\u2019s heartbeat and breathing to be slowed for emergency surgery.\n\nAmmonite (2020)\n\nA romantic drama based on the life of British fossil-hunter Mary Anning (inspiration for the tongue-twister \u201cShe sells seashells on the seashore\u201d), Ammonite caused some controversy for portraying Anning (Kate Winslet) as a lesbian. Some felt this distorted the fact. Others pointed out that since no \u201cfacts\u201d of Anning\u2019s sexuality exist, it was no more a distortion than portraying her as straight would have been.\n\nWhat is not in question is the film\u2019s depiction of early paleontology and Anning\u2019s crucial importance to its development, an almost unheard-of instance of a woman contributing to scientific discovery in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nArrival (2016)\n\nThe extraterrestrials in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s didn't get the scientific community all fired up, but the way humans communicated with them.\n\nA number of linguists and phonetics experts consulted on the film to ensure that the language devised by Amy Adams to talk to the aliens and avert a catastrophe was entirely authentic.\n\nWoman in the Moon (1929)\n\nGiven the date, it makes sense that Fritz Lang\u2019s second foray into sci-fi, after the far more famous Metropolis in 1927, doesn\u2019t get a great deal right about lunar exploration (there was no breathable atmosphere on the moon, even in 1929), but its depiction of a rocket-powered moon mission predates the real thing by four decades.\n\nThe Andromeda Strain (1971)\n\nGiven the chilling new relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic, this faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton\u2019s 1969 novel concerns a team of scientists battling the spread of a highly contagious deadly microorganism from space.\n\nIt may sound far-fetched, but a 2003 publication by the Infectious Diseases Society of America proclaimed The Andromeda Strain \u201cthe most significant, scientifically accurate, and prototypic of all films of [the killer virus] genre\u2026 It accurately details the appearance of a deadly agent, its impact, and the efforts at containing it, and, finally, the work-up on its identification and clarification on why certain persons are immune to it.\u201d\n\nAnt-Man and The Wasp (2018)\n\nShrinking humans to the size of insects is not on the cards just yet (give it a decade or so). But when it does become a reality, the world encountered by the Ant Men and Wasps of tomorrow might have a slightly familiar look.\n\nMarvel called on the services of CalTech experts, including theoretical physicist Spyridon Michalakis, to ensure the quantum environment depicted in the film corresponded closely to that hypothesized by scientists.\n\nHidden Figures (2016)\n\nA superb adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly\u2019s book of the same name, Hidden Figures tells the story of Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan, three black women who defied the institutionalized racism of the day to play a major role in the NASA space program.\n\nCertain elements get changed or exaggerated, but the mathematics contributed by Johnson, Jackson, and Vaughan, vital to the success of the pre-Apollo Mercury missions of the late \u201850s and early \u201860s, gets reproduced in all its head-spinning glory.\n\nMoonfall (2022)\n\nWhile the central premise of this deliriously silly disaster flick is absurd (alien beings set the moon on a catastrophic collision course with Earth), the peripheral science is surprisingly sound.\n\nWere the moon to escape its orbit and fall towards the earth, the tides would go haywire, causing massive flooding, and the days would shorten due to increased gravitational force, making the planet spin faster.\n\nAlien (1978)\n\nDon\u2019t let H.R. Giger\u2019s seductive design fool you, the alien may look the part but underneath the slimy exoskeleton he's no more credible than A.L.F. or Dark Star\u2019s animated beachball.\n\nOther aspects of Ridley Scott\u2019s game-changing horror flick carry more weight. The scruffy, cramped interior of the Nostromo is a lot more authentic than sci-fi\u2019s standard gleaming computer banks and airy white spaces (the interior of the International Space Station is proof of that), and the concept of suspended animation, although still some distance in the future, is far more credible than traversing the vastness of space at warp-speed. Also, in the vacuum of space, no one can hear you scream."

            "article_content": "\u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d by Yuval Noah Harari is a sweeping and insightful exploration of our species\u2019 journey from its humble beginnings to the present day.\n\nSapiens explores the rise of Homo sapiens through key revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. This groundbreaking book examines how human history is shaped by \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies \u2013 that enable unparalleled cooperation. Harari investigates the impact of these revolutions on human society, from the dawn of agriculture and the rise of civilizations to the challenges of the modern world, including climate change, technological disruption, and the search for meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution: The book begins by examining the unique cognitive abilities that set Homo sapiens apart from other animals. Around 70,000 years ago, a \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d occurred, leading to the development of advanced language and the ability to create and believe in \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies. These shared fictions, while not objectively real, allow humans to cooperate flexibly on a massive scale, a feat unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This cooperation enabled the development of complex social structures, from small tribes to vast empires.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution: Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. This seemingly revolutionary shift, however, brought about significant drawbacks. Agriculture led to increased inequality, disease, and environmental degradation. Farmers, despite working harder than hunter-gatherers, often had less leisure time and a poorer diet. The domestication of plants and animals also led to the suffering of countless creatures.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution: Beginning in the 16th century, the Scientific Revolution challenged religious dogma and ushered in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Science provided humans with new tools and knowledge, allowing them to manipulate the natural world on an unprecedented scale. This revolution, however, also brought about new challenges, such as climate change, nuclear war, and the potential for technological disruption.\n\nModern Challenges: Harari explores the profound challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. These include climate change, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. He raises critical questions about the meaning of happiness, the future of humanity, and our relationship with technology.\n\nKey Themes:"
