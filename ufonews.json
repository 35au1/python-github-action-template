Learn more \u203a\n\nIt sounds insane, but I know what I saw\u2014a UFO. Or, I think it was. Too many people have drones these days, so I guess it could\u2019ve been anything. Alas, I was sitting on my porch, enjoying my new pair of night vision binoculars, when I saw something moving in the dark. It was too fast for it to be a plane.\n\nI can see over 1,300 feet away with these bad boys, and, boy, I saw something alright. A flying saucer\u2014or a UAP as the kids call it these days. Better yet? My binoculars have a built-in camera and I started recording. Can you believe they were only $84.97 (reg. $169.99)?\n\nSeeing is believing, and you need these to see\n\nWanna know how I know that UFO was real? My footage didn\u2019t save. The binoculars work; I have dozens of 36MP photos and 4K videos of tweety birds from my backyard. But those aliens? They wiped my darn UAP pictures. Those suckers. This is all I\u2019ve got:\n\nAt least I got to see them in the flesh. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t wipe my memory (yet). The cool thing about these binoculars, compared to night vision goggles, is that I don\u2019t have to squint through uncomfortable eyepieces to get a glimpse at some aliens\u2014just look through the 4.5-inch LCD screen. I can also use it to play videos back.\n\nThe only slightly annoying thing is that they have to be charged, which is obvious since they\u2019re digital. But a 4,000mAh rechargeable battery lasts me quite a few nights of bird-watching and now UFO hunting. I\u2019ll be waiting for my visitors to return.\n\nGrab yourself a pair of these digital binoculars with night vision and recording capabilities for only $84.97 (reg. $169.99) and save 50 percent. This price drop only lasts until February 23 at 11:59 p.m. PT.\n\nStackSocial prices subject to change.\n\n4K Night Vision Digital Binoculars with 8x Digital Zoom\n\nOnly $84.97 at Popular Science"

Also, yesterday, (January 31), Krutrim founder Bhavish Aggarwal announced that his AI unicorn has begun hosting DeepSeek\u2019s open source models on Indian servers.\n\n\u201cKrutrim has accelerated efforts to develop world class AI. As a first step, our cloud now has DeepSeek models live, hosted on Indian servers. Pricing lowest in the world,\u201d Aggarwal said in a post on X.\n\nKrutrim currently hosts five DeepSeek models, including its flagship DeepSeek R1 and four distilled versions. The pricing ranges from INR 10 per million tokens for the R1-Distill-Llama-8B model to INR 60 per million tokens for the most expensive variant.\n\nThis also comes close on the heels of India advancing its data localisation efforts. Recently, union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced that India would host DeepSeek on local servers to address privacy concerns regarding cross-border data transfer."

It was commissioned by Jack Bootle, Head of Commissioning, Specialist Factual. The Executive Producer for BBC Studios is Alan Holland. Rhian Roberts is the Commissioning Editor for the Uncanny podcast.\n\nDanny Robins is the host and writer of hit BBC Sounds / Radio 4 podcast Uncanny. He\u2019s also the creator of BBC Sounds podcasts The Battersea Poltergeist and The Witch Farm, and the writer of the award-winning West End play 2:22 \u2013 A Ghost Story. Assisting Danny in his investigations are sceptic Dr Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Keeffe and parapsychologist Evelyn Hollow, who pick apart the details of each case to work out what might have happened. Danny also invites viewers to get in touch with their own explanations, and he provides case updates which explore viewers\u2019 theories on the stories.\n\nWere three generations of a farming family in rural Lancashire all terrorised by the presence of a small child? Did a group of charity shop workers all witness the same paranormal figure? Were a teenager and his friends preyed upon by a towering malign presence in the 90s? And was a young girl physically pushed down the stairs by a supernatural force in the early 2000s?\n\nDo ghosts exist? Are you Team Believer or Team Sceptic? Danny Robins investigates real-life stories of seemingly paranormal encounters. In the second season of the hit TV series, based on the successful BBC Sounds / BBC Radio 4 podcast, Uncanny is back on BBC Two and iPlayer. Featuring a brand new crop of terrifying real-life stories of potentially supernatural encounters told by the people they happened to - experiences that seem to defy logical explanation. Or do they? In each of the four episodes, Danny Robins investigates a different case and tries to help those involved understand what happened to them. Can their experiences be explained \u2013 or are they really evidence of something supernatural?\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Uncanny?\n\nThis series is bigger, bolder, scarier, and more intriguing than ever before. The cases we feature scare me, so they will definitely scare you! They are really unsettling with bizarre frightening moments that happen in the most ordinary, normal settings. It's truly chilling because if these experiences can happen to ordinary people like those we feature, then it can happen to anyone!\n\nThe first case takes place in a classic ghost story setting on a farm in the middle of nowhere, with a very normal, sensible and rational scientific guy, Liam, who is too frightened to go upstairs in his parents\u2019 home because of what he experienced there. We find out that his mum and his dad have also experienced really strange, frightening things in that same house and it's just so intriguing!\n\nWe have also got a case set in a shop with a bunch of colleagues who don\u2019t know each other very well but are all experiencing genuinely terrifying, potential poltergeist activity and apparitions. Another episode features Julian, who to this day is still frightened by what happened to him, and there's an uncertainty in his case about whether he is making contact with someone he lost or something malicious that is out to do him harm. Our final case features a very normal family who have very abnormal things happen in their home; it's a case that takes us into a level of threat that is almost higher than anything else we've experienced on Uncanny.\n\nUncanny is unique and different to traditional paranormal shows. I think it is probably the first time that sceptics and believers have come together and enjoyed these kinds of cases in their own way. If you're a sceptic it's a \u2018howdunit\u2019, and if you're a believer it's a \u2018whodunit\u2019. You can get together and enjoy the story on your own terms and talk to your friends about it; discussing that biggest of all questions: Do ghosts exist?\n\nWhat is new and different about this series?\n\nWe have a very different spread of people in this series; different ages, personality types and very different locations as well. We've got homes, we've got workplaces, we've got people who experience things in childhood, people who experience things as adults, families that experience it together and people who experience it with mates or colleagues, so it's a real spread! It really dispels the idea that there is a certain type of person that sees a ghost or a certain type of place where you're likely to see a ghost. These stories can happen to anybody!\n\nWe've got some brilliant experiments featuring in the series too, for example sending me into a wind tunnel at 90 miles an hour to test a theory about whether convection currents - drafts in houses - can cause poltergeist activity. I had things flying towards my head at 90 miles an hour so that was quite something! We also go to Hampton Court Palace and I go around testing whether electromagnetic frequencies could explain the hauntings there. We also have me in a graveyard, checking whether people might hallucinate spectres by a sudden coming together of fog and lights. So it\u2019s quite an unusual show from that point of view. I don't think there's anything else quite like Uncanny on television. You've got all the excitement and adrenaline-fuelled thrills and scares of the ghost story but you've also got the journalistic rigour and scientific integrity of stress testing the theories.\n\nWhat reaction did you get following the success of the last series?\n\nAfter last series I did a tour around the country and so many people came up to me and said, \"Thank you for talking about this subject\u201d and \u201cWhy haven't we talked about this subject more before?\" For a long time the topic of the paranormal was treated as slightly pantomime entertainment, but the idea of really properly looking at this subject and trying to work out if it's real, what is really going on, hasn\u2019t really been done before. A lot of people have felt compelled to come forward and tell their stories, they feel Uncanny has created a safe space to talk about this subject. People who have never told their friends, never even told their partner, feel it's okay to talk to us about this and put themselves out there. I love that aspect of it.\n\nThe Uncanny fan base has also grown so much and now encompasses everyone from seven-year-olds to people in their 90s. I know families that sit down and watch Uncanny together, and that\u2019s wonderful. The Uncanny community of people who go off and do their own research, do their digging between episodes and send us their questions and theories is such a huge part of the show.\n\nWhat volume of stories get sent to you and how do you decide which ones to choose?\n\nIt\u2019s got to the point where it\u2019s gone kind of bonkers and there are thousands of stories coming in! I feel deeply privileged to receive each one, as they are all an amazing slice of someone's life. I love that people trust me with their stories.\n\nIt is very instinctive as to which stories we decide to tell; if I read a story and it makes me scared, and if it sends a shiver down my spine. I still think of myself as a sceptic who wants to believe but the thing that pushes me closest to \u2018belief\u2019 is sitting opposite somebody and hearing the tremble in their voice, seeing that look in their eyes and realizing they're still scared. It's often those stories that begin with \u201cI don't believe in ghosts, but I think I might have seen a ghost\u201d. I love that complete discombobulating life-changing confusion that something that you do not believe in, that you fundamentally don't want to accept, may have happened to you.\n\nHas your stance on being a sceptic or a believer changed at all since the last series or are you still \u2018a sceptic that wants to believe\u2019?\n\nI think I am still \u2018a sceptic who wants to believe\u2019. I've been on a journey, if you listen to the early podcasts you hear a more sceptic me, but I've not yet had that experience that pushes me over the edge. I feel like I live vicariously through the people who tell me their stories. I'd love to see a ghost, but I also feel very scared by that idea, and I think be careful what you wish for. I don't know if I'm brave enough to go through what these people have gone through.\n\nI also think it's important to keep a foot in both camps. I think Uncanny would be very different if I was a fully signed up card-carrying believer. I enjoy being torn. I love hearing our sceptic expert Ciaran\u2019s explanations and I think many of them are very convincing, and I also love Evelyn pulling me in the direction of belief. I view them as a little angel and devil on my shoulder, pushing and pulling me in different directions and hopefully the audience feel like that as well.\n\nI think if there's one message that Uncanny puts out there, it's that it\u2019s okay to not be sure; you can change your mind, or you can keep an open mind. We're encouraged all the time these days, particularly on social media, to stick to one opinion and to hate anybody who doesn't agree with you, but it\u2019s great that we can agree to disagree in this programme. We've got people who are incredibly polarised in their opinions coming together and enjoying it in their own way, agreeing to disagree and maybe changing their mind, or maybe not. I just think that's such an important thing, the idea that you can listen without judgment, respect somebody for their experiences and take home from it what you want; view it in your own way and treat it as a detective story on your own terms.\n\nIs winter the perfect time of year for ghost stories?\n\nThe winter has always been a time associated with ghost stories. The idea of telling stories around a campfire and that little thrill of the shiver down your spine that you feel at this coldest time of year. I think we are going to be delivering some truly chilling stories at this most chilling time of year. I just think there's no better time to listen to a ghost story than when you are curled up in your house, it's dark outside, there's a little chill in the air and you start to imagine it could all feel more real. There's a little bit more darkness, there's a few more shadows in the corner of your house!\n\nInterview with Dr Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe, Team Sceptic"

            "article_content": "\u2018Presence\u2019 Review \u2013 Paranormal Purgatory\n\nA still from Presence by Steven Soderbergh, an official selection of the Premieres Program at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. Courtesy of Sundance Institute.\n\nWritten by David Koepp (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Mummy 2017) and directed by Steven Soderbergh (Logan Lucky, Side Effects), Presence has an intriguing concept that doesn\u2019t completely work in its execution. Shot in three weeks almost entirely in one location with a $2 million budget, Presence is a creative powerhouse that lacks a lasting impression.\n\nAll of Presence is from the perspective of an entity in a suburban house. The supernatural thriller seemingly has no close-ups while the cinematography is different in a way that seems like it was shot with a slight fish-eye lens. A family, The Paynes \u2013 Rebekah (Lucy Liu), Chris (Chris Sullivan), Chloe (Callina Liang), and Tyler (Eddy Maday), moves into the empty house revealed at the beginning of the film.\n\n(L to R) Chloe (Callina Liang), Chris (Chris Sullivan), Tyler (Eddy Maday), Rebekah (Lucy Liu), and Cece (Julia Fox) in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThe SNAFU\u2019d relationship between The Paynes is palpable as soon as they\u2019re introduced. Rebekah is committing financial fraud and her husband Chris is contemplating separation or divorce. Rebekah also prioritizes her older son Tyler and his athleticism in swimming over her younger daughter Chloe, who barely ranks acknowledgement. Meanwhile, Chris is concerned for Chloe since her best friend abruptly died and she still hasn\u2019t gotten over it.\n\nThe idea of a horror or supernatural film from the perspective of the ghost or entity is insanely cool, but the issue here is that this presence isn\u2019t given much to do besides witness people have sex and argue.\n\nCallina Liang as Chloe in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThere are expected supernatural elements here like doors mysteriously opening or closing on their own, a stack of books floating in the air one by one and being stacked neatly on a nearby desk, and shelves and posters being ripped off the wall.\n\nBefore The Paynes arrive, the first scene of the film is supposed to be this entity wandering around an empty house. It\u2019s fascinating at first but becomes dizzying and nauseating, which may represent the claustrophobic aspect of being trapped somewhere with no escape but still not entirely fun to watch.\n\nPresence features the first truly nasty on-screen character of the year in Ryan (West Mulholland). Ryan is a popular classmate of Tyler and a drug dealer. He gets romantically involved with Chloe and tries to appear nonchalant and supportive.\n\nCracks bubble up to the surface early on as he loses his temper often and his rambling typically sounds like a villain attempting to explain their evil plan in detail to a subdued victim.\n\nThe film\u2019s editing is bizarre since most sequences either feel like one-take or suddenly shift to black before the next scene. Presence is presented like a bunch of scenes randomly stitched together that just happen to make a semi-coherent story.\n\n(L to R) Chris (Chris Sullivan) and Rebekah (Lucy Liu) in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThe acting in Presence is fine, but two of the four Payne family members are complete jerks while the other two are pushovers. This dynamic makes it difficult to get invested in any of their character developments.\n\nThe existence of the entity in the film is deeply connected to grief and trauma, which allows people who have almost died or experienced something truly traumatic to see or feel someone who has died.\n\nCallina Liang as Chloe in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nA medium is brought into The Payne\u2019s home after everyone but Chris stops making fun of Chloe\u2019s encounters with the entity. The medium does little for the film apart from solidifying that Chloe isn\u2019t making it up and drawing attention to an item in their living room that will be a part of the last scene in the film.\n\nThere is a unique concept in Presence that hasn\u2019t entirely been explored in the genre, especially when combined with captivatingly different cinematography and a talented cast. But there aren\u2019t enough actual horror elements in Presence to be scary, and the family drama is mostly uninteresting apart from this entity being a part of their lives.\n\nLucy Liu as Rebekah in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nPresence is a close-but-no-cigar thriller with unusual camera tricks and everyone staring off slightly to the left or right to drive its sense of mystery.\n\nPresence (2025), Neon 2 OVERALL SCORE PROS Refreshing concept\n\nDecent acting CONS The tedius nature of drama over horror\n\nCinematography becomes tiresome"

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Experts believe they have finally found the last Anglo-Saxon king's residence\n\nArchaeologists have made a stunning breakthrough after discovering an 11th Centry medieval toilet that has helped to unravel a 2,000-year-old mystery. Researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of Newcastle believe they have uncovered Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon king of England\u2019s long-lost residence. Experts had until now been unable to pinpoint the exact location of King Harold\u2019s residence in Bosham. Illustrations of the grand hall in his residence appear twice in an 11th-century embroidered work known as the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the 1066 Norman Conquest of England. The tapestry shows Harold feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France. While the church in Bosham still stands today, experts have been left baffled by the hall's exact location.\n\nA The tapestry shows Harold seen feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France.\n\nHowever, researchers' re-examining evidence found in 2006 by West Sussex Archaeology led to a stunning revelation. The initial 2006 investigation located two previously unidentified medieval structures at the site. One structure is built into a modern-day private residence, and the other was found in the property's garden. Dr. Duncan Wright, Senior Lecturer in Medieval Archaeology at Newcastle University and project leader, said a toilet from the period found in the building offered a vital clue. While having a toilet in your home is practically a given in every household today, they were typically only found in high-status and elite residences in England during the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "When astronomers found a large world farther out than Pluto, it became one of the final nails in the coffin of our ninth planet.\n\nEris is too distant for even the largest telescopes to resolve into a disk. This artist\u2019s concept shows astronomers\u2019 best guess as to what it and its moon Dysnomia look like. Credit: NASA/ESA/STScI\n\nEight billion miles (14 billion kilometers) from Earth, at the solar system\u2019s ragged edge, lies Eris \u2014 a planet-sized oddball of a world that emerged unexpectedly from the darkness 20 years ago. Named for the capricious Greek goddess of discord, trouble-stirring Eris would doubtless be pleased that her celestial namesake caused even mild-mannered astronomers to quarrel, as its discovery caused the nature of what constitutes a \u201cplanet\u201d to rear its controversial head.\n\nWith a magnitude of 18.7, Eris currently lies in the southern constellation Cetus the Whale, barely resolvable even by the world\u2019s largest telescopes. Due to its vast distance \u2014 some 95.6 astronomical units (AU; 1 AU is the average Earth-Sun distance) \u2014 its slow apparent progress across the sky makes it notoriously difficult to spot.\n\nAt Eris\u2019 distance, the Sun appears as a tiny star in the coal-dark sky, its light taking 13 hours to traverse the space between them and weakly illuminate a glistening surface of methane and nitrogen ices. Eris is three times more distant than Pluto. And its relationship to Pluto \u2014 a world demoted since 2006 from the solar system\u2019s ninth planet to a lowly dwarf planet, in large part due to the discovery of Eris \u2014 remains contentious today.\n\nA distant find\n\nIn 2001, astronomers at Palomar Observatory in California began systematically seeking planet-sized objects beyond Neptune. This time-consuming process targeted small pockets of the sky, utilizing powerful imaging software to identify anything that moved against the starry backdrop. To limit the number of false-positive data returns due to image resolution, the software excluded anything moving slower than 1.5 arcseconds per hour.\n\n\u201cThings like Eris were precisely what we were looking for when we started this survey in 2001,\u201d says Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who co-discovered Eris with Chad Trujillo, then of the Gemini Observatory, and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. \u201cAt that time, nothing had ever been found beyond about 60 AU, so we tuned the survey to concentrate on this area.\u201d\n\nBut an ironic consequence was that images of the slow-moving Eris, taken by Brown\u2019s team with the 48-inch (1.2 meters) Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar on Oct. 21, 2003, slipped entirely through the net, falling below their speed cutoff.\n\nIn the months that followed, several new trans-Neptunian objects \u2014 bodies whose orbits have an average distance beyond that of Neptune \u2014 were discovered: red-hued Sedna in November 2003 and ellipsoid-shaped Haumea in December 2004. Sedna\u2019s 11,400-year orbit carries it to an aphelion (its farthest point from the Sun) well beyond the heliopause, the region near the solar system\u2019s periphery where the Sun cedes gravitational influence to the interstellar medium.\n\nAt the time of its discovery, Sedna lay at 90 AU \u2014 8.3 billion miles (13.3 billion km) from the Sun, three times more distant than Neptune. And significantly, it moved at a paltry 1.75 arcseconds per hour. That prompted Brown\u2019s team to reanalyze their older data with lower limits on angular motion, then painstakingly sort through previously excluded images by eye.\n\n\u201cWhen we found Sedna in 2003 at close to 90 AU and just barely at the limit of our software, we wondered whether we might have missed something even further away,\u201d Brown remembers. \u201cIt took months of additional work and processing, until suddenly Eris pops out of the data! In the end, it was the only extra object we found from all of the reprocessing \u2014 but worth it!\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s reanalysis finally pinpointed Eris on Jan. 5, 2005. At that time, it was simply called 2003 UB 313 . Brown excitedly called his wife, Diane, with the news: \u201cI found a planet!\u201d\n\nBut his words were ominously propitious, as unfolding circumstances on Earth quickly overtook the discovery.\n\nMore planets?\n\nEarly observations hinted that Eris might be bigger than Pluto, whose own size remained uncertain until the New Horizons spacecraft flew past in July 2015.\n\nBut whether larger or smaller than Pluto, hopes that Eris might also be granted planetary status were quickly dashed. For years, astronomers had hotly debated Pluto\u2019s planethood. Our then-ninth planet was smaller than any other planet, yet carried profound cultural connotations, endearing itself to generations who had grown up reciting the same solar system mnemonic in the classroom and universally accepted it as the ninth planet.\n\nThat long-held popular belief was turned on its head with the discoveries of Haumea, Sedna, Eris, and \u2014 a few months after Eris \u2014 Makemake in March 2005, forcing the astronomical community\u2019s hand. In August 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally defined a \u201cplanet\u201d as an object circling the Sun, sufficiently large and gravitationally massive to attain a spherical shape, and has cleared its region of space.\n\nUnder that definition, the new discoveries fell short on this third point, for none had cleared their respective celestial neighborhoods. But neither had Pluto. On Sept. 6, 2006, Pluto and the others were formally recategorized not as planets but as \u201cdwarf planets\u201d \u2014 objects orbiting the Sun that could achieve sphericity but were gravitationally incapable of dominating their environs.\n\n\u201cWe knew that second that we found it [Eris] that our concept of the solar system was going to have to change,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWe were either going to have to add new planets or subtract one. I would have predicted the former, but even though it means I lost my chance to be called the discoverer of a few new planets, I am delighted that astronomers had the nerve to make the right choice and realize that Pluto should never have been called a planet in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name?\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2006, 2003 UB 313 was formally named Eris. But this had not been the original choice. One unofficial name used by Brown\u2019s team was Xena, honoring the titular character in the television show Xena: Warrior Princess \u2014 which coincidentally also began with an X, for what might have been the tenth planet.\n\n\u201cWe called it Xena right away, just as one of our internal code names,\u201d says Brown. \u201cBut when the final IAU decision came out, we decided to search for something in the Greek or Roman mythology to honor the fact that Xena had been something like a real planet for a good year. Not surprisingly, almost everything had been taken by various nondescript asteroids over the years.\u201d\n\nPopular suggestions rounded up in a survey by New Scientist ranged from Persephone to Pax, Galileo to Xena, Rupert to Nibiru, and Cerberus to Loki. The survey results even included the comically floated \u201cBob\u201d as an option, its originator quipping that it was easily pronounceable, non-offensive, and \u201cI think Uranus needs a break, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut everyone seemed to have avoided the goddess of discord and strife,\u201d whose Greek name was Eris, recalls Brown. \u201cAs soon as we saw it, we realized [it] was perfect.\u201d Just like the strife-inciting goddess of ancient Greece, the celestial Eris had prodded its own hornet\u2019s nest of debate both in the astronomical community and among the wider public.\n\nIt turns out that Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto, with an equatorial diameter 1,445 miles (2,326 km) and a surface area roughly equivalent to South America. But Eris is some 27 percent more massive than Pluto, likely due to a denser, rocky interior.\n\nA tiny moon, named Dysnomia after the mythological Eris\u2019 daughter and the goddess of lawlessness, was discovered in September 2005 by Brown\u2019s team at Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Dark as coal, one-third the size of Eris, and icy in nature, Dysnomia orbits every 16 days at a distance of 23,200 miles (37,300 km).\n\nEris\u2019 plain white fa\u00e7ade reflects some 96 percent of the Sun\u2019s light, making it one of the solar system\u2019s brightest surfaces. Its highly eccentric orbit carries it around the Sun every 559 years, bringing it as close as 37.9 AU (3.5 billion miles [5.6 billion km]) and carrying it as far as 97.5 AU (9.1 billion miles [15 billion km]). Surface temperatures hover around 42 kelvins \u2014 about \u2013384 degrees Fahrenheit (\u2013231 degrees Celsius).\n\nIts ubiquitous brightness is matched only by Saturn\u2019s icy moon Enceladus, but Brown does not believe cryovolcanism or geysers are necessarily responsible. \u201cEris is sufficiently cold that its atmosphere will be condensed onto the surface and I think that is really all that is going on,\u201d he says. \u201cPresumably as Eris gets closer to the Sun, the frosts will sublime and the surface will darken.\u201d\n\nHaving passed its most recent aphelion in 1977, Eris will reach perihelion in 2257. Plans for a flyby mission are being considered, with the most ideal launch opportunities in 2032 and 2044. Should such a mission take place, the spacecraft could reach Eris roughly 25 years after launch.\n\nAnd new discoveries would surely follow.\n\nRelated: Does Planet Nine exist?"

            "article_content": "It\u2019s been just over a week since DeepSeek upended the AI world. The introduction of its open-weight model\u2014apparently trained on a fraction of the specialized computing chips that power industry leaders\u2014set off shock waves inside OpenAI. Not only did employees claim to see hints that DeepSeek had \u201cinappropriately distilled\u201d OpenAI\u2019s models to create its own, but the startup's success had Wall Street questioning whether companies like OpenAI were wildly overspending on compute.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,\u201d wrote Marc Andreessen, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most influential and provocative inventors, on X.\n\nIn response, OpenAI is preparing to launch a new model today, ahead of its originally planned schedule. The model, o3-mini, will debut in both API and chat. Sources say it has o1 level reasoning with 4o-level speed. In other words, it\u2019s fast, cheap, smart, and designed to crush DeepSeek. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says work on o3-mini began long before DeepSeek's debut and the goal was to launch by the end of January).\n\nThe moment has galvanized OpenAI staff. Inside the company, there\u2019s a feeling that\u2014particularly as DeepSeek dominates the conversation\u2014OpenAI must become more efficient or risk falling behind its newest competitor.\n\nPart of the issue stems from OpenAI\u2019s origins as a nonprofit research organization before becoming a profit-seeking powerhouse. An ongoing power struggle between the research and product groups, employees claim, has resulted in a rift between the teams working on advanced reasoning and those working on chat. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says this is \u201cincorrect\u201d and notes that the leaders of these teams, chief product officer Kevin Weil and chief research officer Mark Chen, \u201cmeet every week and work closely to align on product and research priorities.\u201d)\n\nSome inside OpenAI want the company to build a unified chat product, one model that can tell whether a question requires advanced reasoning. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened. Instead, a drop-down menu in ChatGPT prompts users to decide whether they want to use GPT-4o (\u201cgreat for most questions\u201d) or o1 (\u201cuses advanced reasoning\u201d).\n\nSome staffers claim that while chat brings in the lion\u2019s share of OpenAI\u2019s revenue, o1 gets more attention\u2014and computing resources\u2014from leadership. \u201cLeadership doesn\u2019t care about chat,\u201d says a former employee who worked on (you guessed it) chat. \u201cEveryone wants to work on o1 because it\u2019s sexy, but the code base wasn\u2019t built for experimentation, so there\u2019s no momentum.\u201d The former employee asked to remain anonymous, citing a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nOpenAI spent years experimenting with reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model that eventually became the advanced reasoning system called o1. (Reinforcement learning is a process that trains AI models with a system of penalties and rewards.) DeepSeek built off the reinforcement learning work that OpenAI had pioneered in order to create its advanced reasoning system, called R1. \u201cThey benefited from knowing that reinforcement learning, applied to language models, works,\u201d says a former OpenAI researcher who is not authorized to speak publicly about the company.\n\n\u201cThe reinforcement learning [DeepSeek] did is similar to what we did at OpenAI,\u201d says another former OpenAI researcher, \u201cbut they did it with better data and cleaner stack.\u201d\n\nOpenAI employees say research that went into o1 was done in a code base, called the \u201cberry\u201d stack, built for speed. \u201cThere were trade-offs\u2014experimental rigor for throughput,\u201d says a former employee with direct knowledge of the situation.\n\nThose trade-offs made sense for o1, which was essentially an enormous experiment, code base limitations notwithstanding. They did not make as much sense for chat, a product used by millions of users that was built on a different, more reliable stack. When o1 launched and became a product, cracks started to emerge in OpenAI\u2019s internal processes. \u201cIt was like, \u2018why are we doing this in the experimental codebase, shouldn\u2019t we do this in the main product research codebase?\u2019\u201d the employee explains. \u201cThere was major pushback to that internally.\u201d"

            "article_content": "OpenAI is making a smaller, more efficient version of its cleverest artificial intelligence model available for free as it seeks to answer the hype and enthusiasm swirling around a new open source offering from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.\n\nWIRED previously reported that OpenAI was prepping the new model, called o3-mini, for release on January 31. The company\u2019s researchers have been working overtime to get it ready for prime time, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\no3-mini, which OpenAI teased in December, is a smaller version of the model that features the most advanced AI reasoning capabilities of any OpenAI offering to date. The model can break difficult problems into constituent parts in order to figure out how best to solve them.\n\n\u201cThis powerful and fast model advances the boundaries of what small models can achieve,\u201d the company said in a blog post announcing o3-mini\u2019s availability.\n\nOpenAI is making o3-mini available to all Plus, Team, and Pro users of ChatGPT. Users of the free version of ChatGPT will also be able to try o3-mini but won't be able to send as many queries, the company says.\n\nOpenAI has evidently been using PhD students to help train a new model for some time. Several weeks ago, the company began recruiting PhD computer science students at $100 per hour for a \u201cresearch collaboration\u201d that would \u201cinvolve working on unreleased models,\u201d according to an email viewed by WIRED.\n\nOpenAI also appears to have been recruiting PhD students with expertise in other areas through a company called Mercor that it regularly uses to find staff for model training. A recent job posting from Mercor on LinkedIn states: \u201cThe overall goal of this project that you may become a part of is to create challenging scientific coding questions designed to test the capabilities of large language models in generating code for solving realistic scientific research problems.\u201d\n\nThe job posting goes on to give an example problem that is strikingly similar to a problem in a benchmark called SciCode that is designed to test a large language model\u2019s ability to solve complex science problems.\n\nThe news comes as DeepSeek\u2019s R1 continues to roil the US tech industry. The fact that such a powerful model could be released for free puts pressure on Google and Anthropic to lower their prices.\n\nOpenAI is particularly eager to demonstrate that it remains at the forefront of developing and commercializing AI, according to sources inside the company.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s freely available model incorporates innovations that made it more efficient to both train and serve. The company appears to have developed it using far fewer resources than OpenAI and other US companies currently building frontier AI models, although the precise details of DeepSeek\u2019s expenditure remain unknown. OpenAI says it believes R1 may have incorporated the output from its models into its training.\n\nGot a Tip?\n\nAre you a current or former employee at OpenAI? We\u2019d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Will Knight at will_knight@wired.com or on Signal via his username wak01.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s newest model may not outshine R1 in terms of price, but it shows that the company will make efficiency part of its focus going forward. OpenAI also says that the model is especially strong in math, science, and coding.\n\nThe company says that the latest model will also incorporate new features, including the ability to tap into web searches, call functions from a user\u2019s code, and toggle between different reasoning levels that trade off speed for problem-solving capabilities.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s sudden rise has also raised questions about the US government\u2019s strategy to curb China\u2019s rise in AI. The past two US administrations have introduced a number of sanctions to curb China\u2019s ability to access the most advanced Nvidia chips typically used to build cutting-edge AI models. DeepSeek described several types of Nvidia chips in its research, but it remains unclear what exactly was used."

Alternatively, if you\u2019ve had issues with getting previous models to respond properly to your most advanced prompts, you may want to try out this new reasoning model on them. To try out o3-mini, simply select \u201cReason\u201d when you start a new prompt on ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough reasoning models possess new capabilities, they come at a cost. OpenAI\u2019s o1-mini is 20 times more expensive to run than its equivalent non-reasoning model, GPT-4o mini. The company says its new model, o3-mini, costs 63% less than o1-mini per input token However, at $1.10 per million input tokens, it is still about seven times more expensive to run than GPT-4o mini.\n\nThis new model is coming right after the DeepSeek release that shook the AI world less than two weeks ago. DeepSeek\u2019s new model performs just as well as top OpenAI models, but the Chinese company claims it cost roughly $6 million to train, as opposed to the estimated cost of over $100 million for training OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. (It\u2019s worth noting that a lot of people are interrogating this claim.)\n\nAdditionally, DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model costs $0.55 per million input tokens, half the price of o3-mini, so OpenAI still has a way to go to bring down its costs. It\u2019s estimated that reasoning models also have much higher energy costs than other types, given the larger number of computations they require to produce an answer.\n\nThis new wave of reasoning models present new safety challenges as well. OpenAI used a technique called deliberative alignment to train its o-series models, basically having them reference OpenAI\u2019s internal policies at each step of its reasoning to make sure they weren\u2019t ignoring any rules.\n\nBut the company has found that o3-mini, like the o1 model, is significantly better than non-reasoning models at jailbreaking and \u201cchallenging safety evaluations\u201d\u2014essentially, it\u2019s much harder to control a reasoning model given its advanced capabilities. o3-mini is the first model to score as \u201cmedium risk\u201d on model autonomy, a rating given because it\u2019s better than previous models at specific coding tasks\u2014indicating \u201cgreater potential for self-improvement and AI research acceleration,\u201d according to OpenAI. That said, the model is still bad at real-world research. If it were better at that, it would be rated as high risk, and OpenAI would restrict the model\u2019s release."

            "article_content": "As AI abounds and consolidation comes calling, the marcomms agency landscape is poised for a significant shakeup in 2025.\n\nBut where some see challenge, others seize opportunity. And so, to coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, throughout this week our journalists have been making some predictions of their own by spotlighting the agencies they believe will dominate the headlines this year.\n\nThey have done so armed with some important information, as all the agencies featured across this series have earned The Drum Recommends status on the strength of their recent performance and quality of work.\n\nAMV BBDO, Hearts & Science and Code and Theory were among those recognized in part one. It was the turn of FCB, Mower and Whalar in part two. Then Area 23, David Madrid, Zulu Alpha Kilo enjoyed their moment in part three. And, in part four, Ogilvy UK, Monks and DDB Colombia all featured. Today, we have more heavy hitters to recognize from across the globe.\n\nSo scroll on to hear from our latest Agencies to Watch honorees about how they\u2019re preparing themselves for the major trends upon us in 2025.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nThe Accenture Song-owned ad agency featured prominently at The Drum Awards for Advertising, winning Golds in the Finance, Sports and Sound Design categories, while its S\u00e3o Paulo office partnered with Dove to celebrate 20 years of its \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty.\u2019\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nMark Green, global chief executive officer: Fighting evil in the algorithm. As content becomes increasingly polarized, brands will have to fight the urge to settle in the middle and play it safe. Growth for brands will be in unifying, not dividing.\n\nThe creative differentiator. Creativity will increasingly be the differentiation in business as new ideas are copied and replicated as quickly as DeepSeek, for example. Therefore, the power of brand becomes more crucial.\n\nHigher-order creativity. While robots and AI will transform jobs, industries and indeed advertising, human empathy and higher-order creativity will be the saviors. They were, are and will be the answer to growth.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGreen: A truly global Droga5 \u2013 fueled by borderless creativity and a renewed creative ambition \u2013 will be an even more powerful weapon as we continue pushing our creative boundaries further and beyond advertising. We firmly believe our best work is ahead of us. We have an exciting group of leaders that have the ambition to take creativity much further than advertising and we have a unique relationship with Accenture that brings the best of creativity, technology and consulting together. We have also learned a lot from successes and failures in equal measure and will now put this to work in the best way possible. New offices, new leaders and exciting new work will be the result.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGreen: Dove\u2019s \u2018The Code\u2019: To celebrate 20 years of its pioneering \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty,\u2019 Dove partnered with Droga5 S\u00e3o Paulo to reinforce its commitment to real beauty. Vowing never to use AI to create or distort women\u2019s images, \u2018The Code\u2019 demonstrated how adding the phrase \u2018According to Dove Real Beauty campaign\u2019 to AI-generated prompts resulted in dramatically more diverse, inclusive, and authentic images. This sets a new standard for brands navigating evolving technology.\n\nSolament\u2019s \u2018The Down-Less Down Jacket\u2019: In Japan, Droga5 Tokyo applied a new technology and called it Solament, a unique material that absorbs near-infrared sunlight to generate heat and protect people from the cold. We then created the brand and developed a prototype for a transparent puffer jacket. This is a product and innovation going beyond advertising.\n\nSydney Opera House\u2019s \u2018Play It Safe\u2019: Celebrating 50 years, Droga5 Australia created a musical tribute to one of the world\u2019s most celebrated cultural landmarks, the Sydney Opera House. The musical created in collaboration with Tim Minchin reminded us of the power of creativity and its endless possibilities when you don\u2019t \u2018Play It Safe.\u2019 This is the power of entertainment for brands.\n\nBosch\u2019s \u2018#LikeABosch\u2019: Last summer, Bosch named Droga5 its US Agency of Record, tasked with ambitiously expanding Bosch\u2019s presence in the US market. Those ambitious plans with Droga5 include leading the German engineering and tech company to make its Super Bowl debut with an extension of Bosch\u2019s 2024 #LikeABosch platform.\n\nNRMA\u2019s \u2018A Help Company\u2019: Celebrating 100 years NRMA wanted to transform from an insurance company that helps people to a help company that does insurance. We created a new brand platform to deliver this message while also taking creativity further across digital channels, product design and service delivery. This is more than a marketing transformation but rather a wholesale customer transformation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe media agency had another award-laden year, the best yet in its 34-year history, picking up gongs at shows including The Drum Awards for Media and The Drum Awards for Marketing, including Gold in the Travel and Tourism category for its \u2018If You\u2019re Into It\u2019 campaign for The V&A.\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nPaul Knight, incoming CEO, PHD UK: In a market that is experiencing media fragmentation, asset fragmentation and capability fragmentation, marketers need 2025 to be the year where consumer experiences are better connected.\n\nThe agencies that will thrive in 2025 will be the ones that can best connect their talent, technology, and data to accelerate and elevate new solutions for clients and deliver better brand experiences for consumers.\n\nKey to this will be agencies\u2019 abilities to harness AI to improve efficiency in areas such as data distillation, audience pattern recognition and lateral thinking. We will also start to see the emergence of agentic AI, which acts autonomously on a user\u2019s behalf, completing complex tasks without prompting.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing that will continue to define the industry but isn\u2019t a new trend. When we get to the end of 2025, we will yet again be celebrating ingenious, creative thinking that creates real competitive advantage for clients. And long may that continue.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nSarah Nugent, managing director, PHD London: Following a year where we successfully retained \u00a3250m+ in incumbent pitches and added almost \u00a3150m of net new wins to our client list, we\u2019ve entered 2025 with significant business momentum and with Knighty\u2019s imminent arrival as CEO in February we are full of energy to bring PHD\u2019s new \u2018Intelligence. Connected\u2019 positioning to life in the work we do.\n\nWe exist to help clients Outthink, Outpace and Outgrow the competition so we will be continuing to prioritize the power of thinking to develop and grow new products and services that are designed to offer clients new solutions to new challenges, building on our recent successes in areas such as data consultancy and gaming.\n\nWe\u2019re already underway with this, having already launched a new UK cultural insight platform called Culture Currents, which unveiled new research into the importance of brands embracing optimism in a challenging macro-economic and political climate. There will be much more of that to come this year and as an agency, we\u2019re also massively optimistic about what 2025 will bring.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nEuan Hudghton, chief brand and experience officer, PHD UK: 2024 was a standout year for work at PHD UK, becoming the most awarded year in the agency\u2019s 34-year history, including winning five Grand Prix awards.\n\nAs importantly, our winning campaigns also reflected the breadth of work a modern media agency now needs to deliver for its clients. Work that was effective, creative, and inclusive.\n\nPHD clients won six IPA Effectiveness awards, including the Grand Prix for McCain.\n\nOur \u2018Streams of (un)consciousness\u2019 campaign for the British Heart Foundation flatlined the Twitch streams of 14 prominent gaming influencers to promote CPR training, directly leading to a life being saved.\n\nAward-winning campaigns for Andrex ranged from driving sales in new retail media spaces to partnering with ITV to redesign the Big Brother diary room chair made from toilet rolls.\n\nWe were also delighted to do our bit to make media more inclusive, brokering audio description and British Sign Language partnerships with ITV and Channel 4 for Guinness and Virgin Atlantic.\n\nAnd there\u2019ll be more of that kind of work to come in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNils Leonard\u2019s hot shop continued to impress in 2024, its British Airways \u2018Windows\u2019 work picking up gongs at Cannes Lions and The Drum Awards for Advertising.\n\nUncommon\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAI won\u2019t define 2025 \u2013 our reaction to it will. As AI mass-produces mediocrity, rare ideas, taste and beauty become more valuable. The industry\u2019s fear is misplaced; automation pushes creativity further.\n\nPolarization will shift from risk to strategy. Brands must take bold stands, leaving some behind while fostering loyal communities. Forget playing it safe \u2013 conviction and agitation will drive sharper, more meaningful work.\n\n2025 will be a landmark year for design. No longer just a backdrop, design itself will spark conversations, provoke reactions and shape brand narratives. Smart brands will harness its power for fame, engagement and cultural relevance.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019re taking our design practice to the next level with more projects \u2013 off the back of the biggest rebrand in entertainment history for EA Sports FC and our disruptive graphic design system for Vimeo. As well as exploring new avenues including retail design \u2013 as we\u2019re set to redesign The Ordinary\u2019s store experience globally.\n\nArchitecture continues to be another area of growth in our founding partnership with Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s \u2018Humanise\u2019 movement. Last year, we launched UnLandmarks, a campaign using AI to reimagine iconic British buildings through the lens of monotonous architectural trends. The project is set to expand to the US in 2025.\n\nUnrest is an accelerator developing impact-led consumer brands. Based in our London studio since its inception, we can\u2019t wait to continue to cultivate this year\u2019s cohort as the program\u2019s continued brand partner.\n\nThis year also sees the launch of our third film feature, The Thing with Feathers, which premiered at Sundance 2025 with rave reviews, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and directed by Dylan Southern.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe redefined Christmas with JD Sports\u2019 #1 YouTube ad; launched Monzo\u2019s first brand campaign and ATMmm stunt, making it Marketing Society\u2019s Brand of the Year; crafted British Airways\u2019 Cannes-winning \u2018Windows\u2019 and viral safety video; made reference point B2B work with Hiscox helping the insurer reach record profits; designed the first-ever brand identity with resolution at its core for Vimeo; challenged beauty industry standards with provocative outdoor for The Ordinary speaking to the brand\u2019s philosophy of science over celebrity and celebrated Erling Haaland\u2019s quirks, challenging the serious nature of sports marketing with Beats \u2013 all combining creativity and effectiveness to pick up four Effies and continue to build brands the world wished existed.\n\nAn award-winning 2024 for the global media agency saw it pick up 10 trophies at The Drum Awards for Media, including the Chair\u2019s Award for its work with Transport for London.\n\nWavemaker\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nHow long is a piece of string? In such a fast-paced, constantly changing industry like ours, there\u2019s always something influencing or impacting it in any given year.\n\nRather than trends, I like to focus on what\u2019s keeping our clients awake at night or the things they are trying to navigate to deliver sustainable business growth \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going to define the industry and what we need to do to adapt. I believe this year, there\u2019ll be three things frequenting our agenda.\n\nThe first is HFSS \u2013 in October this year we\u2019ll see the HFSS advertising legislation come into place. This isn\u2019t just going to impact HFSS brands; it\u2019s going to impact everyone \u2013 we\u2019ll see increased competition for premium inventory and in turn, an impact cost that\u2019s going to take some careful navigation to minimize the impact on ROI. The second is the \u2018messy middle\u2019; it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s never really gone away and one that clients and agencies have been navigating together, but I believe this year we\u2019ll see a renewed focus on working hard to maximize the power of the messy middle. And last but certainly not least is the intelligent use of AI (yes, it\u2019s being mentioned again!) in transforming creativity and problem-solving. It\u2019s definitely transforming how we operate as an agency, freeing up more space to focus on the client challenges that really need that human brain power.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time to be part of WPP and GroupM. With lots of new leadership in place and a whole new way of operating, our platform advances, product innovation and collaborative spirit are serving us well, making us all stronger. The power of the group and the broader network is really enabling all of us at Wavemaker to live and breathe positive provocation, so I think you\u2019ll see a renewed energy from us this year in really provoking the industry and demonstrating what sets us apart as an agency. It\u2019s that positively provocative spirit that really gives us the focus on creating unrivaled work; I\u2019m confident that you\u2019re going to be seeing it in spades from Wavemaker UK in 2025.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nOh, blimey, this is a bit like having to pick a favorite child! I\u2019m incredibly proud of all our client work in 2024 - we really did see a step change in the volume of unrivaled work we were creating, powered by some great agency-wide initiatives that galvanized everyone behind the work. Some of the standout campaigns include \u2018Bonjour, Hello, Ciao, Ola, Konichiwa!\u2019 for TfL, where we combined real-time train and flight data into a globally recognized DOOH campaign for the Elizabeth Line; our groundbreaking activation for Paramount that transformed Piccadilly Lights into an ancient stone mosaic for Gladiator II; and our UnXpected FM campaign for the UK Government which tackled road safety in an authentic and impactful way.\n\nI\u2019m also really proud of our partnership with Morrisons, which shines a light on what makes Morrisons unique, as well as our work in the data space with Merlin and William Hill that leveraged our proprietary technology \u2018Geograph\u2019 to deliver business impact for both businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s always great to look back, but I\u2019m super excited for what\u2019s in store for 2025 when it comes to the work\u2026 watch this space!\n\nThe B2B specialist won in the Media and Technology-Led Innovation categories at The Drum Awards for B2B 2024, with its work for Juniper Networks and Ecologi.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nCreativity as a strategic brand/business asset: Creativity in B2B has made giant strides in recent years. The momentum for higher-order creativity \u2013 creativity that serves as a strategic asset to move a business forward into the future \u2013 is now unstoppable.\n\nThe essential role of buying groups. Every B2B purchase of consequence involves a buying group. Functional \u201cpoint\u201d buyers. Anonymous buyers, Hidden buyers. Building brand availability and preference at \u2018day one\u2019 of the purchase process is the only way to create and cultivate demand. The understanding that buying groups are not monoliths \u2013 with advocates, antagonists and neutrals all present within the same buying group \u2013 will influence brand strategy and activation going forward.\n\nThe 95/5 rule will become more nuanced. Within the 95% of buyers who are not in-market at any given time, there is a cohort of 25%-30% that is edging closer to market. B2B marketers will develop specific strategies to engage these \u2018in-betweens\u2019 and follow them as they progress into and through the funnel.\n\nBDX as B2B\u2019s default go-to-market model: Truly unified brand-to-demand marketing will become the rule rather than the exception. Brands will gain maturity by applying the Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) model. From organizational structures to omnichannel creative platforms to orchestration platforms, BDX will move to underpin effective B2B marketing.\n\nThe re-definition of the role of brand in B2B. In-market, out-of-market and in between. Top, middle and bottom of funnel. Brand\u2019s multiplier effect on performance marketing. The magnitude and expansiveness of brand\u2019s role in driving demand and growth is becoming a mainstream B2B belief. Brand investment will grow in turn because it must.\n\nAI will move from hype to focused, strategic reality. While experimentation will continue for years, as will the AI arms race, marketers and agencies will focus on a core set of use cases that go beyond tactical enhancements to play a strategic role in all areas of value delivery.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWith new global CEO Kate MacNevin now at the helm, Stein IAS is continuing its growth journey and increasing its growth trajectory. Stein\u2019s positioning \u2013 Building the World\u2019s Most Demanded B2B Brands \u2013 connects the agency to the most consequential brands globally. Our Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) framework released at Cannes addresses the most critical challenge faced by B2B marketers \u2013 building brand strength in order drive demand strength and sustainable growth. As we scale BDX, we anticipate senior hires across the agency, particularly in creative, strategy and business leadership.\n\nIn 2025 and beyond, Stein IAS will continue to lead the industry BDX agenda by: launching the first B2B brand-to-demand maturity study, including industry perspectives on media allocation; partnering with LinkedIn, IAA, ANA and the ANA Lions CMO Growth Council to develop a Future of B2B Buying model; partnering with Brand Finance on the 2025 Most Valuable B2B Brands Index, focusing on the imperative for B2B enterprises to invest in brand to accelerate growth and build enterprise value; partnering strategically with ecosystem leaders, including LinkedIn and 6sense, to unify brand and demand and up-level effectiveness and efficiency for the world\u2019s B2B brands; and launching v2 of our proprietary Origin data platform that leverages AI and direct feeds from LinkedIn\u2019s APIs to develop more relevant and actionable personas, audiences, messaging and content, richer segmentation, and more effective media planning and activation.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nThe Mack Trucks \u2018By America\u2019s Side\u2019 campaign reconnected the soul of the iconic Mack Trucks brand with truck/fleet owners and operators. While the audience\u2019s affinity with Mack is considerable going back many years, it had lessened over time and needed to be strengthened anew in a highly competitive market.

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nWeb Client Runtime Security (WCRS) refers to the security or behavior of the code executed in users' internet browsers during their web interactions.\n\nThe first part of this series discussed why WCRS as a security discipline warrants specific attention in addition to traditional web application security solutions. The second article covered the limitations of traditional security solutions in addressing WCRS risk and proposed implementation options in terms of newer security mechanisms or solutions. This third and final article includes seven suggested steps or activities that organizations may find useful in operationalizing their WCRS programs or capabilities. These steps should provide a potential roadmap for organizations to obtain meaningful outcomes from WCRS solution implementation efforts.\n\nStep 1: Discovery\n\nThe first step in implementing WCRS solutions is to conduct a thorough discovery phase including all web applications and their associated third-party scripts. This involves creating an inventory of web assets and mapping out all dependencies, including those introduced by third-party services. By understanding the full scope of the application environment, organizations can identify key web applications that need to be protected and prioritize security efforts accordingly. The discovery phase is critical as it sets the foundation for subsequent steps and ensures that no critical assets are overlooked and left unprotected. The main objective of this step is to identify all web applications and monitoring requirements.\n\nThis effort could leverage configuration management databases (CMDB) as a starting point. However, it may be the case that some CMDB systems may not always yield accurate and up-to-date information. Implementation teams may therefore need to perform domain name system (DNS) and IP-based discovery against internet and intranet networks as such actions can uncover additional undocumented applications that may require protection.\n\nBy understanding the full scope of the application environment, organizations can identify key web applications that need to be protected and prioritize security efforts accordingly.\n\nStep 2: Prioritization of Web Applications\n\nWhen the discovery phase is complete, organizations should prioritize web applications for WCRS monitoring based on their risk profile. Factors such as the sensitivity of data handled, the volume of user traffic, and the criticality of the application to business operations should be considered. High-risk applications should receive immediate attention, while lower-risk applications can be addressed in a phased manner. This prioritization ensures that resources are allocated effectively, initially focusing on the most critical areas to maximize security impact.\n\nStep 3: Justification and Minimization of Third-Party Scripts\n\nOrganizations should assess the necessity of each third-party script and remove or replace those that are non-essential or pose significant risk. In other words, organizations should prioritize minimizing their attack surface, as reducing the attack surface is a key aspect of WCRS. This involves evaluating the functionality provided by third-party scripts against their security implications and seeking alternative solutions where possible. By minimizing the use of third-party scripts, organizations can reduce the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced and improve overall security.\n\nStep 4: Policy Development\n\nOrganizations should establish policies designed to block unwanted scripts and behaviors by implementing automated technical controls, such as WCRS vendor solution policies, content security policies,1 sub-resource integrity checks,2 and other security measures. Vendor solutions that enable behavior-based policies should be leveraged to reduce high-risk behaviors, such as keystroke logging and limiting access to sensitive data fields to a specific group of trusted scripts. These policies should be designed to balance security with operational needs, ensuring that legitimate business activities are not disrupted. Regular reviews and updates to these policies are necessary to adapt to evolving threats and changes in the web application environment.\n\nStep 5: Alerts and Response to Changes\n\nTimely detection and response to security incidents are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. Organizations should implement mechanisms for real-time alerting and monitoring of changes to client-side scripts and behaviors. This involves adapting security policies to reduce false positives and ensuring that the volume of alerts received by security operations staff is commensurate with the size of their team. Clear response protocols and escalation paths should also be established, enabling security teams to quickly address incidents and mitigate potential risk. Last, it is important to ensure continuous monitoring and adaptation of these processes in order to maintain an effective security response over time.\n\nStep 6: Third-Party Risk Management\n\nManaging risk associated with third-party scripts requires close collaboration with vendors and adherence to regulatory guidelines. Organizations with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance obligations should follow the latest PCI requirements3 and guidance on engaging third parties for script integrity checking and ensure that vendors are aware of their impact on security. On 1 August 2019, the PCI Security Standards Council issued a bulletin4 addressing the threat of online skimming to payment security. This bulletin underscores the critical need for third parties to understand their role in securing payment pages, a message that remains highly relevant for organizations today. Additionally, organizations should refer to guidance from the US Office for Civil Rights (OCR) regarding the protection of protected health information (PHI).5 By maintaining robust third-party risk management practices, organizations can ensure that their security measures extend beyond their infrastructure.\n\nStep 7: Governance and Accountability\n\nEstablishing a governance framework and regular reporting mechanisms is essential for maintaining oversight and accountability for WCRS efforts. This involves defining roles and responsibilities, setting security objectives, and tracking progress against these goals. Regular reporting to stakeholders provides visibility into the effectiveness of security measures and highlights areas for improvement. Continuous improvement processes should be implemented to allow security practices to evolve in response to emerging threats and changes in the regulatory landscape. By maintaining strong governance and reporting structures, organizations can ensure that WCRS remains a priority and is effectively managed over time.\n\nOrganizations should consider implementing governance dashboards, such as the one shown in figure 1. These dashboards may include click-through functionality, allowing stakeholders such as line of business (LOB) and technology (LOT) owners and information security, compliance, and internal audit teams to readily review the underlying information or data for their respective needs.\n\nFigure 1\u2014Example WCRS Dashboard\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWCRS is crucial for any website utilizing third-party code. Given the increasing complexity and functionality of modern websites, it is nearly impossible for commercial sites to avoid the use of third-party code during client interactions. As a result, ensuring robust WCRS measures is essential for maintaining website security.\n\nThe authors hope that the solutions covered in the second article of this series, along with the operationalization strategies outlined in this final installment, offer readers comprehensive guidance regarding the next steps for implementation within their respective organizations.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Mozilla Foundation, \u201cContent Security Policy (CSP),\u201d 10 January 2017\n\n2 Mozilla Foundation, \u201cSubresource Integrity,\u201d 21 September 2015\n\n3 PCI Security Standards Council, PCI DSS: v4.0.1\n\n4 PCI Security Standards Council, \u201cThe Threat of Online Skimming to Payment Security,\u201d 1 August 2019\n\n5 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cUse of Online Tracking Technologies by HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates,\u201d USA, 1 December 2022\n\nSergei Vasilevsky, CISSP\n\nIs the founder and president of ILIAM Consulting.

The same can be said even at the microscopic level of a \u201cnanoflower,\u201d compound combinations in chemistry that grow to form plantlike shapes. With this in mind, a research team based at Italy\u2019s University of Genoa have designed a novel nanostructure that relies on carnation-like nanoflowers containing enough surface area to host numerous wound-healing drug molecules.\n\nThe medical innovation is detailed in a study published in the journal ACS Applied Bio Materials. According to its creators, the bandage prototype uses two polyphenol-based materials\u2013copper phosphate and tannic acid. These reagents possess well-documented anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Once mixed and placed in a saline solution, the copper phosphate-tannic acid compounds begin to self-assemble and grow into recognizable, flower-like structures. From there, researchers then carefully attached these nanoflowers on small strips of electrospun nanofabric.\n\n\u201cPolyphenols, natural compounds abundant in phenolic structures, have received widespread attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer properties, making them valuable for biomedical applications,\u201d the team wrote in their study. \u201cHowever, the green synthesis of polyphenol-based materials with economical and environmentally friendly strategies is of great significance.\u201d\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to an accompanying announcement on January 31st, the nanoflower-covered fabrics not only \u201cinactivated\u201d the bacteria, but did so through the addition of antibiotic-resistant biofilms\u2014all while protecting lab-grown human cells.\n\nResearchers say their new, nanoflower based approach appears to be both cost-effective and extremely efficient, allowing for better means to speed up wound healing and fight infections. The possible benefits from nanoflowers aren\u2019t limited to medicine, either. Another study, published in October 2024 in Advanced Materials, points to uses across real-time imaging, wastewater purification, and even microrobotics."

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

            "article_content": "Experts believe they have finally found the last Anglo-Saxon king's residence\n\nArchaeologists have made a stunning breakthrough after discovering an 11th Centry medieval toilet that has helped to unravel a 2,000-year-old mystery. Researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of Newcastle believe they have uncovered Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon king of England\u2019s long-lost residence. Experts had until now been unable to pinpoint the exact location of King Harold\u2019s residence in Bosham. Illustrations of the grand hall in his residence appear twice in an 11th-century embroidered work known as the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the 1066 Norman Conquest of England. The tapestry shows Harold feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France. While the church in Bosham still stands today, experts have been left baffled by the hall's exact location.\n\nA The tapestry shows Harold seen feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France.\n\nHowever, researchers' re-examining evidence found in 2006 by West Sussex Archaeology led to a stunning revelation. The initial 2006 investigation located two previously unidentified medieval structures at the site. One structure is built into a modern-day private residence, and the other was found in the property's garden. Dr. Duncan Wright, Senior Lecturer in Medieval Archaeology at Newcastle University and project leader, said a toilet from the period found in the building offered a vital clue. While having a toilet in your home is practically a given in every household today, they were typically only found in high-status and elite residences in England during the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This artist\u2019s concept shows astronomers\u2019 best guess as to what it and its moon Dysnomia look like. Credit: NASA/ESA/STScI\n\nEight billion miles (14 billion kilometers) from Earth, at the solar system\u2019s ragged edge, lies Eris \u2014 a planet-sized oddball of a world that emerged unexpectedly from the darkness 20 years ago. Named for the capricious Greek goddess of discord, trouble-stirring Eris would doubtless be pleased that her celestial namesake caused even mild-mannered astronomers to quarrel, as its discovery caused the nature of what constitutes a \u201cplanet\u201d to rear its controversial head.\n\nWith a magnitude of 18.7, Eris currently lies in the southern constellation Cetus the Whale, barely resolvable even by the world\u2019s largest telescopes. Due to its vast distance \u2014 some 95.6 astronomical units (AU; 1 AU is the average Earth-Sun distance) \u2014 its slow apparent progress across the sky makes it notoriously difficult to spot.\n\nAt Eris\u2019 distance, the Sun appears as a tiny star in the coal-dark sky, its light taking 13 hours to traverse the space between them and weakly illuminate a glistening surface of methane and nitrogen ices. Eris is three times more distant than Pluto. And its relationship to Pluto \u2014 a world demoted since 2006 from the solar system\u2019s ninth planet to a lowly dwarf planet, in large part due to the discovery of Eris \u2014 remains contentious today.\n\nA distant find\n\nIn 2001, astronomers at Palomar Observatory in California began systematically seeking planet-sized objects beyond Neptune. This time-consuming process targeted small pockets of the sky, utilizing powerful imaging software to identify anything that moved against the starry backdrop. To limit the number of false-positive data returns due to image resolution, the software excluded anything moving slower than 1.5 arcseconds per hour.\n\n\u201cThings like Eris were precisely what we were looking for when we started this survey in 2001,\u201d says Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who co-discovered Eris with Chad Trujillo, then of the Gemini Observatory, and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. \u201cAt that time, nothing had ever been found beyond about 60 AU, so we tuned the survey to concentrate on this area.\u201d\n\nBut an ironic consequence was that images of the slow-moving Eris, taken by Brown\u2019s team with the 48-inch (1.2 meters) Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar on Oct. 21, 2003, slipped entirely through the net, falling below their speed cutoff.\n\nIn the months that followed, several new trans-Neptunian objects \u2014 bodies whose orbits have an average distance beyond that of Neptune \u2014 were discovered: red-hued Sedna in November 2003 and ellipsoid-shaped Haumea in December 2004. Sedna\u2019s 11,400-year orbit carries it to an aphelion (its farthest point from the Sun) well beyond the heliopause, the region near the solar system\u2019s periphery where the Sun cedes gravitational influence to the interstellar medium.\n\nAt the time of its discovery, Sedna lay at 90 AU \u2014 8.3 billion miles (13.3 billion km) from the Sun, three times more distant than Neptune. And significantly, it moved at a paltry 1.75 arcseconds per hour. That prompted Brown\u2019s team to reanalyze their older data with lower limits on angular motion, then painstakingly sort through previously excluded images by eye.\n\n\u201cWhen we found Sedna in 2003 at close to 90 AU and just barely at the limit of our software, we wondered whether we might have missed something even further away,\u201d Brown remembers. \u201cIt took months of additional work and processing, until suddenly Eris pops out of the data! In the end, it was the only extra object we found from all of the reprocessing \u2014 but worth it!\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s reanalysis finally pinpointed Eris on Jan. 5, 2005. At that time, it was simply called 2003 UB 313 . Brown excitedly called his wife, Diane, with the news: \u201cI found a planet!\u201d\n\nBut his words were ominously propitious, as unfolding circumstances on Earth quickly overtook the discovery.\n\nMore planets?\n\nEarly observations hinted that Eris might be bigger than Pluto, whose own size remained uncertain until the New Horizons spacecraft flew past in July 2015.\n\nBut whether larger or smaller than Pluto, hopes that Eris might also be granted planetary status were quickly dashed. For years, astronomers had hotly debated Pluto\u2019s planethood. Our then-ninth planet was smaller than any other planet, yet carried profound cultural connotations, endearing itself to generations who had grown up reciting the same solar system mnemonic in the classroom and universally accepted it as the ninth planet.\n\nThat long-held popular belief was turned on its head with the discoveries of Haumea, Sedna, Eris, and \u2014 a few months after Eris \u2014 Makemake in March 2005, forcing the astronomical community\u2019s hand. In August 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally defined a \u201cplanet\u201d as an object circling the Sun, sufficiently large and gravitationally massive to attain a spherical shape, and has cleared its region of space.\n\nUnder that definition, the new discoveries fell short on this third point, for none had cleared their respective celestial neighborhoods. But neither had Pluto. On Sept. 6, 2006, Pluto and the others were formally recategorized not as planets but as \u201cdwarf planets\u201d \u2014 objects orbiting the Sun that could achieve sphericity but were gravitationally incapable of dominating their environs.\n\n\u201cWe knew that second that we found it [Eris] that our concept of the solar system was going to have to change,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWe were either going to have to add new planets or subtract one. I would have predicted the former, but even though it means I lost my chance to be called the discoverer of a few new planets, I am delighted that astronomers had the nerve to make the right choice and realize that Pluto should never have been called a planet in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name?\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2006, 2003 UB 313 was formally named Eris. But this had not been the original choice. One unofficial name used by Brown\u2019s team was Xena, honoring the titular character in the television show Xena: Warrior Princess \u2014 which coincidentally also began with an X, for what might have been the tenth planet.\n\n\u201cWe called it Xena right away, just as one of our internal code names,\u201d says Brown. \u201cBut when the final IAU decision came out, we decided to search for something in the Greek or Roman mythology to honor the fact that Xena had been something like a real planet for a good year. Not surprisingly, almost everything had been taken by various nondescript asteroids over the years.\u201d\n\nPopular suggestions rounded up in a survey by New Scientist ranged from Persephone to Pax, Galileo to Xena, Rupert to Nibiru, and Cerberus to Loki. The survey results even included the comically floated \u201cBob\u201d as an option, its originator quipping that it was easily pronounceable, non-offensive, and \u201cI think Uranus needs a break, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut everyone seemed to have avoided the goddess of discord and strife,\u201d whose Greek name was Eris, recalls Brown. \u201cAs soon as we saw it, we realized [it] was perfect.\u201d Just like the strife-inciting goddess of ancient Greece, the celestial Eris had prodded its own hornet\u2019s nest of debate both in the astronomical community and among the wider public.\n\nIt turns out that Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto, with an equatorial diameter 1,445 miles (2,326 km) and a surface area roughly equivalent to South America. But Eris is some 27 percent more massive than Pluto, likely due to a denser, rocky interior.\n\nA tiny moon, named Dysnomia after the mythological Eris\u2019 daughter and the goddess of lawlessness, was discovered in September 2005 by Brown\u2019s team at Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Dark as coal, one-third the size of Eris, and icy in nature, Dysnomia orbits every 16 days at a distance of 23,200 miles (37,300 km).\n\nEris\u2019 plain white fa\u00e7ade reflects some 96 percent of the Sun\u2019s light, making it one of the solar system\u2019s brightest surfaces. Its highly eccentric orbit carries it around the Sun every 559 years, bringing it as close as 37.9 AU (3.5 billion miles [5.6 billion km]) and carrying it as far as 97.5 AU (9.1 billion miles [15 billion km]). Surface temperatures hover around 42 kelvins \u2014 about \u2013384 degrees Fahrenheit (\u2013231 degrees Celsius).\n\nIts ubiquitous brightness is matched only by Saturn\u2019s icy moon Enceladus, but Brown does not believe cryovolcanism or geysers are necessarily responsible. \u201cEris is sufficiently cold that its atmosphere will be condensed onto the surface and I think that is really all that is going on,\u201d he says. \u201cPresumably as Eris gets closer to the Sun, the frosts will sublime and the surface will darken.\u201d\n\nHaving passed its most recent aphelion in 1977, Eris will reach perihelion in 2257. Plans for a flyby mission are being considered, with the most ideal launch opportunities in 2032 and 2044. Should such a mission take place, the spacecraft could reach Eris roughly 25 years after launch.\n\nAnd new discoveries would surely follow.\n\nRelated: Does Planet Nine exist?"

            "article_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nOne of the great anomalies of American politics is that Donald Trump, who has been elected to the presidency twice and came very close to victory a third time, has been pretty regularly unpopular since he first came down that New York escalator in 2015. The day he was elected in 2016, his personal net favorability ratio per FiveThirtyEight was minus 24 percent, lower than any major-party presidential nominee dating back at least to the 1970s. For a moment during his first term as president, he had a positive job-approval ratio, but it went south by February 3, 2017, and never recovered. On Election Day 2020, his job-approval numbers were 44.6 percent positive, 52.6 percent negative. And he left office after the January 6 Capitol Riot with a 38.6 percent/57.9 percent ratio.\n\nDuring his comeback effort, Trump\u2019s favorability ratio was never positive. His favorability number peaked at 44 percent on February 28, 2024, and luckily for him, it was still at 43.6 percent \u2014 not good, but not disastrous \u2014 on Election Day.\n\nAll of this makes the 47th president\u2019s current standing look pretty good. His current job-approval average is 49.1 percent positive and 43.9 percent negative, down very slightly from where he was on Inauguration Day. But individual polls can give you a different impression of where he stands. Gallup\u2019s January 2025 job-approval poll shows Trump at 47 percent positive, 48 percent negative, so unsurprisingly, its current take is that the glass is half-empty:\n\nAt 47%, President Donald Trump\u2019s initial job approval rating for his second term is similar to the inaugural 45% reading during his first term, again placing him below all other elected presidents dating back to 1953. Trump remains the only elected president with sub-50% initial approval ratings.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting as well that Trump\u2019s personal favorability, despite the inaugural \u201choneymoon\u201d he is supposedly experiencing, remains meh at best: he\u2019s at 46.4 favorable, 48.0 unfavorable, per FiveThirtyEight.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty clear that Trump is not as popular as Joe Biden was at this point in the 46th presidency: On January 31, 2021, Biden\u2019s job-approval average was 53.8 percent positive and 33.4 percent negative. His approval ratio eventually turned negative in September 2021 and remained underwater until he left office.\n\nAll this is relevant background for what we might expect now that Trump 2.0 is entering its first serious rough patch, with a significant public backlash against a poorly executed and almost immediately suspended federal funding freeze. Upcoming fights over congressional budget decisions (which could make the funding-freeze furor seem like a low-pressure dress rehearsal), the messy details of mass deportation, and Trump\u2019s own tendency to overreach could all drive his popularity down to where it has been for most of his public career. The question then remains: In his last term in office, does he really care?"

It is unsurprising, therefore, that AI forms part of both the problem and the solution. Accompanied by a governance model that has a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d component, AI-enabled solutions can support more efficient and effective systems and controls for the prevention of financial crime risks. In this article we explore the current use of AI to combat financial crime and what lies ahead for firms using third parties to comply with their obligations in this area.\n\nAI-enabled financial crime compliance\n\nAI continues to dominate both professional and private conversation.The financial services sector have been early adopters to the technology, using AI widely, including within their risk and compliance functions.AI\u2019s role in fraud detection and prevention has developed rapidly: the Bank of England and FCA\u2019s third survey of AI and machine learning in UK financial services revealed that it is the third highest use case in financial services and is expected to increase in the next 3 years. Additionally, customer due diligence and transaction monitoring are two areas where AI can deliver significant operational efficiencies.\n\nWhat is driving this trend? Financial crime plainly remains one of the most significant risks facing financial services firms and remains firmly within the regulator\u2019s focus \u2013 tackling financial crime is one of the main objectives in the FCA\u2019s new 5-year strategy 2025-2030. Firms are significantly motivated to adopt more sophisticated and dynamic ways to protect against financial crime risks, which AI-enabled tools offer.\n\nRecent examples of the use of AI in this area are real success stories. AI-enabled tools have been used to:\n\nHowever, these AI-enabled tools are inherently complex, requiring considerable resource and extensive market data to develop and maintain. Third-party providers of AI enabled tools designed to detect and combat financial crime have emerged, raising important questions of governance, accountability, expertise and, ultimately, regulatory compliance.\n\nThe Reliance on Third Parties A third of all current AI use cases deployed by respondents to the regulators\u2019 AI survey are third-party implementations, up from 17% in the regulators\u2019 equivalent 2022 survey. Risk and compliance was the business area with the second highest percentage of third-party implementations (64%), narrowly behind usage in HR (65%). The regulators anticipate that the use of third-party implementations will increase as AI models become more complex and outsourcing costs decrease. Coupled with the likely increased reliance on third party providers in AI use, evidence suggests that firms have an inadequate understanding of how outsourced systems operate and are trained. For example, almost 50% of respondents in the Bank of England\u2019s survey reported having only a partial understanding of the AI technologies they use, admitting \u201ca lack of complete understanding\u201d where these technologies are developed by third parties rather than internally. This is problematic given the regulatory requirements governing the oversight of outsourced functions, which includes use of third party AI tools. Such oversight cannot be properly exercised where the host firm does not understand the system. Firms will need to consider how the fundamental differences in AI, compared with algorithmic models before it, impact the discharge of their responsibilities. Whist the typical safeguards contained in an outsourcing agreement, i.e. provisions that stipulate audit rights and business continuity arrangements, may mitigate emergent risks in the area, a new suite of protective solutions and governance arrangements will be required. This need is particularly apparent in respect of data. AI-enabled tools that rely on poor quality or incomplete data will, necessarily, produce poor quality outcomes. Data governance and standards have never been more important and will be a fast-developing field in the context of AI models. Similarly, firms will need to implement measures to protect against third party models generating biased results, a likely focus of regulatory concern. The FCA has cautioned that firms using AI-enabled tools should consider whether they may lead to worse outcomes for some groups of consumers, in breach of the Consumer Duty, due to these technologies embedding or amplifying bias. Bias can occur at any point from the creation of the algorithm to its deployment. Incorrect problem-framing or reliance on datasets that are not representative of the firms\u2019 customer demographic will result in an inherently biased learning process and discriminatory outputs. Use of third-party models that rely on market-wide transfer learning in risk detection (i.e. leveraging pre-existing models trained on large financial datasets) may exacerbate this problem. The use of third-party AI models may also present an accountability challenge, if not deficit, especially where the developers and providers are outside of the regulatory perimeter. Failures connected with the operation of financial crime systems and controls have already been a significant focus of regulatory enforcement action. The FCA\u2019s issuance of Final Notices to Metro Bank Plc and Starling Bank Ltd in late 2024 are stark examples. However, there have not been any related actions taken against Senior Managers, which may speak to the evidential challenges presented by such cases. Whilst, establishing individual accountability may become more difficult in respect of AI systems which have a significant third party component, regulators may closely scrutinise firms\u2019 standards of governance and oversight. Firms will need to have staff with the requisite expertise and training, to ensure that auditing and oversight of the models, and their development, can be monitored effectively. They will also need to assess the appropriate extent to which \u201chumans in the loop\u201d should be incorporated into the operation of the model, i.e. where does the appropriate balance between efficiency and protection lie? Should failings emerge, unravelling what went wrong and who was ultimately responsible will be challenging due to the complexity of the models and number of parties feeding into the systems. Firms will need to be able to explain, in a meaningful way, the machine learning model and any resulting decisions, especially if they lead to consumer harm. Firms need also to design and implement feedback mechanisms to detect and prevent model drift, and enable prompt reaction to bias or new threats. These are significant questions, which will require input at a Board level. Where an unacceptable accountability deficit emerges, the Regulator may shift its focus on the governance arrangements in firms, instead casting its perimeter wider, to include third party providers of AI financial crime systems within the regulatory fold. This has already been done in respect of critical third party providers, who supply material services to financial sector. That approach may be rolled out in other areas in which the industry\u2019s dependence on third party providers for complex AI systems becomes entrenched."

For the full year, offtake is also up 1.8% to 630.2 MT.Nuvama highlighted that apart from Coal production from captive mines, Coal India is also losing market share, which declined to 75% from 78% last year.Although the brokerage does not see any significant downside on the stock, it would prefer to first see volume growth before entering the stock.Nuvama has a \"hold\" rating on Coal India with a price target of \u20b9419.Out of the 26 analysts who have coverage on Coal India, 20 of them have a \"buy\" rating on the stock, four say \"hold\", while two have a \"sell\" rating on the stock.Shares of Coal India ended 2.6% lower on Saturday at \u20b9385.35. The stock is down 30% from its peak of \u20b9543."

This target implies a potential upside of 24% from the current levels.Inox Wind shares rallied 11.93% to hit an intra-day high of188.45.The brokerage also said Inox Wind is one of only two wind-EPC suppliers in India, riding tailwinds of RTC, FDRE and C&I demand.Nuvama said that Inox Wind's revenue per MW was subdued at Rs 4.5 crore per MW due to low EPC sales, which was offset by higher operating profit margin at 22.7% against an estimate of 17% on product heavy mix.Its profit exceeded expectations of 27%, adjusted for exceptional items (higher other income offset by one-off tax charge).Order inflow was soft at 231 MW, taking order book to 3.3 GW with a large order pipeline.\"Guidance was retained at FY25/26 execution of 800MW/1200MW and 17%-plus OPMs,\" Nuvama said.Inox Wind remains a key player in the C&I segment and benefits from a duopolistic market in wind EPC. OB of 3.3GW (execution over 24 months) lends revenue visibility, according said, adding that it remains positive on the sector and the company.The brokerage has tweaked its FY25 and FY27 estimates, cutting realisation/MW, factoring lower EPC execution and inching up margin.Inox Wind CEO Kailash Tarachandani expressed confidence in ramping up execution from Q4 FY25 onwards.\u201cWe have been able to deliver another quarter of strong results in Q3 and are confident of delivering significantly higher execution from Q4 FY25 onwards,\u201d Kailash Tarachandani said.On the charts, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Inox Wind is at 52.2. An RSI reading above 70 would mean that the stock is in overbought territory.Five out of the six analysts that have coverage on Inox Wind maintained a 'Buy' rating on the stock while one has a 'Hold rating.Shares of Inox Wind Ltd. are currently trading 6.21% higher on Saturday at178.80."

From time to time, I buy shares, mostly to not be categorized as a degen by my fellow investor friends, therefore the 50%-50% allocation. My timeframe tends to be between 3-24 months.I like stocks that have experienced a recent sell-off due to non-recurrent events, particularly when insiders are buying shares at the new lower price. This is how I often screen through thousands of stocks, mainly in the US, although I may own shares in banana republics. I use fundamental analysis to check the health of companies that pass through my screening process, their leverage, and then compare their financial ratios with the sector, and industry median and average. I also do professional background checks of each insider who purchased shares after the recent sell-off. I use technical analysis to optimize the entry and exit points of my positions. I mainly use multicolor lines for support and resistance levels on weekly charts. From time to time I draw trend lines, taken for granted, in multicolor patterns. Note: I tried to keep my introduction as real, and authentic as possible. I dislike empty suits, high-level BS, deep-level BS, unnecessary jargon, and self-indulgent, third-person written introductions with an air of superiority.Thanks for reading my introduction!"

            "article_content": "If Intel hopes to survive the next few years as a freestanding company and return to its role as innovator, it can not afford to waste its time and it cannot afford to make any more mistakes.\n\nWhich is why the new top brasses at Intel \u2013 chief executive officer of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus and chief financial officer Dave Zinsner, who are co-CEOs of the company \u2013 are pushing out the next generation of its E-core Xeon CPUs and turning a future AI accelerator that represents the convergence of its datacenter GPU and AI accelerator lines into a research platform as it goes back to the drawing board to create a rackscale AI design that presumably will do a better job competing against Nvidia.\n\nThe roadmap changes, which we backcast into our recent CPU roadmap story, were made during the call with Wall Street analysts yesterday going over Intel\u2019s financial results for Q4 2024. We will get to the numbers in a second, but first let\u2019s update the Intel datacenter compute engine roadmap, starting with the \u201cClearwater Forest\u201d Xeon 7 E-core chip that was expected later this year and that was expected to be the first datacenter chip to use its 18A RibbonFET manufacturing process.\n\n\u201cSo I really look at the datacenter market in kind of two buckets,\u201d Johnston Holthaus said on the call when asked about the timing change for Clearwater Rapids. \u201cWe have our P-core products, which you know is Granite Rapids and then we have our E-core products which equates to Clearwater Forest. And what we\u2019ve seen is that\u2019s more of a niche market, and we haven\u2019t seen volume materialize there, as fast as we expected. But as we look at Clearwater Forest, we expect that to come to market in the first half of 2026. 18A is doing just fine on its performance and yield for [Diamond] Rapids, but it does have some complicated packaging expectations that move it to 2026. But we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well. But this is going to be a journey.\u201d\n\nJohnston Holthaus said \u201cGranite Rapids\u201d in the paragraph above, but meant to say \u201cDiamond Rapids.\u201d The Granite Rapids Xeon 6 processor has already been launched and is etched with the Intel 3 process, which if you want to be generous is akin to 3 nanometer processes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nIt sounds to us that some of the packaging kinks need to be worked out for Xeon-class chips using 18A. We also think, given the niche nature of the E-core variants, Diamond Rapids P-core variants could come to market ahead of E-core Clearwater Forest variants. And if it gets crazy enough, the E-core chip could be moved to custom products and not rolled out as part of the official Xeon roadmap at some point.\n\nThe reason that might happen is simple: The E-core chips do not have full-on AVX vector math units and they do not have AMX matrix units or HyperThreading simultaneous multithreading. The first and second are increasingly important for AI inference and light AI training. AMD does not have matrix math units on any Epyc CPUs as yet, but it does have full-on vectors on boith the plain vanilla and skinny core \u201cC\u201d variants for the \u201cGenoa\u201d Epyc 9004 and \u201cTurin\u201d Epyc 9005 CPUs. The AMD approach to skinny cores is to cut the L3 cache in half for the C variants and rejigger the core such that you can fit more cores in a socket. With the Genoa chips, that was 33 percent more cores, and with Turin, it is 50 percent more.\n\nAs we put it at the Granite Rapids launch: Intel Brings A Big Fork To A Server CPU Knife Fight. It is amazing to us that Intel didn\u2019t do the same trick that AMD did to make a skinny core and preserve compatibility, and it is also amazing to us that hyperscalers and cloud builders indicated that they were fine with this forking of the architecture. Then again, a hyperscaler/cloud builder talking up FPGA-based DPUs is how Intel got scared into spending $16.7 billion on Altera. Sometimes, Intel gets a bad steer, and it doesn\u2019t compensate by stiffening its arms. (And to be fair, we caught a little FPGA religion, too, at the time, but still think Intel\u2019s exuberance was much larger than ours.)\n\nBecause of the intense competition that AMD is bringing with the Genoa and Turin datacenter CPUs, Intel has had to circle back and actually chop prices on the Granite Rapids chips, which were announced in September 2024 with the highest prices we have ever seen for Intel CPUs. This price cuts better align Granite Rapids chips to Genoa Epyc 9004 pricing, which was probably happening informally in every deal anyway. All five of the Granite Rapids chips that were announced last fall had a price cut, with three getting a 30 percent cut, one getting a 20 percent cut, and another getting a 13.4 percent cut. The top bin parts with 128 and 120 cores and the lower bin part with 72 cores had the deepest cuts.\n\nThat brings us to the ever-changing \u201cFalcon Shores\u201d accelerator.\n\nThree years ago, Intel was working on a GPU product line anchored by its \u201cPonte Vecchio\u201d Max GPU and followed by its \u201cRialto Bridge\u201d kicker and at the same time was creating a hybrid CPU-GPU device called Falcon Shores that, like AMD\u2019s MI300A, would mix Xeon CPU cores and matrix math units that were derived from these GPUs as well as the Gaudi line of XPUs that it got through its acquisition of Habana Labs. In February 2022, we contemplated what Falcon Shores might look like, and the expectation was that these accelerators would plug into the same sockets as the Granite Rapids CPUs.\n\nby March 2023, Intel\u2019s GPU efforts were in a shambles with Ponte Vecchio being very late and Rialto Bridge canceled. AT the time, there were rumors that Falcon Shores using only GPU engines would be the future discrete accelerator from Intel and that project was pushed out \u201cbeyond 2025.\u201d And in June 2023, Intel downplayed the whole idea of a hybrid CPU-GPU device and merged the Gaudi matrix math engines with the Falcom Shores all-GPU machine to create a new and improved plan for Falcon Shores. The idea was to take the wide Ethernet pipelines used in the Gaudi architecture and the Falcon Shores GPU and Gaudi matrix math to create a unified accelerator that could run workloads designed for Gaudi and Pente Vecchio.\n\nWell, forget all of that. Now everything is shifting out further to a still future accelerator called \u201cJaguar Shores.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way,\u201d Johnston Holthaus said, stating what is obvious to us all given the explosive fortunes of Nvidia. \u201cWe have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi, and we are applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our roadmap and concentrate our resources. Many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month. Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only, without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI datacenter. More broadly, as I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably, to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute.\u201d\n\nSo that is the end of Falcon Shores and the beginning of Jaguar Shores, of which we know nothing other than the hinted at rackscale approach mentioned above.\n\nWith that, let\u2019s talk about Intel\u2019s datacenter business as it was in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the December quarter, Intel\u2019s overall revenues were $14.26 billion, down 7.4 percent year on year, but up 7.3 percent sequentially. The company posted a $152 million net loss, compared to a $2.67 billion net gain in the year ago period, but a whole lot better than the nearly $17 billion loss it booked in Q3 2024 due mostly to restructuring charges.\n\nIntel ended the quarter with $22.06 billion in cash and investments in the bank, money it is correctly parceling out very carefully as it invests in products and foundries.\n\nHere is the breakdown of Intel\u2019s revenues and operating income by group for the past two years:\n\nAnd here is the same data shown graphically for revenues:\n\nIntel was able to hold revenues in its Datacenter and AI (DCAI) group relatively steady in the fourth quarter, with sales down 3.3 percent to $3.39 billion but up 1.1 percent sequentially. Operating profits were $233 million, a pretty anemic 6.9 percent of revenues and down 68.4 percent from the year ago quarter. Intel\u2019s profit levels for datacenter products has been declining over the past year, which is no doubt concerning and which is also compelling the company to break its Network and Edge (NEX) group into pieces, with Xeon processor and networking product sales in NEX eventually being merged back into DCAI. (Other parts of it will go into its Client Computing Group at some point in the future.)\n\nThe NEX group had a revenue bump of 10.3 percent to $1.62 billion, and operating income was $340 million (20.9 percent of sales), which is the healthiest profit levels Intel has had in this line of business in years. The Altera FPGA business, which we also think of as part of the core datacenter business, had sales of $429 million, down 10.6 percent, and operating income of $90 million, a factor of 21.5X higher than a year ago.\n\nWe have been tracking Intel\u2019s Data Center Group, the core business that was created for server products way back in the day, for a long time, and have used the combination of DCAI and a portion of NEX and Altera as a proxy for the historical Data Center Group that was first headed up by Pat Gelsinger so many years ago.\n\nHere is the trend:\n\nIntel\u2019s rise in the datacenter and its hegemony over server compute is evidenced in the run from 2009 through 2019, and you can see where AMD started taking share in 2020 and how this has caused Intel much grief since then.\n\nThe server CPU business has become intensely competitive, and it is safe to say that a lot of Intel\u2019s revenues are supply wins, not design wins, considering the much higher core counts and performance that AMD delivers for most workloads at this point.\n\nIntel used to sell flash and 3D XPoint memory storage, and it also used to sell network switches, and this all made the \u201creal\u201d systems business at intel much larger. (The company still sells network adapters and DPUs.) Since 2015, we have been modeling this \u201creal\u201d datacenter business, which ascended to around $9 billion a quarter in 2019 and kissed it once again in 2021 during a hypercaler and cloud buildout before deflating down to around $5 billion a quarter now. Profits have collapsed much faster, as you can see, but are better than the minor loss Intel posted in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nThe question we have \u2013 that everyone has \u2013 is: Can Intel ever get above $5 billion a quarter again in the datacenter, and can it do so profitably? Because we like competition, we certainly hope so.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now"

The same can be said even at the microscopic level of a \u201cnanoflower,\u201d compound combinations in chemistry that grow to form plantlike shapes. With this in mind, a research team based at Italy\u2019s University of Genoa have designed a novel nanostructure that relies on carnation-like nanoflowers containing enough surface area to host numerous wound-healing drug molecules.\n\nThe medical innovation is detailed in a study published in the journal ACS Applied Bio Materials. According to its creators, the bandage prototype uses two polyphenol-based materials\u2013copper phosphate and tannic acid. These reagents possess well-documented anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Once mixed and placed in a saline solution, the copper phosphate-tannic acid compounds begin to self-assemble and grow into recognizable, flower-like structures. From there, researchers then carefully attached these nanoflowers on small strips of electrospun nanofabric.\n\n\u201cPolyphenols, natural compounds abundant in phenolic structures, have received widespread attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer properties, making them valuable for biomedical applications,\u201d the team wrote in their study. \u201cHowever, the green synthesis of polyphenol-based materials with economical and environmentally friendly strategies is of great significance.\u201d\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to an accompanying announcement on January 31st, the nanoflower-covered fabrics not only \u201cinactivated\u201d the bacteria, but did so through the addition of antibiotic-resistant biofilms\u2014all while protecting lab-grown human cells.\n\nResearchers say their new, nanoflower based approach appears to be both cost-effective and extremely efficient, allowing for better means to speed up wound healing and fight infections. The possible benefits from nanoflowers aren\u2019t limited to medicine, either. Another study, published in October 2024 in Advanced Materials, points to uses across real-time imaging, wastewater purification, and even microrobotics."

He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

            "article_content": "In a networked society, secure communication is essential. Quantum physics delivers the necessary foundation by allowing practicable technologies such as quantum key distribution. With the new fiber optic test facility at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), which opened on January 22, 2025, researchers aim to transmit, test and refine quantum keys. They also plan to set up a quantum network to link quantum computers.\n\n\n\nTo generate and transmit the quantum keys, the researchers will use cutting-edge technologies such as ultra-coherent lasers with the new fiber optic test facility. Quantum keys are crucial for secure communication because they are based on physical laws instead of the mathematical assumptions underlying earlier encryption keys, which future quantum computers will be able to break.\n\n\n\nSpanning 20 kilometers, the quantum-optical transmission line connects laboratories specially equipped with complex lasers and cryostats on KIT\u2019s Campus South and Campus North. The light-guiding core of a fiber optic cable is only about 9 micrometers in diameter. For comparison, the thickness of a human hair is about 60 micrometers.\n\n\n\nImportant Quantum Research Platform\n\n\u201cQuantum communication is a strategically important field for KIT, so I\u2019m especially pleased that with the finished test facility, KIT is providing its researchers with important infrastructure for investigating the opportunities offered by quantum physics,\u201d said Oliver Kraft, Vice President for Research at KIT. \u201cWith this facility, we\u2019re making an important contribution to the advancement of research and development in quantum network technology, with an eye to practical applications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the fiber-optic test facility, we have a platform for improving quantum key distribution, investigating its basic properties, and integrating it in classical communication,\u201d said Professor David Hunger of the Physikalisches Institut at KIT, who heads the project. Based on this work, the scientists aim to develop new transmission protocols for the keys. \u201cWith the new methods we develop, we want to make quantum cryptography more efficient and practical. We\u2019re working on this e.g. with KEEQuant, a quantum communication start-up,\u201d added Hunger. \u201cFurthermore, using novel materials such as molecular quantum emitters, we want to generate ultrapure quantum light \u2013 individual photons \u2013 to increase transmission rates.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuilding a Quantum Network\n\nThe researchers will also be progressively building a quantum network to investigate the quantum internet of the future. Their work focuses on two crucial steps: storing quantum information in special quantum memories, and quantum entanglement of the memories. This will make it possible to implement quantum repeaters for the transmission of quantum information over long distances. Since entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum computers, such computers can be connected with one another in a quantum internet via optical transmission of the entanglement.\n\n\n\nTest Facility Part of Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence Initiative\n\nThe project is a key part of the infrastructure for the Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence initiative, in which researchers from KIT, Ulm University and the University of Stuttgart will design materials for future quantum technologies and focus on molecular quantum systems, a new field of quantum technology. In addition, the project plays an important role in the quantum repeater research conducted in the Quantenrepeater.Net (QR.N) joint project of Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and in the QuantumBW Innovation Campus.\n\n\n\nMore information\n\nDetailed caption: Opening of the fiber optic test facility at KIT: (from left to right) Prof. Sebastian Randel (KIT), Prof. Marc Weber (Head of Division B V, KIT), Prof. Oliver Kraft (Vice President Research, KIT), Prof. Mario Ruben (KIT), Prof. David Hunger (KIT) (Photo: Daryoush Djavadi)\n\n\n\nBeing \u201cThe Research University in the Helmholtz Association\u201d, KIT creates and imparts knowledge for the society and the environment. It is the objective to make significant contributions to the global challenges in the fields of energy, mobility, and information. For this, about 10,000 employees cooperate in a broad range of disciplines in natural sciences, engineering sciences, economics, and the humanities and social sciences. KIT prepares its 22,800 students for responsible tasks in society, industry, and science by offering research-based study programs. Innovation efforts at KIT build a bridge between important scientific findings and their application for the benefit of society, economic prosperity, and the preservation of our natural basis of life. KIT is one of the German universities of excellence."
