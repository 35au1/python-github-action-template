Learn More.\n\nGoogle is set to unleash the power of Gemini with upgraded capabilities when it launches Android 16 for the consumer market next year. In this version, the AI assistant becomes an agent that does things for the human user. A new API introduced to Google\u2019s Developers page allows the AI assistant to perform actions inside the phone\u2019s apps on behalf of the users, a huge improvement that can automate hundreds of daily phone activities.\n\nThe AI assistant will play a bigger role as it transitions to its next generation of becoming agentic, which uses reasoning and planning to solve complex problems on its own. When put in a smartphone, it could potentially revolutionize user experience.\n\nHeavy Speculation About Agentic AI\n\nGoogle released Android 16 for developers in November, sparking an air of mystery and speculation about the new feature for its AI assistant. The \u201capp function\u201d feature likely provides Gemini capabilities to automate daily phone activities with little to no human intervention.\n\nGoogle explains the \u201capp function\u201d as \u201ca specific piece of functionality that an app offers to the system,\u201d adding that \u201cthese functionalities can be integrated into various system features.\u201d It will let \u201capplications \u2026 execute functions they define.\u201d\n\nThis means Gemini can execute a specific function of an application when triggered or called upon by the system, as long as such a function is \u201cregistered and made available.\u201d In other words, Gemini can shop online using the phone\u2019s app with very little or no intervention from the user. For example, an \u201corderFood\u201d function lets the AI assistant do the job without the need for the user to open a food delivery service app to order pizza.\n\nGemini is currently the default AI assistant for most Android phones and devices. However, the upgraded Gemini would be more than just an AI assistant that interacts with phone apps and external services\u2014giving it the capacity to control the functions inside the applications on behalf of the phone\u2019s user adds a hefty measure of utility and power to smartphones."

            "article_content": "Apps infused with AI are being marketed to schools across the world and governments are rushing to embrace the technology, despite experts raising serious doubts.\n\nThe sector known as Ed Tech exploded during the Covid pandemic as schools closed to stop the spread of infection and millions of children were forced to learn in front of screens at home.\n\nAs demand dried up after schools reopened, Ed Tech startups tried to win back investment by adding AI to their products and marketing.\n\nTech titans like Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI have also spied an opportunity, promoting their AI products to schools or partnering with startups.\n\nWhile many education ministries have announced plans to deploy AI apps, there are plenty of dissenting voices.\n\nThe UN's education body UNESCO last year eviscerated the record of online learning during Covid, saying the rapid rollout of tech solutions was a \"tragedy\" that had increased inequality and worsened learning outcomes.\n\nUNESCO's Manos Antoninis told AFP that AI might have some utility in education but right now it \"seems to be creating more problems than it is solving\".\n\nHe cited concerns that companies were using data for commercial purposes, deployed biased algorithms and overall were less concerned with educational outcomes than with their bottom line.\n\n\"I think the unfortunate thing is that education has been used as a bit of a Trojan horse to access future consumers,\" he said.\n\nDuring the pandemic boom in 2021, venture capitalists pumped more than $17 billion into Ed Tech. But that has slumped to $3 billion this year, about the same as last year, according to analysts PitchBook.\n\nBut from North Carolina to South Korea it is a different story, where education officials have been encouraging teachers to use generative AI.\n\nBritain has already rolled out a homework app called Sparx Maths that uses algorithms to tailor children's learning.\n\nIt recently announced a further multimillion-dollar outlay on AI programmes to \"ease the pressure\" on hard-working teachers by helping with lesson plans, marking and assessment.\n\nThe European Union supports several learning apps, and several EU countries have experimented with them.\n\nChina is a huge booster of AI in the classroom and has a national strategy for digitising education -- its centrepiece being a national education platform of tools and online courses.\n\nYet the on-the-ground reality is often messy.\n\nIndia boasted one of the liveliest startup scenes in the sector during the pandemic, including a firm called BYJU's which was once the world's most valuable Ed Tech startup.\n\nYet when schools in New Delhi were forced to close because of smog last month, there were no flashy apps to help.\n\n\"It is not feasible for them to take online classes,\" 29-year-old teacher Vandana Pandey told AFP, saying many of her pupils had no smartphones or connectivity at home.\n\nBYJU's has faced allegations of financial misconduct and only narrowly avoided bankruptcy in a recent court hearing.\n\nIn richer countries, the arrival of AI has received a tepid reception.\n\nOnly six percent of US secondary school teachers polled by Pew Research Center in May thought using AI in education would do more good than harm.\n\nFrance announced it would roll out an AI-powered homework app called MIA in secondary schools earlier this year, but quietly dropped the project as a political crisis rumbled on.\n\nMany British parents are also not keen on Sparx Maths."

In three words: deep learning worked.\"\n\nAI is still a highly contentious piece of tech for millions across the globe.\n\nMany fear it will soon become too powerful with humans potentially being over reliant on the system.\n\nOthers have concerns over how it may affect various industries and workplaces if robots or chatbots could replace humans.\n\nEthics, privacy and misinformation worries are also some of the most common objections to the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\n4 The AI voice is described as 'merry and bright' and closely follows the speech patterns used by Hollywood depictions of old Saint Nick"

            "article_content": "MA Ganapathy (File photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: When laying hands on a book penned by a recently retired IPS officer, you would normally expect tales of gallantry, security strategy insights and, even better, some inside and juicy details of investigations into high-profile cases that can possibly generate enough media interest to get the memoirs flying off the shelves.But M A Ganapathy \u2014 who hung up his boots earlier this year after discharging key roles as DG, NSG and Uttarakhand DGP as well as earlier stints in the CBI, Union home ministry and Central police organisations \u2014 in his debut novel \u2018 Whispers in the Shadows \u2019, a collection of short stories , has chosen to go with the paranormal rather than normal. With the government of India having tightened rules to rein in bureaucrats\u2019 post-retirement \u201ckiss and tell\u201d memoirs, Ganapathy has steered clear of making his literary foray with a first-person account in James Bond-style and dabbled instead in Ruskin Bond \u2019s much-loved art of narrating \u2018spooky events and paranormal encounters \u2019 set in the woods and quaint Indian towns.Taking a cue from the Uttarakhand-based celebrity author, Ganapathy in \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 (mind you, not \u2018Whispers in the Corridors\u2019, which would anyday be a more awaited offering from an ex-bureaucrat), puts together hair-raising and captivating tales set in UP/Uttarakhand, Ganapathy a.k.a. Avinash\u2019s cadre state; his native home in the coffee haven of Coorg set in the Western Ghats; his alma mater JNU (not named in the book) and even his Central postings in CISF and as head of Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security (BCAS).It could thus not be more apt that \u2018the\u2019 Ruskin Bond himself introduces \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 on the cover as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.Ganpathy stars in and as Avinash, a protagonist he has cleverly created to narrate his rather frequent brushes with the supernatural. There are enough giveaways: Avinash, like Ganapathy, is a native of Coorg, or Kodagu. The stories \u2018Shriek in the Woods\u2019 and \u2018Babu\u2019s Hurricane Lamp\u2019 may remind you or your own childhood \u2014 the fear of Maths, walks from the school through the haunted woods and spooky stories fed to wide-eyed children by the househelps \u2014 and have a flash of R K Narayan\u2019s \u2018Swami\u2019 from Malgudi Days.Each of the tales has Avinash narrating his weird, ghostly, time-travel and post-death experiences in a lucid but captivating, edge-of-the-seat style. The book is a window to the life of a senior police officer who is trained to be fearless and rely on scientific evidence but who is also human enough to marvel at and embrace the unexplained, supernatural experiences along the way. So much so, Ganapathy made it a point to chronicle these chilling life incidents and produce a novel soon after he retired.The stories may be intriguing, sometimes rather incredible (particularly The Curious Case of Class of 1986, which sees Avinash travel through different realms of time), but they also carry a message. The ghosts and supernatural entities, including dead dogs, seem to help in solving knotty murder cases (The Uncanny Experience in Behta Village and Little Khairi Still Roams the Wilds), save lives (Do Miracles Really Happen Anymore and The Small Boy Who Loved Airports) and ensure that the forests and wildlife are protected (Bote Aiyappa of the Sacred Grove)."

These locations are usually fascinating places full of wonder, but sometimes they can hide something far more sinister.\n\nEvery now and then, a game can feature an eerie-looking place that hides an even more disturbing secret. Coming across a location like this can be pretty creepy on its own, but if you dare to delve deeper into its mysteries, the degree of fear can reach critical levels.\n\nAlthough a game you play may appear nice and innocent, it can also contain an unresolved murder mystery, a secret monster, or a terrifying story of cosmic proportions in its darkest and scariest corners.\n\nThe discovery of such a place can send you down a deep rabbit hole that will change your perspective on the world of the game and make you wonder if it really is what it claims to be.\n\nIf you're not afraid to poke around creepy places and uncover their dark secrets, the following list will pique your curiosity. Otherwise, you might want to steer clear of the locales and the mysteries we're about to unravel."

            "article_content": "Charming and ebullient, Ducotterd does not fit the stereotype of a research scientist. She grew up in Wigan, and her accent has survived long years abroad. Like many involved in dementia research, she has a personal connection to the disease. With a dentist father and social worker mother, Ducotterd initially planned to become a vet, but when she didn\u2019t get into veterinary school she studied biology at the University of Edinburgh instead. Around the same time, her grandmother\u2019s mental state began to decline.\n\n\u201cI was watching my granny start to buy food for people who didn\u2019t live with her anymore and forget big details about her life,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving that personal connection to the story made me so motivated by what I was doing in the lab. I thought: this is exactly what I want to do. Make medicines.\u201d She went on to a PhD at Newcastle. In the face of diminished neuroscience investment in the UK, she moved to Japan for a postdoctoral position studying Parkinson\u2019s disease. Later she worked at GSK in China and later at Eisai Pharmaceuticals in the USA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazingly global experience of drug discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be innovative you have to think differently. And the more different ways of thinking you have in your group, the more you\u2019re going to challenge each other.\u201d\n\nShe ended up staying in America for nine years, before moving back to the UK at the end of 2022, by which time she had acquired a husband and a daughter. While she had been away, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK had taken the lead in establishing new Drug Discovery Institutes at Oxford, Cambridge and in London, enabling them to function like biotech startups in a university setting, adding free-market pep to academic excellence.\n\nSince Ducotterd was an undergraduate, there has been revolutionary progress in neurodegenerative diseases, mostly driven by advances in computing.\n\n\u201cI went to university just after they\u2019d cloned Dolly the sheep,\u201d she says. \u201cThe molecular technologies have transformed the field \u2013 being able to sequence genomes in minutes rather than years; methods that let us do more rapid analysis of big data; artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe success of lecanemab, a drug that has been shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s progression by 30 per cent in early-stage patients (but which has yet to be approved on the NHS) has also energised the field by showing that progress is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never seen a trial that has shown we can slow the disease at all. It gives massive amounts of hope and investment because everyone now knows it is possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects she is particularly excited about involves leveraging human genetics to mimic natural resilience against dementia. \u201cThere is a really interesting study in a group in Holland where they\u2019re looking at people who live healthily into their hundreds cognitively,\u201d she says."

This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

This screengrab is taken from OpenAI's press demonstration of the generator posted on Monday. Image by OpenAI\n\nDec. 14 (UPI) -- OpenAI has launched Sora, a new video tool powered by artificial intelligence technology that has generated controversy in recent months. The Sora Turbo product, available since Monday, makes it much easier and faster for users to generate high-definition videos lasting up to 20 seconds. Advertisement\n\n\"We're introducing our video generation technology now to give society time to explore its possibilities and co-develop norms and safeguards that ensure it's used responsibly as the field advances,\" OpenAI said in an online announcement.\n\n\"We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories and push the boundaries of what's possible with video storytelling.\"\n\nUsers can use the A.I.-powered technology to incorporate existing digital information and extend, remix, blend or generate new content from text.\n\nA storyboard tool enables users to control the outcomes for every frame while adding text, images or video, and two community feeds provide new and continually updated content.\n\nOpenAI said it is blocking content that is illegal or otherwise highly controversial, such as child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes.\n\nStill, the app has faced criticism long before it was released to the public with some experts alarmed about how A.I.-generated video could be used and others concerned with legal issues regarding things like copyright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty artists who had early access to the Sora app in November opposed the Sora app in an open letter to OpenAI and accused the tech firm of using artists as a way to make the app appear more accepted among the global artist community.\n\n\"Artists are not your unpaid R&D,\" they said. \"We are not your free bug-testers, PR puppets, training data, validation tokens.\"\n\nThe artists addressed the open letter to \"A.I. corporate overlords\" and included a leaked code for Sora. Just weeks later, the company rolled out the product to the masses, possibly influenced by that leak.\n\n\"We are being lured into art-washing to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists,\" the artists had said.\n\nOpenAI in February announced the roll-out of the text-to-video Sora app as a follow-up to its ChatGPT chatbot tool for generating textual content.\n\nSora said artists would be part of its development team for the Sora app that is intended to compete with Meta's Make-a-Video tool, which was previewed by Facebook's parent in a 2022 white paper but has seemingly not been released to the public.\n\nAt the time, UPI reported that the success of Meta's model would be likely to spur an increase in investments by other companies into videos generated by A.I.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI in March also rolled out its A.I. tool called Voice Engine, which can clone someone's voice after hearing several seconds of audio. The company has said Voice Engine can help people who have lost their voices and be used in other beneficial ways."

Musk, meanwhile, was originally a co-founder at OpenAI before eventually splitting from the company, starting rival xAI, and taking legal action that includes seeking an injunction to stop its transition into a for-profit. (Zilis is also a plaintiff in Musk\u2019s lawsuit.)\n\nOpenAI responded by publishing emails and texts from Musk and arguing that \u201che should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom.\u201d"

In a community update, the company introduced the new Parent Code feature that will block kids from accessing user profiles for adults in their household.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt is an opt-in feature that needs to be enabled manually. Once activated, this code will be required if kids want to access a profile meant for other members of their family. Moreover, they will also be prompted to enter the code if they want to access the video platform without any Google account signed in.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nGoing a step further, the team will also require the parent code if an individual attempts to remove an account from the shared TV. YouTube has also clarified that enabling the new feature won\u2019t affect other devices on which the same account is being used.\n\nIn order to enable the Parent code feature, follow this path:\n\nIn the YouTube app installed on your TV, navigate to the Settings page. You will see a dedicated Parent Code tab in the Settings dashboard. Go through the on-screen prompts and set up the four-digit Parent Code. In order to disable the safety feature, you need to enter the same code in the future.\n\nDo keep in mind that once you remove the parent code, anyone can enjoy YouTube sans any age restrictions for content and without having to sign up with a Google account. Moreover, all user profiles belonging to adult members will be openly accessible.\n\nThe latest safety-focused feature update from YouTube is actually a corrective measure on the company\u2019s end. Earlier this year, Google pulled away the separate YouTube Kids app icon in the YouTube experience for TVs and smart devices.\n\nInstead, the profiles for kids and adults were all clubbed together under the \u201cWho\u2019s watching\u201d launch banner. \u201cNow, you can easily select your child\u2019s profile from within the YouTube app, and you\u2019ll be brought right into the new YouTube Kids experience on TV,\u201d the company reasoned back then.\n\nHowever, it seems that not all parents and guardians were happy with the move, apparently because it makes it far easier for kids to access other user profiles that show content without any age restrictions. Locking non-kids profiles behind a passcode is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Parent Code feature on YouTube is now rolling out and will start appearing for all users within the next few days."

This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

According to Sci. News, Dulcibella camanchaca is the first large, active predatory amphipod creature found in the deep-sea zone.\n\nThe creature was discovered in Atacama Trench, or the Peru-Chile Trench. It is one of the most geographically isolated hadal features of the ocean. The rare living creature lacked \u201cpigmented eyes\u201d, displayed \u201capparent gigantism\u201d, and surprisingly used to feed other creatures, revealed a research published in Systematics and Biodiversity.\n\nAlso Read | A Nobel for Google DeepMind is a tribute to how AI can transform drug discovery\n\nRare creature named darkness Researches coined the genus name Dulcibella, which was inspired by Dulcinea del Toboso. Its second name, camanchaca, has been derived from a term which means \u2018darkness\u2019 in local South American languages.\n\nSee pics of the rare creature The new predatory amphipod was discovered around 7,902 metres below the sea in Atacama Trench.\n\nImage of the creature discovered in deep-ocean\n\nThe creature had a 'gigantic' structure compared to other creatures found in the hadal zone\n\nUnlike all the other creatures discovered in hadal zone, this one is a predator and feeds on other living creatures.\n\nThe new creature was discovered last year during an Integrated Deep-Ocean Observing System (IDOOS) Expedition aboard the R/V Abate Molina.\n\nThe discovery belongs to a new genus too The DNA and morphology data of the species point out that the newly-discovered creature belongs to a new genus. Which highlights the scope of further such discoveries in the Atacama Trench which can be assumed as an endemic hotspot.\n\nAlso Read | NASA unveils surprising discovery after opening cannister of asteroid Bennu\n\nScientists discovered four dulcibella camanchaca individuals at a depth of 7,902 m using a lander vehicle, which is an untethered platform used for carrying scientific equipment, including baited traps, to and from the ocean floor.\n\n\u201cThis study\u2019s collaborative effort and integrative approach confirmed Dulcibella camanchaca as a new species and highlight ongoing biodiversity discoveries in the Atacama Trench,\u201d Sci.news quoted Dr. Carolina Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Instituto Milenio de Oceanograf\u00eda."

            "date": "22h",
            "source": "AOL",
            "article_content": "With 2025 approaching, it's time to start thinking about what stocks to add to your portfolio. While I'm a proponent of a well-diversified portfolio, I see a lot of potential in the tech realm right now, especially with how big artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming.\n\nIf you're looking for a shopping list of stocks to buy in 2025, here's a solid bunch of 10 to pick from.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nIf I had to buy just one stock from this list for 2025, I'd pick Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semi is the world's leading contract chip manufacturer and makes chips for nearly every company that produces anything related to high technology or AI.\n\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to triple this year, and there's slim chance of that demand slowing down heading into 2025. With Wall Street expecting 25% revenue growth in 2025, I'd expect Taiwan Semi's stock to excel next year.\n\nLastly, Taiwan Semi's stock isn't that expensive, trading for 22 times 2025 earnings. When you consider how important this company is, alongside its growth rate and reasonable price tag, it makes for a top stock to own in 2025.\n\n2. ASML\n\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is similar to Taiwan Semi in that it's an important supplier in the chip value stream. ASML makes lithography machines that nobody else in the world has the technology to make, giving it a technological monopoly.\n\nHowever, this also causes problems as its machines are highly regulated, and most cannot be sold in China. As a result, management slashed 2025 revenue guidance, which caused the stock to tumble, and it is now down for the year.\n\nThis short-term weakness should be seen as a buying opportunity, as ASML's tech is likely impossible to duplicate or catch up to, so it will be all right over the long term. Even with the guide down, Wall Street analysts still expect 15% growth next year, making ASML a great stock to buy now.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is probably better known by its former name, Facebook. This social media giant generates a ton of revenue and profits from ad sales, but it's also involved in the AI race.\n\nMeta's generative AI model, Llama, is the leading open-source AI model, making it a popular option for those who want visibility into what is actually happening behind the scenes. If Llama can become the top open-source AI model, it will collect vast amounts of information faster than other platforms that users must pay for, potentially opening up avenues for a paid version.\n\nStill, that kind of success is a ways off, and right now, investors must base their analysis on the company's ad division, which is doing incredibly well. Wall Street expects 21% revenue growth for 2024 and 15% for 2025. With strong growth in hand, Meta is set to have a strong 2025, with AI potentially another tailwind that has yet to meaningfully contribute to the business.\n\n4. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another company heavily involved in the AI race. Its Google Gemini model is one of the leading options, and it can be further maximized by being deployed through Google Cloud, the company's cloud computing wing.\n\nGoogle Cloud grew by 35% in Q3 and is rapidly improving its operating margin. Although this segment makes up a fraction of Alphabet's total revenue, it is one of the most exciting parts of its business and will drive it to market-beating growth.\n\nWith the stock trading recently for 25 times forward earnings, Alphabet is attractively priced compared to many of its big tech peers.\n\n5. Amazon\n\nAmazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) investment thesis is similar to Alphabet's. It has a thriving primary business (in Amazon's case, an e-commerce empire), but the cloud computing division is the primary reason to buy the stock.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) made up 17% of revenue in Q3, but its operating profits made up 60% of the company's total. As a result, AWS heavily steers the company's profit picture. With AWS growing at a healthy 19% clip in Q3 and no signs of AI-related growth slowing down, it's primed to push Amazon higher in 2025.\n\n6. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) may be a bit of a controversial stock to include on this list. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that gained a wider profile after a July 19 outage that crashed millions of devices. The effects of the crash are still being sorted, but that doesn't mean the company isn't strong. CEO George Kurtz has stated the company's customer pipeline has returned to pre-incident levels, so the overall effect hasn't been too bad.\n\nIn its last quarter (which encompasses a full quarter after the incident), annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased by 27% year over year to more than $4 billion, which is well on its way to achieving its goal of $10 billion in ARR.\n\nCRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCRWD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nCrowdStrike is a top cybersecurity provider; even a bit of a stumble wasn't enough to derail the company. Although the stock is a bit pricey, I think it's worth it for the growth that it's putting up.\n\n7. dLocal\n\ndLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) is a far more obscure company than any on this list. It provides a plug-in to anyone wanting to process payments in emerging market countries, unlocking access to parts of the world that wouldn't make financial sense without dLocal's services. Its client list includes giants like Amazon, Spotify Technology, and Shopify, demonstrating that its product fills an important niche.\n\ndLocal is undergoing a transformation as new CEO Pedro Arnt takes over after a 12-year stint at MercadoLibre. He led an incredibly successful business there and has the blueprint to kick-start dLocal's growth again.\n\nWith the stock trading for a mere 25 times forward earnings despite its profit margin being well off its previous highs, this stock has incredible value.\n\n8. PayPal\n\nSpeaking of incredible values, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is still a fairly cheap stock. The payment processing giant has gone through ups and downs but is currently on the rise, thanks to CEO Alex Chriss, who has been in the role for just over a year.\n\nPayPal isn't putting up the flashiest growth, with revenue rising 6% year over year in Q3 and earnings per share (EPS) rising about 6% as well. However, the company is diligently working to grow its business segments and using its cash to repurchase shares at a cheap price.\n\nPYPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nPYPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nAlthough the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be, trading at 19 times forward earnings, it's still a pretty big bargain, especially considering that the S&P 500 trades at 22.5 times forward earnings. As a result, I think PayPal still has plenty of room for upside, and it could be the turnaround story of the year in 2025.\n\n9. MercadoLibre\n\nNext is MercadoLibre. The Latin American e-commerce and fintech giant has continuously posted incredible results year after year.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, MercadoLibre's revenue rose more than 100% in Q3, showing its impressive platform. Although the company fell on a bit of a rough patch in Q3 as it dealt with some bad debt in its credit portfolio, that is a quarter-to-quarter problem that will pop up from time to time.\n\nAlthough the stock isn't cheap at 56 times forward earnings, its strong and sustainable growth justifies that price tag. As a result, I think it's a phenomenal stock to buy in 2025.\n\n10. Nvidia\n\nLast but certainly not least is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia has led the market each of the past two years, but I don't expect it to do it again in 2025. However, with the largest AI players and cloud computing providers still building their computing power, Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) sales remain primed to benefit.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, which offers massive performance gains over the current Hopper architecture, will reach full-scale production in 2025, further boosting Nvidia's revenue.\n\nDespite Nvidia's massive growth over the past two years, Wall Street still expects its revenue to rise 51% next year. That's enough to justify Nvidia's price tag for me, and I think it's a solid buy heading into 2025. Just don't expect it to repeat 2023's or 2024's performance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "article_content": "To capitalise on this potential, companies should assess their current technology stack and identify B2B functionality gaps\n\nIndia's online B2B marketplaces have the potential to reach $200 Bn by 2030\n\nIndian businesses seeking growth beyond traditional methods are increasingly adopting B2B marketplace models. This approach offers expansion opportunities without the risks associated with conventional strategies. For executives and technology leaders aiming to implement or refine a B2B marketplace, grasping the nuances of this model is paramount.\n\nIndia\u2019s online B2B marketplaces have the potential to reach $200 Bn by 2030, based on the latest projections from the Economic Diplomacy Division of IndBiz. This growth stems from key technological advancements reshaping B2B interactions. As India progresses with its Digital India initiative, B2B marketplaces will play an increasingly significant role in the country\u2019s digital economy.\n\nTechnological Foundations For B2B Marketplaces\n\nAPI-first architecture stands at the forefront, enabling seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. This approach creates a unified ecosystem where data moves effortlessly between the marketplace, ERP systems, CRMs, and other mission-critical software.\n\nMicroservices architecture complements this shift, allowing businesses to adapt swiftly to market changes and scale functionalities independently.\n\nAdvanced marketplaces often rely on cloud-native solutions to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and reliability. This is particularly relevant for B2B platforms handling high transaction volumes and intricate business logic. Cloud infrastructure facilitates the implementation of AI and machine learning technologies, which are increasingly applied to predictive analytics in inventory management, product recommendations, and fraud detection.\n\nEmerging trends such as blockchain integration for supply chain transparency, IoT devices for real-time inventory tracking, and voice-activated ordering systems for hands-free procurement are set to further advance the B2B landscape.\n\nKey Features Driving B2B Excellence\n\nModern B2B marketplaces require sophisticated features to meet complex buyer and seller needs. A multi-tier pricing engine is indispensable, accommodating customer-specific pricing, volume-based discounts, and market-driven dynamic pricing. This pricing flexibility allows businesses to remain competitive while maintaining profitability.\n\nConfigurable approval workflows are equally significant. B2B transactions often involve multiple stakeholders and intricate approval processes. Implementing role-based access control with customisable approval chains allows marketplaces to align with clients\u2019 organisational structures, streamlining operations and reducing purchase friction.\n\nThe efficacy of a B2B marketplace hinges on its ability to help buyers locate products efficiently. This necessitates an advanced search and filtering system with faceted search capabilities, custom attributes, and technical specification filters.\n\nIn the B2B sector, where purchases are often highly specific and technical, the ability to pinpoint exact product specifications significantly impacts user satisfaction and conversion rates.\n\nA comprehensive quote management system is another critical feature. The capability to handle requests for quotes (RFQs) with integrated negotiation tools and CRM system connectivity can significantly improve the sales process. This is particularly relevant in industries with complex, customised products or services where standard pricing may not apply.\n\nReal-time inventory visibility across multiple warehouses or suppliers is indispensable. In B2B transactions, where large orders and just-in-time delivery are common, accurate inventory information is critical. Advanced systems should support backorder and pre-order management, providing businesses with the flexibility to meet varied customer requirements.\n\nBest Practices And Considerations\n\nImplementing these advanced features requires adherence to proven best practices. Data migration and cleansing is a critical process often underestimated in its complexity. A comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is necessary to ensure consistent data across the marketplace, particularly when consolidating information from multiple legacy systems or integrating various supplier databases.\n\nPerformance optimisation significantly impacts success. Employing caching strategies, content delivery networks (CDNs), and lazy loading techniques ensures swift page loads, even for extensive product catalogues.\n\nIn B2B transactions, where buyers often review detailed technical specifications, performance directly influences user satisfaction and sales outcomes.\n\nThe increasing trend of mobile usage in B2B transactions, particularly in the Indian market, cannot be overlooked. A mobile-first approach using responsive design and progressive enhancement techniques is necessary to cater to B2B buyers who prefer mobile transactions.\n\nLocalisation is a critical consideration, especially in India\u2019s diverse market. Supporting multiple languages and currencies is fundamental. Adherence to regional tax regulations, such as India\u2019s GST system, is crucial for compliance and building user trust.\n\nB2B marketplaces require stringent security measures due to high-value transactions and sensitive data. Multi-factor authentication, SSL encryption, and regular security audits should be standard. In an era of increasing cyber threats, demonstrating a strong commitment to security can be a significant differentiator in the B2B space.\n\nReal-World Applications And Future Outlook\n\nB2B marketplace implementations have yielded impressive results across various industries. In the food distribution sector, companies have successfully digitalised their B2B operations by developing specialised platforms for different customer segments.\n\nBy implementing flexible pricing systems and integrating with existing ERPs, these businesses have achieved round-the-clock order placement capabilities, reduced operational costs, and expanded their customer bases.\n\nIn the wholesale distribution space, companies have optimised operations by creating self-service portals with custom catalogues and pricing. Automating quote-to-order processes and implementing advanced analytics for personalised product recommendations has led to significant reductions in order processing times and increases in average order values.\n\nA prime example of the transformative power of B2B marketplaces comes from one of our customers, a food distribution company in Europe. They have highlighted two major benefits of shifting to B2B online ordering:\n\nReduced Cost Per Order : B2B businesses are encouraged to calculate their cost per order, factoring in all necessary expenses such as agents, devices, petrol, and consumables. They proudly report that they have decreased their cost per order by over 50% through the implementation of their B2B marketplace. Impact On Average Order Value (AOV) And Product Quantity : A positive outcome identified is that customers, when presented with a digital catalog, are discovering and ordering from more product categories compared to traditional ordering methods. This contrasts with the tendency of sales agents to focus on replenishing products that customers typically buy.\n\nFurthermore, owning the digital customer relationship has emerged as a key factor in the B2B marketplace model. The customer data gathered through these platforms is an invaluable asset. For instance, owning a network of 50,000 restaurant customers can drive significant GMV growth in a marketplace model as the category offer expands.\n\nThis is because customers tend to consolidate their ordering processes, preferring to use a single platform for multiple product categories.\n\nThe B2B marketplace model presents a significant opportunity for Indian businesses to overcome growth constraints and expand their reach. To capitalise on this potential, companies should assess their current technology stack and identify B2B functionality gaps.

But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like ?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists , who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets , or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2014 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition , and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution vs Natural Selection - YouTube Watch On\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life .\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures , which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions . Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal . They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2014 biological or not \u2014 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information . As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection .\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. CC BY) (Image credit: Doug Bowman\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory , natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife .\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth . A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon , which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules \u2014 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable . As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution . As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite , a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization , such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures .\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road , not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it \u2014 for life as we don't know it, all bets are off."

To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThe neutron scattering experiment was performed on a highly specialized spectrometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France, allowing us to obtain extremely high-resolution data,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNeutron scattering is a well-established tool in analyzing the behavior of spins in magnets,\u201d added Andriy Nevidomskyy, associate professor of physics and astronomy at Rice, who conducted a theoretical analysis of the acquired data. \u201cIt is challenging, however, to develop an unambiguous \u2018smoking gun\u2019 signature that would prove the material harbors a quantum spin liquid,\" he added.\n\nIn our current understanding of quantum mechanics, electrons possess a property known as spin. This means that they behave in a manner akin to tiny bar magnets.\n\nWhen electrons interact, their \"spins\" align or anti-align (align in the opposite direction). However, this alignment/anti-alignment can be disrupted in some materials, like pyrochlores.\n\nThis is called \u201cmagnetic frustration\" and can lead to conditions where, the researchers say, quantum mechanics can be created in interesting ways, like the creation of quantum spin liquids. Yet, despite the name, this phenomenon can manifest in various states of matter, including solids.\n\nTalking quantum particles\n\nThe effect is so significant, the researchers explained, that electrons can form quantum mechanical superposition that results in fluidlike correlations between electron spins as if the spins are immersed in a liquid.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt a quantum level, the electrons interact with one another by emitting and reabsorbing quanta of light known as photons. Similarly, in a quantum spin liquid, the interaction between spinons is described in terms of exchanging lightlike quanta,\u201d said Nevidomskyy.\n\nThe team explained that these spinons could even \"talk\" to each other by exchanging waves similar to light but much slower. This interaction is somewhat like how electrons exchange photons in the quantum theory of light.\n\n\"After this discovery, it is all the more exciting to search for evidence of monopolelike particles in a toy universe formed out of electron spins in a piece of material,\u201d said Nevidomskyy.\n\nThe team is now looking for other exotic particles, like \"visons,\" which could act like magnetic monopoles\u2014a theoretical idea from decades ago. These discoveries could deepen our understanding of the universe and how matter works at the smallest scales.\n\nYou can view the study for yourself in the journal Nature Physics."
