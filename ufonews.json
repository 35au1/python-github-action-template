            "article_content": "We need less uproar over everyday drones and more critical attention about ones near airports and other restricted airspace\n\nDecember\u2019s spate of drone sightings seen in New Jersey and spreading nationwide, sure looks familiar. As does its associated media frenzy\u2014culminating in memes and conspiracy theories about so-called \u201cmystery drones.\u201d The episode bears an eerie resemblance to the UFO phenomenon, or the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) one, that spiked in recent years and has led to significant congressional attention and legislation.\n\nIn a way, this is progress. The reason this outbreak looks so familiar is that such drone sightings would previously have been identified as UAP ones. It\u2019s only after years of concerted efforts in education, and transparency by U.S. Department of Defense officials, that UAP sightings have rightfully evolved into common drone identification. That is not to say that the drone sightings are any less of a concern, but fortunately, we can address them without the contagion of the UFO community and the conspiracies associated with it.\n\nUnfortunately, our response has been no less irrational.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nA New Jersey state assemblyman has accused federal officials of \u201clying to us\u201d about drones on CNN. The president-elect suggested we \u201cshoot them down!!!\u201d which is almost (but only almost, sadly) needless to say, a bad idea. So is wasting resources to investigate nonsensical notions of advanced technology related to Iran or, again, aliens. Calls for shooting objects down not only have obvious safety issues but fail to recall that Congress and the White House limited such strikes over U.S. territory after the incidents involving the Chinese high-altitude balloon and other balloons, based on concerns about civilian safety.\n\nThere are a couple of things we need to make clear about the drone sightings. First, many of the sightings remain mistaken interpretations of manned aircraft or satellites such as Starlink ones. The real drone sightings fall into two classes: those that are in restricted airspace, and those that are in legal airspace. Restricted airspace surrounds airports as well as national security areas such as Air Force and Navy bases. Most sightings reported fall within the latter category and have been assessed as having no immediate national security or flight safety risk, although the public finds them annoying.\n\nOne fact that many people tend to overlook, or at least don\u2019t readily rationalize, is that these drones have lights on them. That lights are present on various flying objects including drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) is a fact I often referred to in my last job, heading a Pentagon office investigating UAP sightings. Lights on a drone are for collision avoidance. They are a safety feature. Flying drones with lights ensures they can be seen; if they were meant to be unnoticed, the operators would turn off or disable the lights. In September 2023, the FAA changed the rules to allow drones to fly at night this way, and this is likely a contributing factor to the increase in sightings. The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.\n\nCongressional officials and that unfortunate source of information, social media, continue to make unfounded claims of drone technologies far ahead of U.S. capabilities. The most recent example being the assertion that drones flew from an Iranian mother ship off the coast of the U.S. and demonstrated seven or eight hours of battery life. That fantastic assertion requires there to be evidence that the drones originated from an Iranian ship and were tracked continuously to the U.S. cities. There are no such tracks. The more rational explanation is that they originated near the place of the sighting, that is from domestic operators.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean some drone operations aren\u2019t ill-intentioned.\n\nSeveral hypotheses (apart from mistaken identity) might explain these drones in legal airspace. They might be academic, professional or hobbyist domestic operators exploring a new technology. YouTube overflows with drone footage from amateur photographers all over the world. Flying in urban settings, in legal airspace, for photography or maybe even some research such as high resolution thermal or pollution measurements is very plausible. Or they are commercial. Increased commercial activity is unavoidable as industry advances drone technology for delivery, remote sensing and communications.\n\nMore concerning, operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace. Whether foreign or domestic bad actors, they could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is. That information on reactions and response could readily feed back to some sort of attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.\n\nFinally, the operators could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic. It could be for personal gain (such as claiming they have the anti-UAV solution to sell), or perhaps advertising something resembling another History Channel series on aliens.\n\nMuch like the UAP problem, there is little evidence to support, or rule out, any of these hypotheses. Like UAP, the drones don\u2019t likely all have the same explanation. That makes it hard from a national security perspective to distinguish when a sighting is benign versus potentially nefarious. Lest we forget the lessons of the ongoing war on Ukraine, we don\u2019t want to be caught in an intelligence or technical surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, the sightings that are clearly in restricted airspace usually have more obvious intentions. These can range from benign to nefarious, but generally center around seeing things that are normally not allowed. Whether this is military aircraft, commercial airports or operations, these clearly identified drones and balloons with payloads pose not only a security risk but also a flight safety risk. It would only take one small quad copter to get sucked into a commercial jet engine to end in tragedy.\n\nThe proliferation of drone technology, in its commercial, recreational, scientific and military uses, is clearly disrupting the world around us. Our legislation and regulation have created an environment that allows for legal drone usage. It should come as no surprise then that drones are in the air and increasing. Yet here we are, once again with more extraordinary claims, public demands for transparency, baseless accusations of hiding the truth, and congressional calls for more legislation over a mystery in the sky, instead of a rational scientific approach to the investigation. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nA man who says he spent over 25 years in the military recently described his terrifying encounter with a bright UFO he saw while camping in California. During the course of describing the harrowing event, he said it was like nothing he had ever experienced before.\n\nHe described the UFO as being 20 to 30 feet in length and 8 to 10 feet in height. He also stated that the mysterious craft was oval-shaped, emitted a white light, and got to within 100 yards of his campsite in Mountain Center, Calif.\n\n\u201cAt approximately 11:00 p.m. I was laying in the tarped bed of my truck in the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites at about 7,800 foot elevation,\u201d the military veteran wrote in his report that was submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). \u201cI was the only camper/hunter in the area that night and it was pitch black out.\n\n\u201cInstantly, everything (all natural animal/insect noises) went completely silent and the entire area lit up brighter than the brightest full moon I\u2019ve ever seen. But I knew it wasn\u2019t the moon because I had already located the moon prior to that and it was a dimly lit waning gibbous.\n\n\u201cThinking a really quiet truck was pulling into the campground with its headlights on, I peeked out from under the tarp and saw a stationary, bright white light, about 20-30 foot in length (about the size of a medium sized helicopter but with the light encompassing the entire object), hovering at tree top level, behind an about 30-40 foot tall pine tree, only about 100 yards away. It made absolutely no noise, didn\u2019t pulsate or move, and did not radiate any sort of heat (it was about 40 degrees Fahrenheit that evening).\n\n\u201cI observed it for at least a minute before fear took over and I sank back down into the bed of my truck and into my sleeping bag. Therefore I have no idea what it did or where it moved after that. I must\u2019ve fell asleep and didn\u2019t come back out of my sleeping bag until approximately 2:30 a.m., drenched in sweat, at which time it was gone, and everything was pitch black again.\n\n\u201cI was completely sober and not tired nor sleep deprived at the time of this sighting. I stayed the next night at the same campsite (only because I didn\u2019t recall this incident until two days later) and did not experience any further bright lights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no expert tracker, but I did not notice any out of the ordinary tracks or signs in the vicinity of the sighting over the next two days. I\u2019ve backpacked/hunted the backcountry routinely for the past 15 years, spent over 25 years in the military, and I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this before.\u201d\n\nThis military veteran\u2019s story has gained credence recently due to the numerous unexplained drone slash UFO sightings that have been taking place all over the United States.\n\nIn addition to the widely-publicized drone sightings over New Jersey, there have also been reports made in Ohio, in San Diego County and other parts of Southern California, over Bowie, Maryland, and at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nOn top of those strange witness reports, RadarOnline.com recently obtained new photos and video of some of the suspected drones that have been terrorizing residents around Staten Island.\n\nThe media outlet also reports similar sightings have been reported in Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts. Those drone sightings and many others are now being tracked by an interactive map published by DailyMail.com."

            "article_content": "Most people, when they think about AI, focus on applications such as image generation or chatbots. But as we're starting to learn, there is so much more to artificial intelligence than these simple tools.\n\nAs well as the high-specification AI products, which help with science, deep research and other heavyweight needs, AI is also extremely useful in the softer sciences.\n\nOur existence is made up of relationships \u2014 work, family, friendships, they're all part of the important mix of life. So let's take a quick look and see how our computerized friend can help us navigate the tricky waters around our important social activities.\n\nIt's important to remember, however, that AI will never be a substitute for real-life engagement or professional guidance. This is just an example of how you can use AI, not professional advice.\n\n1. Communications\n\nSo much of the hard work relating to relationships comes from simply navigating communications. It's no surprise that large language models, which are the bedrock of today's AI, excel at language. We can use this ability to significantly improve our interactions.\n\nA growing number of people use their chatbot as a sounding board, to ask for advice on how to deal with tricky communications. Things said or unsaid.\n\nA simple tool is to give ChatGPT something you plan to send to a friend, loved one or even a colleague and ask: \"Can I phrase this better?\"\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n2. Conflict resolution\n\nInterview roleplay with GPT-4o voice and vision - YouTube Watch On\n\nOne of the sad but true facts about relationships is the fact that they involve a fair amount of conflict in one way or another. Chatbots can offer feedback on tricky episodes, as well as suggestions for how to overcome certain positions.\n\nEven asking simple questions about how to apologize, or requesting help with mediation is a valuable way to use the power of AI language.\n\nFor those who need something a little more structured, the Flamme app may be a worthwhile investment. It offers a wide range of options and is available on iPhone and Android. Essentially, it offers advice on interacting with your partner every day including tips and information.\n\n3. Mental Health\n\nAgain, this is not advice, merely a list of tips and apps you can use with AI.\n\nThere's a growing palette of AI tools being deployed for mental health applications. These cover the range from simple mood apps, which check your current state of mind and help to improve it, to deep therapy products which are designed to work alongside professional mental health services.\n\nOne such tool is Youper, which is a CBT chatbot designed to help people with emotional issues. Always check with medical professionals.\n\n4. Organizational tool\n\nA lot of the negative issues arising out of relationships come from simple bad planning. Forgetting appointments, losing track of obligations or simply not contributing our share to a workload. Again AI can come to the rescue through the use of a variety of tools to help manage these kinds of daily demands.\n\nThe free Trevor AI app is one such example amongst many. It combines an AI assistant with an organizer, to-do list manager and more.\n\n5. Social skills aid\n\nHave you ever wished you were more socially adept? You're not alone, millions of people across the world feel like they fail to cope with basic social skills. We can use artificial intelligence to help practice these skills, because they can be learned just like any other skill.\n\nRole-playing, active listening sessions and empathy exercises are all part of the things we can use to improve ourselves.\n\nThere are a number of commercial apps which can be used for this purpose, although many are just wrappers for the standard AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic and the rest. It's probably just as valid to use a standard chatbot in the first instance.\n\n6. Memory aid\n\nIt pays to remember the simple things in our relationships. Even banal issues like forgetting birthdays or anniversaries can be a cause of conflict and discord.\n\nBy using AI technology to manage our memory, calendar or even alarm clock, we can encourage smooth sailing in every way.\n\nSetting reminders for gift ideas is a very quick win. This type of feature is likely to become more common in standard AI models as the memory functions improve over time.\n\n7. General relationships\n\nIt may sound a little excessive, but by using an AI advisor to help us with relationship expectations at the beginning of an important life journey, we can proactively prevent issues down the line.\n\nWe can also use AI to help us with cultural and language gaps which may occur in our personal interactions.\n\nFinally, using AI to help with relationship goal setting in a collaborative way can be very useful. By working together on these kinds of tasks, we can probably strengthen the depth of our connection in subtle but important ways."

Assuming it doesn't join the Killed by Google graveyard, it has the potential to change the XR landscape. But the actual devices will come from partners like Samsung.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta Horizon OS\n\nThe XR Goliath to beat\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta is best known for its Quest headsets, but its Meta Horizon OS is available to third-party partners, giving them access to the Quest gaming library, Meta AI, and an interface that's been tweaked and improved across a ton of updates. It has the edge for gaming and its sales foothold but lacks Google's access to millions of apps.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might think it's premature to compare Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS, given that we won't see any Android XR headsets until 2025 at the earliest. But based on everything Google has explained about Android XR's features, hardware, and software, it's remarkable how similar these two operating systems will be.\n\nUnlike Apple with its productivity-focused Vision Pro, Google and Samsung have said they intend to make gaming a central tenet of Android XR, meaning they'll have to challenge gaming headsets like the Meta Quest 3S.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, Google's software plans for XR headsets, AR glasses, and smart glasses all directly oppose Meta, the established or aspiring rival in each category. The big question will be whether Google is willing to lose billions on XR development the way Meta has been or if it'll kill Android XR like so many other initiatives if it's unprofitable.\n\nWe should see a major influx of VR headsets and smart glasses from Google and Meta's partners, running either Android XR or Meta Horizon OS. We'll be following developments closely for both, but if you're weighing buying your next XR purchase for gaming, productivity, or development, this guide will run through what to expect with either operating system.\n\nAndroid XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Hardware and controls\n\nMeta Quest headsets depend on Snapdragon chips, optimized to run graphics-heavy programs and a dozen sensors or cameras at once. Meta itself said that the Snapdragon XR2 series is \"tightly integrated with our software and hardware stacks\" and that Horizon OS partners will benefit from their \"long-term partnership with Qualcomm.\"\n\nGoogle also \"collaborated\" directly with Qualcomm when designing Android XR, which is unsurprising given its specialization in the XR space. It specifically declared the Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 as the backbone behind upcoming Android XR headsets. Qualcomm will make its Snapdragon Spaces XR platform fully compatible with Android XR, and they are \"focused on helping to build and scale the Android XR ecosystem.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe expect the performance level for Google and Meta headsets (or their partner brands) to be very similar and dependent upon which generation of Snapdragon SoC they use. The main differences will come down to specific partners' hardware choices, like the cameras, controllers, and amount of RAM.\n\nA Meta Quest 3S headset with its default cloth strap on a wood floor\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on everything Google has said or shown about Android XR, the operating system can support controller tracking, hand tracking, eye tracking, and voice-controlled commands. So, any given Android XR headset or glasses could ship without controllers and rely solely on pinching and showing information where you're looking; otherwise, they can support proper gaming controllers. It's all up to the OEM.\n\nMeta supports all of these controller options through the Meta Horizon OS. It hasn't offered eye tracking on a headset since the defunct Quest Pro, but we suspect Meta may re-add eye tracking to the Quest 4 since Apple and Google are both making it a point of emphasis.\n\nThere isn't too much else to say about hardware until we try Samsung's Project Moohan or Google's smart glasses for ourselves. Meta's Quest headsets are well known for their strengths \u2014 affordability, lightweight and wireless design, reliable tracking \u2014 and weaknesses \u2014 battery life and the need for comfort upgrades.\n\nAndroid XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Partnerships\n\nAn official concept image of a potential Meta Horizon OS VR headset\n\nMeta Horizon OS has changed its name a couple of times (starting with Oculus), but it's the proprietary OS behind its Quest headsets. In April 2024, Meta opened up Horizon OS to third parties, announcing that Lenovo and ASUS ROG would make a productivity and gaming headset, respectively, with the same OS and software as first-party Quests. Meta also intends to make a Quest \"inspired by Xbox\" in partnership with Microsoft. We don't know yet when these devices will arrive.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBased on our demo with the Meta Orion AR glasses and our time wearing the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, they share many of the same OS tools and AI tricks as the Quest headsets. So, we think it's fair to lump them into the same Meta Horizon OS umbrella.\n\nWhile Meta took years to open up its system to others, Google is making Android XR available to other brands from the start without its own (public) hardware plans. Google developed Android XR in tandem with Samsung, which will sell its mixed-reality headset \u2014 codenamed Project Moohan \u2014 in 2025. Google has its own smart glasses prototype, but we don't know if they'll ever be available to consumers.\n\nAn official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset\n\nGoogle also has other partners who plan to sell Android XR devices: Xreal, Sony, and Lynx. Sony already announced its mixed-reality headset at CES 2024, and Xreal previously hinted that it intended to make its glasses compatible with a multimodal AI on your phone, meaning Google Gemini.\n\nGoogle has explicitly said Android XR will work for AR and smart glasses. Meta announced Horizon OS as \"our open mixed reality ecosystem\" and did not mention glasses, so it may not intend to share its software with anyone targeting this form factor \u2014 or at least not yet.\n\nAndroid XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Software, games, and apps\n\nViewing my living room in mixed reality as a starship in Starship Home through the lenses of a Meta Quest 3S\n\nMeta regularly updates its devices with new software features, but it does so by device: the Meta Quest is on v72 as of December 2024, while the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are on v11. It's not clear how Meta will handle feature updates for third-party headsets, but it is clear that they update things quickly rather than wait for annual updates.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt's also fair to point out that Meta's software is highly focused on gaming. It has a few 2D progressive web apps (PWAs) since it can't use traditional App or Play Store apps, but only a few big-name apps like YouTube, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and a few streaming apps with basic VR theater modes. For the most part, you'll be spending your time in the Quest browser.\n\nOn the gaming front, every VR or MR developer focuses on the Quest first and foremost since that's where the money is. Our best Quest games list and the upcoming Quest games list should show just how much content there is available \u2014 and third-party Meta Horizon OS headsets will get that same content, from virtual experiences to mixed-reality titles that make your living room visible.\n\nAdmittedly, developers are annoyed with Meta at the moment over its mess of an app store, which spends more real estate highlighting the Horizon app over new games. So, if Google provides a better alternative and makes porting games easy, we're sure some developers will jump on board. The question is whether gamers will follow and move over to either Samsung or any other Android XR partner when their current gaming library is on the Quest.\n\nA look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn the Android XR front, Google is promising app developers an easy pipeline to their apps appearing on their headsets. It supports \"ARCore, Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, Unity, and OpenXR,\" and there is already substantial documentation for devs to start using the Android XR SDK.\n\nGoogle says any current Play Store developer can \"opt in\" to Android XR and have their app \"just work\" because of this built-in compatibility. But we assume this would simply mean that the app works as a 2D window in virtual space, not that it'll have any XR optimization. And it's not clear how many major developers will opt into Android XR, based on the difficulties Apple had getting Vision Pro buy-in.\n\nSo far, only a few third-party apps like Adobe, Calm, and MLB have officially signed on. However, even a tiny fraction of the Play Store's app collection would give Google the edge. It also has the advantage of its own apps: being able to include Google Drive and Gmail gives an automatic edge for productivity users. Chrome is a more popular and polished browser option than Meta's, and YouTube and Google TV will provide popular streaming options.\n\nPlus, Google has the ability to fully sync its Android XR software with your other Android devices, specifically your phone. Just like Wear OS watches benefit from close synchronization for functions like messaging, Android XR headsets and glasses could have functions that Meta can't offer as easily.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGoogle has promised full gaming support for Android XR, and many Quest games use OpenXR, allowing for cross-platform compatibility. However, the built-in Quest audience will make it a higher priority for developers, and the specter of Stadia's failure could make gaming developers leery about investing too much time in the platform.\n\nAndroid XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Gemini & Meta AI\n\nTranslating a sign using smart glasses powered by Android XR\n\nGoogle Gemini and Meta AI are two of the most well-known AI options available today. Gemini Live is getting a major marketing push as this conversational tool on your phone, while Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses just got its own Live AI and live translate update for hands-free Meta AI conversations.\n\nWe can't say whether Gemini or Meta AI is better, but they're both backed by billions of dollars in R&D and teams of engineers, pushing out new, smarter versions at regular intervals. At the moment, both are as prone to hallucinations and misinformation as any other AI.\n\nIn the short term, headsets like Project Moohan and the Quest 3 will offer AI tools, but they won't be the device's focus. Most people are still buying XR headsets for gaming, and you don't need AI for that. It's when we start to see more smart & AR glasses for outdoor use that the AI will really matter, in our opinion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGoogle has said that the \"Gemini era\" is why Android XR will succeed where past Google VR and AR projects, so whether or not you get invested in the platform may depend on whether you think Gemini will be smart enough to be a real-time multimodal assistant in the next few years.\n\nAndroid XR vs. Meta Horizon OS: Can Google make a name for itself?\n\nAndroid XR has the potential to become the most exciting version of Android in years. However, so much of its potential depends on how well partners like Samsung take advantage of it. Samsung is one of the most popular tech brands in the world, and its hardware and software knowledge helped revive Wear OS from metaphorical life support, but Samsung and Google are both in the business of making money, and XR has historically proven to be difficult to profit from. Just ask Meta!\n\nWe can also look at the example of the Apple Vision Pro, which has a gorgeous design, excellent UI, and opt-in apps from its App Store but has largely failed to make a huge impact. It's in part because of its overpriced headset but also because the audience for a wearable productivity device is relatively small.\n\nSamsung will have to compete with the established Meta Horizon brand on the gaming front or hope that it can do better than Apple at a lower price point. And if any Android XR brand hopes to sell AR glasses, they'll have to deal with the simple fact that they seem extremely difficult to create in a lightweight, functional form factor.\n\nAll of that is to say; Android XR seems to have some factors stacked against it while also having the advantage over Meta's rival OS in key areas like apps and a full device ecosystem. We're excited to see whether or not Android XR lives long enough to truly make a difference in the XR industry!\n\nMeta Quest 3S\n\nThe standard, now in a cheaper package\n\nThe Meta Quest 3S is like having a Quest 3 but without having to spend several hundreds of dollars. There are a few downgrades, but the experience is largely the same and you'll have access to all the best VR games.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "OpenAI says its corporate structure must evolve to advance its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2014 AI that can complete most tasks humans can \u2014 benefits all humanity.\n\nThe company currently has a for-profit org controlled by a nonprofit, with a \u201ccapped profit\u201d share for investors and employees. But in a blog post published Friday, the company says it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest.\n\nThose details had been reported elsewhere. In December, The New York Times revealed that OpenAI was in discussions to pay its nonprofit billions of dollars for it to cede control. However, it\u2019s the first time OpenAI has laid out its proposal in a public memo.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup \u2014 we have to become an enduring company,\u201d OpenAI wrote in its post. \u201cThe world is moving to build out a new infrastructure of energy, land use, chips, data centers, data, AI models, and AI systems for the 21st century economy. We seek to evolve in order to take the next step in our mission.\u201d\n\nOpenAI says establishing the PBC would enable it to \u201cbalance shareholder interests, stakeholder interests, and a public benefit interest\u201d in its decision-making while allowing it to \u201craise the necessary capital with conventional terms.\u201d It would also create one of the best-resourced nonprofits in history, OpenAI claims; OpenAI\u2019s existing nonprofit would receive shares in the PBC \u201cat a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a nonprofit and a for-profit today, and we will continue to have both,\u201d OpenAI wrote. \u201cOur current structure does not allow the board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission and does not enable the nonprofit to easily do more than control the for-profit. The PBC will run and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while the nonprofit will hire a leadership team and staff to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft.\n\nIn October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, bringing its total raised to $17.9 billion. The company still expects to lose money this year, however \u2014 $5 billion, according to CNBC \u2014 and the terms of its latest funding round require that it complete a for-profit transition within two years.\n\nThe plan faces hurdles.\n\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s co-founders, billionaire Elon Musk, has filed for an injunction to halt the company\u2019s transition to a for-profit, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission. Musk has also alleged that OpenAI has deprived his own AI company, xAI, of capital by extracting promises from investors not to fund it.\n\nOpenAI has called Musk\u2019s complaints \u201cbaseless\u201d and simply a case of sour grapes.\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI\u2019s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, nonprofit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government,\u201d Meta wrote in the letter.\n\nOpenAI competitors like xAI and Anthropic are structured as PBCs but lack a nonprofit component.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s structure as it exists today is what ultimately led to the abrupt ousting of CEO Sam Altman last November, which greatly displeased investors \u2014 in particular Microsoft. It also gives OpenAI\u2019s board the power to determine exactly when OpenAI has achieved AGI, and exempts this AGI from the licensing agreements the startup has in place with customers.\n\nOne of those customers is Microsoft \u2014 and Microsoft and OpenAI are said to have a specific, internal financial definition of AGI. According to The Information, the two companies signed an agreement last year stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nOpenAI continues to deal with an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Carroll Wainwright, who researched aligning AI systems with safety policies, wrote in a post on X this fall that OpenAI \u201cwas structured as a nonprofit [but] acted like a for-profit\u201d and \u201cshould not [be trusted] when it promises to do the right thing later.\u201d\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said that he has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about OpenAI\u2019s transition plan as outlined.\n\n\u201cFirst, there is surprisingly little discussion of actual governance details, despite this arguably being the key issue,\u201d Brundage wrote. \u201cSecond, a well-capitalized nonprofit on the side is no substitute for PBC product decisions \u2026 being aligned to the original nonprofit\u2019s mission \u2026 Third, while there is a ton of potential for a well-capitalized nonprofit to drive \u2018charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science,\u2019 that is a very narrow scope relative to the original OpenAI mission. What about advancing safety and good policy?\u201d\n\nBrundage said that he worries about OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit becoming a \u201cside thing\u201d that gives license to the PBC to operate as a \u201cnormal company\u201d without addressing potentially problematic areas.\n\n\u201cBesides board details, what other guardrails are being put in place \u2026 to ensure that the nonprofit\u2019s existence doesn\u2019t (seem to) let the PBC off too easy?\u201d he wrote. \u201c[A]s OpenAI knows (in part from work I coauthored there), competition also begets corner-cutting. What are the PBC and nonprofit going to do about this?\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday."

Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.\"\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox.> Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe pressure on OpenAI is tied to its $157 billion valuation, achieved in the two years since the company launched its viral chatbot, ChatGPT, and kicked off the boom in generative artificial intelligence. OpenAI closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, gearing up to aggressively compete with Elon Musk's xAI as well as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Anthropic in a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\nDeveloping the large language models at the heart of ChatGPT and other generative AI products requires an ongoing investment in high-powered processors, provided largely by Nvidia, and cloud infrastructure, which OpenAI largely receives from top backer Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI expects about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue this year, CNBC confirmed in September. Those numbers are increasing rapidly.\n\nBy transforming into a Delaware PBC \"with ordinary shares of stock,\" OpenAI says it can pursue commercial operations, while separately hiring a staff for its nonprofit arm and allowing that wing to take on charitable activities in health care, education and science.\n\nThe nonprofit will have a \"significant interest\" in the PBC \"at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors,\" OpenAI wrote.\n\nOpenAI's complicated structure as it exists today is the result of its creation as a nonprofit in 2015. It was founded by CEO Sam Altman, Musk and others as a research lab focused on artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which was an entirely futuristic concept at the time.\n\nIn 2019, OpenAI aimed to move past its role as solely a research lab in hopes of functioning more like a startup, so it created a so-called capped-profit model, with the nonprofit still controlling the overall entity.\n\n\"Our current structure does not allow the Board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission and does not enable the nonprofit to easily do more than control the for-profit,\" OpenAI wrote in Friday's post.\n\nOpenAI added that the change would \"enable us to raise the necessary capital with conventional terms like our competitors.\"\n\nMusk's opposition\n\nOpenAI's efforts to restructure face some major hurdles. The most significant is Musk, who is in the midst of a heated legal battle with Altman that could have a significant impact on the company's future.\n\nIn recent months, Musk has sued OpenAI and asked a court to stop the company from converting to a for-profit corporation from a nonprofit. In posts on X, he described that effort as a \"total scam\" and claimed that \"OpenAI is evil.\" Earlier this month, OpenAI clapped back, alleging that in 2017 Musk \"not only wanted, but actually created, a for-profit\" to serve as the company's proposed new structure.\n\nIn addition to its face-off with Musk, OpenAI has been dealing with an outflow of high-level talent, due in part to concerns that the company has focused on taking commercial products to market at the expense of safety.\n\nIn late September, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati announced she would depart the company after 6\u00bd years. That same day, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, also announced they were leaving. A month earlier, co-founder John Schulman said he was leaving for rival startup Anthropic.\n\nAltman said during a September interview at Italian Tech Week that recent executive departures were not related to the company's potential restructuring: \"We have been thinking about that \u2014 our board has \u2014 for almost a year independently, as we think about what it takes to get to our next stage,\" he said.\n\nThose weren't the first big-name exits. In May, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and former safety leader Jan Leike announced their departures, with Leike also joining Anthropic.\n\nLeike wrote in a social media post at the time that disagreements with leadership about company priorities drove his decision.\n\n\"Over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\" he wrote.\n\nOne employee, who worked under Leike, quit soon after him, writing on X in September that \"OpenAI was structured as a non-profit, but it acted like a for-profit.\" The employee added, \"You should not believe OpenAI when it promises to do the right thing later.\"\n\nWATCH: OpenAI announces o3 and o3 mini models"

            "article_content": "Payments trends in 2024 and beyond are largely impacted by technology and the state of the economy. We\u2019re seeing a decline in discretionary spending, and an increase in the number of ways consumers like to make payments. Plus, AI and biometrics are also impacting payment security and fraud prevention.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll walk you through a few digital payment trends\u200b to watch as you prepare your business for the future of payment processing.\n\n1. Diversified payment methods\n\nOne of the more well-known global payment trends\u200b is payment method diversity. There are so many ways to make payments these days. I can choose cash, card, mobile app, QR code, tap to pay, buy now and pay later (BNPL), or even cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a survey by Square, preferences are pretty widespread across the board. While 58% of consumers still use cash, 57% prefer mobile wallets, and 53% use QR code payments. Another 44% use traditional credit and debit cards, 44% use touchless card payments, and 43% use BNPL.\n\nBNPL is particularly notable, as it\u2019s now being adopted in more industry verticals than before. Groceries, for example, may be available for purchase via BNPL. In fact, BNPL grocery purchases increased by 40% between 2023 and 2024, according to Deloitte. This is a direct response to the current economic and political climate, which is causing a decrease in discretionary spending.\n\nThe list of payment options will only continue to grow as the economy moves further away from cash and check and towards innovative payment methods like NFC or biometric payments. This also means considering options like subscriptions, cryptocurrency, saved payments, bill splitting, peer-to-peer (P2P), and gift cards.\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting stat from Deloitte: 70% of consumers say their store choice is highly influenced by whether or not the store offers their preferred payment method. It is therefore important for businesses to keep up.\n\nRelated: Best crypto payment gateways\n\nCash vs cashless\n\nToday\u2019s consumers like convenience and options. I remember when it was just a cash or credit world\u2014now, consumers can choose to pay for their purchases in many ways.\n\nHowever, according to data from Square, about 58% of shoppers still prefer cash. In fact, some trends are even indicating a move back to cash and away from digitization.\n\nSo, there\u2019s really no clear winner in a cash vs. cashless debate. The real answer for businesses is to create ways to allow customers to pay with or without cash.\n\nRelated: What is a cashless society? From speculation to near-reality\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\u2014like Apple Pay and Google Pay\u2014are another payment trend that has been around for a while but continues to impact businesses everywhere, especially as this technology evolves.\n\nPer Deloitte, 57% of consumers prefer to pay with mobile wallet apps. Digital wallets actually made up 37% of transaction value for e-commerce payments and 15% of POS payments in North America in 2023.\n\nContactless pay can also fall under the category of mobile payments. Mobile payments involve the use of NFC technology so a customer can hold up their phone or smartwatch to the reader rather than having to insert a chip or swipe a card. The contactless payment market is also expected to see major growth\u2014at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 113% through 2029, according to Juniper Research.\n\nRelated: Top mobile payment methods\n\nCrypto payments\n\nCryptocurrency payments skyrocketed in popularity when they were first introduced. The trend did lose some steam partly due to regulatory challenges, currency volatility, susceptibility to fraud, and low confidence in the currency\u2019s viability over the long term, perhaps thanks to the FTX scandal and collapse.\n\nWith this doubt, the crypto payments market is only forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2029.\n\nHowever, since Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, crypto and bitcoin have seen a resurgence of popularity in the United States.\n\n2. Biometrics features\n\nBiometric payments are experiencing a surge in growth, with forecasts to grow at a CAGR of 113.6% from 2024 through 2028, per Juniper Research. Some forecasts even say it will be the norm within the next decade. These payments incorporate biometric technology\u2014usually in the form of fingerprint or facial recognition\u2014to improve both data privacy and transaction convenience.\n\nSecurity is a top concern for businesses, both themselves and their customers. This is especially important when it comes to payments\u2014there\u2019s lots of sensitive information going around, so businesses are always looking for ways to tighten things up from a security perspective. Biometric payments are another layer of security that can help accomplish this.\n\nNot only does biometric authentication help boost security, but it also makes login and connection more efficient. I can\u2019t tell you how many passwords I have to remember\u2014if I can use my fingerprint or my face to authenticate something instead, that\u2019s one less password I have to keep track of. And remember, shoppers love efficiency and convenience.\n\n3. AI to facilitate and fight fraud\n\nFraud is always a threat to businesses and consumers. According to Avidchange\u2019s B2B Payment Security report, more than three-quarters of businesses have experienced payment fraud in the past year alone.\n\nSpeaking of security, AI is another payment trend to watch. And this can work in businesses\u2019 favor or, in a worst-case scenario, fraudsters\u2019 favor. Globalpayments reports that as many as 43% of businesses have plans to employ AI technology to help with fraud detection.\n\nWhile AI is an amazing tool to detect fraudulent transactions and add a layer of security, it also makes the work of a hacker much more accessible.\n\nRather than manually decoding payment information, hackers can tap into AI technology to make it easier to accomplish their tasks. In fact, Deloitte actually predicts that AI could enable losses to fraud of up to $40 billion by 2027. So, it\u2019s important to use payment technology that integrates the latest and most advanced security features.\n\n4. Instant payments\n\nWhile consumers love the convenience of being able to pay with anything other than cash, this has also added to delays when it comes to being able to access said cash.\n\nDigital payments often come with a waiting period\u2014for example, if I make a purchase with my credit card at a store, it might take a day or two for the charge to show up. Likewise, when I transfer money from PayPal or Venmo to my account, I usually have to wait a few days to receive the funds in my bank account.\n\nThese delays don\u2019t gel with our instant gratification society. So, payment technology is adapting to instant payments. For example, if I want to receive my PayPal or Venmo funds right away, I can actually pay a fee for an instant transfer.\n\nInstant payments are actually expected to make up 22% of transactions by 2028, per Capegemini\u2019s World Payments Report 2025. It\u2019s also believed that more instant payment availability will also facilitate more digital payment adoption by both businesses and consumers alike. JPMorgan reports about 80% of finance professionals believe faster payments will positively impact business.\n\nBut time will tell on this one\u2014only about 5% of global banks have advanced business technology, so there\u2019s still work to do.\n\n5. B2B is going digital\n\nB2B payments used to be largely check-based. But checks are quickly becoming antiquated in the payments industry. In fact, 80% of B2B transactions used to be paid by check\u2014that figure is now closer to one-third. And only about 5% of businesses are even prepared to make vendor and supplier payments by check.\n\nYou can see the decline in cash and check in B2B payment trends in the chart below. In 2019, they made up half of all B2B payments. Now, they account for less than one-third. Digital ACH transfers are making the most headway, but card and wire payments also experienced a slight increase."

Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Enpass Individual Score Details \u201cEnpass Individual has affordable plans for mobile sync, but there are some trade-offs with its unique storage options.\u201d Pros Strong security via third-party cloud\n\nEasy access to logins and more\n\nUnlimited free desktop app\n\nLow prices for mobile sync\n\nUnlimited secure storage Cons No web app\n\nSharing is awkward\n\nEmail support\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Specs Tiers and pricing Design Features Support Privacy and security Is Enpass right for you?\n\nEnpass is a password manager that can store and sync logins to Google Drive, iCloud, or other cloud storage providers. That means you can choose which leading tech company you trust most to encrypt and secure your account passwords.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe best password managers go beyond auto-filling passwords on favorite websites. You can also organize and share logins, notes, and more with ease. I went hands-on with the free and paid version of Enpass to find out how well its cloud sync works and whether it\u2019s a good solution for your needs.\n\nSpecs\n\nEnpass Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices Unlimited Support Email, Forums Free version? Yes\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nEnpass has a nice desktop app that you can use for free on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. Android and iOS apps can only sync 25 logins for free, a good incentive to become a subscriber. Who has only 25 accounts?\n\nAn Enpass plan starts at just $10 annually and renews at $24. That\u2019s very affordable pricing that\u2019s equivalent to $1 initially, climbing to $2 per month after 12 months.\n\nEnpass Family provides accounts for up to six family members. The initial cost is $30, and the subscription renews at $48. That makes the family plan a good choice for families with three to six members.\n\nA unique one-time payment plan lets you buy a lifetime Enpass Individual license for $80. If you anticipate using Enpass for at least four years, the One-Time plan offers the best value. It\u2019s like year five and beyond are free.\n\nWhile it\u2019s rare, there are other password managers that accept a single payment. For example, StickyPassword is an offline password manager that syncs to your other devices over Wi-Fi.\n\nA paid Enpass subscription unlocks unlimited items on mobile devices, more organization features, and monitoring for password breaches.\n\nDesign\n\nI started with the free Windows app. Enpass setup was quick and simple. I created an individual account and verified my email address. Next, I was given several cloud sync options, including Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, and Box.\n\nThere are also options to save data locally and sync with other devices via Wi-Fi. I could also set up WebDAV or NextCloud servers to self-host. I chose Google Drive, authenticated, and chose a strong master password.\n\nI was guided to install the browser extension and authenticate. I checked the app and couldn\u2019t find a place to enter verify. After looking around for a bit, I went back to the browser and typed the code that I saw on screen even though there was no box to type into. That worked, and I was ready to start using Enpass in Microsoft Edge. Enpass also supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi.\n\nI also switched on Windows Hello authentication so I didn\u2019t have to type my long master password when Enpass timed out or when I restarted my computer. Settings are arranged in tabs so it was easy to find what I needed.\n\nFeatures\n\nEnpass autofill worked just like most other password managers. When I visited Netflix, my login appeared as soon as I selected the username or password field. Signing in only took two clicks of my mouse.\n\nIf I use Enpass as a launcher, choosing a website from the Windows app or browser extension, the page loads and I\u2019m automatically logged in, so I can access my favorite websites even faster.\n\nEnpass lets me attach files and photos to secure notes. Cross-platform syncing worked perfectly. I could see use the passwords from my Windows PC on my iPhone to autofill in Safari. I created a secure note and attached a photo from my iPhone gallery, and in seconds it appeared on my computer.\n\nWhile the 3GB secure storage limit of NordPass is generous, Enpass doesn\u2019t limit how much data I use. That\u2019s between me and my cloud provider.\n\nUnfortunately, the simplicity breaks down when you want to share a login, note, or other item with someone else. I had to use the Enpass app and navigate through menus to generate a key, giving it a name and a password. The name is for my reference, but the password is needed by the recipient to unlock shared items.\n\nNext, I find the item I want to share and provide an email address or copy a link to message to my friend or family member. The recipient must have the Enpass app installed to open the link. To make matters worse, Gmail didn\u2019t hyperlink the eight-line URL so they had to select copy and paste it into Enpass.\n\nKeeper and 1Password lead the way with simple yet robust sharing features that don\u2019t require everyone to have an account.\n\nSupport\n\nEnpass offers email support, which usually means you\u2019ll have to wait up to 24 hours for a reply. That\u2019s not as convenient as the 24/7 live chat option from competitor Keeper, but Enpass has a very thorough support center and online user guide to look up information.\n\nOn the evening of December 24, I sent an email and also filled in the contact form on the support page. I received replies from both very early on the 26th, taking about 31 hours. That\u2019s fast for email support during the holiday season.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEnpass\u2019 privacy policy looks good. It collects the minimum user data needed to provide service and doesn\u2019t sell or share your email address with third-party advertisers.\n\nYour data is stored on your own devices or in your chosen cloud service. No logins are uploaded, and Enpass uses end-to-end AES-256 encryption based on your master password, so no one can access your accounts, even Enpass staff.\n\nEnpass security has been verified by Cure53, a well-known and trusted independent security lab.\n\nIs Enpass right for you?\n\nEnpass is a great option for free use on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. However, you\u2019ll probably need to sync with mobile devices. In that case, there are better free password managers with full cross-platform syncing.\n\nI recommend Proton Pass, which is part of Proton Free, since it includes free password management, VPN, cloud storage, and more.\n\nThe best password managers make a strong effort to secure your data, but there have been notable issues. LastPass was hacked in 2022 and 1Password suffered a minor breach in 2023.\n\nWhere Enpass shines is the variety of storage options that let you choose where to your logins are saved. With a paid Enpass plan you can over local Wi-Fi, use your own server, or choose from a variety of popular cloud storage services. If you already trust Google, Microsoft, Apple, or others with most of your data, it might make sense to store logins there as well."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

I\u2019ve been seeing this girl \u201cAngie\u201d for eight months now. She is everything to me. I fell in love with her right away, and she said she loved me first within the first month.\n\nBut now, I get yelled at for basically everything I say. Like today, I called her for the first time at 2:30 p.m. and she answered the phone saying, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask what she\u2019s up to and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business\u201d and then goes, \u201cI\u2019m done talking now.\u201d This is a typical conversation for us.\n\nAnnie, I never cheated on this girl. I have always treated her well. Is it cheating if I just quit talking to her and start looking for someone else? The crappy part is that I don\u2019t want anyone else. But I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can put up with this. -- Should I Stay or Should I Go\n\nDear Should I Stay: Before you start looking for someone else, you need to tell Angie the relationship is over. Just because she isn\u2019t treating you well doesn\u2019t mean you should stoop to her level.\n\nAs for not wanting anyone else, you\u2019ll never know until you start looking. You\u2019d be amazed at what a clean break and a little bit of time can do.\n\nDear Annie: I will be inheriting a modest sum of money and want to gift some of it to my two married children. I also want to gift some money to my daughter\u2019s two young children to be used for future educational needs. My son and his wife don\u2019t have children and will likely not have any in the future. They lost beautiful twins born prematurely many years ago.\n\nI want to be fair and compassionate with the distribution of money. If I gift the same amount to my two children and a smaller amount to our two grandchildren, do you think my son will feel the distribution is unfair? I realize the inheritance is mine to do with as I please, but I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. We are all kind and level-headed people. -- Grandma in a Quandary\n\nDear Grandma: Your thoughtfulness and consideration for everyone\u2019s emotions show what a caring grandma you are.\n\nGifting the same amount to each child, plus additional funds earmarked for your grandkids' education, is a perfectly fair approach. But because your son and daughter-in-law experienced such a profound loss, it\u2019s wise to consider how this might affect them emotionally. If you want, you could contribute something unique to them as well -- a trip, for example -- to show extra consideration.\n\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\n\n"

            "date": "4h",
            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

Although Russia launched a powerful new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile at a Ukrainian weapons facility after the first two volleys of Western long-range missiles, it has since responded to them with its usual mix of drones, missiles and threats."

            "article_content": "Far-right activists clashed online with billionaire Elon Musk and other supporters of President-elect Donald Trump over the need for a skilled-worker immigration program that has long been a lifeblood for Silicon Valley \u2014 signifying a potential rift between Trump\u2019s core nationalist base and technology executives who have come to support him.\n\nThe fight that spilled into public view over the holiday week could preview a wedge within Trump\u2019s coalition over how to execute immigration policy, an issue that animated Trump\u2019s White House campaign.\n\nThe controversy spread across X after far-right activist Laura Loomer on Monday criticized Trump\u2019s choice to name Sriram Krishnan, a technology entrepreneur and investor who was born in India, as his senior policy adviser on artificial intelligence. She pointed to Krishnan\u2019s previous support for removing some caps on green cards and easing the ability of skilled foreign workers to come to the United States. The policy is \u201cin direct opposition\u201d to Trump\u2019s agenda, Loomer wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe critique sparked a broader debate about immigration in the tech industry, which relies heavily on a visa program that allows foreigners with technical skills to work in the United States for up to six years under H-1B nonimmigrant status.\n\nIt ran headlong into tension with some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, notably Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk; David Sacks, who will be the president-elect\u2019s AI and crypto czar; and Vivek Ramaswamy, who will co-lead a commission to cut government spending.\n\nRamaswamy argued American culture doesn\u2019t produce enough skilled workers to fuel cutting-edge companies. \u201c\u2018Normalcy\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cAnd if we pretend like it does, we\u2019ll have our asses handed to us by China.\u201d\n\nThe online fight sparked a slew of racist posts from Loomer and allegations of censorship. She said her X account lost its verified status and premium subscribers because Musk, who owns the platform, was retaliating against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA screenshot purporting to show that Loomer\u2019s X account had been flagged for violating rules against \u201cposting other people\u2019s private information\u201d bounced around the social network. The Washington Post could not independently verify the authenticity of the post.\n\n\u201cSo much for free speech,\u201d she said in an X post on Friday. \u201cQuite totalitarian if you ask me.\u201d\n\nNotable Republicans, including former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley, championed Loomer\u2019s position. \u201cIf the tech industry needs workers, invest in our education system,\u201d Haley said in a post on X on Friday. \u201cInvest in our American workforce. We must invest in Americans first before looking elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTech executives, including Musk, have said they would prefer to hire American workers because obtaining visas for foreign workers can be time-consuming and costly. But Musk, who once held an H-1B visa and has relied on the program to employ thousands of Tesla employees, said recruiting foreign workers is a crucial way technology companies obtain the best engineering talent to compete globally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,\u201d Musk wrote on X on Christmas. \u201cIf you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be.\u201d\n\nThe online feud reflects the challenges that Trump will have holding together the delicate political coalition that delivered him the White House, which included unprecedented levels of financial support from Musk and other Silicon Valley billionaires.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of future conflicts,\u201d said Samuel Hammond, a senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation. \u201cThis is like the pregame.\u201d\n\nKrishnan declined to comment. Loomer and a representative for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Trump traveled with Loomer during the campaign, but amid criticism of her previous statements, he said in September he doesn\u2019t \u201ccontrol\u201d her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has sought to position himself as a champion for legal immigration, even though he slashed pathways for immigrants during his first term. Trump has offered few specifics about how he will address skilled immigration in the tech industry during his second term.\n\nOn a June episode of the \u201cAll In\u201d podcast, which is co-hosted by Sacks, Trump said he would automatically give a green card to every international student with a college diploma.\n\n\u201cIf you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nAhead of the first Trump administration, many tech CEOs sought to build bridges with the president-elect during the transition with a meeting at his New York Trump Tower. But those delicate relationships broke down when Trump almost immediately rolled out what critics and federal judges have branded a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d which prohibited U.S. entry by the citizens of several majority-Muslim countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe episode amounted to a \u201cshock wave\u201d in the industry, where many founders and workers are immigrants, Hammond said.\n\n\u201cImmigration is an economically important issue for tech, but also in many cases a personal one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all understand the inefficiencies and the bureaucracy around the U.S. immigration system and the Kafkaesque nightmares it can throw you in.\u201d\n\nBut this time, the tech industry is far more directly intertwined in Trump\u2019s transition. Self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d Musk has spent much of the time since Election Day by the president-elect\u2019s side, and Trump has tapped many Silicon Valley investors and executives to serve in prominent roles within his administration.\n\nAs Silicon Valley companies compete to create artificial intelligence products, the need for foreign-born talent has intensified. Twenty-eight of the top 43 AI companies in the United States were co-founded by immigrants, and 70 percent of full-time graduate students in AI-related fields are international students, according to a 2023 analysis from the National Foundation for American Policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump previews a hard-line immigration policy including militarized mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, many in the tech industry are pushing him to expand legal immigration for highly skilled workers. Some argue the shift is necessary for the United States to remain competitive with China.\n\nSkilled immigration emerged as one of the top flash points between Trump and Silicon Valley during his first presidency. Although Trump at times acknowledged the need for American companies to recruit top talent, his administration limited the H-1B program. Stephen Miller, who helped craft some immigration policies during the first Trump administration, is returning to the White House as Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser.\n\nThe online debate reverberated among Washington lawmakers, who have long pursued ways to improve the H-1B program. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, defended Krishnan and said he supported reforming the H-1B program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe should celebrate that immigrants like Elon Musk, Jensen Huang and Sriram Krishnan choose to come to the United States,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cThis has fueled our economic and technology preeminence. I am glad Sriram is being appointed.\u201d\n\nThe restrictions of H-1B visas during Trump\u2019s first term faced fierce opposition from major tech companies. During the pandemic, Trump temporarily froze H-1B visas in a move the administration said would help Americans experiencing job loss. That same year, the Trump administration also introduced new rules tightening eligibility for H-1B visas and requiring companies to offer higher salaries to people on the visas. A federal judge later rejected some of the rules, including the salary provision.\n\nDuring President Joe Biden\u2019s final weeks in office, his administration has introduced rules to \u201cmodernize\u201d the H-1B program by making it easier for international students to obtain the visas and improving the efficiency of the application process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese reforms target systematic misuse by IT consulting firms while acknowledging the program\u2019s demonstrated net positive impact on U.S. technological competitiveness,\u201d said Divyansh Kaushik, a vice president at Beacon Global Strategies.\n\nTechnology companies are particularly reliant on H-1B visas \u2014 which are capped at 85,000 new visas annually \u2014 to help recruit talent. Amazon, with 3,871 new H-1B employees, had the most approved new petitions in 2024, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan organization National Foundation for American Policy. Google had 1,058 approved applications, and Tesla had 742, the data showed. (The Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.)\n\nRamaswamy said in an X post on Thursday that the reason technology companies hire foreign-born engineers is because \u201cAmerican culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long,\u201d drawing criticism from notable pro-Trump personalities.\n\nBrenden Dilley, a pro-Trump podcaster, shot back at Ramaswamy\u2019s post. \u201cI always love when these tech bros flat out tell you that they have zero understanding of American culture and then have the gall to tell you that YOU are the problem with America,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLoomer, who has 1.4 million followers on X, unleashed a slew of racist posts falsely describing Indians as \u201cthird world invaders\u201d with low IQs, and calling the clash a \u201ccivil war\u201d between Trump\u2019s far-right base and the \u201ctech bros\u201d that have come to support his upcoming administration.\n\nShe also sparred with Musk over his support of the H-1B program, questioning the skills of Indian programmers at X because of glitches during a May live event on the site kicking off Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cLoomer is trolling for attention. Ignore.\u201d Musk said on X.\n\nLoomer said she hopes the feud with Silicon Valley changes Trump\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cLooking forward to the inevitable divorce between President Trump and Big Tech,\u201d she said on X. \u201cLet\u2019s pray this fake Big Tech \u2018love fest\u2019 with Trump ends sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Dwoskin contributed to this report."

            "article_content": "The AI computing market may shift in 2025, opening opportunities for smaller companies.\n\nNvidia dominates AI computing. Evolving workloads could benefit competitors.\n\nCompanies like Groq, Positron, and SambaNova focus on inference to challenge Nvidia's market hold.\n\nIn 2025, the tides may turn for companies hoping to compete with the $3 trillion gorilla in AI computing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 90% of the market share for AI computing. Still, as the use of AI grows, workloads are expected to change, and this evolution may give companies with competitive hardware an opening.\n\nIn 2024, the majority of AI compute spend shifted to inference, Thomas Sohmers, CEO of chip startup Positron AI, told BI. This will \"continue to grow on what looks like an exponential curve,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn AI, inference is the computation needed to produce the response to a user's query or request. The computing required to teach the model the knowledge needed to answer is called \"training.\" Creating OpenAI's image generation platform Sora, for example, represents training. Each user who instructs it to create an image represents an inference workload.\n\nOpenAI's other models have Sohmers and others excited about the growth in computing needs in 2025.\n\nOpenAI's o1 and o3, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and a handful of other AI models use more compute-intensive strategies to improve results after training. These strategies are often called inference-time computing, chain-of-thought, chain-of-reasoning, or reasoning models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, if the models think more before they answer, the responses are better. That thinking comes at a cost of time and money.\n\nThe startups vying for some of Nvidia's market share are attempting to optimize one or both.\n\nNvidia already benefits from these innovations, CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's November earnings call. Huang's wannabe competitors are betting that in 2025, new post-training strategies for AI will benefit all purveyors of inference chips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to three challengers about their hopes and expectations for 2025. Here are their New Year's resolutions.\n\nWhat's one thing within your control that could make 2025 a big year for alternative chips?\n\nMark Heaps is the chief technology evangelist for Nvidia challenger Groq. Groq\n\nMark Heaps, chief technology evangelist, Groq:\n\n\"Execution, execution, execution. Right now, everybody at Groq has decided not to take a holiday break this year. Everyone is executing and building the systems. We are all making sure that we deliver to the opportunity that we've got because that is in our control.\n\nI tell everyone our funnel right now is carbonated and bubbling over. It's unbelievable, the amount of customer interest. We have to build more systems, and we have to stand up those systems so we can serve the demand that we've got. We want to serve all those customers. We want to increase rate limits for everybody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO, SambaNova Systems:\n\n\"For SambaNova, the most critical factor is executing on the shift from training to inference. The industry is moving rapidly toward real-time applications, and inference workloads are becoming the lion's share of AI demand. Our focus is on ensuring our technology enables enterprises to scale efficiently and sustainably.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThomas Sohmers, CEO, Positron:\n\n\"My belief is if we can actually deploy enough compute \u2014 which thankfully I think we can from a supply chain perspective \u2014 by deploying significantly more inference-specific compute, we're going to be able to grow the adoption rate of 'chain of thoughts' and other inference-additional compute.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's one thing you're hoping for that's not in your control for 2025?\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO and cofounder of SambaNova Systems. SambaNova Systems\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"It's about customers recognizing that there are novel advancements against incumbent technologies. There's a lot of folks that have told us, 'We like what you have, but to use the old adage and rephrase it: No one ever got fired for buying from \u2014 insert incumbent.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we know that it's starting to boil up. People are realizing it's hard for them to get chips from the incumbent, and it's also not as performant as Groq is. So my wish would be that people are willing to take that chance and actually look to some of these new technologies.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"If I had a magic wand, I'd address the power challenges around deploying AI. Today, most of the market is stuck using power-hungry hardware that wasn't designed for inference at scale. The result is an unsustainable approach \u2014 economically and environmentally.\n\nAt SambaNova, we've proven there's a better way. Our architecture consumes 10 times less power, making it possible for enterprises to deploy AI systems that meet their goals without blowing past their power budgets or carbon targets. I'd like to see the market move faster toward adopting technologies that prioritize efficiency and sustainability \u2014 because that's how we ensure AI can scale globally without overwhelming the infrastructure that supports it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\n\"I would like people to actually adopt these chain of thought capabilities at the fastest rate possible. I think that is a huge shift \u2014 from a capabilities perspective. You have 8 billion parameter models surpassing 70 billion parameter models. So I'm trying to do everything I can to make that happen.\"\n\nWhat's your New Year's resolution?\n\nPositron AI executives. From left to right: Edward Kmett, Thomas Sohmers, Adam Huson, and Greg Davis. Positron AI\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"In the last six months, I've gone to a number of hackathons, and I've met developers. It's deeply inspiring. So my New Year's resolution is to try to amplify the signal of the good that people are doing with AI.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"Making time for music. Playing guitar is something I've always loved, and I would love to get back into it. Music has this incredible way of clearing the mind and sparking creativity, which I find invaluable as we work to bring SambaNova's AI to new corners of the globe.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\nI want to do as much to encourage the usage of these new tools to help, you know, my mom. Part of the reason I got into technology was because I wanted to see these tools lift up people to be able to do more with their time \u2014 to learn everything that they want beyond whatever job they're in. I think that bringing the cost down of these things will enable that proliferation.\n\nI also personally want to see and try to use more of these things outside of my just work context because I've been obsessively using the o1 Pro model for the past few weeks, and it's been amazing for my personal work. But when I gave access to my mom what she would do with it was pretty interesting \u2014 those sort of normal, everyday person tasks for these things where it truly is being an assistant.\""

            "date": "The Daily Signal13h",
            "source": "The Daily Signal",
            "article_content": "Apparently believing that the more you repeat a lie the truer it becomes, President Joe Biden recently quoted a Time magazine article claiming that \u201cPresident [Donald] Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history.\u201d\n\nThe Time article was little more than a setup designed to position Democrats to take credit for the inevitable Trump economic boom\u2014as I noted just four days before Biden repeated this audacious claim.\n\nExpect similar efforts from the Left as it attempts to rewrite economic history in hopes that our memories are weak enough\u2014and our gullibility strong enough\u2014to overcome economic reality.\n\nIn fact, Biden is handing Trump an economy on the precipice of disaster. Thanks in large part to Biden\u2019s four-year deficit-spending spree, the economy is shackled by an incomprehensibly huge $36 trillion in debt and $1 trillion less in Treasury cash on hand. That debt is growing exponentially, with interest alone now consuming over $1.1 trillion annually.\n\nAnd while Biden has been touting jobs numbers, those estimates keep getting revised down after wildly overoptimistic initial reports. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia just estimated that net job growth in the second quarter of this year was likely negative, meaning employment was falling.\n\nAdd in inflation that is once again accelerating by every measure, and you have some understanding of the debt-ridden, inflationary, dumpster-fire economy Trump is actually inheriting.\n\nSo, what is Biden talking about?\n\nOf course, much of Biden\u2019s speech was laced with false and misleading data woven into generalities about Bidenomics \u201cgrowing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up\u201d (which means absolutely nothing) and the evils of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d (which exists only in the minds of the economically illiterate).\n\nBiden actually blamed nonexistent trickle-down economics for creating \u201cbigger deficits.\u201d I guess he had to blame something.\n\nBut, seriously, bigger than what?\n\nThere has never been a bigger federal deficit than the one Biden is handing off\u2014other than in times of severe national crises. But we are not facing a severe national crisis. The pandemic is long over and we are not at war. Nonetheless, the federal debt is 121% of our gross national product\u2014the level at which it peaked during World War II!\n\nFor a more recent comparison, our annual federal deficit was just under $1 trillion in 2019 heading into the pandemic. In 2022, following the pandemic, it was about $1.4 trillion. For the most recent fiscal year (which ended Sept. 30), Biden\u2019s runaway-train spending deficit hit a stunning $1.8 trillion, an 80% increase from pre-pandemic levels. Now that\u2019s big.\n\nFor some perspective, at over $1.1 trillion annually, interest alone on our federal debt now exceeds our entire pre-pandemic annual federal deficit.\n\nWhy? A feedback loop of excessive government spending. First, Biden\u2019s reckless spending regime set off inflation (as even the Democrats\u2019 economist emeritus Larry Summers warned it would). That inflation then induced the Fed to raise interest rates.\n\nNow Biden has the economy in a death spiral of higher debt levels and higher interest rates driving each other\u2014and his deficit spending spree continues.\n\nHow quickly are things spiraling out of control? Very quickly!\n\nIn October and November 2023, the federal deficit was $380 billion. For the same months this year, it\u2019s already $624 billion, a shocking 64% increase over last year with no plan in place to constrain it. None.\n\nThis is the actual economy \u201cTrump is receiving.\u201d Rather than the \u201cstrongest economy in modern history,\u201d it\u2019s a house of cards built on federal debt, creating what is one of\u2014if not the\u2014most dangerous economies in modern history.\n\nSo, what is Biden\u2019s proposed solution? Piling the ridiculous atop the absurd, Biden stated that it is his \u201cprofound hope that the new administration will preserve and build on this progress.\u201d He actually said this.\n\nWhy? Well, according to Biden, things are getting better as inflation has declined \u201cto pre-pandemic levels\u201d while \u201cwages have increased.\u201d Of course, as most Americans know, neither statement is true.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first term, the average year-over-year inflation rate was 1.9%. When Biden took office in January 2021, annual inflation was 1.4%. Following its June 2021 peak at 9%, the inflation rate under Biden never declined to the Fed\u2019s 2% target\u2014let alone \u201cpre-pandemic levels.\u201d\n\nThat rate is currently increasing by literally every measure, with inflation around 3% or higher becoming the new normal.\n\nAs for wages going up, keep in mind that inflation is a tax. So, while the average American\u2019s weekly paycheck was a record high $1,221.42 in November, that paycheck could purchase $176.86 less than nominally smaller average paychecks when Biden took office.\n\nThis is because real weekly wages (the number on your paycheck minus inflation) are down 3% since Biden took the economic reins. That is not what most people consider an increase.\n\nReal wages were up 6.8% under Trump. Now that was an increase.\n\nSo, with crocodile tears, Biden bemoans the possibility that we could \u201cbackslide to an economy that benefited those at the top, while working people and the middle class struggle\u201d to get \u201ca fair share of growth.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone honestly believe that inflation-strapped working- and middle-class Americans are getting a fair share under Bidenomics? The people benefiting in today\u2019s economy are those who own stocks, interest-bearing securities, or real estate.\n\nIn other words, \u201cthose at the top.\u201d That is what Bidenomics produced.\n\nOriginally published by Fox News\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"
