        "article_content": "This city has the highest number of UFO reports in Ontario\n\nPreferred Region How does this work?\n\nBy Karen Longwell Published October 25, 2024 at 12:01 pm\n\nOntario has the highest number of UFO reports in Canada and one city has the most sightings in 2024.\n\nThe National UFO Reporting Center, founded in 1974 in the United States by Robert J. Gribble, keeps records of sightings around the globe. Since 1995, the centre has kept sighting reports on its website.\n\nBeyond the explained sightings of comets or northern lights, Unidentified Flying Objects are just that, unexplained objects spotted in the sky. Recently, scientists are using the acronym \u201cUAP\u201d (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon) for unexplainable sights or phenomena. NASA established a team in 2022 to study UAP.\n\nIn Canada, Ontario has the highest number of reports at 2,562 in the National UFO Reporting Center database. British Columbia is next with 1,226. Toronto has the highest number of sightings in 2024.\n\nThese numbers are likely due to the population. Ontario has the highest population in Canada at 16,124,116, according to Statistics Canada. British Columbia is next at 5,698,430.\n\nToronto, with a population of 6,431,000 in 2024, has had six UFO sightings reported to the National UFO Reporting Center in 2024.\n\nIn September, someone reported a \u201cnear stationary white changing object\u201d in the city and in July another report indicated there was an \u201coval craft\u201d that floated at an almost helicopter level.\n\nOther reports in the GTA include a recent sighting in Mississauga. On Oct. 10, someone reported and egg-shaped object following an aircraft on a final approach to Pearson Airport.\n\nOn Aug. 31, a person in Burlington claimed to see nine craft that appeared as dots in a delta formation.\n\nThere was a report of an \u201cextremely large triangle\u201d over Clarington on Aug. 29.\n\nIn April, someone spotted a \u201cwhite ball moving very fast \u2013 too fast for a satellite\u201d in Milton.\n\nWhile often ridiculed, UFO sightings are part of Canada\u2019s history.\n\nLast month, The Royal Canadian Mint announced a coin commemorating one of Canada\u2019s most notable UFO sightings. The Langenburg Event, as it came to be known, was a sighting on Sept. 1, 1974 near the town of Langenburg, Saskatchewan.\n\nA farmer reported five saucer-shaped objects hovering just above the ground. He watched as they rose up, emitting a strange vapour and then disappeared into the sky. The RCMP investigated and the incident report noted \u201cfive different distinct circles, caused by something exerting what had to be heavy air or exhaust pressure over the highgrass.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the National UFO Reporting Center, see the website here."

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Sewell told the bot he was \u2018coming home\u2019 \u2014 and it encouraged him to do so, the lawsuit says.\n\n\u201cI promise I will come home to you. I love you so much, Dany,\u201d Sewell told the chatbot.\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d the bot replied. \u201cPlease come home to me as soon as possible, my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I told you I could come home right now?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cPlease do, my sweet king,\u201d the bot messaged back.\n\nJust seconds after the Character.AI bot told him to \u201ccome home,\" the teen took his own life, according to the lawsuit, filed this week by Sewell\u2019s mother, Megan Garcia, of Orlando, against Character Technologies Inc.\n\nCharter Technologies is the company behind Character.AI, an app that allows users to create customizable characters or interact with those generated by others, spanning experiences from imaginative play to mock job interviews. The company says the artificial personas are designed to \u201cfeel alive\" and \u201chuman-like.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine speaking to super intelligent and life-like chat bot Characters that hear you, understand you and remember you,\u201d reads a description for the app on Google Play. \u201cWe encourage you to push the frontier of what\u2019s possible with this innovative technology.\u201d\n\nGarcia's attorneys allege the company engineered a highly addictive and dangerous product targeted specifically to kids, \u201cactively exploiting and abusing those children as a matter of product design,\" and pulling Sewell into an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if Sewell Setzer had not been on Character.AI, he would be alive today,\u201d said Matthew Bergman, founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center, which is representing Garcia.\n\nA spokesperson for Character.AI said Friday that the company doesn't comment on pending litigation. In a blog post published the day the lawsuit was filed, the platform announced new \u201ccommunity safety updates,\" including guardrails for children and suicide prevention resources.\n\n\u201cWe are creating a different experience for users under 18 that includes a more stringent model to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content,\" the company said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"We are working quickly to implement those changes for younger users.\"\n\nGoogle and its parent company, Alphabet, have also been named as defendants in the lawsuit. The AP left multiple email messages with the companies on Friday.\n\nIn the months leading up to his death, Garcia's lawsuit says, Sewell felt he had fallen in love with the bot.\n\nWhile unhealthy attachments to AI chatbots can cause problems for adults, for young people it can be even riskier \u2014 as with social media \u2014 because their brain is not fully developed when it comes to things like impulse control and understanding the consequences of their actions, experts say.\n\nJames Steyer, the founder and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media, said the lawsuit \u201cunderscores the growing influence \u2014 and severe harm \u2014 that generative AI chatbot companions can have on the lives of young people when there are no guardrails in place.\u201d\n\nKids\u2019 overreliance on AI companions, he added, can have significant effects on grades, friends, sleep and stress, \u201call the way up to the extreme tragedy in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit serves as a wake-up call for parents, who should be vigilant about how their children interact with these technologies,\u201d Steyer said.\n\nCommon Sense Media, which issues guides for parents and educators on responsible technology use, says it is critical that parents talk openly to their kids about the risks of AI chatbots and monitor their interactions.\n\n\u201cChatbots are not licensed therapists or best friends, even though that\u2019s how they are packaged and marketed, and parents should be cautious of letting their children place too much trust in them,\u201d Steyer said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this report. Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        "article_content": "On a recent Sunday night at Katie\u2019s of Smithtown, a group of about a dozen people stood in the dark. But they weren\u2019t in search of a drink \u2014 they were there to find a ghost.\n\nMichael Cardinuto, president of the group Long Island Paranormal Investigators, told guests to turn their phones off and recounted the tale of bartender Charlie Klein, who is said to haunts Katie\u2019s. There are stories of glasses flying off the bar and tables, and the sound of unexplained footsteps.\n\nFrom left, Tanya Leib at a weekly meeting of the Long Island Paranormal Investigators in Selden. Top right, Michael Cardinuto, seated at center, with members of the group. Bottom right, some of the equipment members use to conduct their investigations. Credit: Newsday/Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nCardinuto then led the group \u2014 a mix of guests and other paranormal investigators \u2014 past a poster for the A&E show \u201cParanormal,\u201d which filmed at Katie\u2019s in 2008, as he pointed a flashlight down a wide, green staircase to the basement.\n\nHe interrogated a possible ghost, asking questions of the air and hoping to capture on video, tape recorder or EchoVox app signs that something supernatural might be present.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty quiet,\u201d said Cardinuto, 44, of Selden. But he was undaunted: \u201cConsider it like fishing. You throw in your line and you hope you catch a fish. Every time I don\u2019t catch something, I still have fun doing it.\u201d\n\nSign up for the NewsdayTV newsletter From breaking news to special features and documentaries, the NewsdayTV team is covering the issues that matter to you. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nInterest in ghosts has become more mainstream, with shows like the Travel Channel\u2019s \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d and \u201cParanormal Caught on Camera\u201d showcasing mysterious phenomena around the world. There\u2019s also the \u201cLong Island Medium,\u201d Theresa Caputo, who claims to communicate with spirits.\n\nBut while ghost hunting may be Halloween entertainment for some, for those who believe in the paranormal \u2014 essentially anything that doesn\u2019t have a scientific explanation \u2014 it\u2019s a constant search for validation that there is indeed a reality beyond ours.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do it for entertainment purposes. We\u2019re documenting everything that happens, whether we capture something or not,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cI never expect to find anything. When it does happen, it happens.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW PARANORMAL\n\nWhether or not ghosts exist, what is certain is the popularity of the paranormal. In addition to the many television shows on the subject, there are lectures, documentaries and conventions, including The Warren\u2019s Seekers of the Supernatural Paracon in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Long Island Paranormal Investigators has grown from 17 dues-paying members five years ago to 33 today, and Stony Brook University even has a paranormal club.\n\n\u201cBack 25 years ago if you were into this, you kept it hush hush,\u201d said Cardinuto, who attended the latest Gettysburg convention in September. \u201cNow you keep it very open.\u201d\n\nAuthor and historian Kerriann Flanagan Brosky, of Huntington, had already written two books about the town\u2019s history, both of which included ghost stories, when her father died in 2005.\n\nKerriann Flanagan Brosky and paranormal investigator Joe Giaquinto at the Hallockville Museum Farm in Riverhead. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\n\u201cI had always been interested in the paranormal, even as a child,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter my father died my husband suggested I get involved in another book project to help get me past the grief I was feeling.\u201d\n\nShe said people who attended her lectures had encouraged her to write a book combining local history and ghost stories. \u201cSo at that point I decided to do so.\u201d\n\nBrosky has since written several books about the paranormal, including \u201cThe Ghosts of Long Island,\u201d \u201cHistoric Haunts of Long Island,\u201d \u201cHaunted Long Island Mysteries\u201d and \u201cHistoric Crimes of Long Island.\u201d\n\n\u201cI interview people about their experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are legitimate people. The stories combine history.\u201d\n\nBrosky often teams with paranormal investigator Joe Giaquinto, of West Sayville, on lectures and investigations at libraries, historical societies and other locations.\n\n\u201cWhat better way to teach local history than through a ghost story?\u201d Brosky said. \u201cI\u2019m a historian first, a ghost investigator second.\u201d\n\nCardinuto sets up a sensor during the investigation at Katie's of Smithtown. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nLOOKING FOR EVIDENCE\n\nCardinuto said religion started him on the road to the paranormal. \u201cI always questioned, \u2018Is there a God?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cDo you just die and that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nWhen he was 23, he said he and a few friends took a video camera to the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which operated from 1885 to 1996 and is said to be haunted. (State parks officials recently announced stepped-up patrols on the property starting Oct. 30 to discourage people from visiting the remaining buildings, which are not safe to enter.)\n\nDuring Cardinuto\u2019s visit two decades ago, he said his friends went in, heard a bang before the camera turned off on its own, and ran out. While many things could have caused both, Cardinuto said he began looking into the paranormal.\n\n\u201cWe bought some stuff (equipment used in paranormal investigations) and started looking up some locations on Long Island,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to see what people were experiencing at these locations. We started investigating.\u201d\n\nTwenty-one years and 850 investigations later, Cardinuto said he has visited many sites on Long Island that are believed by some to be haunted, including Lake Ronkonkoma, where an Indigenous princess\u2019 spirit is said to return each year to claim the life of a young man.\n\n\u201cThrough investigation and capturing evidence, a lot through audio, I feel there\u2019s something I can\u2019t explain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we die, there is something.\u201d\n\nNIGHT HIKES\n\nParanormal investigator Daniel Hoffman, 40, of Floral Park, remembers waking one night, startled at the sight of a figure balanced on the edge of his bed that he said vanished as he woke.\n\n\u201cI jumped out of my bed and turned my light on,\u201d Hoffman, a Federal Express courier, said during a Long Island Paranormal Investigators meeting in the basement of Ciro\u2019s Nice Italian Barbershop in Selden.\n\nAfter that experience, he recalled, \u201cI was becoming curious about the paranormal. Then I saw \u2018Ghost Hunters.\u2019 \u201d He realized, he said, \u201cThere were teams that do this.\u201d\n\nHoffman and other investigators often go on night hikes and visit places believed to be haunted, searching for signs of something supernatural.\n\nThe members are serious about the work they do, but they also have a sense of humor \u2014 like the moment when an electronic scream filled the room during the meeting.\n\n\u201cThat was my notification,\u201d said Bianca Perricone, 34, of Shirley, who also goes by Medium Bianca Rose. \u201cMy phone screamed to notify me that I got a text message.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Long Island Paranormal Investigators at a weekly meeting. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nCAPTURING THE SIGNS\n\nParanormal investigators apply scientific principles to occurrences that don\u2019t necessarily have clear, scientific proof. They often use ultraviolet cameras, motion sensors, Geiger counters, barometers, thermometers and video and tape recorders in their work.\n\n\u201cThe theory behind it is when a ghost is manifested, it will give off some type of radiation,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cWe use Geiger counters to detect all sorts of radiation.\u201d\n\nAttuned to any anomaly, paranormal investigators capture flickering lights, footstep-like sounds, objects moving and appearances that they believe are evidence of apparitions.\n\n\u201cWe look for orbs, which are light anomalies that appear on images that are thought to be spirits,\u201d Brosky said. \u201cIt comes in and out of the frame, so it\u2019s not a dust particle.\u201d\n\nEquipment can capture electrical and other phenomena, which they take as reinforcing the possibility, if not necessarily proof, of things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very big on trying to debunk things,\u201d said Cardinuto, who by day works with people with special needs. \u201cEven when somebody captures something in our group today, we play it and try to debunk.\u201d\n\nFear can fuel feelings and lead people to hear or imagine things that may not be there, the way someone who falls asleep watching a horror movie can have nightmares, Cardinuto said. Still, he talked about \u201cunexplained\u201d voices and images, including sounds he said his group picked up at the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe in Shoreham, which was damaged in a fire last year. \u201cWe captured some audio evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cVoices captured on audio not there at the time of the investigation.\u201d\n\nMembers do free house investigations for people who say they heard or saw disturbing things, he said. He estimated they have conducted between 100 and 125 investigations. About 20% of the time, he said they detect signs of possible paranormal activity.\n\n\u201cYou look in someone\u2019s eyes and you see the fear,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cThey have no one else to turn to.\u201d\n\n\n\nHAUNTED BY HISTORY\n\nSarah Kautz, executive director of the Southampton History Museum, said the facility has hosted paranormal investigations and welcomes groups like Cardinuto\u2019s to help pique visitors\u2019 interest in history.\n\n\u201cWe get folks coming to the museum who wouldn\u2019t come to the museum for any other reason,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sort of tricks you into learning history.\u201d\n\nHalloween is, unsurprisingly, a popular time for such events. But Kautz said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about ghost hunting. You learn about science. They use some really cool stuff. You learn about the history of the site.\u201d\n\nCardinuto\u2019s Gateway laptop has a Halloween-like ghost on it, but he, Brosky and others passionate about the paranormal are ambivalent about the Halloween rush. \u201cI love Halloween. It\u2019s skeletons and ghosts and witches,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I do.\u201d\n\nBrosky said she believes there\u2019s a hunger for information about the supernatural. \u201cPeople love ghost stories,\u201d she said. \u201cI take the creepiness out of them. What we do is positive. It\u2019s not negative, not demonic. It\u2019s not Hollywood.\u201d\n\nShe understands the reaction some have to discussions of the paranormal: \u201cIf people want to be skeptics, they can be skeptics,\u201d she said. But, Brosky added, \u201cThere are things that can\u2019t be explained.\u201d\n\nShe talks about \u201cundoing perceptions of ghosts and spirits\u201d as demonic forces. \u201cThey\u2019re not out to kill or possess you,\u201d Brosky said. \u201cLong Island is more than the \u2018Amityville Horror.\u2019 We\u2019re rich in history.\u201d\n\nKautz said the world is full of enough that\u2019s difficult to explain to prompt curiosity. \u201cCan you hear something that sounds like a voice on a frequency we can\u2019t hear with our human ears?\u201d Kautz asked. \u201cUsually, you can find something weird. Explaining it isn\u2019t that easy.\u201d\n\nWhile Cardinuto said he\u2019s searching for possible evidence of the paranormal, members of Long Island Paranormal Investigators do come away with something definite: \u201cThere is an experience you have. It\u2019s an experience you share for a lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody else goes to the beach or the casino. Who else is doing what we do?\u201d\n\nSarah Hangley takes an energy reading at Katie's. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nHoping to find their own Holy Grail \u2014 a sign that ghosts or spirits exist \u2014 some members said they enjoy the search itself. \u201cIt\u2019s an adventure \u2014 the investigation, the memories we make along the way,\u201d said Sarah Hangley, 37, of Westbury, a special education teacher who has been part of Cardinuto\u2019s group for two years. \u201cFear and the unknown make us a stronger group.\u201d\n\nCardinuto said members find camaraderie and a kind of peace in their work. \u201cThis is an outlet for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a few hours during the week, we forget about everything going on in the world.\u201d"

        "article_content": "One night, a student \u2014 St. Cloud State University alumna Rebecca Whalen, who led SCSU's Paranormal Society \u2014 went exploring for paranormal activity on campus. She and several friends looked in the rooms of Eastman Hall, eventually reconvening in the former gym.\n\nWhile in the gym, they heard a deep voice coming from the stairwell. The whole group was together and nobody else was in the building, pushing them to truly consider that there could be paranormal activity there.\n\n\"I'm definitely the one who's like, 'we have to go check it out,'\" Whalen said. \"Your adrenaline does get pumping, but also trying to be like, if we act like fools... it won't help anything.\"\n\nSCSU has a long history of alleged paranormal activity, with many people reporting seeing strange figures in buildings, or hearing bizarre sounds or footsteps when nobody is there.\n\nThere are legends about buildings such as Shoemaker Hall, which is supposedly haunted by a former student who committed suicide after an affair with an employee of the school, Riverview Hall's alleged ghost of an unknown woman and several people hearing mysterious footsteps.\n\nShoemaker Hall, located at 915 First Ave. S., is one of the oldest buildings on St. Cloud State University's campus and currently serves as a residential hall.\n\nSCSU alumna Nick Bovee-Gazett said his late father-in-law John Bovee, who was a professor in Riverview, was one of the people who heard the strange footsteps and shared his story in a student-made film called \"It Happened Here.\"\n\nAccording to Nick Bovee-Gazett, his father had been working in the building late one night and heard high-heeled footsteps coming down the hall and stop outside his room, but when he opened the door, nobody was there.\n\n\"He looks outside because he thinks there's a colleague,\" Bovee-Gazett said. \"What's strange about it was I don't think he had any female colleagues at that time, so he's like, 'who is this?'\"\n\nBovee-Gazett had his own experience at the Robert H. Wick Science Building while studying at SCSU. Late one night, he spotted a mysterious figure sitting on a ledge outside the building. The figure was dressed as though he were from a different time period. Then, the mysterious person jumped off the ledge and seemingly disappeared. When Bovee-Gazett looked down, no one was there.\n\nWhile rumors of paranormal activity at SCSU abound, university archivist Tom Steman said there has never been any documentation of the events like murders and suicides that supposedly led to campus ghosts.\n\n\"I've never seen any evidence of anything like that at all,\" he said. \"There's no way that something like that would not have been reported.\"\n\nThe James W. Miller Learning Resources Center is located at 400 Sixth St. S. and includes both classrooms and St. Cloud State University's library.\n\nHowever, Steman said it is true that the university's James W. Miller Learning Resources Center was built on top of a former cemetery from the mid-19th century. It was discovered during the 1999 groundbreaking for the current building.\n\nThe site became a hands-on learning experience for archaeology students, who discovered coffin fragments and 10 graves with skeletal remains, according to a report on the excavation.\n\nSteman said he also wonders if the alleged Riverview ghost could be a former teacher from the university's original normal school, which provided teacher training. The program's lab school was housed in Riverview Hall, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThough the existence and stories behind the ghosts that roam SCSU's campus are not concretely proven, Bovee-Gazett said he hopes the legends can help people get interested in learning more about the university.\n\n\"It's cool that there's this place in St. Cloud, that whether or not you believe in it, has this history and this tradition of having these spooky stories. It's something that kind of gives the university and the town a little bit of a fun identity,\" he said.\n\nSteman shared a similar belief, saying that he hopes the urban legends can act as a bridge that gets people interested in local history.\n\n\"These stories sort of give a glimpse into St. Cloud State's history, but as for the stories, I would love to see some proof that some of these things actually happened.\"\n\nTeagan King covers business and development for the St. Cloud Times.

        "article_content": "With continued development, we expect robotics and automation will improve the speed, precision and reproducibility of experiments across diverse instruments and disciplines, generating the data that artificial intelligence systems can analyze to guide further experimentation James Cahoon\n\nThis trial-and-error approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive, slowing the pace of discovery. Automation offers a solution. Robotic systems can perform experiments continuously without human fatigue, significantly speeding up research. Robots not only execute precise experimental steps with greater consistency than humans, they also reduce safety risks by handling hazardous substances. By automating routine tasks, scientists can focus on higher-level research questions, paving the way for faster breakthroughs in medicine, energy and sustainability.\n\n\u201cRobotics has the potential to turn our everyday science labs into automated \u2018factories\u2019 that accelerate discovery, but to do this, we need creative solutions to allow researchers and robots to collaborate in the same lab environment,\u201d said Dr. James Cahoon, a co-author of the paper and chair of the Department of Chemistry. \u201cWith continued development, we expect robotics and automation will improve the speed, precision and reproducibility of experiments across diverse instruments and disciplines, generating the data that artificial intelligence systems can analyze to guide further experimentation.\u201d\n\nThe researchers defined five levels of laboratory automation to illustrate how automation can evolve in science labs:\n\nAssistive Automation (A1): At this level, individual tasks, such as liquid handling, are automated while humans handle the majority of the work. Partial Automation (A2): Robots perform multiple sequential steps, with humans responsible for setup and supervision. Conditional Automation (A3): Robots manage entire experimental processes, though human intervention is required when unexpected events arise. High Automation (A4): Robots execute experiments independently, setting up equipment and reacting to unusual conditions autonomously. Full Automation (A5): At this final stage, robots and AI systems operate with complete autonomy, including self-maintenance and safety management.\n\nThe levels of automation defined by the researchers can be used to assess progress in the field, help in establishing appropriate safety protocols and set goals for future research in both science domains and robotics. Although lower levels of automation are common today, achieving high and full automation is a research challenge that will require robots capable of operating across different lab environments, handling complex tasks and interacting with humans and other automation systems seamlessly."

        "article_content": "Smartphones are constantly getting bigger, and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL both stretch the boundaries of what\u2019s comfortable to use with one hand. Thankfully, Apple and Google also launched the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, which offer the same premium flagship experience in a smaller, more ergonomic form factor.\n\nEach phone boasts reasons to buy it over the other, and many of these have to do with AI. Both phones also cost $1,000, So, which one should you buy? Which phone has the best mix of hardware and software, and utilizes AI in ways that will improve your life? Let\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: specs\n\nSpecs iPhone 16 Pro Pixel 9 Pro Size 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm (5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches) 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm (6.02 x 2.83 x 0.32 inches) Weight 199 grams (7.03 ounces) 199 grams (7.02 ounces) Screen 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1206 x 2622 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness 460 pixels per inch 6.3-inch OLED 1280 x 2856 pixels 120Hz dynamic refresh rate 3,000 nits peak brightness 495 pixels per inch Operating system iOS 18 Android 14, upgradable to Android 15 RAM and storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 8GB RAM 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 16GB RAM Processor Apple A18 Pro Six-core CPU Six-core GPU Google Tesnor G4 Octa-core CPU Mali-G715 GPU Camera Rear: 48-megapixels primary, f/1.8, 1/1.28\u2033, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9, 1/3.6\u2033 Rear: 50MP primary, f/1.7, 1/1.31\u2033, PDAF, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/1.7, 123\u00b0 FOV 48MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 42MP, f/2.2, PDAF Video Rear: 4K, up to 120 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Rear: 8K, up to 30fps\n\n4K, up to 60 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C Gen 3.2 DisplayPort USB-C Gen 3.2 Water resistance IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) IP68 (maximum depth of 1.5m up to 30 minutes) Battery & charging 3,582 mAh 30W fast charging 25W wireless charging via MagSafe 15W Qi2 wireless charging 4,700 mAh 27W fast charging 21W wireless charging with Pixel Stand 12W Qi wireless charging Colors Black Titanium,\n\nWhite Titanium,\n\nNatural Titanium,\n\nDesert Titanium Porcelain,\n\nRose Quartz,\n\nHazel,\n\nObsidian Price Starts at $999 Starts at $999\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: design and display\n\nBoth phones have undergone subtle changes from their predecessors, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro. Unlike previous years, both now feature near-identical specs sheets to their bigger siblings, and they both offer the same flagship experience in a smaller, more ergonomic size.\n\nThe big difference is in style: Apple uses titanium in the build of the iPhone 16 Pro, which feels lighter and more premium than the Pixel 9 Pro, which uses aluminum, but comes in more vibrant colors. Even though they weigh the same 199 grams, the iPhone 16 Pro feels slightly lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro thanks to the titanium build.\n\nThe choice of titanium also means the iPhone 16 Pro features more muted colors than the Pixel 9 Pro. The four titanium color choices are beautiful, but none are quite as vibrant as the Rose Quartz Pixel 9 Pro. The pink color choice means your Pixel 9 Pro can stand out, although there are more traditional color choices available if Pink isn\u2019t your preference.\n\nMeasuring 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm, the iPhone 16 Pro is 3mm shorter, 0.5mm narrower, and 0.25mm thinner than the Pixel 9 Pro, but they feel virtually identical in the hand. The iPhone 16 Pro also has a Camera Control button on the right side,and the Action button on the left, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a mmWave antenna cutout on the top, even in countries where mmWave isn\u2019t available.\n\nBoth phones have a 6.3-inch OLED display, with a dynamic refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The Pixel 9 Pro display is slightly higher resolution, resulting in a higher pixel density (495 pixels per inch versus 460 ppi), but the difference is minimal. The Pixel 9 Pro has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, while the iPhone 16 Pro doesn\u2019t get as dark at 2,000 nits. However, there\u2019s functionally little difference in the quality or brightness of the displays during day-to-day use.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a slightly better display, but there\u2019s no denying how good the titanium build on the iPhone 16 Pro feels in the hand. This one\u2019s a stalemate.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: performance and battery\n\nRecent Pixel devices have been plagued by problems with Google\u2019s Tensor GPU, and while Google has stuck with its chipset, the Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 Pro is vastly improved. It\u2019s designed with performance and AI in mind and fixes many of the problems in the previous generation, including poor battery life and overheating. It\u2019s paired with a whopping 16GB of RAM inside the Pixel 9 Pro, which results in fast performance that left us impressed.\n\nIn comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro is powered by the new Apple A18 Pro chipset that\u2019s designed with performance, battery life, and yes, AI, in mind. Compared to the A17 Pro chipset, it offers up to 15% faster CPU performance, 20% faster graphics performance, and 2x faster ray tracing. The neural processing unit (NPU) performance is very similar, but the improved heat dissipation on the iPhone 16 Pro means it\u2019ll be harder to overheat your iPhone.\n\nThat\u2019s what all the numbers say, but as we discovered in our iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro reviews, both phones offer excellent performance in most conditions. The A18 Pro chipset inside the iPhone 16 Pro is faster than the Tensor G4 and more likely to handle future use cases, but neither phone disappoints in the experience offered today.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro features a battery capacity of around 3,582mAh while the Pixel 9 Pro has a much larger 4,700mAh capacity. However, the tight integration of hardware and software means the iPhone 16 Pro can have a smaller technical capacity and deliver slightly better battery life than the Pixel 9 Pro. In our testing, Apple\u2019s flagship lasts up to two hours longer, but both phones offer all-day battery life with some juice to spare.\n\nBoth phones offer \u201cfast\u201d charging that is among the slowest in the industry, and both phone makers have opted to use their own standard for faster wireless charging. The iPhone 16 Pro uses MagSafe for 25-watt wireless charging, while the Pixel 9 Pro requires the Pixel Stand to achieve 21W. However, both also support the Qi standard, with the iPhone 16 Pro offering up to 15W speeds when charging with Qi2 and the Pixel 9 Pro being capable of 12W charging when connected to a Qi charger.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is very similar to the Pixel 9 Pro, but offers slightly better battery life and overall performance. The Tensor G4 is no slouch \u2014 and vastly improved over previous years \u2014 but Apple still holds the lead.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: cameras\n\nBoth phones use a triple-camera setup and advanced algorithms to capture photos at a variety of focal lengths. The Pixel 9 Pro has better hardware on paper, but each phone has its pros and cons. Google has a slight advantage in still photography and software features, but the iPhone 16 Pro is better for creators and anyone focused on video.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP periscope telephoto camera that offers up to 5x zoom. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro uses a 48MP main camera (with the Fusion branding) that captures high-resolution 24MP photos by default. There\u2019s also a 48MP ultrawide camera with a smaller f/2.2 aperture and a 12MP periscope telephoto camera that also offers up to 5x zoom.\n\nThere are many hardware similarities between these two cameras, but it\u2019s in the wider feature set where they diverge. The Pixel 9 Pro comes with features like Add Me \u2014 which makes it easy to include everyone in a group shot, even the photographer \u2014 Auto Frame in the Magic Editor, Zoom Enhance to capture more detail at higher zoom lengths, and Reimagine to help you reimagine photos using generative AI.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro also comes with a slate of camera features, although they\u2019re more geared toward creators. The Camera Control button makes it easy to launch the camera, swipe through different functions, and zoom in or out of a photo or video. The camera control button will also enable Vision Intelligence features later this year, offering a similar experience to Google Lens, where you can point the camera at something and learn more about it straightaway.\n\nThe upgrade of the ultrawide camera to 48MP offers far more detail and better color reproduction. The revamped Photography Styles allow you to tweak and refine your photos before you take them. There\u2019s also the ability to take 4K video portraits at 120 frames per second (fps), Dolby Vision recording, and improvements to audio recording. Audio Mix allows you to choose from four different styles and edit the audio in a video to match this professional style.\n\nBoth phones take fantastic photos, and personal preference will play into this. The iPhone 16 Pro ekes out a win, however, thanks to better photographic styles and video recording.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: software and updates\n\nBoth companies have made strong promises about software and updates, with Google promising seven years of security and software updates for the Pixel 9 Pro. At the same time, Apple makes no guarantees, but its phones have usually been supported for just as long, if not longer.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro launched on Android 14, but can be updated to Android 15 after the recent launch. The update for the Pixel 9 Pro brings a host of new features, including the ability to hide sensitive apps and improvements in theft protection, the ability to generate passkeys, and App Pairing. This last feature allows you to save combinations of two apps and launch them with a single tap.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, ushers in iOS 18, which introduces one of the biggest overhauls to the iPhone experience. If you\u2019re an Android user, many of the new features in iOS 18 will feel familiar, because it\u2019s the closest that the iPhone has ever come to replicating the Android experience.\n\nSome of the biggest iOS 18 features include a customizable home screen \u2014 you can finally move apps wherever you want \u2014 a customizable control center, a new private folder for your apps, and the ability to lock apps behind a paywall. There are also huge overhauls of Apple Photos, new features in iMessage, support for the RCS standard for messaging, a new Passwords manager, and much more. It\u2019s a huge overhaul of the iPhone experience.\n\nBoth companies are also betting big on AI. Google dedicated much of its Pixel event to showcasing the power of Gemini as your voice assistant. There are new tools for creating and editing images, custom weather reports, a new screenshots app, and many more features that leverage Generative AI to usher in a host of new features.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro also bets big on AI, but takes a different approach. Apple Intelligence powers the revamped Siri, but it isn\u2019t launching until later this month. The full rollout of the new Apple Intelligence features won\u2019t be available until early next year, and while features like Apple Intelligence Summaries are some of the best use cases for AI, it\u2019ll take six months from launch for the iPhone 16 Pro to get the full suite of AI features.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro comes with one year of Gemini Advanced for free (after which, it\u2019s $20 per month), while the Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone 16 Pro are entirely free \u2014 except for the ChatGPT integration, which uses your existing subscription \u2014 although Apple may choose to charge for some features in the future.\n\nBoth phones focus on AI, and while Apple Intelligence has a lot of promise, the delay in launch means the Pixel 9 Pro offers better overall software and AI features right now.\n\nWinner: Pixel 9 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: price and availability\n\nBoth phones cost $999 for 128GB of storage, and each charges a $100 premium for the 256GB version. The Pixel 9 Pro costs $1,219 for the 512GB and $1,449 for the 1TB models, while the iPhone 16 Pro costs $1,299 and $1,499, respectively.\n\nThings get a little confusing when you consider the Pixel 9 Pro colors, however. The Porcelain and Hazel colors only come with up to 512GB of storage, while the Rose Quartz model is bizarrely only available with 256GB of storage. If you want the top storage, you have to go for the Obsidian (aka Black) color.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is far simpler. The four titanium color choices \u2014 Natural Titanium, White Titanium, Black Titanium, and the hero, Desert Titanium \u2014 are available in all storage options.\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: verdict\n\nTwo similar phones, from two companies that you\u2019ve heard of. This sums up this comparison, at least on paper. Once you dive in, you realize that the differences are subtle, but they do exist.\n\nBoth phones weigh the same, but the iPhone 16 Pro feels lighter. The cameras are very similar, and each camera excels in different ways. Even the software is fairly similar, with iOS 18 taking great strides to offer Android-esque levels of customization.\n\nWhich smartphone is best depends on which platform you prefer. If you prefer iOS, then buy the iPhone 16 Pro. For Android lovers, the Pixel 9 Pro is a fantastic smartphone. If you want to make the switch in either direction, there\u2019s no better time, but if you\u2019re thinking of switching to Android, it\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro is a great alternative, but the OnePlus 12 is the best Android alternative to the iPhone."

        "article_content": "Computing-veteran International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) issued its first dividend check in 1913, and the quarterly payouts have never stopped. The company has also been raising its payout per share for 28 years, and that trend should continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nIBM Dividend Chart\n\nIBM Dividend data by YCharts.\n\nTherefore, I can't tell you the exact amount of IBM's dividend payments in 2025. The company will probably raise the payout in June, as it has done every year since 1995.\n\nI suppose that IBM will issue a symbolic quarterly dividend boost of $0.01 per share next year, resulting in a full calendar-year payout of $6.71 per share. Management might have more bullish ideas, though.\n\nIBM's free cash flow has been rising in the last couple of earnings reports. If the trend of stronger cash profits stays on track, I wouldn't be surprised to see Big Blue boosting the payout by more than $0.01 next summer.\n\nIBM's potential dividend adjustments\n\nIf you'd rather view IBM's dividend payouts in the form of total dividend expenses, even a larger quarterly boost next year would probably land the full-year dividend expense within a rounding error of $6.2 billion. That's just over half of this fiscal year's expected free cash flow of at least $12 billion and probably a smaller portion of next year's growing cash profits.\n\nIBM's profits are booming, thanks to strong software sales and a rising presence in the market for enterprise-class artificial intelligence (AI) services. The watsonx generative AI platform now has more than $3 billion of orders in the books, up from $2 billion three months ago. Most of those orders are for consulting services, rather than software licenses, underscoring the unique business advantage of IBM's robust consulting segment.\n\nIBM should pay dividends of at least $6.71 per share next year, adding up to roughly $6.2 billion in total dividend expenses. And these costs are becoming a smaller portion of IBM's growing cash flow.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
