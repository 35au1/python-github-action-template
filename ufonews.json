        "article_content": "Carl Petrick is a sky-watcher.\n\nThe East Moline resident and Moline native is a retired longtime zookeeper at Niabi Zoo. He studies his surroundings with scientific attention. Science is his religion, Petrick said. The 66-year-old just wants to figure it all out.\n\n\u201cMoving things,\u201d in particular, are fascinating to him. He\u2019s an avid bird-watcher. Birds\u2019 camouflaging abilities, their ability to fly into the wind, their speed \u2014 it\u2019s all impressive to Petrick.\n\n\u201cPeople are smart, but we can't do some of the things they do,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrick is willing to go to great lengths to identify birds he spots in local parks \u2014 once, he chased a bird 50 yards just to get answers after he glimpsed it through a bush. Eventually, he tracked it down.\n\nBut there\u2019s one flyer that got away. It\u2019s nagged at him for more than 50 years.\n\nPetrick is one of several Quad-Citians who reported seeing UFOs over several days in early March 1967. At the time, Petrick was a 9-year-old student at Sacred Heart Catholic School, now Seton Catholic, in Moline.\n\nThe record of this local UFO phenomenon, which stretched across multiple counties in western Illinois, is part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs in the 1950s and 1960s, a time of heightened concern due to the Cold War.\n\nNuns, sheriff\u2019s deputies, elementary students and more reported seeing something in the sky that spring.\n\nThe story is still vivid in Petrick\u2019s head.\n\nIf he stares long enough at a wall, he can close his eyes and see it like it was yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s not an airplane\n\nPetrick saw it between 2 and 3 p.m., as he went back inside for class, he said. The weather was chilly but clear.\n\n\u201cI looked up and I saw something in the distance,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nTo his naked eye, the object in the western sky looked like a spot or a small silvery thing. He estimated its height to be like that of airplanes when they emit contrails as they fly over.\n\nAs Petrick watched the object, Bill Fisher, a Moline police officer, came around the corner. The officer had binoculars or a movie camera with him. Fisher looked at the object then handed the instrument he carried to Petrick.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d the police officer asked the boy.\n\nWith the instrument\u2019s assistance, Petrick saw a silver, cigar-shaped object with what Petrick described as three long windows along the side. Those windows were powder blue, like the jersey shade of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe thing was not moving and Petrick estimated its length to be between 20 and 40 feet.\n\nPetrick told Fisher the thing was not an airplane, then the police officer said he had to go.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last I saw of him,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nThat day, Fisher recorded the object with a portable 8mm movie camera. He and his recording would be a central part of the Air Force\u2019s investigation.\n\nAfter Fisher left, Petrick watched the object for about 10 more minutes before returning to class, he said. About 30 or 45 minutes later, he came back outside.\n\n\u201cIt was still there,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nAt home a short time later, he observed it again with his father and brother, using a small telescope. The object still had not moved and its appearance remained the same.\n\nPetrick does not know what the object was, but he said he knows what it wasn\u2019t. It was not a bird or a butterfly, he said. It was not an airplane, helicopter or zeppelin.\n\nBy the process of elimination, he concluded it was a UFO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, so obviously and logically, it would be unidentified,\u201d he said. \u201cJust common sense.\u201d\n\nNow decades removed from the event, Petrick said he does not think the object had a human origin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just observing us like we observe.\u201d\n\nPetrick said he saw the object in the same place in the sky for several days after those initial sightings.\n\nThen, one day, it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nInitially, he thought it might have moved. After a bit more time, he decided it was gone for good.\n\nDuck and cover\n\nAt the time of the Quad-Cities sighting, the Cold War was in full swing. The rivalry between America and the Soviet Union even extended into space.\n\nPetrick remembered a childhood game he and his friends played, inspired by the monthly emergency siren tests. When they heard the siren, the children would pretend the Russians were attacking.\n\nPeople feared a nuclear holocaust, Petrick said. Incidents like the Bay of Pigs had occurred and the conflict in Vietnam was heating up.\n\n\u201cWe were so inundated with the Cold War\u2019s \u2018Russians are bad, we\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d Petrick said.\n\nHe also described an exercise he had to do at school: the duck-and-cover drill.\n\n\u201cIf the siren goes off, get under your desk because if a bomb explodes, you\u2019ll be protected,\u201d he said.\n\nShould they find themselves in the hallway, children were supposed to get against the wall and cover themselves as best they could, he said.\n\nThe school phased that drill out while he was still a student.\n\nThere was also a big emphasis on science in school because of the Cold War. The Russians had their Sputnik satellite. The Americans were after the Moon.\n\nAfter he saw the object in the sky that day, Petrick said, he considered, then discarded, the possibility that another nation was behind it.\n\n\u201cIf it was Russian or Chinese or whatever, you think it would have been attacking the States or would have been doing something to throw us off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sat there.\u201d\n\nNot just Petrick\n\nPetrick wasn\u2019t the only person in the Quad-Cities who spotted a UFO that week. The local newspapers covered the phenomenon extensively.\n\nJames Maifield, of Silvis, reported that he and his wife spotted a \u201cwhite light\u201d in the sky for several minutes. An anonymous Silvis police dispatcher told the Moline Dispatch she saw a \u201cweird\u201d white light, too.\n\nGary Bennett, an Augustana College student, told the Times-Democrat he saw an \u201cunfamiliar airborne vehicle\u201d around 9:30 p.m. on March 9.\n\nArnold Buchmeyer, Helen DeRocker and Leo Schmitz, all of Moline, separately reported to the Times-Democrat that they saw something strange in the sky, too. Schmitz said it was \u201cvery white\u201d and \u201cmoving northwesterly.\u201d\n\nA Northwestern University astronomer speculated that it was just the planet Venus.\n\nThe weekend after the sightings, pranksters were caught deploying a balloon with a candle that crash-landed in Rock Island. A similar balloon was found near the Monmouth waste disposal plant on Thursday, March 9, pieced together with soda straws.\n\nJimmie Scott, a 12-year-old from Buffalo, Iowa, told the Times-Democrat he got out of bed around 2 a.m. on March 9 to get a drink of water. He looked into the sky and saw a \u201cbright, white object that looked like a saucer.\u201d\n\nHis sketch of the saucer was published on the front pages of the Times-Democrat.\n\nThe principal witness, though, was Fisher, the Moline officer who greeted Petrick on the campus of Sacred Heart.\n\nThe star witness\n\nAfter the Quad-Cities area sightings drew the attention of the federal government, Fisher was interviewed at length by the U.S. Air Force, who sent Capt. Edward Orenic and Capt. Anton Kato to investigate.\n\nAfter their visit, they produced a 94-page report on their methods, avenues of inquiry and conclusions. The report is available online through the U.S. National Archives.\n\nThe two captains cast a wide net, the report shows. Their efforts included interviewing witnesses and collecting weather data. They also checked with regional military, airport and National Weather Service officials for aircraft and weather balloon flights as well as for reports of anything strange.\n\nOrenic and Kato took particular interest in Fisher\u2019s account and the footage he took.\n\nThe officer told the Air Force that he was initially at Sacred Heart on March 9 to deliver a message to his son, a student there. He arrived around 1:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I glanced upward above the treetops and viewed a object that I was not sure of its description or its identity,\u201d he told investigators.\n\nHe described the object as \u201cU-shaped \u2014 like a pickle,\u201d and said he watched it for \u201ca precious minute and a half.\u201d Soon after, he began shooting footage with his 8mm camera, using a telescopic lens and outdoor film. The footage is also available online in the U.S. National Archives.\n\nFisher told the Dispatch in 2015 that he kept the camera in storage on his motorcycle, aware that UFO rumors were already swirling in town.\n\n\u201cThere were stories all around,\u201d he told the Dispatch. \u201cI was just naturally curious.\u201d\n\nAfter he arrived on the campus, Fisher says the object then began moving \u201cnorthwesterly\u201d away from him. It \u201cappeared to have stopped\u201d and hovered, he said, and then it continued its pace until it faded from view.\n\n\u201cBefore it faded away here, before it got completely obscure, I did have a definite sighting of a metallic, shiny surface on the side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe side that was the broad side to me, was metallic and appeared to be of the same construction like some of our large aircrafts that I\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n\nAs he stood at the school, Fisher asked several kids and a state policeman\u2019s wife about what they saw. The woman told him it \u201clooked shiny and reflected a white light.\u201d Fisher said he didn\u2019t spot any lights or objects connected to the craft. He heard no sound emitted from the object, but the woman reported a hissing or whirring sound.\n\nIn the report, captains Orenic and Kato also highlighted the accounts of two sheriff\u2019s deputies, one from Knox County and the other from Henry County.\n\nThe Knox County deputy\u2019s account was that early on March 6, 1967, he saw a flying object.\n\nHis account included that it was shaped like an upside-down bowl, the report states. It had a glowing red base and at one point emitted a bright beam of white light.\n\nThe deputy from Henry County saw something in the sky late on March 8, the report states.\n\nThe deputy\u2019s description included that the object was framed by three lights \u2014 one red, one white and one green. Periodically it would emit an intense red light bright enough to obscure the other three lights.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict?\n\nOrenic and Kato concluded at the end of the report that the sightings most likely involved the mundane.\n\nIn Fisher\u2019s case, the object was most likely an air vehicle \u2013 a plane or helicopter, the report states. In another part of the report, Orenic and Kato also state it could have been a balloon.\n\n\u201cThe description, duration and flight characteristics are similar to that of a balloon,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe 8mm film failed to reveal any information that would dispute this evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe captains said the Henry County deputy\u2019s sighting was also likely an aircraft.\n\nThe Knox County sighting was probably of a home-made hot air balloon created using a garment bag, similar to the one Rock Island pranksters made the weekend of March 12, and the one recovered in the Monmouth area. The method of making the balloons had been published in a national magazine, the report states.\n\nDuring that period, two red kites along with batteries and a light bulb were also recovered in the Galesburg area, according to the report.\n\nNearly all the witnesses Orenic and Kato interviewed appeared extremely reliable but had a \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d or an attitude of \u201cthought I\u2019d never see a saucer,\u201d the report states.\n\nThose attitudes, the extensive news coverage and prank launchings appeared to have caused wide-spread UFO sightings, the captains wrote.\n\nStill looking, still believing\n\nIn 2015, the year before Fisher\u2019s death at the age of 81, the Dispatch interviewed him about the incident. They asked how he felt about investigators pointing out his affinity for science fiction and \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d \u2014 the report said, for example, that Fisher \u201cwatches the sky every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nThe former officer told the Dispatch he felt investigators were fishing for statements like that. But Fisher remained \u201cadamant that he saw what he saw,\u201d even years later.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what it was, but it most certainly wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d the Dispatch wrote. \u201cAnd several other people saw it and were startled by it, too.\u201d\n\nPetrick also stands by his story. He said he never read the conclusions of the Air Force, but he doesn\u2019t mind skepticism. Like Fisher, he knows what he saw.\n\n\u201cPeople believe in love,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cCan you prove it? Can you prove it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also quick to point out that his interest in the UFO comes from a place of scientific curiosity, not opportunity. It\u2019s the bird that got away.\n\nPetrick jokes about his father, whose experience with the unknown was a little different. Milton Petrick lived in rural New Jersey when Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of The Worlds\u201d went over the radio the night before Halloween in 1938. Milton and his buddies saw through the radio play\u2019s facade, but took it as a chance to improve the town.\n\n\u201cThey went down with their shotguns and rifles and shot the water tower, called the police and said, \u2018Yeah, we just killed a Martian,\u2019\u201d Petrick laughs. \u201cThey got their new water tower out of it.\u201d\n\nPetrick, though, isn\u2019t looking for a new water tower. He\u2019s just looking for answers. To this day, the 66-year-old scans the western sky almost daily, longing to see the UFO again. The uncertainty, though, is a sort of gift.\n\n\u201cEverybody has beliefs that they can't prove,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cWhich is actually a good thing, or life would be boring.\u201d\n\nWhile walking around the grounds of his old elementary school on a recent fall day, Petrick\u2019s voice rattled with a certain giddiness. He shuffled his feet along the sidewalk. Every time he found the perfect spot to recreate the memory, he\u2019d find an even better one a few inches over.\n\n\u201cNow it really hits home,\u201d Petrick said, aligning a triangle between the rightmost spire on the church steeple and the roof of the school.\n\nHe lingered in the neighborhood for about a half hour, in awe of the sky. Waiting, perhaps, for an answer to appear. The weather conditions were similar to those in 1967. The sky was clear and a seasonal chill lingered in the air.\n\nFor a moment, a plane flew overhead to the north. Petrick estimated it was about the same size as the UFO of 1967. The jet left contrails behind, but they faded after a few minutes.\n\nPetrick kept on looking, raising his hand to his forehead to block out the sun \u2014 a salute, of sorts, to the puzzling sky."

According to an unlisted article seen by 9to5Mac, the company wants to show a summary of users\u2019 app reviews before they download a new app.\n\nThe Apple blog says there\u2019s no clear example of what these App Store summaries could look like. However, they will possibly be made by Apple rather than using local processing. This upcoming feature will help users understand the most usual feedback about an app, whether it\u2019s worth buying/downloading or not.\n\nDevelopers will also be able to report if they consider a summary \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Here\u2019s how Apple explains this feature:\n\n\u201cAn app may have a summary that highlights the most common customer feedback and sentiment in user reviews about the app. The summaries are refreshed as new reviews are added. Summaries are available in select countries and regions and for apps with enough reviews to provide a summary. They appear on the app\u2019s product page.

If it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence in some way, that means the US App Store will be the first to get the App Store summaries, followed by other English-speaking countries.\n\nThis new feature could be part of Apple\u2019s ideas to prevent users from downloading fraudulent apps. Over the years, BGR reported on several copycat and fraudulent apps trying to deceive users and even passing Apple\u2019s App Store review process. If a summary suggests that an app doesn\u2019t work as intended, it might help users steer clear of it.\n\n9to5Mac says a launch is expected soon, as this feature can already be found in the App Store API. We\u2019ll let you know once Apple makes this new feature official."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nMicrosoft unveiled an ambitious expansion of its artificial intelligence tools on Tuesday, introducing GitHub Copilot for Azure and a suite of developer-focused features that could fundamentally change how software is built in the AI era. The move represents Microsoft\u2019s boldest attempt yet to dominate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI application development.\n\nAt the heart of the announcement is a deceptively simple idea: eliminate the cognitive burden that developers face when switching between different tools and interfaces. It\u2019s a problem that, according to Microsoft, costs developers an average of 23 minutes of productivity each time they context switch.\n\n\u201cDevelopers today need to reach a heightened state of focus, because they\u2019re creating a mental model about the application they\u2019re trying to create. Having to interface with lots of different tools creates a huge amount of cognitive overload,\u201d said Amanda Silver, CVP of Product for Microsoft\u2019s Developer Division, in an interview with VentureBeat.\n\nThe setup interface for OpenAI GPT-4 on GitHub guides developers through creating personal access tokens and integrating AI models into their workflows, reflecting Microsoft\u2019s efforts to simplify AI implementation within coding environments. (Credit: Microsoft/GitHub)\n\nThe rise of the AI engineer\n\nThe timing of Microsoft\u2019s announcement is particularly significant. As organizations rush to integrate AI capabilities into their applications, a new category of software developer is emerging \u2014 what industry insiders are calling the \u201cAI engineer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think about the app workload from here on now, what developers are going to be doing, both in enterprises, commercial and even consumer, is going to be integrating intelligence into those applications,\u201d explains Mario Rodriguez, Chief Product Officer at GitHub. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the rise of the AI engineer.\u201d\n\nThis shift represents more than just a new job title. It signals a fundamental change in how software is conceived, built, and deployed. Traditional software development follows a predictable pattern: code, build, debug, repeat. But AI development introduces new complexities, including model evaluation, prompt engineering, and managing the inherently probabilistic nature of AI outputs.\n\nA developer interacts with GitHub Copilot for Azure, using the AI-powered assistant to create and deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application, part of Microsoft\u2019s initiative to streamline AI development within familiar coding environments like Visual Studio Code. (Credit: Microsoft)\n\nBreaking down the technical barriers\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new tools aim to address these challenges head-on. GitHub Copilot for Azure acts as an AI-powered assistant that lives within popular coding environments like Visual Studio Code. It can help developers manage cloud resources, deploy applications, and even troubleshoot issues without leaving their primary workspace.\n\nThe company is also introducing AI App Templates, which can be deployed \u201cin as little as five minutes.\u201d These templates support various AI frameworks and integrate with popular tools from vendors like Arize, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Pinecone \u2014 a clear acknowledgment that AI development requires a diverse ecosystem of tools.\n\nFor smaller teams and individual developers, these tools could level the playing field. \u201cExperimenters and tinkerers can be very successful with all of these tools,\u201d Silver noted. \u201cWhen we think about the developer design point, it really is for creative developers exploring on their own.\u201d\n\nThe business implications\n\nThe stakes are enormous. As enterprises race to integrate AI capabilities into their applications, the tools and platforms they choose today could lock them into specific ecosystems for years to come. Microsoft, with its ownership of GitHub and its Azure cloud platform, is uniquely positioned to capture this market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of at this stage right now where we\u2019re starting to see Copilot go from single-threaded to multi-threaded,\u201d Rodriguez explained. \u201cWe\u2019re going from single model to multi-model\u2026 from single file editing to multi-file editing.\u201d\n\nThis evolution reflects a broader trend in the industry: the move toward more sophisticated, AI-powered development tools that can handle increasingly complex tasks. Microsoft\u2019s announcement includes new capabilities for model evaluation and A/B testing at scale through GitHub Actions, allowing developers to automatically assess metrics like coherence and fluency as part of their deployment workflows.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWhile Microsoft\u2019s new tools are impressive, they also raise important questions about the future of software development. As AI assistants become more capable, the line between human and machine contributions to code will blur. This could have profound implications for how we think about software authorship, liability, and intellectual property.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft\u2019s integration of GitHub Copilot with Azure represents a significant advantage in the ongoing cloud wars with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. With 95% of Fortune 500 companies already using Azure, Microsoft\u2019s enhanced developer tools could help it further consolidate its position in enterprise AI.\n\nThe tools begin rolling out in preview this week as part of GitHub Universe, the company\u2019s annual developer conference. Their success could determine not just Microsoft\u2019s position in the AI race, but also how the next generation of software gets built.\n\nFor developers, the message is clear: the future of software development is AI-first, and it\u2019s arriving faster than many expected. As Silver puts it, these tools allow developers to \u201celiminate having to do the repetitive and the tedious and mundane and focus on the creative aspects of your job.\u201d\n\nWhether this vision of AI-assisted development becomes the new normal will depend on how developers embrace these tools \u2014 and how Microsoft\u2019s competitors respond to this latest evolution in the developer experience."

        "article_content": "Set in the Victorian-era heart of the Highland village of Strathpeffer is a beautiful pavilion.\n\nBuilt more than 140 years ago, its visitors have included suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and The Beatles.\n\nBut after recent strange goings-on, there are some who believe the place is haunted.\n\nI joined BBC Scotland's The Social and paranormal investigators trying to unravel the mystery.\n\nThe Social's Grace Nicoll poses next to a photograph of Anne Hay-Mackenzie, the Countess of Cromartie [BBC]\n\nIt's a warm autumn afternoon and we have Strathpeffer Pavilion to ourselves.\n\nOur group includes a team from Highland Paranormal, the north of Scotland's oldest established paranormal society. It has investigated more than 180 sites across Scotland.\n\nWe're here because of seemingly unexplained events.\n\nOn occasions, when the building was closed, internal CCTV activated and filmed what looked like mist rising in the hall and lights turning on and off in the bar.\n\nA decorator working alone also reported hearing doors slamming and then a growl in his ear.\n\nParanormal investigators Liam Shand, Lyn Reid and Lindsay Dunn have been searching for proof of spirits.\n\nLiam says: \"As a group our philosophy is always to look for the logical.\n\n\"If a door opens is it a draught? If we can't find that draught you then have to go down the route of did someone push that door?\"\n\nNear the main entrance we pass a photograph of a woman who could be our first ghost.\n\nAnne Hay-Mackenzie, Countess of Cromartie, was a key figure in Strathpeffer's transformation from a farm to a bustling spa resort.\n\nWealthy Victorians travelled from as far as London believing the local sulphur and iron-rich water had healing powers.\n\nThe countess helped plan the village and designed its pavilion.\n\nThe aristocrat glares back from her photograph.\n\nMaybe she was pretending to be annoyed or was in bad mood at the time the picture was taken.\n\nIt's said she had a deep dislike of her husband, the 3rd Duke of Sutherland.\n\nLooking towards the balcony inside the pavilion [BBC]\n\nMap\n\nOur group heads up to a balcony overlooking the hall.\n\nMen have reported feeling uncomfortable in this part of the building, and Highland Paranormal suspects the countess is the cause.\n\nThe investigators have equipment they say can provide clues to potential paranormal activity.\n\nThey have EMF meters to detect changes in electromagnetic fields, audio recorders and a camera.\n\nA set of dowsing rods are handed round for us to try.\n\nThey are similar to divining rods some claim can be used to find water, and that UK water companies have used in the past to search for underground pipes.\n\nIn paranormal investigations ghosts are asked to move the rods to answer \"yes\" and \"no\" to questions.\n\nBBC producer David Gray makes his first attempt at using the rods.\n\nAfter a few questions, he asks if there is a spirit could it point to where presenter Grace Nicoll is standing.\n\nThe rods slowly swing towards Grace.\n\n\u201dThey like you,\u201d says David.\n\nThe dowsing rods used during the investigation [BBC]\n\nHighland Paranormal's spirit box on the balcony at Strathpeffer Pavilion [BBC]\n\nNext, a spirit box is set up.\n\nIt's an electronic system that rapidly shifts between AM frequencies as part of a process paranormal investigators claim can be manipulated by ghosts to form words.\n\nIt fizzes with white noise punctuated by short bursts of music and words.\n\nSomeone in our group asks if we should leave the balcony. The word \"yes\" crackles from the device.\n\nIt's decided to bid the countess, if she's there, farewell and investigate a small upstairs attic on the other side of the hall.\n\nSince arriving, we've been hearing soft thuds and knocks from that side of the building.\n\nJust the sunny day causing an old building to creak and groan, or something uncanny?\n\nWe cross the hall. On its wooden floor the team has placed \"triggers\", clusters of objects that might be familiar to a ghost.\n\nFor this investigation they include war medals and bandages.\n\nDuring World War One the pavilion was a US Navy hospital and the hall was lined with beds filled with casualties.\n\nIt's been suggested a nurse and an injured sailor are among our spooks.\n\nAlso on the floor are cat toys, little plastic balls that light up when touched.\n\nI accidentally kick one sending it skittering across the floor, and causing a brief moment of excitement before I apologetically explain it was me and not a ghost.\n\nGrace tries out dowsing rods in the attic [BBC]\n\nFrom a darkened corridor we climb a narrow, twisting flight of stairs to the attic.\n\nThe room is small with a low roof and it's hot from the pavilion's heating.\n\nThe spirit of a young person is said to haunt the attic and Liam soon reports a spike in activity on a meter.\n\nThe dowsing rods are handed to Grace who, like David, has been trying them for the first time.\n\nShe asks if the spirit is happy to see us. The rods cross indicating \"yes\".\n\nGrace asks if it can spin a rod, and it duly starts to spin rapidly.\n\nShe asks if it can spin the other rod, and it too spins round and round.\n\nSo, is the activity ghosts? Lyn and Lindsay say what we've encountered cannot be easily explained away, and believe in the possibility of at least three spirits.\n\n'Audio illusion'\n\nHayley Stevens, a writer for The Sceptic magazine and a researcher of paranormal activity for about 20 years, suggests not.\n\nShe says involuntary muscle movements can cause dowsing rods to move.\n\n\"It's like why we close our eyes when we sneeze - things we don't do on purpose but our body does to respond to a situation,\" she says.\n\n\"I have this golden rule of ghost-hunting - if you have to touch something to allow the spirit to move it then it's you that's moving it.\"\n\nHayley says spirit boxes might pick up frequencies used by radio stations or taxi offices, creating an \"audio illusion\".\n\n\"Humans are very good pattern-seekers and find meaning in the random,\" she says.\n\nHayley adds: \"The power of expectation is always going to have a role here, and the power of suggestion.\n\n\"If you are told a lady haunts a location the chances are you are going to interpret sounds as being associated with that ghost.\"\n\nBoth sceptic and believer could probably walk away from Starthpeffer satisfied.\n\nWhile we were packing up to leave there was a thud above us.\n\nThe sound came from a vent where the attic is.\n\nAn old building settling in the cool of the late afternoon, or a cheeky ghost saying \"cheerio\"?\n\nMore on this story\n\nRelated internet links"

        "article_content": "Estimated read time: 5-6 minutes\n\nMAGNA \u2014 For more than a decade, Brandon Barrick was a skeptic. He'd heard tales from the late night stage crew. The glimpses of a soldier standing at the banister. A woman in white pacing across the second-floor windows. But until Barrick experienced paranormal activity firsthand, he wasn't convinced the Great Saltair was haunted.\n\nThe Great Saltair, built in 1893 on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, was a mainstay for early Utah settlers until it burned down for a second time in 1970. The site was rebuilt in 1981 and is now a venue for concerts and other entertainment events.\n\nOnce considered \"The Coney Island of the West,\" modern ghost-sighting lore has made the Great Saltair a hub for paranormal investigations.\n\nWhen Saltair's permanent stage crew used to work back-to-back shows, they'd stay overnight at the venue. \"They had some pretty crazy stories about, you know, seeing things at night, hearing things,\" Barrick, a Great Saltair employee of 15 years who is currently the events coordinator, told the Deseret News.\n\n\"The owner and even myself, when I started, we kind of chalked it up to those guys are kind of sleep deprived . ... Because at that point, neither one of us had seen anything really strange out here.\"\n\nThen, a paranormal experience in 2020 prompted Barrick to reconsider his skepticism.\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic, a film crew expressed interest in using the Saltair as a backdrop. The building had been vacated for six months at that point, and most of the interior was caked in dust. So Barrick, the building's owner and two others returned to the venue to prep for the film crew. As they tidied up, all four heard children's laughter.\n\n\"We all heard the same thing, and we thought it was coming from outside the building,\" Barrick said. \"We all went out to look and walked the entire perimeter of the building, and there was nobody out there.\n\n\"So that was pretty weird. That was something.\"\n\nCorey Rue, an investigator with Mysteries and Legends Paranormal, sets up a movement detecting device while leading a group during a paranormal event hosted at the Great Saltair in Magna on Saturday. (Photo: Brice Tucker, Deseret News)\n\n'Coney Island of the West'\n\nAlmost nothing from the original Great Saltair exists today.\n\n\"The (Saltair) that's out there now is actually on a completely different site, and its only connection (to the original) is using the name and a bad copy of the architecture,\" Ian Christensen, a researcher who is currently writing a book on the history of the Great Saltair, told The Deseret News.\n\nBut the \"main difference\" between the original Saltair and its modern rebuild has nothing to do with its architecture, Christensen said. The biggest difference? The original Saltair was \"world famous.\"\n\nOriginally constructed in 1893, the Great Saltiar was envisioned as a \"Coney Island of the West.\" The site was comprised of several different structures \u2014 a 130-foot tall main pavilion named The Saltair Palace, a bathhouse on the Great Salt Lake, a boardwalk and a railroad to bring visitors in from the city.\n\nPhoto: Deseret Morning News Archives\n\nIt was once home to the world's largest wooden roller coaster, a 10,000-occupancy dance floor, a merry-go-round, musicals, bowling, Skee-Ball and Utah's first movie theater.\n\nAt its peak, in 1924, the Great Saltair attracted half a million visitors a year from around the world.\n\nTragedy struck the flourishing amusement park in April 1925, when an electrical fire burned the Great Saltair to the ground. It was rebuilt the following year, but could never attract the same-sized crowds as it had before. In 1958, the amusement park was boarded up and closed for good.\n\nFor over a decade, the site sat abandoned. Then for a second time, in 1970, the Saltair caught fire. Police suspected arson, but no one was ever caught.\n\nIn 1981, the Saltair was rebuilt roughly one mile from the original site. It's now located off westbound I-80, providing greater accessibility to guests while still not far from the Great Salt Lake.\n\nThe rebuild was done quickly and on a budget. \"An old aircraft hangar ... bought from Hill Air Force Base,\" was used to construct the heart of the modern Saltair, Christensen said.\n\nWithin two years of the rebuild, tragedy struck the venue for a third time. Salt Lake City's 1983 flood submerged the main floor of the Saltair under five feet of water. It wasn't until the late 1980s that the water fully receded.\n\nIn 1992, Walter Plumb restored the flood-stricken building and added a stage for local musicians and performers. The Great Saltair reopened in 1993 and was sold to its current owner, Ian Morehouse, in 2005. It is currently used as an entertainment venue.\n\nA single piece of the original Saltair lives inside its modern successor. In a room behind the stage, strapped to a column is a plank of wood, collected from the original Saltair's boardwalk.\n\nTo the believer, this plank is considered \"active\" for paranormal events, Barrick said during a tour of the building. It's one of many spaces within the building that attracts ghost hunters searching for a paranormal experience.\n\nInvestigators walk down a staircase during a paranormal event hosted by Mysteries and Legends Paranormal at the Great Saltair in Magna on Saturday. The staircase is supposed to have many paranormal stories of its own, originally being from the historic Hotel Utah. (Photo: Brice Tucker, Deseret News)\n\nGhost hunters flock to The Great Saltair in search of paranormal activity\n\nOn a Saturday night in October, a few dozen amateur and expert ghost hunters gathered at the Great Saltair to take part in a paranormal investigation. Hunters hoped for communication with one of Saltair's resident ghosts, or perhaps, a phantom who followed them inside.\n\nThe investigation was led by Grimm Ghost Adventures, a local group of expert paranormal investigators who have led similar investigations at the Saltair several times in the past.\n\nExpert hunters estimate Saltair is home to 10 ghosts, but there are only a handful who have been sighted frequently. As far as experts can tell, none of these ghosts are connected to the site's predecessor.\n\nRead the full article at Deseret.com"

Listen to this article using the player above. \u2716\n\nRead time: 16 minutes\n\nThe theme for this year\u2019s Black History Month is \u201cReclaiming Narratives\u201d, which emphasizes recognizing and correcting the narratives of Black history and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is of particular importance in science because throughout history, Black scientists have made significant discoveries that have shaped the world we live in today despite being oppressed, refused jobs and often not given the recognition they deserve or having their stories told. A prime example of this is depicted in the movie Hidden Figures, which retells the story of four Black female scientists (Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan and Christine Darden) who were instrumental in the launch of the NASA astronaut John Glenn into orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoincidentally, Black History Month occurs at the same time as the Nobel Prizes are awarded; however, no Black scientist has ever won a science Nobel. This includes pioneers such as Charles Henry Turner, the first Black scientist to publish in Science for his groundbreaking research on animal behavior, through to Kizzmekia Corbett, the immunologist who successfully led the team that developed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough only a few may be aware of these breakthroughs, by reclaiming the narratives, it gives an opportunity for the voices of today\u2019s Black scientists to be heard and enables them to take ownership of their own narratives. This article highlights several inspiring men and women working across academia and industry within drug development and discovery who are breaking barriers and regaining ownership of their own narratives.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Ijeoma Uchegbu.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Uchegbu is a distinguished nanoscientist who gained her PhD from the University of London. Her PhD focused on drug delivery using nanosystems, which led to her identifying a nanoparticle that could be used for drug delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is currently serving as the 7th president of Wolfson College at the University of Cambridge. Prior to her current role, she served as a professor of pharmaceutical nanoscience at University College London (UCL) and the chief scientific officer of Nanomerics Ltd, a spin-out from UCL specializing in the drug delivery of hydrophobic drugs, nucleic acids and peptides.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has also been a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion and, whilst at UCL, was Pro-Vice Provost for Africa and the Middle East, and the Provosts\u2019 Envoy for Race Equality. She is also a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and British Society of Pharmacology, a governor on the Wellcome board (one of largest biomedical research charities) and a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer pioneering work, in which she designed polymers that could self-assemble into nanoparticles, led to the discovery that these nanoparticles could be used for drug delivery. She was the first to demonstrate that peptides could be delivered across the blood-brain barrier to elicit a pharmacological response when presented as peptide drug nanofibers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, her group was also the first to demonstrate that nanoparticles could be delivered via the nose exclusively to the brain, which led to the discovery of the therapeutic medicine candidate Envelta\u2122, which was designed to address the devastating side effects of opioid poisoning. Envelta has been out-licensed to Virpax Pharmaceuticals, and clinical trials are currently being developed. These nanoparticles are currently being explored for other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and triple-negative breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Uchegbu, Nanomerics and the technology underpinning Envelta have received many prestigious awards including the King\u2019s Award for Enterprise in May 2024, the UK Government\u2019s Women of Outstanding Achievement in Science, Engineering and Technology 2007, Royal Pharmaceutical Society Pharmaceutical Scientist of the Year 2012, Special Recognition Business of Science Leadership Award 2023, listed in Who\u2019s Who in 2024 and an honorary degree from Lincoln University in 2024.\n\nCredit: Segun Fatumo.\n\nProfessor Fatumo is a computational geneticist who gained his PhD in computer science, specializing in bioinformatics, from Covenant University, Nigeria.

        "article_content": "The giant planet J1407b has been a weird space mystery since its discovery in 2010. But a new study revealed something about the planet that may help explain at least part of its weirdness: a sprawling set of rings that may actually rotate backwards around the planet.\n\nJ1407b may be a rogue planet, drifting through space untethered to a star or other planets, or it may be orbiting nearby star V1400 Centauri on a wide loop that astronomers haven\u2019t mapped yet. Either way, it\u2019s home to wide rings and a handful of moons, one of which may be as large as our whole planet. Those rings and moons may actually be in a retrograde orbit, meaning they revolve backwards around the planet. A recent study used computer simulations to explain how that might happen.\n\nWenshuai Liu, a physicist at Henan Normal University in China, published his work in a preprint paper which has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nJ1407b may look something like this artist\u2019s illustration of brown dwarf 0TS 44, surrounded by dusty rings and rocky moons.\n\nA Rogue Planet with Backwards Rings?\n\nLiu simulated how a giant planet and its ring system might form and evolve around a star like V1400 Centauri, which is about the mass of our Sun but a few billion years younger. Their models suggest that as giant planets coalesce out of the gas and dust swirling around the star, interactions between those planets can not only nudge some of them into weird, stretched-out orbits, but also set their rings spinning in the wrong direction.\n\nIf Liu is right, that might explain not only why J1407b\u2019s rings may rotate backwards, but why they exist at all.\n\nIn 2007, J1407b happened to pass between Earth and the star V1400 Centauri blocking part of the star\u2019s light. Astronomers didn\u2019t spot the planet\u2019s shadow in the data from the Super Wide Angle Search for Planets until three years later, but once they did, the planet quickly became a fascinating puzzle. For one thing, it\u2019s large enough to be a brown dwarf, a massive object too big to be a mere gas planet, but not quite big enough to be a star.\n\nThe planet\u2019s silhouette revealed that it has a system of dusty rings and moons about 200 times wider than Saturn\u2019s rings. Gaps between the rings mark where moons have cleared lanes through the dust (even though they can\u2019t see the moons themselves; we haven\u2019t yet imaged an exomoon, or a moon orbiting a planet outside our Solar System). Based on the width of the lane it\u2019s cleared between rings, one of those moons may be at least the size of Earth.\n\nIf J1407b really is a rogue planet, at least it\u2019s not completely alone out there.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the really weird part: the possibility that J1407b may not be orbiting V1400 Centauri, but instead a solo traveler that just happened to pass through the 450 light years of space between the star and Earth. Because it hasn\u2019t crossed in front of the star again since 2010, and because a survey with ALMA in 2017 spotted it in a position it shouldn\u2019t have been in if it were actually caught in the star\u2019s gravity, some astronomers argue that J1407b is more likely to be a rogue planet than a companion to V1400 Centauri. The puzzle isn\u2019t entirely solved, because a 2019 survey didn\u2019t find any sign of J1407b at all.\n\nPart of the debate about J1407b centers on the fact that if it\u2019s really in a wide orbit around the star, then the planet shouldn\u2019t be able to hang onto the more distant reaches of its system of rings and moons. Instead, the star\u2019s gravity should strip them away every time its orbit swoops close by (about 5 times the distance from Earth to the Sun, at its closest approach, if earlier studies are correct). That\u2019s part of what Liu hoped to explain with his simulations.\n\nIt turns out that, for reasons that have to do with the detailed physics of flowing dust clouds in space, a ring orbiting backwards around its planet is a little more stable than one orbiting in the same direction the planet rotates. Another team of astronomers suggested back in 2016 that if J1407b\u2019s ring system rotated backwards, it could hold out against the gravitational tug of V1400 Centauri. But no one could actually explain why the ring system would happen to rotate backwards, and that\u2019s been a sticking point for the whole argument in support of J1407b orbiting V1400 Centauri instead of going rogue.\n\nAccording to Liu\u2019s simulations, as giant planets coalesce out of the gas and dust swirling around the star, the newly-forming planets\u2019 gravity pushed and pulled at one another, jostling the young planets into different orbits \u2014 something very similar to the kind of gravitational nudging that sent Jupiter migrating inward during the turbulent early years of our own Solar System. Along the way, J1407b got herded into a long, narrow orbit. The complex ways fluids (including flowing clouds of dust in space) interact eventually caused the planet\u2019s little disk of material to start flowing, or orbiting, in the opposite direction from the planet\u2019s rotation and its path around the star.\n\nWe won\u2019t know for sure unless astronomers can capture a direct image of the planet, and that\u2019s no small feat, since they\u2019d have to find it again first."

        "article_content": "When it comes to antivirus software, small business\u2019 needs often fall in an in-between space: Personal antivirus tools such as McAfee or Kaspersky may not be robust enough, while enterprise solutions are too complicated and expensive. Fortunately, there are antivirus solutions tailored to the needs of smaller companies, so we\u2019ve rounded up our six top choices of the best antivirus software for small businesses.\n\nTop antivirus software for small businesses comparison\n\nBesides price, there are many other factors to consider when choosing the best small business antivirus software. A few of them are summarized in the table below:\n\nStarting price Free trial Devices covered VPN included Password manager included Bitdefender $104.99 for 5 devices for 1 year Yes macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Server Yes Yes Norton $59.99 a year for 6 devices for 1 year Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Premium plan only Yes Trend Micro Contact for pricing Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android No No ESET $179.99 for 5 devices for 1 year Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux Certain plans only Certain plans only Avira $59.99 for 5 devices for 1 year Yes Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Yes Yes Microsoft Defender $33.75 per user per month Yes Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android No No\n\nBitdefender GravityZone: Best overall Bitdefender is known for its consumer-facing antivirus software, but it also offers excellent antivirus solutions for small businesses. Bitdefender can protect macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and Windows Server systems, making it a good choice for SMBs that use multiple types of devices. The dashboard makes it easy to manage your security even if you don\u2019t have advanced IT training. Some plans also offer unlimited VPN traffic and account breach monitoring for everyone on the plan. SEE: How to Create an Effective Cybersecurity Awareness Program (TechRepublic Premium) Why I chose Bitdefender GravityZone I chose Bitdefender GravityZone because of its ease of use and excellent reputation. I also appreciate the many pricing options it offers. You can opt to pay per the number of devices or the number of users, so that you aren\u2019t paying for extra slots you\u2019re not using. If and when you\u2019re ready to scale, Bitdefender also offers security solutions and managed services for mid-sized businesses, so you might not even have to switch providers. Pricing Small Business Security: Starts at $104.99 for 5 devices for 1 year.\n\nStarts at $104.99 for 5 devices for 1 year. Business Security: Starts at $129.49 for 5 devices for 1 year.\n\nStarts at $129.49 for 5 devices for 1 year.

Visit Bitdefender\n\nFeatures\n\nRisk management capabilities.\n\nScam Copilot feature powered by AI.\n\nFileless attack protection.\n\nBuilt-in password management and digital identity monitoring.\n\nDedicated email protection.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Centralized security dashboard. Price plans can be confusing to navigate. Scores well in independent testing. Monthly payment option not available for all plans. User interface is intuitive and relatively easy to navigate. Scales with businesses as they grow.\n\nNorton: Best for 24/7 customer support At a small business, you rarely work defined hours, which is why it\u2019s important to choose antivirus software that offers extensive support options. Fortunately, Norton offers online chat support 24/7 for English-speaking customers. There\u2019s also a large knowledge base that you can consult for self-help before reaching out to customer service. Norton\u2019s small business plans bundle together many features, including password management and cloud backup. Why I chose Norton I chose Norton because it offers 24/7 customer support in addition to an all-in-one security platform. It\u2019s not big enough to scale with your business the way some other options on the list can, but it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re a true small business that needs to protect 20 devices and under. Pricing Norton Small Business: Starts at $59.99 a year for 6 devices.\n\nStarts at $59.99 a year for 6 devices. Norton Small Business Premium: Starts at $149.99 a year for 10 devices. Visit Norton\n\nFeatures\n\nSecure browser protects internet traffic.\n\nEncrypted vault for storing login info.\n\nAutomatic software update tool.\n\nPC cleaner and optimizer.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Affordable promotional pricing for the first years. Must upgrade to a more expensive plan to get a VPN. Can monitor up to 5 contacts for identity theft and breaches. Cloud storage is limited on both plans. Automatically backs up crucial business data. 24/7 chat support is available in English only. Includes Windows PC cleaning, updating, and optimizing.\n\nTrend Micro: Best for endpoint protection Trend Micro is excellent at detecting and defending against cyberattacks, which is why I named it one of the best antivirus software for Windows. Trend Micro offers two tiers of software: Trend Vision One for Small Businesses, and Trend Vision One for larger companies. The small business version can protect not just endpoints but also workloads and cloud apps as well with both endpoint detection response and extended detection response. Why I chose Trend Micro I selected Trend Micro because of its multiple cyber threat tools that promote early detection and elimination. I also appreciate that its many plans can scale with a small business as it becomes a midsize business or even a large enterprise. It also offers managed services through partnerships with third-party providers if you\u2019re interested in outsourcing your IT work. Pricing Trend Micro does not disclose the pricing information for Trend Vision One for Small Businesses or Trend Vision One. Contact the sales team to get a customized quote. Visit Trend Micro\n\nFeatures\n\nAttack surface risk management.\n\nAI threat intelligence tools.\n\nData protection supports regulatory compliance.\n\nAdvanced email security and mobile device security.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Wide variety of apps for threat detection and prevention. Pricing is not transparent. Educational tutorials are available. Number of features can be overwhelming to navigate. Can scale with your business as it grows. Ability to run simulated attacks on endpoints.\n\nESET: Best for scalability ESET is antivirus software for small businesses that offers five different pricing plans to choose from. This gives growing businesses a lot of runway to upgrade as their cybersecurity needs grow. A handful of add-ons increases the flexibility of the pricing tiers even further. Even the entry-level plan covers all types of endpoints and device control, while upper tier plans have additional features such as full disk encryption and patch management. Why I chose ESET I picked ESET because the platform offers four pricing plans and three add-ons for small and medium-sized businesses, giving companies lots of flexibility to scale as they grow. It\u2019s also relatively easy to manage \u2014 though you\u2019ll want a dedicated IT administrator to fully take advantage of the cybersecurity features offered by the more expensive plans. Pricing ESET Small Business Security: Starts at $179.99 for one year with 5 devices.\n\nStarts at $179.99 for one year with 5 devices. ESET Protect Entry: Starts at $211.00 for one year with 5 devices.\n\nStarts at $211.00 for one year with 5 devices.

Small business plan limited to 25 devices. Multilingual customer support available. Certain features like MFA require an additional paid add-on. Many pricing plans means the software can scale as your business grows.\n\nAvira: Best for affordability If you\u2019re a small business owner who needs to cover lots of devices at a reasonable cost, check out Avira Prime. This small business antivirus software only charges $134.99 per year for up to 25 devices, which costs about the same (or less!) than what many competitors charge for 5-10 devices. The bundle also includes an unlimited VPN, a password manager, and a device cleaner, so you\u2019re getting more than just antivirus software at that price. If you need an even lower cost option, then check out our list of the best free endpoint detection software. Why I chose Avira I opted for Avira because it offers one of the most affordable pricing plans, allowing small businesses owners to protect up to 25 devices at a decent cost. I also like that it bundles additional features into its plan, like a VPN, instead of breaking them off into separate paid add-ons like some competitors. Pricing Avira Prime for 5 devices: $59.99 for the first year, or $9.99 per month.\n\n$59.99 for the first year, or $9.99 per month. Avira Prime for 25 devices: $139.99 for one year, or $12.99 per month. Visit Avira\n\nFeatures\n\nBlocks unwanted spam callers on smartphones.\n\nUnlimited VPN traffic allowed.\n\nAutomatically updates software on Windows devices.\n\nDevice cleaner and privacy settings manager for PCs.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Offers tools to improve security, privacy, and performance. Only two pricing tiers to choose from. Unlimited VPN included. Jump from 5 to 25 devices may not work for all SMBs. Device cleaner gets rid of junk files on PCs. Block trackers and adware while internet browsing.\n\nMicrosoft Defender: Best for Windows-only systems If your small business only uses Windows devices, then Microsoft Defender may be sufficient for your basic antivirus needs. In fact, Defender already comes built into Windows 11 and 12, and you can even get it bundled in with other Microsoft apps like Word and Excel through the 365 E3 and E5 software packages. While you can use Defender on other types of operating systems and devices, such as Macs and iPhones, you\u2019ll probably find it easier to set up other options on this list on non-Windows endpoints. Why I chose Microsoft Defender I chose Microsoft Defender because it\u2019s often the most seamless option for small businesses that only use the Windows operating system. If you opt for one of the 365 E5 software bundles, you\u2019ll get Defender alongside your other Microsoft apps, so you don\u2019t even have to set up a separate subscription. Pricing Microsoft 365 E3: $33.75 per user, per month; Windows for Enterprise, 1TB of cloud storage and MDE P1.\n\n$33.75 per user, per month; Windows for Enterprise, 1TB of cloud storage and MDE P1. Microsoft 365 E5: $54.75 per user, per month; all 365 E3 features plus advanced security and compliance capabilities; business analytics and MDE P2. Visit Microsoft Defender\n\nFeatures\n\nAutomatic disruption of ransomware attacks.\n\nSecure Score offers prioritized security recommendations.\n\nGlobal threat intelligence and reporting.\n\nCopilot AI feature now available for security solutions, including Defender.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros Cons Built into Windows 10 and 11. Pricing plans are difficult to navigate. Often bundled together with other Microsoft tools. Lacks advanced protection and features of competitors. Integrates with other security solutions from Microsoft.\n\nHow do I choose the best antivirus software for my small business?\n\nTo choose the best small business antivirus software, first consider your needs as well as your budget. Bear in mind that bundled plans that include additional features (such as a VPN and password manager) may save you more money in the long run than purchasing each tool \u00e0 la carte. Use your budget and must-have features to narrow down your options to a shortlist, or start with the six platforms listed here.\n\nThen it\u2019s time to take advantage of free trials so that you can test the software for yourself. I always strongly recommend hands-on testing of the software before committing to an annual contract. You should also schedule demo calls with the sales team if you have additional questions during or after the trial.\n\nIf you still aren\u2019t certain about your choice of antivirus software, then you might want to try a platform that offers a month-to-month option, such as Avira and Bitdefender. That way, you aren\u2019t locked into a year-long contract if you ultimately decide to change your mind.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo choose the best small business antivirus software, I consulted product documentation and users reviews. I considered features such as endpoint protection options, phishing and anti-malware measures, included VPNs and password managers, and automatic software updates. I also weighed other factors such as price plans, scalability, free trials, customer service available, ease of use, and user interface design."
