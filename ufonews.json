        "article_content": "The Settings app of any smartphone is a nightmare we all have to deal with on a regular basis. I say that as a longtime iPhone user who still dreads going to the Settings app even after the big redesign in iOS 18. The equally important Control Center redesign makes it easier to access some of the key settings you interact with more frequently.\n\nThe same applies to Android, of course. The Settings app has too many menus to remember, so I usually resort to using the built-in search feature.\n\nBut what if AI could help with that? Samsung is reportedly designing an AI feature that might stop you from visiting the Settings app that often. Instead, Galaxy AI might detect your needs and adjust the settings automatically. That\u2019s the kind of useful AI feature we could all use on our smartphones.\n\nAccording to ETNews, Samsung is developing AI software that would customize the phone experience without the user having to open the Settings app. That doesn\u2019t mean the phone will lack a Settings app. After all, not all Galaxy phone buyers want to use Galaxy AI features.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how this new Galaxy AI feature would work. The report says that Samsung plans to improve the \u201cperformance of \u2018touch points\u2019 such as keyboards and cameras to enable the ability to predict what consumers want in advance.\u201d\n\nAs Android Authority points out, Samsung already lets you control some Settings with the Bixby assistant. But the new Galaxy AI feature above would be more sophisticated than that. Adjusting settings on the fly with minimal user interaction would be incredible.\n\nAs someone dying to see AI evolve on smartphones and computers to the point where I can reliably control the devices, apps, and app features via voice or text prompts, I\u2019d love it if the AI could adjust my settings in real time on its own. The AI would simply learn what I like and then adjust the settings without me having to do anything.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself here. It\u2019s unclear how this Settings-related feature would work on future Galaxy AI phones, and there\u2019s no release timeline estimate for it either. What\u2019s certain is that Samsung will want to demo new Galaxy AI abilities when the Galaxy S25 series launches in early January. AI will continue to be a big marketing point for all phones, including Samsung handsets."

Nickles says the show is the perfect combination of spooky and family-friendly \"Each year I come up with new arrangements of things,\" Nickle said. \"I like playing the Ghostbusters theme, the Thriller theme, the funnest thing is playing on instruments that are a little unconventional like a coffin or a car.\"\n\n\"It's really just about a bunch of us drummers who have been drumming our whole life just getting out here and beating some drums and having a good time together,\" said Paranormal Percussions performer, Derek Julio.\n\nSince the show started in 2019 people have traveled from all across the state to see their favorite Halloween songs come to life on the stage. Nickles and Julio say the audience feedback so far has been spooktacular.\n\n\"It just feels wonderful when we know they have had a really good time, a really good experience,\" Julio said. \"It's meant to be spooky, it's meant to be a little fun, I think it's really funny, a lot of aspects of it,\" Julio said.\n\nWarehouse 5 Drum Theatre hopes to continue making audiences smile and putting drummers in the spotlight by eventually putting on other seasonal shows.\n\n\"It's really fulfilling for me, the first year was really scary because I had these arrangements, but I didn't know if they would make sense live but once we put the show together it was really nice,\" Nickles said.\n\nFor show times, locations, and tickets you can click here."

This innovative study has successfully reproduced small amounts of skin in the laboratory, paving the way for future advancements in regenerative medicine.\n\nThe Human Cell Atlas Project\n\nThis research is part of the ambitious Human Cell Atlas project, an international initiative based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge. The project aims to comprehensively map how every cell in the human body is formed. Prof. Muzlifah Haniffa, one of the project leaders, highlighted the potential benefits, stating, \u201cIt would help scientists treat diseases more effectively, but also find new ways of keeping us healthier for longer, and perhaps even keep us younger-looking.\u201d\n\nProf. Haniffa added, \u201cIf we can manipulate the skin and prevent aging, we will have fewer wrinkles.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding Skin Development\n\nResearchers are delving into how skin cells develop during early fetal stages. Initially, all human cells are identical after fertilization, but specific genes activate three weeks later, guiding stem cells to specialize and form different body parts. By pinpointing which genes turn on and when, scientists have unraveled the complex process of skin formation.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, presents an instruction set for creating human skin. This revelation opens up exciting possibilities for regenerative therapies. For instance, fetal skin is known to heal without scarring, and researchers are investigating how to replicate this quality in adult skin, which could enhance surgical outcomes.\n\nInnovations in Skin Creation\n\nA significant advancement in this research includes the discovery that immune cells are essential for forming blood vessels within the skin. By mimicking these instructions in a laboratory setting, scientists have successfully activated genes to grow skin artificially from stem cells. Currently, they have produced small skin samples complete with hair follicles.\n\nProf. Haniffa stated, \u201cIf you know how to build human skin, we can use that for burns patients and that can be a way of transplanting tissue.\u201d Furthermore, creating hair follicles could lead to solutions for hair loss.\n\nA Comprehensive Understanding of Human Biology\n\nThe Human Cell Atlas project has analyzed over 100 million cells from various body parts in its eight years of operation. It has already produced draft atlases for the brain and lungs, with ongoing work on the kidney, liver, and heart.\n\nAccording to Prof. Sarah Teichmann of Cambridge University, one of the consortium\u2019s founders, the project\u2019s findings will revolutionize our understanding of human biology. She noted, \u201cIt is incredibly exciting because it is giving us new insights into physiology, anatomy, a new understanding of humans. It will lead to a rewriting of the textbooks in terms of ourselves and our tissues and organs and how they function.\u201d\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs researchers continue to unlock the genetic instructions for different body parts, they anticipate publishing more findings in the coming weeks and months, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of human development. This groundbreaking research not only holds promise for slowing the aging process but also for advancing medical treatments and tissue regeneration.\n\n(INCLUDES INPUTS FROM ONLINE SOURCES)\n\nALSO READ: Singapore Fighter Jets Escort Air India Express Plane After Bomb Threat"

Most recently, she served as senior vice president and corporate head of drug discovery at Exelixis, Inc., where she was responsible for the strategy and execution of the company\u2019s drug discovery portfolio as well as advancing the early clinical pipeline. In just over three years at Exelixis, she built the discovery team and a state-of-the-art discovery platform while advancing multiple candidates toward investigational new drug applications and clinical trials, including a USP-1 inhibitor, XL309, and XL495, a PKMYT1 inhibitor. Prior to Exelixis, she spent over 10 years at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. focused on pipeline expansion and discovery in positions including senior vice president, global head of biotherapeutics discovery and discovery research site head; senior vice president, head of small molecule discovery and discovery research site head; and vice president, head of small molecule discovery. While at Boehringer Ingelheim, Dr. Mahaney\u2019s teams were responsible for delivering drug candidates to the company\u2019s global clinical portfolio, including several investigational assets in oncology, immunology, cardiometabolic, inflammation and respiratory and orphan diseases, many of which have received FDA regulatory pathways including accelerated approval or breakthrough therapy designation. These include important contributions to the advancement of Spevigo\u00ae, a first-in-class IL36R blocking antibody for generalized pustular psoriasis; BI 764532, a first-in-class bi-specific T-Cell engager for neuroendocrine carcinomas and small cell lung carcinoma; and avenciguat, a small molecule activator of soluble guanyl cyclase for systemic sclerosis. Earlier in her career, she held scientist roles in medicinal chemistry at Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. She received her B.S. in chemistry from Guilford College and her Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nStory continues\n\nThroughout his distinguished career, Dr. Fisher has dedicated himself, in academic and industry capacities, to identifying and discovering compounds to help advance treatments for patients. He joined C4T in 2016 and has served as the company\u2019s CSO since 2018. While at C4T, he supported the development and evolution of the company\u2019s TORPEDO\u00ae platform and led the development of a library of over 10,000 Cereblon ligands constructed from over 200 unique scaffolds. Dr. Fisher has spearheaded the identification, characterization and optimization of novel, selective, orally bioavailable BiDAC\u2122 and MonoDAC\u2122 degraders that have resulted in a total of six development candidates across a wide range of target classes delivered to C4T\u2019s clinical pipeline or a collaboration partner. Under his leadership, C4T has advanced three novel degraders into the clinic and partnered with global pharmaceutical companies to further extend the reach of targeted protein degradation.\n\n\u201cIt has been my honor to work alongside talented professionals at C4 Therapeutics to quickly advance the field of targeted protein degradation and bring several degraders into the clinic,\u201d said Stew Fisher, Ph.D. \u201cAs I look forward to this exciting chapter of my personal life, I am also excited about the future of C4 Therapeutics with Paige\u2019s leadership and innovation in place to help ensure our science will continue to push the boundaries of scientific discovery to positively impact patients.\u201d\n\nAbout C4 Therapeutics\n\nC4 Therapeutics (C4T) (Nasdaq: CCCC) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to delivering on the promise of targeted protein degradation science to create a new generation of medicines that transforms patients\u2019 lives.

The report offers a detailed examination of industry trends and developments shaping the growth of the Sales Tax Software market. It also provides a comprehensive analysis and forecast of the market future performance.\n\nGlobal Sales Tax Software Market is valued at approximately USD 6.9 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 9.5% over the forecast period 2024-2032.\n\nRead the Market Summary Here @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw10065\n\nSales tax software is an essential tool designed to automate the calculation, reporting, and compliance of sales tax obligations for businesses. The software offers solutions such as consumer use tax management, value-added tax, tax return filing, and integration with financial databases, simplifying complex tax processes and enhancing efficiency. The market\u2019s growth is primarily driven by the increasing demand for automation and integration in tax processes, fueled by the adoption of cloud-based solutions at competitive prices. Businesses are increasingly seeking to streamline tax calculations, management, and reporting through advanced software solutions that leverage AI and machine learning algorithms. This trend is also driven by the rise in demand for IoT devices, which further propels the growth of the sales tax software market during the forecast period.\n\nMoreover, the growing emphasis on regional integration and harmonization of tax legislation, coupled with the demand for accessible and cost-effective platforms, presents lucrative growth opportunities for the market. Despite these growth drivers, challenges such as the need for substantial initial investments and specialized skill sets could potentially hinder market growth. Nevertheless, the shift towards automation and user-friendly interfaces in sales tax software, along with the increasing adoption of e-commerce tax solutions, is expected to sustain the market\u2019s positive trajectory. In the e-commerce industry, sales tax software has become indispensable due to the complexity of managing local tax obligations across various jurisdictions. This complexity is compounded by frequent changes in tax laws, rates, and rules for different types of products and services. For instance, companies like Avalara provide eCommerce sales tax software to help U.S. businesses efficiently manage demanding tax obligations imposed by states and other local tax authorities.\n\nRequest To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw10065\n\nKey regions considered in the global sales tax software market study include Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Rest of the World. North America, particularly the U.S., dominates the market, driven by the extensive adoption of sales tax software across various industry verticals such as BFSI, retail, and e-commerce.
