        "article_content": "In the final moments of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs,\u2018 the line between reality and fiction blurs as Jos\u00e9 de Zer loses himself in his search for the UFO. After a series of inexplicable events showcase themselves, the fakery being utilized by the protagonist to sell the vision to the watching public takes on a whole new dimension as certain elements prove themselves to be far more mysterious than established in the beginning. As Jos\u00e9 overcomes his feelings of imposter syndrome, a different kind of belief instills within him as he tries to find salvation in the message he has been spreading among his followers. However, it causes the movie to end in a very confusing way, which flips the script on the whole narrative! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nThe Man Who Loved UFOs Plot Synopsis\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer, an entertainment journalist for a TV news channel, suffers a seizure while interviewing a high-profile celebrity, Monica. The attack is triggered after Jos\u00e9 sees a blinding white light hovering above the sky and a strange high-pitched sound in his head. Subsequently, he wakes up in the hospital while his cameraman, Chango, watches him. One day, two residents from the nearby village of La Candelaria visit him at the hospital and propose for him to cover the story about a burnt pasture in their area. They suggest that the protagonist avail himself of a different angle, namely aliens, as they want tourism to spread in their small community, which has been lacking in advancement over the years.\n\nSubsequently, Jos\u00e9 embarks on a trip to La Candelaria with Chango and finds the burnt pasture in one of the surrounding hills. He conducts several interviews with the locals, who mostly speak about a UFO conspiracy being hidden by the government and higher authorities. With the recorded footage, the reporter heads back to his TV channel headquarters and presents it to his bosses, who disapprove of the idea immediately. Their reservations are mostly levied at Jos\u00e9\u2019s embellishment of the report to make it more exaggerated than usual. However, after various persuasive talks, the protagonist convinces them to air the video during the TV news show Notidiario. When it is presented to the public, more doctored evidence is shown, such as burnt insects lying on the charred pasture.\n\nAs soon as the footage is released, the audience\u2019s interest in UFO sightings swells as Jos\u00e9 slowly becomes a household name. Despite being relegated to more obscure entertainment news over the years, his newfound fame drives more attention to his paranormal claims. More support is pumped into his venture as the journalist starts building a crew around himself who help him fabricate the alien story at a higher production level, which includes a mysterious engineer and self-proclaimed alien enthusiast named Sixto Schiaffino. However, amidst the fakery employed by the protagonist, things start heating up as sightings of real inexplicable saucers start appearing in real life. While he continues to believe in their reality, his daughter Martina is not entirely convinced of her dad\u2019s theories.\n\nThe Man Who Loves UFOs Ending: Are the Aliens Actually Real?\n\nOne of the most confusing and yet pivotal aspects of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 revolves around the existence of the aliens. Although Jos\u00e9 seems to have faith in their existence, for much of the narrative, he employs dodgy schemes to construct a fake reality to make others believe like him. It suggests that the aliens are simply a construct that the protagonist is using to garner more attention to his work, as he has somehow managed to enrapture them with his style of narration. However, the tricky part of the story is how it plays with the idea of belief and how it can determine what people see as real or not. In fact, during a conversation with his daughter, Jos\u00e9 mentions the same thing to her, telling her that if she believed the aliens did not exist, then they also did not exist in reality.\n\nIt adds a layer of complexity to the narration, especially in the later parts as the mysterious events start ramping up. Initially, the so-called alien visits are only relegated to a flashback in Jos\u00e9\u2019s past, specifically when he got lost in the Sinai desert during the Israel war. Whether it is real or not is left up to the audience at that point, with a majority of people likely to side with the latter. However, doubts start creeping in when the reporter becomes acquainted with Sixto Schiaffino, a man he calls Mr. Engineer. From the get-go, the movie presents him with a mysterious aura, albeit seeming ordinary on the surface. The more Jos\u00e9 dives into his supposed delusions, the more Mr. Engineer offers him spiritual advice and encourages him to keep spreading the words of the aliens.\n\nIn many ways, the movie revolves around the power of belief, and initially, Jos\u00e9 is far from a believer. He even expresses to Chango how skeptical he is of a higher power like God, considering the cruelties in the world. Meanwhile, his cameraman assures him that he himself is a believer. As the narrative progresses, the protagonist undergoes a radical shift in his belief system, going from someone who barely relates to any notion of divine authority to someone who clings to the grace and divinity of the aliens. To that end, the reality of the aliens within the story becomes a rather complicated discussion as it is mostly filtered through the eyes of Jos\u00e9. So, the answer might come down to a case of looking at the problem by subscribing to the protagonist\u2019s worldview from beginning to end.\n\nDoes Jose Survive the Cave Collapse?\n\nIn the final part, an excited Jos\u00e9 leads an expedition into a mining cave in the hills of La Candelaria, expecting to find answers to his burning questions about the aliens. After having spent months in the village concocting various reports, the journalist is given one last opportunity to craft a big story before he must leave the place. Consequently, his final adventure also turns out to be one of the most life-changing events. It begins with a helicopter ride through the area around the burnt pasture, during which Jos\u00e9 witnesses a real UFO zipping through the sky. While following it through the air, he and Chango end up at the mining cave. They venture into it despite protestations on the part of his cameraman. Unfortunately, Jos\u00e9 ends up getting trapped in the cave after he moves in too deep, separating him from Chango.\n\nWhile being stuck under a pile of rubble, the protagonist uses his lighter to read the nearby cave walls, which are decorated with all manner of hieroglyphs, most of them eerily recounting his own story thus far. Another strange occurrence takes place as Mr. Engineer materializes out of nowhere and speaks with Jos\u00e9. This adds even more talking points to the reality of the aliens, as Sixto could not have entered the cave after it collapsed. Mr. Engineer picks up one of the cave hieroglyphics and hands it over to the protagonist before disappearing. A few moments later, he is rescued by the local firefighters, who drag him out of the cave on a stretcher.\n\nWhy Does the UFO Take Jos\u00e9?\n\nThe most concrete evidence of the aliens presents itself in the ending moments of the movie. After being carried out by the firefighters, Jos\u00e9 flags down his daughter Martina and tells her in a state of adrenaline that the aliens want to take him with them. He hands her the cave hieroglyphic before he is wheeled into the ambulance and driven away. While Martina studies the hieroglyphic, a monumental revelation takes place as a gigantic UFO appears out of the clouds and uses its traction beam to lift the ambulance. The crowd gathered around the cave watches in stunned silence as the protagonist is taken into the UFO just like he envisioned previously after hearing Mr. Engineer. It is a game-changing final twist that leaves the ending with a sense of ambiguity and wonder.\n\nThere are several ways to interpret the UFO\u2019s appearance at the end and its reasons for taking Jos\u00e9 with it. The straightforward reading suggests that the aliens always existed, and everyone was blind to them except the protagonist, who saw them first in the Sinai desert during the war. Additionally, Mr. Engineer is one of those aliens who is hiding among humanity and providing support to the reporter as he is the staunchest follower and believer in the existence of extraterrestrials. Therefore, when the UFO appears and takes Jos\u00e9 away, it is a reward for his devotion to their ideals and holding on to his convictions despite the world ridiculing him. While it explains most of the ending, there may be an additional aspect to it.\n\nYears ago, when Jos\u00e9 got lost in the Sinai desert while fighting in the Israeli war, he came close to death several times and did not see any way out. In his derelict state, the vision of the UFO appearing out of nowhere must have felt like a sign of divinity or that his prayers had been answered, even if he was not religious. This highlights the crux of the movie, which uses UFOs as a substitute for religious faith. For most of the narrative, Jos\u00e9 has been striving to achieve that feeling of connection he felt when the UFO first appeared to him. Thus, his attempts at fabricating a lie to make people believe is irrelevant to his intentions of surrendering to his belief entirely. Because he achieves full spirituality in the end, the UFO appears to take him away and reveal its existence to the public, who doubts Jos\u00e9 all along.\n\nRead More: Jos\u00e9 De Zer: What Happened to Him?

        "article_content": "In Netflix\u2019s \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs,\u2018 an entertainment journalist named Jos\u00e9 de Zer finds himself with a unique opportunity after hearing reports of a UFO sighting in a rural area. Although the field evidence is sparse and limited to a burnt pasture, Jos\u00e9 uses it to his advantage by crafting a report that garners huge attention from the viewing public. The movie partially draws inspiration from Jos\u00e9 de Zer\u2019s real-life exploits from 1986, as he etched his name into folklore by fabricating one of the biggest alien sighting stories of all time. Although the narrative blurs the lines between fiction and reality, the Argentine reporter\u2019s UFO obsession becomes a gateway into the movie\u2019s deeper themes and crafts an intriguing narrative brimming with excitement!\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer Was a Reporter Who Chased All Manner of Outlandish Cases\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer was born in 1941 as Jos\u00e9 Keizer. His father was a theater lighting designer, and Jos\u00e9 himself went on to have an eclectic life that was not without its share of adventure. He survived the Six Days War in Israel as a young reserve lieutenant in 1967 and also lived through a serious car accident in Patagonia. Subsequently, he had a storied career in journalism, initially working for small newspapers before moving on to the magazine Gente. He also hosted a radio show known as Generaci\u00f3n Espont\u00e1nea before he transitioned into the mainstream TV business. At the time, the media business was still an evolving sector in Argentine society, and he became a significant icon of it after joining the news program Nuevediario in 1984.\n\nThe topics covered by Jos\u00e9 ranged from bizarre, paranormal claims to solid day-to-day reporting like crime stories and show business. He even befriended celebrities like Alberto Olmedo and the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde, who later became the president of Argentina. Some of his more outlandish cases include gnomes wandering around La Plata, chasing chupacabras, and a magnetic pit with the ability to pull people in, among many others. He was described as having a severe chain-smoking issue and was also said to be a \u201cserial womanizer\u201d by his daughter Paula. During the pre-cable TV era, Jos\u00e9\u2019s reportings were treated as a bit of harmless fun rather than the manner in which people characterize fake news in today\u2019s world.\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer Pioneered a Wave of UFO Obsession in 1986\n\nWhile working in Villa Carlos Paz in 1986, Jos\u00e9 de Zer came across a tabloid report about a burnt pasture near the Uritorco mountains in C\u00f3rdoba, a news story that would later become the site of one of the most famous episodes in his career. Although covering outrageous cases was not unfamiliar to Jos\u00e9, his star took on a different level after he fabricated a report about a UFO landing site using the burnt pasture as his starting point. Even with no strong evidence, Jos\u00e9 managed to produce rolling footage of UFO hauntings by presenting eerie findings like burnt insects, strange lights in the sky, and hieroglyphs in caves.\n\nThe story became a sensational piece of media coverage, leading to a spike in viewership numbers for Nuevediario. However, years later, his discoveries were completely debunked after the footage was found to be faked. For one, the burnt insects in the recordings were planted by Jos\u00e9, the hieroglyphs on the cave walls were painted by him in his hotel room, and the lights in the videos were nothing more than cigarettes or flashlights. Still, the viewership numbers were a testament to how well the material resonated with the audience at the time. Even tourism boomed in the area, and Jos\u00e9 became a bit of a local hero.\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer Continued His Journalistic Work Before Passing Away in 1997\n\nFollowing his success with the UFO sighting story, Jos\u00e9 de Zer stayed in touch with his journalistic work, often alternating between his more conspiratorial stories and more grounded daily events. In 1989, he provided coverage of the attack on the La Tablada military compound after a guerilla warfare group tried to capture an army base in the Bueno Aires province. He also interviewed Carlos Monz\u00f3n, the boxing champion who was imprisoned for the murder of his wife Alicia Mu\u00f1iz in 1988. He left Nuevediario in 1994, just as the rest of the Argentine TV news aesthetic started adopting the chaotic and found footage style narration popularized by him during his long career. On April 2, 1997, Jos\u00e9 passed away at the age of 56. The reporter had Parkinson\u2019s disease and esophagus cancer.\n\nRead More: Is Netflix\u2019s The Man Who Loved UFOs Based on a True Story?"

The girls want to play.\u201d\n\nThe Ghosts of Saratoga Trolley Tours are a collaboration of the Discover Saratoga tourism bureau, and the Saratoga Springs History Museum. You can catch a ride for the next two Thursdays, including on Halloween.\n\nMORE: Tickets for Ghosts of Saratoga Trolley Tours"

Both brown dwarfs have masses well over that of Jupiter, marking a significant discovery in the study of these enigmatic celestial objects.\n\nThis discovery challenges prevailing theories, particularly given their smaller diameter compared to Jupiter despite having a higher mass. Researchers continue to explore how brown dwarfs form and the complexities involved in distinguishing them from planets or stars.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

But here\u2019s what worries me, something I\u2019ll call cognitive outsourcing. The more AI does for us, the less we have to think, and this goes beyond just saving time.\n\nBut as the world moves into being AI-powered, we should ask what we\u2019re giving up. Apple Intelligence is being called a game-changer , ready to revolutionize our lives. That is great . But what happens when we let AI do all the thinking for us? Are we giving up something more meaningful in exchange for convenience?\n\nApple\u2019s about to release its newest AI tool, and if you are like me, you\u2019re probably excited to see what it can do. It promises convenience, personalization, and less time spent on the tedious stuff we all hate such as such as managing our schedules or sorting our information. It\u2019s hard not to get drawn in by the hype.\n\nTake a simple task like writing a formula in Excel. If you\u2019ve done it manually, you know it takes effort \u2014 you need to understand the logic and how the inputs connect to the result. It forces you to work through each step. But with AI, formulas can be auto-generated. Yes, it\u2019s faster but we\u2019re skipping the thinking part \u2014 basically outsourcing the mental effort. It\u2019s not just \u201cno-code,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cno-brain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven those of us who embrace AI can see the issue. A tool that cuts down friction \u2014 the difficulty in thinking, writing, and problem-solving \u2014 often clashes with the messy process of learning. AI\u2019s goal to \u201creduce friction\u201d misses the point, especially when it comes to education. Learning is supposed to be tough, involving challenges and discoveries. Taking away those challenges may make tasks faster, but risks weakening the very growth students need. They need to struggle with ideas, make mistakes, and think for themselves. Sure, AI can offer answers right away, but it could also eliminate the friction that makes us better thinkers.\n\nAI also poses risks in health care when it comes to critical decision-making. Apple\u2019s AI will anticipate our needs and offer smooth, tailored solutions. But alas, the more we depend on it, the less we\u2019ll reflect critically on what we\u2019re doing \u2014 and that\u2019s a problem. Like with fuel, the faster we go, the more we require.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProblem-solving is a fundamental human skill. Wrestling with challenges, even small ones, keeps our minds sharp. If we hand over too much to AI, we could end up losing that mental edge. It\u2019s not just about saving time; it\u2019s about keeping those mental abilities strong. The more we face challenges, the more resilient and creative we become. Letting AI do everything risks weakening those abilities forever.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we should ditch our devices or swear off AI. But just because AI can do something doesn\u2019t mean it always should. Sometimes, it\u2019s better to do things ourselves, because it keeps us mentally engaged. How many of us can navigate without GPS anymore? I can \u2026 and to be honest, I don\u2019t even like my Apple Music these days. So when Apple Intelligence rolls out, use it. Enjoy it. But don\u2019t let it take over. Stay involved. Keep asking questions. Keep doing stuff. No matter how smart AI gets, it\u2019s still on us to think and learn for ourselves.\n\nRyan Walsh is head of operations at Boston Globe Media.\n\n\n\n"

        "article_content": "Samsung\u2019s strategy with its smartphone portfolio in 2024 has focused more on subtle hardware refinements and a deep software-level overhaul. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, however, is somewhat of an exception, as it supersizes the generation-over-generation upgrade formula without missing the software-side bells and whistles. With its latest Fan Edition phone, the internals aren\u2019t serving up any unexpectedly powerful lift, and the looks haven\u2019t changed either. But for folks who like to hold on to their phones for a healthy few years, the Galaxy S24 FE comes out swinging with some compelling benefits.\n\nBut where does it fall if you\u2019re already using another Fan Edition? The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE remains a solid smartphone, and if you\u2019re still using one, you may be wondering if it\u2019s time to upgrade. If you\u2019ve been of two minds about this, read on, as we\u2019ve broken down the most notable differences between the Galaxy S24 FE and its predecessor.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE vs Galaxy S23 FE: Specs\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Dimensions and weight 77.3 x 162.0 x 8.0 mm\n\n213 grams 76.5 x 158 x 8.2 mm\n\n209 grams Display 6.7-inch FHD+\n\nDynamic AMOLED 2X\n\n1080 x 2340 (FHD+)\n\n120Hz Adaptive refresh rate (60~120Hz)\n\nVision Booster 6.4-inch FHD+\n\nDynamic AMOLED 2X Display\n\n1080 x 2340 (FHD+)\n\nAdaptive 120Hz refresh rate (60~120Hz) Processor 10-core Exynos 2400e chipset Eight-core Exynos 2200\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Rear cameras 12-megapixel Ultra-Wide Camera\n\nf/2.2, FOV 123 degrees\n\n50MP Wide Camera\n\nf/1.8, FOV 84 degrees\n\n8MP Telephoto Camera\n\n3x Optical Zoom, f/2.4, FOV 32 degreesUHD 8K (7680 x 4320)@24fps\n\nSlow Motion 960fps @HD, 240fps @FHD 12MP Ultra-Wide Camera\n\nf/2.2, FOV 123 degrees\n\n50MP Wide Camera\n\nf/1.8, FOV 84 degrees\n\n8MP Telephoto Camera\n\n3x Optical Zoom, f/2.4, FOV 32 degrees\n\nUHD 8K (7680 x 4320)@30fps\n\nSlow Motion 240fps @FHD, 120fps @FHD, 120fps @UHD Front cameras 10MP Front Camera\n\nf/2.4, FOV 80 degrees 10MP Front Camera\n\nf/2.4, FOV 80 degrees Storage and memory 8GB/128GB\n\n8GB/256GB\n\n8GB/512GB 8GB/128GB\n\n8GB/256GB AI Galaxy AI Galaxy AI Durability IP68 IP68 Software and support Android 14 (at launch)\n\nSeven Android OS upgrades promised Android 13 (at launch)\n\nFour Android OS upgrades promised Battery and charging 4,700mAh\n\nWired charging: Up to 50% charge in around 30 mins with 25W Adapter\n\nFast Wireless Charging 2.0\n\nWireless PowerShare 4,500mAh\n\nWired Charging: Up to 50% charge in around 30 mins with 25W Adapter\n\nFast Wireless Charging\n\nWireless PowerShare Colors Blue, Graphite, Gray, Mint, and Yellow Mint, Cream, Graphite, Purple, Indigo and Tangerine Price Starting at $650 Starting at $600\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE vs Galaxy S23 FE: looks and feel\n\nFor folks expecting something wild with the aesthetics, well, there is nothing to be excited about here. It\u2019s the same fundamental design once again, which means a glass and metal shell with a floating lens look on the rear and a splash of fresh colors.\n\nThe most notable difference is the slightly larger display and the corresponding increase in the phone\u2019s dimensions. Where the Galaxy S23 FE offered a 6.4-inch OLED display, its successor bumps up to 6.7 inches.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Galaxy S24 FE is taller and wider than the Galaxy S23 FE, while also being thicker than its predecessor. Notably, the weight has only increased by about 2%, with the Galaxy S24 FE tipping the scales at a hefty 213 grams.\n\nThose numbers don\u2019t sound like much, but in the context of phones, they can make a tangible difference. We found it was probably on the side of too big, and while those who love big phones won\u2019t care, those who appreciate a smaller form factor will probably find this too large.\n\nThe resolution figures remain identical at Full HD+, and so does the peak refresh rate of 120Hz. A minor difference is support for the in-house Vision Booster tech on the newer model. It is a part of the Adaptive Brightness bundle that performs tone mapping and accordingly increases the visibility in surroundings with strong illumination.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE vs Galaxy S23 FE: internal hardware\n\nThe meatier change happens inside. The Galaxy S23 FE arrived in two variants \u2014 one with the Exynos 2200 silicon, while the U.S.-bound trim came armed with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 system on a chip (SoC). The Galaxy S24 FE ditches the two-tier silicon formula and solely embraces the in-house Exynos 2400e processor.\n\nThe RAM and storage configurations also remain identical, with the only difference being a new 512GB storage variant for the Galaxy S24 FE. Ingress protection across both generations also remains identical at IP68.\n\nFolks hoping for a camera upgrade are in for some disappointment as both the phones come with identical imaging hardware. The lead rear sensor is a 50-megapixel unit, sitting alongside a 12MP camera for ultrawide capture and a 10MP sensor with 3x optical zoom output.\n\nTo go with the increase in chassis size, Samsung has also fitted a larger 4,700mAh battery inside the Galaxy S24 FE. That\u2019s a slight bump compared to the 4,500 mAh unit powering its predecessor. However, there is no upgrade in charging speeds, either wired or wireless.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE vs Galaxy S23 FE: software and security\n\nSoftware longevity and in-house security are going to be one of the biggest differentiators between the two Fan Edition phones. In fact, for anyone hoping to use their FE smartphones for the long run, it could very well be the deciding factor.\n\nSamsung launched the Galaxy S23 FE with Android 13 underneath the OneUI skin. The company promised that it would get four Android OS upgrades, which means the phone will only get updates until Android 17, which should make its way to smartphones in 2026. The phone will get security updates for an extra year.\n\nSamsung has since upped the ante for software longevity, not only for its flagship phones, but also for its midrange offerings. As part of that strategy, the Galaxy S24 FE arrived on the scene running Android 14 out of the box, and with a commitment of getting seven years of major Android OS upgrades.\n\nSamsung has also promised to release security updates, at varied cadences, for an equal number of years. That means the Galaxy S24 FE should be running the latest version of Android all the way through 2030.\n\nWith the 2024 lineup of Galaxy smartphones, Samsung also made a crucial security-focused pivot. The Knox suite of security features has been a part of the Samsung device ecosystem for over a decade now, following its introduction in 2013.\n\nLast year, Samsung introduced Knox Matrix, an interconnected security protocol that aims to use multiple connected devices in the ecosystem to protect each other. \u201cIf one element is compromised, Knox Matrix will isolate it from the ecosystem in order to protect the others,\u201d says the company.\n\nKnox Matrix is a cross-platform solution that enables threat analysis via a Trust Chain, and it also relies on secured credential syncing across the network. The whole system is reliant on a private blockchain to accomplish what Samsung calls intelligent threat monitoring.\n\nThis year marks the first time that Knox Matrix-compatible devices are hitting the shelf, and the Galaxy S24 FE happens to be one of them. In addition to Knox Matrix, the latest budget flagship from Samsung also serves a feature called Auto Blocker.\n\nOffered as part of the Security and Privacy hub, it blocks the installation of apps from unauthorized sources, or in this case, the Google Play Store and the Galaxy App Store, mirroring the approach that Apple has historically followed for iPhones.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons that Android devices continue to be a hot spot of malicious activities of all kinds is the rampant distribution of apps that essentially seed malware of all varieties, paving the way for data theft and identity fraud, among other nuisances.\n\nGoing a step further, Auto Blocker also hinders command lines that are attempting to make their way in via the USB port through a compromised computer or any other device. Moreover, once the feature is enabled, it will also scan messaging apps on your phone for images that could potentially be loaded with malware.\n\nThere\u2019s also an optional \u201cmaximum security\u201d aspect to the Auto Blocker toolkit. Enabling it allows the system to automatically scan apps for malicious code, block activation of device administrative apps and work profiles, thwart automatic downloading of messages containing attachment files, and remove metadata such as location and date from pictures before they are shared. Finally, it also disables album sharing so that users don\u2019t accept invites from suspicious contacts or end up sharing sensitive information.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE vs Galaxy S23 FE: price and availability\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is available now, and prices start from $650. The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE is also still available, even from Samsung, but it\u2019s only $20 less than the S24 FE, making it a bit of an odd prospect if you\u2019re looking to immediately buy it. Expect it to get heavier discounts than its newer brethren though, especially during big sales like Black Friday.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE vs Galaxy S23 FE: verdict\n\nThe comparison between the Galaxy S24 FE and its predecessor may not sound like much of an iterative growth, but in reality, these are fundamentally two very different phones.\n\nThe biggest difference, and one that should make a crucial difference in the day-to-day experience, is the sheer size difference. The Galaxy S24 FE falls squarely in big phone territory, while the Galaxy S23 FE is relatively compact by current industry standards.\n\nThe camera hardware is a no-upgrade situation, as is the battery. The 4nm-based Exynos 2400e sounds like a meaningful upgrade, but compared to the Galaxy S23 FE, it doesn\u2019t offer a day-and-night difference in terms of raw performance.\n\nWhere the two phones stand miles apart is product longevity. If you\u2019re planning to keep your phone for at least the next half-decade (against the tide of changing consumer behavior), the Galaxy S23 FE will only serve as a loyal companion through 2026, at which point, it will stop getting updates. Sure, you can keep using it after that, but it won\u2019t get any new features or security patches.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 FE, on the other hand, is on the official Samsung support road map for the next seven years. In such a situation, a newer-generation processor only serves as an added future-proofing incentive.\n\nFor folks who are on the fence about their purchase, the Galaxy S24 FE is the obvious choice for multiple reasons, and specifically from a longevity lens. If it\u2019s a question of upgrading between the Galaxy S23 FE and its successor, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult either, especially if a meaty trade-in deal is in the cards."
