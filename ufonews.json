On a handheld, it usually requires unscrewing more stuff. Still, I'm here to tell you it can be done.\n\nThe first thing you should know is that most of the time you'll want a PCIe 4.0 SSD with a 2230 form factor. That is a specially squished form of solid state that takes up far less room than your average NVMe stick. The one major exception to this is the Legion Go, which requires a 2242 SSD, and some Ayaneo devices actually use the full 2280 SSD form factor.\n\nHere are two of the 2230 SSDs we've tested right here on PC Gamer, both of which are discounted right now:\n\nI've got a few handy videos to outline the process, depending on which handheld you've got.\n\nJust note, you'll likely need to clone your existing drive using an SSD clone tool like Macrium Reflect to get your handheld working as intended. This is a lot easier to do if you have access to a Windows PC with a spare NVMe slot to run the application and clone the drive.\n\nSteam Deck \u2014 SSD replacement guidance\n\nHere are some written step-by-step Steam Deck SSD upgrade instructions covering what needs to be done. If you're a visual learner, here's a video instead:\n\nROG Ally \u2014 SSD replacement guidance\n\nAsus has put together a decent step-by-step guide on how to replace your ROG Ally SSD. You can read it here.\n\nThe teardown video below also shows the general job of getting the handheld open to access the NVMe."

            "article_content": "Google, Apple, Samsung, and practically every other big tech firm are promising a future where AI will take over your phone and computer. However, as it currently stands, newfangled AI assistants aren\u2019t as intelligent as their name suggests. Anthropic\u2014the makers of the Claude chatbot\u2014has a new tool that promises to give any assistant access to any app. If the future truly is based on \u201cagentic AI,\u201d then this model may be the way that Apple Intelligence or Gemini will collect the data from any of your devices\u2019 apps.\n\nThe tool is called the Model Context Protocol, which Anthropic said on Monday it was making open source and free to use for any developer. This protocol will create an information channel between a data source, even app data, and an AI assistant. This is designed for use by AI agents like Anthropic\u2019s Claude desktop app. Anthropic said this connection is \u201csecure,\u201d since\u2014instead of exposing their app\u2019s data\u2014third-party developers can instead build a \u201cMCP client,\u201d AKA a separate AI application, to connect to their private servers.\n\nWhile this ostensibly could be used by companies to allow any AI to access internal data more easily, it may also offer a new standard for how apps offer up their prized data to AI assistants. So far, AI apps like Google\u2019s Gemini on both Android and iOS can access the tech giant\u2019s own Workspace apps, so long as users give it permission. This means it can dig through your Gmail to surface some lost missives or turn any text reservations into an event on Google Calendar. Currently, Gemini doesn\u2019t have access to third-party apps except through extensions.\n\nAnthropic head of Claude relations, Alex Albert, claimed that developers would normally have to work directly with Google or any other AI assistant developer to create a custom connection between the AI and its data. MCP proclaims it solves that issue by enabling a free protocol that could work between the AI assistant and any app or data source.\n\nAlbert demoed Claude working directly with GitHub to make a new repository using MCP. He claimed that with MCP, it took \u201cless than an hour\u201d to build the AI-to-app integration. The company shared some repositories of sample MCP servers that it claims should help developers get started.\n\nHere's a quick demo using the Claude desktop app, where we've configured MCP: Watch Claude connect directly to GitHub, create a new repo, and make a PR through a simple MCP integration. Once MCP was set up in Claude desktop, building this integration took less than an hour. pic.twitter.com/xseX89Z2PD \u2014 Alex Albert (@alexalbert__) November 25, 2024\n\nWhile the protocol is open source, Anthropic still promoted how the most recent Claude 3.5 Sonnet model was better for creating these data channels between servers and the AI. Otherwise, Anthropic said this tool will replace today\u2019s \u201cfragmented\u201d integrations with something more \u201csustainable.\u201d So far, Anthropic said coding software companies Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have onboarded MCP for its AI integrations.\n\nApple has promised similar cross-app AI functionality for Apple Intelligence, eventually. That feature, alongside a rejuvenated Siri, could arrive in early spring next year. The Cupertino, California company\u2019s famously secure walled garden may not have a place for MCP, but other, smaller AI agent developers may be eyeing this or any other similar protocol.\n\nEither way, the major AI developers will be putting pressure on app makers to incorporate ways for AI assistants to access app data. While Apple claims its private cloud compute will keep all your personal data safe, we\u2019ll have to see if any of this open-handed data transfer proves yet another privacy SNAFU."

I\u2019ve talked a fair bit about my love for Notion. Predictably, it includes its own AI integration powered by ChatGPT. Notion AI isn\u2019t new. In fact, the company got in on the LLM action pretty early and introduced the feature way back in February 2023. I\u2019ve been reluctant to let an AI model have access to all my personal thoughts and work-related notes. However, a few weeks back, I finally caved and decided to give it a shot. So, how did my experiment with Notion AI go? Here\u2019s the CliffNotes version \u2014 it\u2019s not for me. But it might just be the perfect productivity enhancer for a certain kind of user. Here\u2019s why.\n\nDo you like Notion AI? 21 votes Yes 29 % No 14 % I haven't tried it yet 57 %\n\nWhat is Notion AI?\n\nDhruv Bhutani / Android Authority\n\nInstead of creating its own LLM model, Notion AI is built on GPT-4 and Claude APIs and leverages all the capabilities of those GPT models. The AI tools work on your own personal data and can be leveraged to perform a range of activities. Think writing assistance, text generation, brainstorming, outlines, research, and organization. It\u2019s the standard ChatGPT capabilities fine-tuned to perform well on your personal data. Building Notion AI on top of ChatGPT makes sense given the latter\u2019s rapid pace of development and relatively advanced state.\n\nHow do I use Notion AI?\n\nDhruv Bhutani / Android Authority\n\nNotion is my catalog of notes, drafts, interesting articles, places to visit, and much more. As such, it is very often a dumping ground for text that I leave aside for later \u2014 or never \u2014 to organize. So, I decided to see if AI could help me triage my long list of notes and articles in Notion. I decided to start simple and used Notion AI to generate summaries for a number of long-form reads in my Notion. It\u2019s similar to the summarize function built into a number of apps and even integrated into phones. Notion AI is able to read an article and give you a concise CliffNotes version of the copy that you can quickly glance through. It works well.\n\nNotion AI's ability to generate custom templates based on your specific simplifies making the most out of Notion.\n\nBut Notion AI\u2019s capabilities go a step further. For example, I\u2019ve been using Notion AI to generate templates to help me plan a forthcoming trip. While Notion\u2019s built-in templates are pretty good, you can use Notion AI to create templates that are specifically tuned for your use case. In this case, I wanted a day-by-day template that helped me plan each day of the trip. Since I couldn\u2019t find an existing template that achieved that, I used Notion AI to generate one. It\u2019s quick and easy and takes away the tedium of having to make these manually.\n\nDhruv Bhutani / Android Authority\n\nIt gets even better. You see, I\u2019ve been saving information about places that interest me directly to Notion. Since Notion AI operates directly on the information in your workspace, it can create granular itineraries based on things that interest you instead of serving up a generic travel itinerary. I tried it out for an upcoming trip, and the results offered up were a surprisingly good way to start building a day-by-day plan.\n\nNotion AI can parse pages across your entire workspace and build databases, charts, and more based on the information.\n\nThis ability to search and read information across your entire workspace is also particularly nifty for other forms of data handling. For example, you could have separate pages tracking investments in a variety of instruments. Personally, I maintain separate pages for stocks, mutual funds, and crypto. Notion AI is able to scan through these separate pages and help me draw tables, charts, and more.\n\nDhruv Bhutani / Android Authority\n\nNext, a key part of my work is brainstorming. However, there are days when I might be feeling a creative block or might be unable to figure out a great approach for an article. Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been experimenting with brainstorming articles with Notion AI. Of course, like most AI tools, you can\u2019t trust it to give you good results out of the box. To optimize the results, I usually create a new page where I put down pointers, my own thoughts on the matter, and maybe some interesting insights that I discovered during research. I then tried using Notion AI to brainstorm a good approach or suggestions for an article flow. The suggestions, like all things AI, can be a bit hit or miss, but I can\u2019t deny that it helped me create a more formal structure for a write-up. Moreover, it can often bring up points that I might\u2019ve missed out on otherwise. Nifty.\n\nNotion PDF PDF summarisation in Notion\n\nIn my spare time, I try to catch up on the latest research journals. But lately, free time has been rather limited. Remember when I mentioned that Notion is my dumping ground for all things interesting? That includes interesting PDF research papers and journals gathered from the internet. I\u2019ve been trying out Notion AI\u2019s PDF parsing capabilities to create bullet-point notes on interesting reads. With my limited spare time, this has been an excellent way to stay up to date on all the latest happenings in science without having to commit to reading a 10-pager or more. Moreover, since Notion AI is operating directly on the PDF, I can be reasonably sure that the summarization will be free of hallucinations.\n\nNotion AI isn\u2019t for me For all its capabilities, there\u2019s not much here that can\u2019t be done in ChatGPT for free. I\u2019m not a fan of subscription fees, and the $8 tacked on per member in a workspace adds up. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Notion AI, if you can find a use case for it, is rather excellent. But for all the use cases I listed above, the majority of my Notion use had no AI actions at all. If I have to invest in an AI tool, I\u2019d rather pick up a general-purpose tool that can perform most of the same functions without being shackled to Notion.\n\nNotion AI is a capable tool, but if I need an LLM tool, I'd rather invest in a standalone product.\n\nThat, however, is not a ding on Notion AI\u2019s capabilities. I went in skeptical of its capabilities and came away rather impressed with the productivity boost it can offer \u2014 provided it aligns with how you use Notion.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

As you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s good and bad in this very early test version.\n\nI use the word test deliberately because I was told in no uncertain terms that Spark is very much an experiment rather than a finished product. Hence the low-key launch. So my comments should be taken with that in mind.\n\nSign up now to get the best Black Friday deals!

Instead of a typical geeky interface with code terminals and stuff, there\u2019s a very simple chatbot interface with a box for the prompt and not a lot else.\n\nMy first reaction to the app was surprise. Instead of a typical geeky interface with code terminals and stuff, there\u2019s a very simple chatbot interface with a box for the prompt and not a lot else.\n\nA second immediate difference is the fact that instead of running with one AI model to do the work, Spark comes with multiple models from both Anthropic, with Claude Sonnet 3.5, and OpenAI with o1-Preview and o1-Mini.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal because, as anyone who\u2019s worked with these app makers knows, the Claude model works up to a point and then often runs out of steam when trying to complete a project.\n\nAt that point, a \u2018thinking\u2019 model like o1-Preview is useful, because it seems to overcome contextual limits and fixes issues Claude can\u2019t deal with.\n\nThis happened a few times during my testing. Claude would start to fail when faced with a prompt, at which point I would switch to o1-Preview, and stuff would get fixed.\n\nUse GitHub Spark to create a travel log app - YouTube Watch On\n\nUsing the app is extremely easy, basically, because everything is done via the single prompt box. There are no distracting terminal panels full of code flashing in front of your eyes. Just enter a prompt, watch a pretty little graphic roll and wait.\n\nAfter 20 or 30 seconds the result will pop up for you to check and iterate. One cool feature is the fact that each prompt is staged in the sidebar, so you can step back to an earlier prompt if something goes wrong and you need to try again.\n\nThe geeks haven\u2019t been ignored completely. There\u2019s a setting that lets you add extra instructions to tailor the model to your preferences. There\u2019s also a handy icon at the top of the screen to open up a code panel, so you can manually edit anything you don\u2019t want the AI to touch.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAll in all, Github Spark is a very credible and interesting entry into the AI app-making arena. The fact that I could run up a pretty sophisticated jukebox music player using Amazon S3 storage, and even throw in a bit of AI for to help with mood selection, proves that the platform\u2019s not a toy, even at this early stage. And I did it all in just six hours from scratch.\n\nHopefully, they will start to open it up to more people sooner rather than later, and also remove the need to have a Github account to access the apps that are created. Definitely one to watch for the future."

After all, he has spent his career telling visually astonishing tales of monsters, demons, and the evils of man that echo through the ages. He\u2019s dealt directly with ghosts in two films, The Devil\u2019s Backbone and Crimson Peak. Amazingly, though, del Toro considers himself a sceptic despite revealing he once had a paranormal experience in a hotel room that would make even the most optimistic believer\u2019s blood run cold.\n\nWhen del Toro made The Devil\u2019s Backbone in 2001, he created a definition of a ghost that spoke to him deeply. In his story of a young boy in a Spanish orphanage being haunted by the ghost of a dead boy, he describes spirits as akin to an insect in amber or something left forever unfinished. As he told Little White Lies, a ghost is \u201can awful sealed thing\u2026like a photograph, like the loop of a movie.\u201d\n\nThe Nightmare Alley helmer subsequently revealed that, in his life, he\u2019d had two paranormal experiences despite being dubious about the existence of ghosts. In fact, despite being such a fan of the macabre and the monstrous in fiction, when it comes to real-life proof of terrifying forces beyond our comprehension, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe.\u201d Essentially, in fiction, del Toro is Fox Mulder, but in reality, he\u2019s Dana Scully.\n\nDespite this, del Toro couldn\u2019t explain away his experiences as some trick of the brain or the creaking of an old building. He claimed, \u201cTwo times I have heard ghostly, disembodied voices, very, very clearly. And they were very scary at the time.\u201d\n\nDel Toro\u2019s most bone-chilling experience came when he was scouting locations for The Hobbit in New Zealand \u2013 ironically, a film he wound up not making. He explained, \u201cWe came to\u2026 a place called Waitomo, and I had read that there was an old hotel which had a haunted room.\u201d Even though the director and his scouts had arrived during the tourist off-season and the hotel was closed, the management agreed to open it, especially for them. Feeling curious, del Toro asked, \u201cCan I get the haunted room?\u201d but he would soon regret that request.\n\nWhile del Toro sat in the room and idly watched The Wire on DVD, he heard something that made him turn white as a sheet. He revealed that the sound was unmistakable: \u201cA woman shrieking for about five minutes, horrible blood-curdling shrieks. And then a man sobbing and sighing with great regret.\u201d\n\nThe terrified director estimated that the screaming lasted for five minutes and the remorseful weeping a full ten minutes more. He did some sleuthing and figured out where the noises were coming from. He claimed, \u201cI was able to actually track the sounds to the bathroom. I tracked them to a vent above the toilet, which went down into the cellar.\u201d\n\nDel Toro was adamant that nothing about the evening had primed him to think he was encountering the spirit realm. He clarified, \u201cI was not in the middle of s\u00e9ance, and it wasn\u2019t a stormy night,\u201d and added, \u201cIt was completely inauspicious conditions for a ghost apparition.\u201d All he was doing was watching high-quality crime drama to wind down after a long day of looking at potential locations.\n\nNaturally, the experience freaked del Toro out. He admitted that as soon as he realised the noises were coming from the cellar, he quietly returned to bed and put on his headphones. All he wanted was to be completely enveloped in the sound of Baltimore\u2019s war on drugs instead of that awful, disembodied screaming. Unsurprisingly, he didn\u2019t sleep a wink for the entire night."

            "article_content": "Skysong\n\nC.A. Wright\n\nPantera Press, $32.99 Fairytale adapted into a full-length fantasy novel best describes C.A. Wright\u2019s Skysong. This book takes inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Nightingale \u2013 one of the brighter flights in that author\u2019s oeuvre, though still spiked with folly and mortality. We follow Oriane, who lives in a remote village with a mystical legacy inherited from her mother. She can transform into a skylark, with the power to call the sun each morning. Curiosity leads Oriane into the dangers and intrigues of the royal court, where she\u2019s worshipped as a goddess but effectively imprisoned in the role. Her maid, Andala, also has a secret and as a schism erupts in the kingdom, it transpires that our heroine is not alone as she thinks. Wright\u2019s tale takes the possessiveness and failure to appreciate beauty in Andersen\u2019s original, and the motif of deception leading to feminine freedom, and builds a fantasy world in which the magical bird becomes an unwitting pawn in a political and religious struggle.\n\nThe Dream of A Tree\n\nMaja Lunde, trans. Diane Oatley\n\nScribner, $34.99 The final book in Norwegian author Maja Lunde\u2019s Climate Quartet, The Dream of A Tree takes us to the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard in 2110, where the Global Seed Vault is kept. Cut off from the world for years, Tommy and his brothers and their grandmother, the current Seed Keeper, tread lightly and at one with nature in their isolated home. When their tiny community faces disaster, they are suddenly alone and fighting not just to survive but to preserve the wonders of the Vault. Meanwhile, Tao, still grieving a son lost to starvation in a distant land, must lead an expedition into the Arctic, searching for the seeds that might save her people from famine. I only recall having read Lunde\u2019s The History of Bees, so I\u2019m uncertain how the Climate Quartet hangs together. Still, the books are written to be read as standalones, and this bleak cli-fi survival story is more imaginative in describing Tao\u2019s expedition than the trials on Svalbard itself.\n\nNON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\n\nMean Streak\n\nRick Morton\n\n4th Estate, $35.99 When robo-debt was inflicted on Centrelink recipients by a ruthless coalition government, it was as though the infamous, automated debt calculation scheme was authored by Franz Kafka, in collaboration with George Orwell. In this searing, forensic and moving investigation of the whole tragic fiasco, Rick Morton, senior reporter with the Saturday Paper, calls it the \u201clabyrinth\u201d. For good reason. Seven people took their own lives, thousands lost their jobs and others developed mental illness. Morton, in measured writing fuelled with rage and sorrow in equal measure, walks us through one of the most shameful episodes in recent Australian politics, taking in prime ministers, pressured public servants, a whistleblower and case studies of the poor sods who were hunted down by their own government. A morality tale for our times.\n\nGreat Game On: The Contest for Central Asia and Global Supremacy\n\nGeoff Raby\n\nMUP, $34.99 In the original Great Game \u2013 a 19th-century imperial contest between Britain and Russia over India \u2013 the threat from Russia was more imagined than real, says Raby (our Chinese ambassador, 2007-2011). Likewise, the United States\u2019 fears of China and Vietnam. His examination of the new Great Game, prompted by his observations of the chaotic US departure from Afghanistan and Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, examines in lively detail the rise of China in Eurasia and its implications for the US, Russia and the world, while also putting events in detailed historical context. Has Putin demonstrated there is no such thing as a quick, decisive victory and will this affect China\u2019s options regarding Taiwan? Has he opened the way for China in Eurasia? Aimed at the general reader, this is a seriously informed study of the major players in these \u201cinteresting\u201d times.\n\nAustralian Ghost Stories\n\nJames Phelps\n\nHarper Collins, $15.99 Everybody loves a good ghost story and there are hauntings aplenty in this record of paranormal activity in Oz. Phelps bookends his collection with tales of the Hydro-Majestic Hotel in the Blue Mountains, especially the case of June Clemenger, who was strangled at the hotel in 1934 by an ex-lover, and who now stalks the place attempting retributive strangulation. Not only did Conan-Doyle conduct seances at the hotel, Sir Edmund Barton died there and has also been spotted floating around. In between, we hear believers\u2019 tales of a prison ghost watching black-and-white movies, families in haunted houses smelling phantom cigarette smoke, a Casper-like friendly ghost and ghost whisperers who have the happy knack of detecting the paranormal and \u201ccleansing\u201d the house of it. Get out the Ouija board, dim the lights, and get spooked."

Fans were encouraged to pause the scene in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Smith's, well... sonic screwdriver, and the story got so big that it even started making news headlines.\n\nMatt Smith of course was not nude in the scene, but a BBC spokesperson and the actor himself still came out to deny the story. Smith told the press that he was wearing \"flesh-coloured trunks\" and that fans \"definitely didn't see more.\" He also said that nudity on a Saturday teatime \"wouldn't be proper\", which is about the most British response you could possibly get.\n\nSo there we have it, fans were simply experiencing a false memory. Almost like there was something... in the corner of their eye."

            "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nHundreds of healthcare startups haven't raised fresh venture funding since 2021.\n\nNow VCs say many digital health startups are cutting their valuations to live another day.\n\nInvestors said numerous startups were quietly folding, while others hope to get bought out.\n\nFor a moment at the beginning of 2024, as healthcare investors broke out their checkbooks after a two-year funding desert and gave new life to a struggling class of startups, it looked like starving healthtech founders would be fed once more.\n\nThis year's new funding reality hasn't given all the healthcare darlings a seat at the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe healthcare startup Forward abruptly shut down this month after raising a $100 million Series E last November for its AI \"doctor in a box,\" a bet marked by numerous logistical and financial challenges.\n\nMany more startups are quietly struggling \u2014 cutting their valuations, selling off assets, or closing their doors without any announcement, investors told Business Insider.\n\nWhile in 2021 there were a record 729 healthcare-startup deals, amounting to an eye-popping $29.1 billion, the first three quarters of 2024 brought in only about half of those deals, with much smaller checks: Startups had raised $8.2 billion through September in 379 deals, per Rock Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dropoff suggests hundreds of startups that nabbed funding during venture capital's ZIRP period have been left out to dry. PitchBook data showed that as of mid-November, 327 digital health startups that grabbed funding in 2021 hadn't raised since. Not even the AI boom, which has brought back-to-back fundraises for hot healthcare startups like Abridge, can make up for the discrepancy.\n\nInvestors told BI that dozens of startups were raising funding rounds at a valuation lower than their last round, also known as a down round, or hoping to merge with a competitor to extend their lifespans. Others could shut down altogether.\n\n\"There are more digital health companies that are selling assets, selling people, or whatever they can,\" said Greg Yap, a partner at Menlo Ventures. \"This is a difficult market. We're definitely not done with companies going out of business.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSame companies, different terms\n\nAfter healthcare startups raised big rounds in 2021 at high valuations and then the floor dropped out, plenty of investors threw their startups a lifeline with bridge rounds, meant to give founders a handful of extra cash to get them to their next labeled funding round.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut those firms are done propping up portfolio companies that still aren't succeeding as expected, several healthcare VCs told BI.\n\nAs AI startups explode in popularity, some limited partners just want the funds they're backing to focus on new and exciting deals and cut their losses, said Doba Parushev, a vice president of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield's Healthworx Ventures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"At least for some firms, the LP sentiment is it was a bad vintage. It's done, move on. That's liberating,\" Parushev said. \"I think that's probably driving some behavior around not doing any more internal defensive rounds.\"\n\nSome VCs are turning to new AI investments as their healthcare portfolios struggle. Getty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez\n\nSome startups will thus need to adjust their prices to get the chance to raise more capital from new or existing backers. Alyssa Jaffee, a partner at 7wireVentures, said she was still being pitched some too expensive deals, with hints of the funding expectations left over from 2021's heyday. But she's seeing more healthcare companies accept the need to take a valuation cut to hit their milestones.\n\n\"I would actually hope that more companies said, I'm OK with a down round. We recognize that we were mispriced in the market, and we need to rightsize,\" she said. \"There are expectations from earlier investors who don't want to necessarily take the markdown but may need to take it because that's what's right for the business.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile down rounds are happening at every stage, investors said Series B and C startups may be the most likely to cut their valuations since they're more likely to have revenue traction that suggests they're worth continuing to bet on.\n\nSeed and Series A companies, on the other hand, could be more likely to shut down without that traction. Ruth Health, a startup that provided pregnancy and postpartum care, announced it was closing in November after failing to find the necessary product-market fit. The company last raised a $2.4 million seed round in 2022.\n\n\"Layoffs are awful. Seeking acquisition is humbling. Selling your baby for parts gets demoralizing,\" Alison Greenberg, the startup's CEO and cofounder, said in a LinkedIn post about the shutdown. \"The checklist for a wind-down is long.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTie-ups and shutdowns\n\nNot all healthcare shutdowns this year have happened quietly. Forward made headlines when it announced it was closing up shop a year after raising $100 million to scale its AI-powered kiosks, called CarePods. A BI investigation revealed technical and logistical snags in Forward's style-over-substance strategy \u2014 such as its self-service blood draws not working as expected, and patients getting stuck in the CarePods.\n\nBut investors said many more healthcare businesses shut their doors under the radar this year, especially seed and Series A companies, which have the benefit of fewer eyes on them. This phenomenon hasn't been specific to healthcare \u2014 data from Carta indicates 254 venture-backed startups across all sectors went bankrupt in the first quarter alone. And Parushev said he was expecting plenty of healthcare bankruptcies still up ahead.\n\nForward's San Francisco clinic. The startup said on November 12 that it would close its clinics effective immediately. Rob Price/BI\n\nTo avoid a shutdown, some startups are looking to combine with a competitor. VC firms might move to revitalize two of their portfolio startups at once, as in the case of LetsGetChecked's $525 million acquisition of Truepill. Both startups are backed by Optum Ventures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAxios reported in August that LetsGetChecked was seeking $150 million in a convertible note to help finance the deal. Galym Imanbayev, a partner at Lightspeed Ventures Partners, said he was seeing a fair amount of similar pitches packaged as \"consolidation rounds\" rather than down rounds \u2014 startups raising more money to enable a merger or acquisition. That's generally a more attractive option to investors than a straightforward down round, he said.\n\nMenlo Ventures' Yap said other startups were choosing to get folded into a competitor without fanfare.\n\n\"Nobody wants to make a big deal out of a company that didn't quite work out. A lot of that is happening, but if you don't have to announce it, why would you?\" he said. \"The surviving company, the acquiring company, can just get a little bigger and announce it whenever it makes sense, or not announce it at all.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmar Afridi and Sid Viswanathan cofounded Truepill. Courtesy Truepill\n\nThe next chapter\n\nHealthcare still has plenty of room for winners. Startups like Hinge Health and Omada Health are expected to test the IPO waters next year, and private-equity firms are looking for healthtech companies to scoop up.\n\nCertain areas of healthcare will have to work harder than others to make it to the other side.\n\nWhile healthcare AI deals have taken center stage this year, virtual care has faltered; telehealth startups nabbed $1.4 billion in VC capital in the first three quarters of this year, compared with $2.8 billion in total last year (and $10.2 billion in 2021), according to PitchBook. Broadly, healthcare services have fallen out of favor, with clinic startups struggling to deliver returns against capital-intensive models and retailers like Walgreens and Walmart downsizing their healthcare offerings or ditching them altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVCs told BI they were pushing the next generation of healthcare startups to have better discipline in balancing growth with profits.\n\n\"Hopefully now people have a more sober view of what it takes to be sustainable, and there'll be a set of companies that may choose to grow a little bit more slowly but with good unit economics and with EBITDA, with profits,\" Yap said. \"That can give them the opportunity to not be subject to the vagaries of venture capital, private equity, and other people's money.\""

            "article_content": "2025 will be marked by the rise of AI as a standard tool, but with this advancement comes a new set of challenges.\n\nThe software development landscape is in for a seismic shift in 2025. This year will be marked by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) as a standard tool, but with this advancement comes a new set of challenges. DevPro Journal recently spoke with the team at Digital.ai to learn more and identify 13 key trends that could reshape your development experience in 2025.\n\nDan Shugrue, Application Security Product Marketing, Digital.ai:\n\nSmart Enterprises Will Move Beyond Vulnerability Scanning. As enterprises embrace AI tools to help them code faster, threat actors have worked in lockstep to write faster malware, analyze code, and get better at wreaking havoc. In 2025, smarter enterprises will harden their apps against reverse engineering through advanced obfuscation, anti-tamper, and threat monitoring. AI Tools Will Bleed into Security Teams. In 2025, expect security departments to adopt AI to keep up with the cybersecurity arms race. Early adopters will look to ML-assisted threat analytics to find patterns in attack behavior that better equip them to mitigate attacks.\n\nDerek Holt, CEO, Digital.ai:\n\nAI-based code assistants go from early adopter to standardized driving both positive and negative impacts. While 2023 and 2024 saw a lot of experimentation with coding co-pilots with expanded adoption in startup companies and various forward-leaning enterprises, 2025 will be marked as the year coding co-pilots become a standard. Like all new technology adoption, this will have pros and cons. Expect to see more code developed more quickly, but keep an eye out for challenges with re-use, quality, security, and technical debt. New bottlenecks emerge in software delivery. While AI-assisted development will drive increased code creation and ultimately drive individual developer productivity gains, new bottlenecks will quickly emerge across the broader software delivery lifecycle. Organizations that have not invested in test automation, built in security, release orchestration, code scanning and more will struggle to translate more productive developers into faster time to market. The Emergence of xOps. As more and more \u201ctraditional applications\u201d begin to adopt AI capabilities expect DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps to converge into xOps. This new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u201cAI-aware\u201d Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities. Software Engineering Intelligence steps into the spotlight (and quickly gains predictive AI capabilities). While Value Stream Management continued to lose steam in 2024, we also saw the fast emergence of Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) to take its place. SEI will have a breakout year in 2025 as more and more businesses realize they need to measure the end-to-end business process of software development and delivery in order to drive continuous improvement, truly deliver improved developer experiences and ultimately realize the potential gains for an AI-powered Software Development and Delivery capabilities. SEI is the key to each. Security and Change Risk Prediction Will Outperform Productivity Gains. As AI continues to impact the entire business process of planning, coding, building, testing, and delivering software, the importance of security and risk prediction will take another leap up the list of priorities. 2024 was marked by scale security breaches and huge change risk failures (let\u2019s not forget walking through airport terminals looking at the blue screen of death)\u2026..with AI driving more changes more quickly, enterprise businesses will continue to increase investment in security and risk prediction solutions.\n\nMike Woodard, VP of Product Management for Application Security, Digital.ai:\n\nThe AppSec Arms Race Will Heat Up. In 2025, If it wasn\u2019t obvious before, no one in application security can safely take a break. With the advantage of AI, reverse engineering and attack tools will become even more sophisticated. Threat actors will use these tools and techniques to better understand the operation of apps, uncover their secrets, and make malicious use of APIs. AI-Aided Threat Monitoring Will Become the Norm. SOC managers have the unenviable job of searching mountains of data for actionable information. AI-aided threat monitoring, such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and general classification of data, will become necessary for security teams to surface the most urgent threats so that proper mitigation steps can be taken in a timely manner.\n\nAdam Kentosh, Field CTO, Digital.ai:"
