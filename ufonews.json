        "article_content": "Trump's second term in office could be good news for UFO enthusiasts, Nick thinks\n\nThere could be \"seismic\" consequences for UFO disclosure after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States for the second time. Nick Pope, who once worked for the Ministry of Defence's UFO department, told the Mirror Trump's presidency is the \"perfect storm\". He explained: \"It's the perfect storm: a maverick, populist President in his second term, and \u2013 thus \u2013 not up for re-election.\" Pope added that Trump's unique standing could provide an unprecedented opportunity for transparency. He went on: \"For those in the UFO community who believe there's been a decades-long conspiracy to cover up the truth about an alien presence, Trump in his second term offers the best-ever hope for pushing back against the Deep State and delivering Disclosure.\"\n\nNick is regarded as one of the leading lights in UFO research\n\nHis views tie in with previous speculations that official revealings regarding extraterrestrial contact may coincide with the forthcoming Inauguration Day in January. Nick, a staunch critic of governmental secrets and manipulation, has showcased his opposition through his latest documentary, Apocalypse Covid, which aims to uncover \"the flawed response and government overreach during the pandemic\". US-based Nick suggests that Trump has been hinting at being privy to significant secrets regarding extraterrestrial contact. He added: \"I believe Trump views the subject in the same way as he views the JFK files, where, if there's top secret information still being withheld, it should be declassified and released. \"Trump released most of the JFK files in his first term and has essentially undertaken to release the rest early in his second term. As he seems to link the two issues, there's a strong possibility of bombshell UFO information being released early in 2025, soon after his inauguration.\"\n\nTrending\n\nTrump has often hinted that he knows something about extraterrestrials\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

(Channel 5) (channel 5 screengrabs)\n\nWhat did you miss?\n\nBen Fogle admitted his latest New Lives in the Wild Revisits turned \"weird\" as he listened to the story of a UFO encounter.\n\nThe 50-year-old TV presenter revisited 82-year-old twins Bill and Bob Stone who live in the canyons of Utah and are conspiracy theorists. Fogle was concerned for their health and safety being so isolated and cut off from health services, and somewhat disturbed by their paranoia at being attacked by outsiders.\n\nBut he admitted his day got even \"weirder\" as Bill told him about how they had been visited by a UFO.\n\nWhat, how and why?\n\nBen Fogle met twins Bill and Bob Stone who live in the canyons of Utah. (Channel 5) (Channel 5 screengrabs)\n\nFogle has been making the Channel 5 show about people who have chosen to leave the rat race and live off grid for 10 years. And in the new series, New Lives in the Wild Revisits, is returning to see how they are getting on. In the latest episode he returned to the elderly twins to find Bob's health has deteriorated and Bill is now a fulltime carer for his brother.\n\nFogle asked if much had happed since his last visit. Bill told him: \"Not much, except that UFO that landed over there.\" Fogle replied: \"Whoah?! You saw a UFO? How do you know it was a UFO?\"\n\nBill told him: \"Landed right down there with that cedar tree by the house. What else was it? It did not make any noise at all. They just had a whitish bluish glow to it like static electricity going around it all the time. That had it lit up.\n\n\"I was sitting reading the magazine and Bob started stoking the floor and pointing and I thought, first thought he was having another heart attack he kept pointing out. So I got up out of the chair and looked down. Here comes this whatever this thing was, lands on the other side of the cedar tree right by the house.\"\n\nThe brothers then showed Fogle an image of an alien Bob had carved onto a rock.\n\nFogle said: \"I should say Bill and Bob are not alone in their experiences. That said, I do worry that aliens are just one more thing for Bill and Bob to feel anxious about. The day just got a little bit weirder. There's a lot of eccentricity here, but it's tinged with sadness 'cause there is a very real paranoia and I think a lot of that paranoia is born through news, they consume. But, you know, there's a sparkle of mischief as well and there's something kind of charming about that.\"\n\nRead more: Ben Fogle\n\nWhat else happened on New Lives in the Wild Revisits?\n\nBen Fogle said he felt a strange connection to Bill and Bob Stone. (Channel 5) (Channel 5 screengrabs)\n\nBill also showed Fogle a cave filled with food provisions the 82-year-old had gathered, in preparation for the 'end of the world'.\n\nFogle said: \"This is my third time visiting Bill and Bob and I think what I think is they really like this. They like the game, whether there's an enemy that's real or not.\n\n\"It's not for everyone. And I don't want to be disrespectful. Maybe, you know, maybe they're right. But I don't know whether they are waiting for that moment or they hope it never happens. Possibly thinks that they've just enjoyed the process.\"\n\nBen Fogle said he had learned from Bill Stone's eccentricities. (Channel 5) (Channel 5 screengrabs)\n\nBut despite not agreeing with their opinions, Fogle said he felt a \"strange connection\" to Bill and Bob.\n\nHe said: \"All these people who I've visited over the last 13 years or so have changed me profoundly. I feel incredibly lucky to have met such an eclectic bunch of people who I would never normally have had a chance to meet because I feel they've put my own life into perspective.\n\n\"And it's easy to come and meet the Bill and Bobs and to kind of laugh at prepper lifestyle that they've lived. But there's many Bill and Bob's out there. It's opened my eyes to a whole new world and it makes you think differently and I'm not about to go home and buy a cave and fill it with guns and food. But I do look at people differently and that is all. Thanks to the Bill and Bobs of this world. I owe them a lot.\"\n\nBen Fogle's New Lives in the Wild Revisits airs on Channel 5 on Tuesday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Yahoo TV UK at https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ben-fogle-new-lives-wild-ufo-encounter-220214134.html"

        "date": "5hOpinion",
        "source": "AOL",
        "article_content": "Tech companies continue to roll out new generative AI apps and services. Microsoft (MSFT) has its Copilot for Windows; Apple (AAPL) has Apple Intelligence for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac; Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has Gemini for its apps and Pixel phones; and Meta (META) has Meta AI for its various social media services. But despite all of the hype, I\u2019m still not sold on these apps. At least not yet.\n\nI\u2019ve been using each company\u2019s products for a while now, and while they\u2019ve got some intriguing capabilities, none of them has the kind of features that make me want them to be a part of my daily life. The problem, at least so far, is that much of what these companies have to offer are solutions for niche situations or kitschy demos for what\u2019s to come down the line.\n\nWhether that\u2019s manipulating photos to completely alter their settings, changing an artificial intelligence app\u2019s voice to a celebrity\u2019s voice, or creating generative AI-based emojis, I haven\u2019t come across a single generative AI feature that would convince me to spend $800 on a new phone or PC or make me want to change how I use apps. But there\u2019s potential on the horizon.\n\nLimited uses for most users\n\nIf you\u2019re an Android user, you\u2019ve likely at least tried some of the company\u2019s generative AI capabilities via Google\u2019s Pixel phones or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line of devices. There\u2019s the ability to edit photos to do things like make your 4-year-old appear as though she\u2019s dunking a basketball on a regulation-height hoop or that your dog is driving your car. You can also reimagine your photos to, say, transform a road into a rushing river, or even add objects to them that weren\u2019t there before.\n\nApple also offers photo editing capabilities with its first wave of Apple Intelligence features, though it\u2019s far tamer than Google\u2019s, only allowing you to remove objects from the background of your photos like a person walking behind your subject in a shot or a cup off of a table.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot+PCs are Windows PC with added generative AI features like the company's Copilot chatbot software. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nMeta AI can pull off the same tricks as Google, letting you do things like remove large objects from images or transform the floor in a photo into lava. It\u2019s all a bit of fun to use at first, but unless you\u2019re spending a lot of time posting the perfect shot to Instagram every day, there\u2019s little reason to regularly use these apps. Is that worth buying a new $799 iPhone or $999 for a Surface laptop or changing your routine to use a new piece of software? Not really.\n\nTech companies are also offering features that can summarize large chunks of text, rewrite emails to make them more professional or more casual, and prepare bullet points to help quickly digest the most important parts of a report. These can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to plow through a massive document, but it\u2019s hard to imagine most people taking advantage of such an option in their daily lives.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re the type of person who needs to closely read reports, surveys, or emails for exact details, you\u2019re probably not going to put all of your trust into a generative AI app to get all of the information you require, especially when they\u2019re able to make up information and then present it as though it\u2019s fact.\n\nI find chatting with AI bots helpful at times, but it still hasn\u2019t replaced Google as my go-to for looking up information on the web. And I\u2019m definitely not about to pony up a chunk of change just to chat with a robot.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come\n\nWhile the first slate of generative AI apps and services may not be the generation-defining raft of technologies that tech companies have been hyping them as, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity ahead.\n\nApple plans to continue to update its Apple Intelligence platform throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025, while Google and Microsoft regularly announce new capabilities for their respective consumer generative AI offerings. Meta also continues to debut new options for its own Meta AI service.\n\nBut the real excitement will come as third-party developers begin to push out their own generative AI-enabled apps over the months and years ahead. What we\u2019re getting right now is sort of a test run of what generative AI can do for the average consumer, but third-party developers will likely be the ones that give us the killer apps that make the technology a hit among users.\n\nThink of it like when Apple first launched the App Store. Sure, iPhones were cool and interesting, but sales really took off once Apple allowed third-party developers to start selling apps of their own for its flagship device. If generative AI is going to be as revolutionary a product as the tech industry promises, it\u2019ll be third-party developers that get us there.\n\nNow we just have to wait for them to do their thing.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "date": "Windows Latest5h",
        "source": "Windows Latest",
        "article_content": "It\u2019s finally happening. Back in February, Windows Latest reported that Microsoft is planning to add Copilot AI to Notepad, a feature that will allow you to create content using generative AI on Windows 11. With today\u2019s preview update, AI in Notepad is now rolling out to testers, but remember, it may not show for everyone just yet.\n\nThe feature is called \u201cRewrite in Notepad,\u201d and it basically allows you to rewrite your existing content. At the moment, it cannot create content from scratch. The \u201cRewrite\u201d feature is designed to refine or improve existing content, and Microsoft officials said that it is powered by \u201ca powerful AI model named GPT.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the \u201cGPT\u201d model is referring to ChatGPT or something else, but it\u2019s fair to assume it\u2019s ChatGPT. With Rewrite in Notepad, you can reword sentences and change tone, making them sound more formal, casual, inspirational, or humorous. You can also change the format of their text.\n\nYou can keep it as default or convert it into different styles like a paragraph, list, business format, academic style, marketing pitch, or even poetry.\n\nAt Windows Latest, we test everything before we discuss it in articles, so I also tried Notepad\u2019s AI rewrite. It\u2019s quite handy, and its performance is impressive. It gets the job done.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how the AI works inside Notepad and what happens behind the scenes.\n\nHands on with AI rewrite in Notepad on Windows 11\n\nFirst and foremost, AI rewrite in Notepad is exclusive to testers in the Canary and Dev Channel of the Windows Insider Program. It\u2019s available only in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany and Canada.\n\nYou also need to sign into your Microsoft account to use AI in Notepad. The feature requires authentication, and it sends your content to Azure.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s online service does not store the text or generated content after processing, ensuring that your data remains private and secure,\u201d Microsoft officials clarified.\n\nMicrosoft limits the usage and performance based on the \u201cCredits\u201d system. If you run out of credits, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to Copilot Pro or wait for a month.\n\n\u201cAI credits reset on the first day of each month,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Latest. Copilot Pro removes the credit usage limit.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the updated Notepad experience, you can check for updates, but Microsoft told us the feature isn\u2019t widely available yet.\n\nHow to use ChatGPT \u201cRewrite\u201d in Notepad for Windows 11\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to write something yourself and then select the text where you want AI rewrite to work. For example, in my case, I had written a short essay on Dogs, and I selected everything except the first line. Then, I clicked the Rewrite button in the toolbar to access it.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the following options as you as you click on the Rewrite button:\n\nRewrite\n\nMake shorter\n\nMake longer\n\nChange tone\n\nChange format\n\nUnder \u201cChange Tone,\u201d the available options are:\n\nDefault\n\nFormal\n\nCasual\n\nInspirational\n\nHumor\n\nUnder \u201cChange Format,\u201d the available options are:\n\nDefault\n\nParagraph\n\nList\n\nBusiness\n\nAcademic\n\nMarketing\n\nPoetry\n\nThese options are self-explanatory, but you can find them again in the next AI pop-up if you\u2019re unsure.\n\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that Notepad AI generates three versions of the content. The three variants are slightly different from each other, and the system prompt is apparently all about switching between words. They do not change the content significantly, but the third version has more changes compared to the second.\n\nYou can use the arrow keys to go through the three variants. You can finalize one of the variants, but you again have the choice to change everything.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s a \u201cLength\u201d button with a dropdown menu. When clicked, it gives you options to make the text similar in length, shorter, or longer. Next, there is a \u201cTone\u201d button with a dropdown, where you can adjust the tone of the text.\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201cFormat\u201d button (labeled as \u201cList\u201d in the below screenshot).\n\nUnder the rewritten text, there\u2019s a Replace button, which will replace your original text with this new version if you are happy with it.\n\nThere\u2019s a star icon with a number (showing 46). This shows your AI credit points. When you run out of credits, AI will take longer than usual to generate content.\n\nIs more Copilot stuff coming to Notepad in Windows 11?\n\nMicrosoft also quietly tested the AI integration in Notepad in a blog post published last month, but nobody noticed it.\n\nIn it, the company stated that Microsoft 365 subscribers will get AI credits to use Copilot inside Office apps and elsewhere, including \u201capps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on Windows.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell what\u2019s next for Copilot inside Notepad, but it\u2019s clear the company is betting big on AI in Windows 11. It\u2019s hopeful that it can convince more people to subscribe to Copilot Pro to remove the AI credit balance limit.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you pay for Copilot Pro to limit AI limitations in Notepad and other Windows apps?"

Over the decades, several US outlets have carried stories about ghostly sightings and mysterious night-time noises plaguing the 18th-century building. On the big result day, these stories are circulating again on the internet, and here's what we know about them.\n\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, there are numerous accounts of encounters with former residents, including the founding father and third president, Thomas Jefferson. However, the most famous spirit believed to haunt the White House is that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president.\n\nIn 1946, President Harry S Truman wrote to his wife in a letter that is archived in his presidential library and museum.\n\n\"I jumped up and put on my bathrobe, opened the door, and no one there,\" he wrote. \"Went out and looked up and down the hall, looked in your room and Margie's. Still no one. Went back to bed after locking the doors and there were footsteps in your room whose door I'd left open. Jumped and looked and no one there! The damned place is haunted sure as shootin'. Secret Service said not even a watchman was up here at that hour.\"\n\n\"You and Margie had better come back and protect me before some of these ghosts carry me off.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, the most famous ghost haunting the White House is undoubtedly that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president. After his assassination in 1865, Lincoln's ghost reportedly appeared in both the Yellow Oval Room and the Lincoln Bedroom. He is said to have materialised to notable figures, including First Lady Grace Coolidge (wife of President Calvin Coolidge), British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, making him the most frequently sighted spirit in the White House.\n\nThe news outlet also reported that residents and staff members have, on various occasions, witnessed the ghost of Abigail Adams, America's second First Lady, hanging laundry or noticed a scent of lavender and damp clothing in the East Room.\n\nIn a 2018 interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Jenna Bush Hager shared that she heard 1920s piano music emanating from her room's fireplace. Jenna and her sister Barbara, daughters of President George W. Bush, heard music from the fireplace in the Lincoln Room on two separate occasions: first, 1920s piano music one week, and then opera music the following week, as Jenna later recounted to Hoda Kotb on the Today show.\n\n\"Our phone rang, and I woke up, and all of a sudden we heard like 1920s piano music coming out of our fireplace ... It was like the middle of the night, and you can feel the music out of the fireplace,\" Jenna said on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\".\n\n"

Initially estimated to have a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029, this asteroid sparked widespread media coverage and public interest. Fortunately, further observations confirmed that it will not collide with our planet, including during its close approaches in 2029 and 2036.Measuring approximately 450 metres across, Apophis will pass as close as 30,600 kilometres (19,000 miles) from Earth on April 13, 2029, making it one of the closest encounters with a significant asteroid in recent history. As scientists prepare to study this intriguing celestial body, the upcoming flybys present valuable opportunities for research and public engagement.Apophis, formally known as 99942 Apophis, is a near-Earth asteroid with an orbit that brings it within 1.3 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Since its discovery in 2004, it has captured significant media attention, particularly when it was initially estimated to have a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029. There was also a brief period during which it was thought to pose a risk in 2036. However, further observations have confirmed that Apophis will not collide with Earth in either of these years.While Apophis won\u2019t collide with Earth, it will come very close on April 13, 2029. On that day, it will pass just 30,600 kilometres (19,000 miles) away from Earth, closer than some of our geostationary satellites. This close encounter is expected to spark public interest, and organisations like the Planetary Society are recommending ways to educate the public about the event. On March 30, 2036, Apophis will be much farther away, passing Earth at a distance of 8.4 million kilometres (5.2 million miles), which is more than 20 times the distance to the Moon.The name \"Apophis\" is derived from Egyptian mythology, where Apophis represents a serpent that is the enemy of Ra, the sun god. Each night, Apophis attempted to engulf the world in darkness, only to be defeated by Ra at dawn.Apophis was discovered on June 19, 2004, by astronomers Roy Tucker, David Tholen, and Fabrizio Bernardi at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. Tucker had previously received a grant from the Shoemaker Near Earth Object Grant Program, which supports amateur astronomers in their efforts to find, track, and characterise near-Earth objects.Determining the exact size and shape of Apophis from Earth is challenging due to its small size. However, radar imaging has revealed that Apophis measures approximately 450 metres (1,500 feet) across its longest axis\u2014comparable to five football fields and taller than the Empire State Building.Its shortest axis measures about 170 metres. The asteroid is likely to be egg-shaped or possibly dual-lobed, resembling Arrokoth, a small celestial body that NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft encountered in 2019.Currently, Apophis is not expected to hit Earth anytime soon. It will definitely miss Earth in 2029 and 2036, and observations made in March 2021 ruled out any risk of impact for at least the next 100 years. Initially, the chance of a 2029 impact was higher because early observations had not yet refined its trajectory. As more data became available, scientists were able to rule out the possibility of an impact.If Apophis were to collide with Earth, it would cause significant destruction, with effects felt hundreds of kilometres from the impact site. The energy released would be equivalent to over 1,000 megatons of TNT, similar to multiple nuclear explosions. In comparison, the asteroid that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs was much larger, at least 10 to 15 kilometres wide.Apophis will not collide with our geostationary communications satellites. While it will pass closer than some of these satellites, its trajectory is inclined away from the equator, ensuring it does not enter the region occupied by these vital communications systems.Yes, during its 2029 close approach, Apophis will be visible from Europe, Africa, and western Asia, appearing as a bright star moving across the sky. In 2036, it will be too far away to see without a telescope.Astronomers monitor asteroids like Apophis through a combination of follow-up observations and tracking efforts. These observations are gathered from both professional astronomers and skilled amateurs, then submitted to the Minor Planet Center. Teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the NEODyS program in Italy compute the orbits of asteroids based on this data. The accuracy of these predictions is determined by the quality and quantity of observations.In some cases, radar is employed to obtain precise distance measurements, further refining orbital predictions. Additionally, spacecraft missions to near-Earth asteroids provide even more accurate orbital data.NASA's OSIRIS-APEX mission will study Apophis for 18 months starting in April 2029, just before its close encounter with Earth. This mission uses the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which recently returned samples from the asteroid Bennu.OSIRIS-APEX will investigate how Earth\u2019s gravity affects Apophis' rotation and surface properties. This study could provide valuable insights about the asteroid and help scientists learn how to deflect similar objects that might threaten Earth in the future. As we approach the close encounters with Apophis, ongoing research and public education will be important for understanding this fascinating asteroid."

Pictured, Idy's burial chamber when discovered\n\nPictured, a close-up of the outer coffin of Idy, showing remarkable illustrations that were made nearly 4,000 years ago\n\nAsyut, a city in Egypt that sits comfortably along the west bank of the Nile river, was a prosperous regional capital and port city\n\nIdy had been placed in a coffin inside a coffin and then sealed in a side chamber in a vertical shaft about 45 feet deep that had been dug in the tomb of her father.\n\nHer coffins, weighing around 200-300 kg each, are above average in size with a length of 8.59 feet (2.62 metres) and 6.66 feet (2.03 metres).\n\nProfessor Kahl said both coffins seem to be made out of 'foreign wood', meaning wood sourced from outside of Egypt.\n\nHe said they are both 'completely decorated with wonderful images and texts' describing the journey of the deceased in the afterlife.\n\nTheir study will allow 'new and far-reaching statements to be made about the position of women and the transfer of knowledge in ancient Egypt'.\n\nWhile Idy's resting place has until now been unnoticed by researchers, it's thought the chamber was ransacked by thieves thousands of years ago.\n\nHer remains were robbed of all jewelry and metal objects in the search for treasures, but other grave goods seem to have been of no interest to the ancient looters.\n\n'Remnants of Idy's garment and her bones, which were completely torn to shreds by ancient looters, provide information about her person,' added Professor Kahl.\n\nIdy was found in two nested wooden coffins with numerous grave goods, including wooden figurines. Pictured, a female figure made of wood\n\nAccording to an initial visual inspection of the bones, Idy was probably around 40 years old and suffered from a foot problem, he added.\n\nSomewhat gruesomely, a box of jars were also found containing Idy's internal organs removed during mummification \u2013 liver, spleen, lungs and intestines.\n\nThis was customary during mummification, as the ancient Egyptians learned the internal organs would decay quickly.\n\nTypically, mummification in ancient Egypt then involved desiccating the body with a mixture of salts and then wrapping it in cloth soaked in a balm of plant extracts, oils, and resins.\n\nOlder mummies are believed to have been naturally preserved by burying them in dry desert sand and were not chemically treated.\n\nProfessor Kahl said further study of the discovered remains will continue in an effort to shed more light on the lives of the governor and his daughter.\n\n'After an initial conservational consolidation of the wooden objects in the burial chamber and the subsequent laborious recovery from the narrow, 14-metre deep shaft, the finds will be handed over to the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism,' he added."

        "article_content": "One of the most intriguing aspects of the political personality of Richard Nixon \u2014 that stiff, charmless, Quaker-raised professional politician who remains the only person to be elected America\u2019s vice president and president twice \u2014 was his ability to successfully cultivate the white working class.\n\nNixon recognised the white backlash developing against civil rights in the 1960s, and growing white anger at \u201celites\u201d on issues like bussing. He worked out that New Deal politics were no longer as effective for the Democrats, as working-class voters began enjoying real prosperity and their political focus switched away from wages and working conditions.\n\nIt was Nixon who channelled white working-class anger toward protesters and far-left students, the kind of anger displayed by New York construction workers beating up Vietnam marchers. One of the factors helping Nixon to a landslide reelection in 1972 was union hostility to the anti-war Democrat nominee George McGovern, with the trade union giant AFL-CIO \u2014 which Nixon had carefully cultivated \u2014 refusing to endorse McGovern.\n\nNixon combined an appeal to white working-class values with some decidedly un-Republican economic policies: a price and wage freeze, a universal income proposal (as advocated by raging socialist Milton Friedman) that he nearly managed to deliver, heavy regulation of business, and affirmative action. Ronald Reagan, one of Nixon\u2019s Republican rivals in 1968, would also win over many white working-class voters, but his domestic policies were a combination of doctrinaire neoliberalism \u2014 attacks on unions, privatisation, deregulation \u2014 with big government spending. While pollsters still talk about \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d, it was Nixon who turned white working-class voters Republican first, and whose example is most useful for what\u2019s now happened in the US.\n\nLike Nixon, Trump combines atavistic tribalism with some left-wing policies. But while Nixon used code like \u201claw and order\u201d to signal his alignment with the white backlash, there\u2019s no code from Trump, and no fig leaf like Nixon\u2019s oft-promised \u201cBlack capitalism\u201c. Trump\u2019s appeal to white Americans, and particularly white men, is unsubtle and has far more targets: migrants, especially, as well as African Americans, women and trans people. Trump offers white voters a zero-sum game in which only one group of Americans can ever win, with Trump determined to ensure it will be white men.\n\nTrump\u2019s economic policies aren\u2019t a continuation or extension of previous Democratic policies, as many of Nixon\u2019s were. Instead, Trump himself has dragged the Democrats to the left on economics. \u201cBidenomics\u201d was an embrace and expansion of Trump\u2019s protectionism during his first presidency, combining economic policy with America\u2019s geopolitical goal to suppress a rising rival in China, to halt China\u2019s rise while delivering blue-collar American jobs \u2014 thus signalling that the economy could work in favour of the working class and middle-income earners in a way it hadn\u2019t in the decades since Reagan.\n\nThe lesson from this week\u2019s election, however, is that delivering economically is not enough, not anymore. The Democratic Party has survived since the Nixon years by cobbling together coalitions of minority voters with the white working class \u2014 enough to regularly deliver control of Congress, elect three presidents and win the majority of votes even when they didn\u2019t win the White House. Having learnt from Trump to shift back leftward on economics, the Democrats now face the much more difficult task of switching to the right on issues like migration, minority rights and values, which are likely to shear off sections of the coalition, leaving them to left-wing groups outside the Democrats.\n\nIn short, if this was a bizarre version of 1968, the next election might be one of 1972, in which the Democrats openly split between minorities and white working-class institutions like unions. Trump, theoretically, can\u2019t run again, and seems too exhausted to serve his coming term, let alone another. But he has shown a path for future Republicans to take the white working class, perhaps in a way that shifts them permanently to the GOP, nigh on 100 years since FDR completely changed American politics with the New Deal.\n\nThen again, we now know what was going on in 1971 and 1972. Nixon and his highest cabinet officials and advisers had a team of crooks operating out of the White House, agents of Nixon\u2019s intense paranoia, obsessive personality and conviction that the east-coast Establishment wanted to destroy him. Even as he played 3D chess with the Russians and the Chinese, operating at a geopolitical level rarely seen in US history, he was trampling the rule of law at home, so much so that eventually his own party abandoned him.\n\nIt\u2019s hard \u2014 impossible \u2014 to see the MAGA Republican Party ever doing that. They already know Trump is a criminal and they love him for it. And as I pointed out a couple of years ago in a piece that attracted some attention at the time, Nixon didn\u2019t have some of the most powerful media proprietors in the US in his corner like Trump does. But as Americans who lived through 1968, 1972 and Watergate can tell you, funny things happen when you put an obsessive, unstable paranoiac in a position of ultimate power.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the outcome of the US election?

        "article_content": "The iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra are both big phones with big screens, big power, and big price tags. The cameras are also impressive, but which one of these two archrivals takes better photos?\n\nI\u2019ve been using the Galaxy S24 Ultra again over the past few weeks and have put it against Apple\u2019s latest top iPhone to find out. And the results are pretty shocking.\n\nThe cameras\n\nBefore we look at the phones, let\u2019s look at the numbers behind the cameras, starting with the iPhone 16 Pro Max. There are three cameras on the back, starting with the main 48-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization, which can also take 2x zoom photos. It\u2019s joined by a 12MP telephoto camera for 5x optical zoom photos and a 48MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra has four cameras. It\u2019s led by a main 200MP camera, along with a pair of telephoto cameras \u2014 a 10MP camera for a 3x optical zoom and a 50MP periscope zoom for 5x optical shots \u2014 plus a 12MP ultrawide camera. Unlike previous Galaxy Ultra phones, the S24 Ultra has \u201coptical quality\u201d 10x zoom shots, which have proven to be just as good as optical zoom shots.\n\nFor reference, I used the Standard Photographic Style on the iPhone 16 Pro Max for all the photos below, and each phone\u2019s camera was used in auto mode. All the photos were downloaded onto an Apple Mac mini and examined on a color-calibrated monitor. They have all been resized for friendlier online viewing.\n\nMain camera\n\nWhen using the main camera, the iPhone 16 Pro Max consistently took more visually pleasing photos than the S24 Ultra, apart from its long-time issue with exposure occasionally rearing its head. In the first photo of the leafy lane, you can see where it causes the camera problems and where the S24 Ultra\u2019s colors are punchier and more vibrant.\n\nHowever, as you can see in the second photo of the Aston Martin Valkyrie car, the S24 Ultra\u2019s eagerness results in noise, which is entirely absent from the iPhone\u2019s pin-sharp, more accurately colored image. Although its exposure can cause issues sometimes, here, it gets it exactly right \u2014 to the point where I can easily read the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the windscreen, which is blurred and jumbled in Samsung\u2019s photo.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra often gets a certain type of photo right, such as the example at the top, but everywhere else, the iPhone improves. The photo inside the church shows the wonderful tone and warmth of the iPhone\u2019s camera, rather than the starkness of the S24 Ultra, right down to the color of the padding on the seats and the wooden beams on the ceiling.\n\nTake a look at our final photo to see how the iPhone\u2019s super-sharp focus and depth of field help it take detailed, emotional shots, even of the simplest subjects. The foam and bubbles on top of the coffee are so sharp, and the depth of field is exactly right, making for a more realistic, attractive photo than the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, which seems less aware of its subject.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nUltrawide camera\n\nOn paper, the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s ultrawide camera should easily improve on the Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s camera, but in reality, it\u2019s the opposite. The S24 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide camera shows up the iPhone\u2019s camera really badly. The first photo of the Ferrari FF was taken indoors in good lighting (the same environment as the Aston Martin Valkyrie photo above), and the iPhone\u2019s photo is full of noise and blur, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra avoids most of the same issues to produce a sharper, less blurred image. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s far better than the iPhone\u2019s photo.\n\nOutside, things don\u2019t improve much for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but it can still impress with its warm tones. The photo of the fields and sky shows the S24 Ultra\u2019s vibrant colors but overall coldness. However, it has a less noisy foreground and more detail, such as around the fence post. In the distance, the two cameras introduce some blur and noise.\n\nIn the final photo of the church, you can see how much sharper the S24 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide photos are, with the stonework on the spire far clearer and less muddy than in the iPhone\u2019s image. Yes, the S24 Ultra does use quite a lot of software enhancement, but it\u2019s easier to forgive it when the balance and sharpness is right.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n2x zoom and 3x zoom\n\nThe two phones have different \u201cshort\u201d zooms, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max offering a 2x optical zoom and the S24 Ultra a 3x optical zoom. You can see examples of them both here, and we\u2019ll be judging this category as one rather than two separate categories. The 2x zoom is fairly consistent across both cameras for balance and focus, but the iPhone can introduce some noise, while the S24 Ultra\u2019s photos have a softer look.\n\nMove on to the 3x zoom across the two cameras, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max can\u2019t match the S24 Ultra\u2019s performance. Shots are far noisier and less sharp, while the Samsung phone\u2019s 3x zoom produces excellent photos with plenty of life and detail. This is to be expected, given Samsung\u2019s dedicated optical 3x mode.\n\nBut because the S24 Ultra\u2019s 2x mode isn\u2019t awful compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 2x shots, it\u2019s going to win this category for being more versatile, as you could realistically use both zooms on it, but would want to stick with the 2x on the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n5x zoom\n\nBoth cameras have 5x optical zooms, and Samsung continues its run of zoom superiority here too. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a problem with sharpness and focus, resulting in grainy, blurry, or noisy images that look worse the more you crop them down. These issues are missing from the S24 Ultra\u2019s camera, and its photos look great at 5x zoom.\n\nTake the wooden angel as an example. Not only are the colors and textures far more realistic in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, but when you crop it down, there\u2019s detail in the wood that the iPhone struggles to capture. The overall sharpness makes the depth of field pop more, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s photo appears flatter.\n\nPhotos taken outside have similar issues, but the iPhone does win a few points with generally more realistic colors. Many will like the S24 Ultra\u2019s fairly saturated colors, which stay consistent across all lenses. The donkey\u2019s fur is sharper and more defined in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, and there\u2019s clearly less noise on the wooden fence post and the red strap. Samsung wins the 5x zoom category, so will it make it three-for-three as we move to the 10x category?\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\n10x zoom\n\nNeither phone has a 10x optical zoom, but Samsung does make a point of highlighting its optical quality photos at 10x and does include a shortcut in its camera app. The iPhone does not, and things do start out quite well.\n\nThe horse photo reveals a similar level of detail, but when you get very close, there\u2019s far more evidence of software enhancements in the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo, with some haloing visible along the horse\u2019s back and ears. This glow is not in the iPhone\u2019s photo at all, giving it a more natural appearance.\n\nBut the iPhone does not always win here, as seen in the next photo of the wooden pub sign. The S24 Ultra\u2019s photo has less noise than the iPhone\u2019s photo, particularly on the green board, and its more dynamic coloring means the fall leaves glow more attractively.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is far more consistent when shooting 10x photos, as the final photo of the car proves. The differences are clear \u2014 accurate colors, spot-on white balance, and no obvious noise. The iPhone can\u2019t keep up at 10x zoom.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nNight mode\n\nWhen it came to shooting photos in low light, the Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s preview on the phone made me expect the worst, as it did not show a truly representative image straight after taking it. The iPhone didn\u2019t have any such problem, so when I was collecting photos, I feared for the S24 Ultra\u2019s performance. However, the images looked totally different in the gallery, and at first, the two appeared quite evenly matched.\n\nThe outside of the brightly lit pub is a great example. The iPhone overexposes in many places while showing more detail than the S24 Ultra\u2019s photos in others. However, in most other areas \u2014 the seating and foliage, for example \u2014 both cope with the low light well. The iPhone\u2019s photo does have a little more blur, though, and the overexposure hides details, such as in the pub\u2019s signage.\n\nIn the photo of the village shop, the iPhone\u2019s more accurate colors shine through, and it\u2019s also less blurry than the S24 Ultra, where the software smooths out a lot of detail, showing both are very sensitive to lighting conditions when taking photos in the dark. The two trade blows like this in all the lowlight images I took, and while the iPhone\u2019s overexposure often caused problems, the S24 Ultra\u2019s smoothing often did the same.\n\nHowever, the S24 Ultra was great in difficult, harsh lighting conditions. Shooting into the sunset, the S24 Ultra captured the golden glow in the sky, the blue sky, the green of the grass, and the scene as a whole. The iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s photo contains so much shadow that it robs it of emotion and detail. The real-world environment was somewhere in between the two, but the S24 Ultra\u2019s photo is the one I\u2019d keep or share.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nSamsung\u2019s flagship comes out on top\n\nIt may come as a shock to some, but the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra \u2014 a phone released at the beginning of the year \u2014 has taken a victory in all but one category against the new Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max. It has by far the superior camera when you want to take any zoom or ultrawide photo.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t quite match the iPhone 16 Pro Max in the main camera category, though, and I consistently preferred it to the S24 Ultra. Still, it should be noted the iPhone\u2019s exposure and contrast can still upset the balance of some images, especially in challenging light. This has affected iPhone cameras for several generations, so it is not unique to the 16 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s very interesting is that the iPhone 16 Pro comprehensively beat the Google Pixel 9 Pro in a recent test, proving its top camera credentials. It also showed several improvements over the iPhone 15 Pro. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has been a winner from the start by improving on its predecessor, beating the Google Pixel 8 Pro, and equaling the performance of our favorite Android camera phone, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra.\n\nIt may not be the latest on the market, but the Galaxy S24 Ultra continues to take on the very best camera phones and easily holds its own."
