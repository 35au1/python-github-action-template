            "article_content": "Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit launched a novel artificial intelligence (AI) coder that is touted as capable of building an application \"in minutes\", sparking plenty of discourse among software programmers in mainland China.\n\nThe AI coder, part of Alibaba Cloud's AI programming tool called Tongyi Lingma, can perform a set of automated tasks - from comprehending prompts, writing code and debugging software - to complete development of an app \"as fast as a few minutes\", according to a company statement on Wednesday. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe system is powered by Alibaba Cloud's Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models (LLMs) - the technology behind generative AI (GenAI) services like ChatGPT - and improves code development efficiency \"by over 10 times\", the company said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nIts launch has fanned speculation among Chinese programmers that this tool can surpass those from US firms like ChatGPT creator OpenAI, as Alibaba Cloud touted its AI coder as the world's first such system that supports both Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and JetBrains' IDEs - two popular integrated software-development platforms used in the industry.\n\nShanghai-based software engineer Frank Lin said he had previously used the coding tool on ChatGPT's website, which can handle routine coding tasks but has limited \"creative abilities\".\n\n\"The Alibaba Cloud one looks stronger than the ChatGPT one by its introduction,\" Lin said, adding that he would be willing to pay for the new service if it proves to be competitive.\n\nAlibaba Cloud is seeing growing domestic adoption of its artificial intelligence programming tool, Tongyi Lingma.

Enterprise users, however, are charged a monthly fee of least 79 yuan (US$11).\n\nShenzhen-based programmer Wang Yiran said the new AI tool has raised hopes that a cheaper, but more powerful and efficient system, is readily accessible for use on the mainland.\n\n\"I've been using Cursor to assist my job, which is a bit expensive,\" Wang said, referring to the AI code editor of VS Code. Microsoft charges US$20 per month for professional users and US$40 per user per month for enterprise clients.\n\nAlibaba Cloud's AI coder reflects the growing adoption of its GenAI tools, following the success of its Tongyi Qianwen LLM series, also known as Qwen, in a range of industries and across various markets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of May last year, Qwen had more than 90,000 corporate clients in industries ranging from consumer electronics to cars and online games, according to Alibaba Cloud chief technology officer Zhou Jingren.\n\nLaunched in 2023, AI programming tool Tongyi Lingma has been adopted by a number of major domestic companies including China United Property Insurance, Changan Automobile and state-owned carmaker FAW Group, according to Alibaba Cloud.\n\nTongyi Lingma has so far recorded more than 9 million downloads for its plug-ins - software components that add a specific feature to an existing computer program. It has also generated 1.5 billion lines of code, making it one of the most used AI coding solutions for programmers in China.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

This results in the easy creation of see-through elements such as smoke as well as accurate reflections and ethereal effects, which all blend and animation naturally in a scene.\n\nCurrently AI apps and models can only generate solid images, which restricts how the data and scenes being generated can be used. TransPixar has just changed the way AI generates effects and scenes, and could be truly a significant release.\n\nIn the white paper Yijun Li, project leader at Adobe Research, wrote: \"Alpha channels are crucial for visual effects, allowing transparent elements like smoke and reflections to blend seamlessly into scenes. However, generating RGBA video, which includes alpha channels for transparency, remains a challenge due to limited datasets and the difficulty of adapting existing models.\"\n\nAs development costs in film and video games increase to wild proportions AI could be the way studios cut costs, and do so without reducing staff numbers. The hope is AI like TransPixar can make life easier for VFX artists, not replace them, while helping smaller studios and solo developers compete.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the demos released with the open source code, Adobe's team showed how TransPixar can deliver impressive results, including a varied mix of effects, from simple text prompts. The demos include emerging smoke clouds, an electrical portal and a swirling asteroid belt. The AI model can even animate still images with transparent effects.\n\nThe Adobe team has released the code, making it available on GitHub for developers to test and advance, as well as a demo on Hugging Face. TransPixar is in its early stages but I'd love to see how this is developed, perhaps as an After Effects plugin or Cinema 4D plugin."

            "article_content": "\n\nFor Gen Z, life has been full of unprecedented events and developments in the world around them in the early 21st century. Everything from living through a pandemic to trends to technological advancements and political shifts, the so-called Zoomers are a generation who has seen a lot. This also includes movies, many of which reflect the world and the times to particularly disturbing effect. This is especially true for the horror genre that often taps into some of the bigger anxieties and questions of society and culture in frequently dark or disturbing ways.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nWhile past generations have their share of disturbing horror movie classics to call their own, it is especially true for Gen Z. Some of the 21st century\u2019s biggest horror hits have left Gen Z shaken with their effectiveness to continually unsettle and terrify. Additionally, there have also been other major box office hits that have blurred the line between horror, psychological thriller, and everything in between, and have also produced some all-timers on the fronts of chilling and scaring Zoomers, leaving a whole generation with permanent anxiety. Here are seven big 21st century hits that Gen Z has been shaken to its collective core by.\n\nParanormal Activity (2009)\n\nThe found footage horror movie phenomenon skyrocketed to new heights with 2009\u2019s sleeper hit Paranormal Activity. When young couple Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat begin experiencing bizarre hauntings at night, Micah sets up a camera to try to observe their supernatural menace. Produced for just $15,000 and set entirely in the couple\u2019s house, Paranormal Activity\u2018s miniscule resources only enhance its terror with director Oren Peli\u2019s deft command of delivering found footage scares.\n\nParanormal Activity builds the demonic entity\u2019s threat gradually, with sounds going bump in the night that eventually graduate to doors slamming shut and Katie being pulled out of bed by an invisible force. The ending (changed from Peli\u2019s originally filmed conclusion at the suggestion of Steven Spielberg himself) takes the entity\u2019s menace to its most overt, and while the final scene is the move\u2019s most polarizing scare, Paranormal Activity nonetheless frightened audiences to tremendous acclaim and box office success in the fall of 2009. The success of Paranormal Activity launched the eponymous franchise and made found footage horror movies all the rage for years to come after its surprise success, and it remains a Halloween found footage favorite.\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy (2014)\n\nWhile 2013\u2019s The Purge first introduced a night where rules of civilized society are thrown out the window and even murder becomes legal, its 2014 follow-up The Purge: Anarchy really showed how effective a premise it is for a horror movie. Set in a dystopian future after the United States has been remodeled by the New Founding Fathers of America, The Purge: Anarchy follows a collection of characters stranded outdoors in downtown Los Angeles on Purge Night. With 12 hours of chaos unfolding around them, the group must survive the night with the unexpected protection of Leon Barnes (Frank Grillo), a mysterious man with his own vendetta to settle on Purge Night.\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy greatly expands the scope of Purge Night from the home invasion tale of its predecessor with a spine-tingling survival story of its characters just barely keeping ahead of the carnage unfolding outdoors. The movie also adds a grey area to its political themes and satire in Leo Barnes\u2019 revenge mission, rooted in very understandable human pain and loss. The Purge franchise excels at putting its audience in the shoes of its characters on a night where chaos reigns, and The Purge: Anarchy stands as one of its strongest installments as well as the movie that arguably truly jumpstarted The Purge franchise.\n\nMidsommar (2019)\n\nAs a studio, A24 has become synonymous with art house horror movies, with Ari Aster\u2019s Midsommar being one of the studio\u2019s crowning achievements of unnerving audiences. Midsommar follows college student Dani (Florence Pugh) as she accompanies her aloof boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) on a trip to Swedish village as part of his friend\u2019s Masters Thesis. As the group partakes in the small community\u2019s midsummer festival, a series of increasingly bizarre events makes clear that this is far from a simple summer vacation for the group.\n\nConsistently awash in bright, vibrant summer daylight and gorgeous Scandinavian scenery, Midsommear is a slow burn of a group of outsiders coming to realize they\u2019ve wandered into a cult\u2019s sacrificial ritual. While Midsommar is full of unsettling deaths and disturbing imagery, the movie\u2019s real impact lies in its tale of Dani and Christian\u2019s deteriorating romance finally coming undone in the worst situation possible. The final act of Midsommar plays as the most horrifying break-up imaginable, with Florence Pugh\u2019s performance as the distraught and heartbroken Dani elevating the movie to a modern horror classic.\n\nJoker (2019)\n\nTodd Phillips\u2019 Joker creates a new origin story for The Clown Prince of Crime as Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a Gotham City clown for hire who is constantly bullied and berated by his fellow denizens of the city. After Arthur kills some subway attackers in self-defense, he inadvertently starts a popular uprising in Gotham with the city\u2019s downtrodden inspired by him. Despite controversy before its release that it would inspire mass shootings, Joker became a cultural phenomenon, as did Phoenix\u2019s performance as Fleck.\n\nIn Joker, many saw a society of haves and have-nots reflective of the real world, with Arthur Fleck\u2019s fall into homicidal villainy a cautionary tale of the dangers of society leaving its most vulnerable out in the cold. Fleck doesn\u2019t properly become Joker until relatively late in the movie, with his on camera interview with talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) a disturbing descent into madness. The failure of 2024\u2019s follow-up Joker: Folie a Deux may well be testimony to Joker being a lightning in a bottle case of unnerving social commentary.\n\nThe Lighthouse (2019)\n\nThe sophomore directorial effort of Robert Eggers, 2019\u2019s The Lighthouse sees incoming lighthouse keeper Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) partnered with decidedly eccentric former sailor Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). The largely two-man show of The Lighthouse is a suspenseful tale of isolation as Winslow is gradually taken in by Wake\u2019s bizarre ways as he simultaneously develops cabin fever in being trapped with such an off-kilter associate. When a storm causes Winslow to be trapped even longer with Wake, his sanity only continues to fall apart with visions of a mysterious mermaid bedeviling him.\n\nPattinson and Dafoe each give gripping performances as Winslow and Wake, while the movie\u2019s black-and-white cinematography adds an aura of both mystery and foreboding atmosphere to the tale of the movie\u2019s two increasingly unhinged main characters. The Lighthouse ends on a note that is as disturbing as it is ambiguous, while also pointing the way to what has become a vibrant directorial career for Robert Eggers.\n\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\n\nWhile Art the Clown had gradually built up a reputation as the scariest clown around with 2016\u2019s underground hit Terrifier, the 2022 sequel Terrifier 2 finally made him an iconic slasher movie villain. Set sometime after the first Terrifier, Terrifier 2 follows Art the Clown (David Howard Thorton) on his latest Halloween night killing spree, with the young heroine Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) and her brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) fleeing Art\u2019s pursuit. As anyone who has seen it can attest, Terrifier 2 is easily one of the bloodiest, most violent movies ever put to film, and Art\u2019s sadistic glee at butchering his victims makes it all the more disturbing.\n\nArt\u2019s exceptionally graphic kills include Terrifier 2\u2018s infamous bedroom scene, and one unlucky boyfriend on the receiving end of a particularly nasty bit of dismemberment. At 138 minutes Terrifier 2 is a little longer than it needs to be, which makes the final showdown in an abandoned amusement park a bit of a slog (the equally violent Terrifier is a comparative a walk in the park at 85 minutes), but it nonetheless set in motion what has arguably become Hollywood\u2019s reigning slasher movie franchise. Terrifier 2\u2018s success brought Art the Clown home for the holidays in 2024\u2019s Terrifier 3, with Art to return in the forthcoming Terrifier 4.\n\nSmile 2 (2024)\n\n2022\u2019s horror movie hit Smile set a new mythos in motion of a demonic entity driving one victim insane before hopping to a new one, and the 2024 sequel Smile 2 actively improves on an already strong start. In Smile 2, pop star Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) is prepping for a comeback tour following a terrible car accident and subsequent time in drug rehab, but after witnessing the death of the entity\u2019s latest victim, Skye finds herself haunted by a smiling demon causing her to lose her mind. Smile director Parker Finn returns to helm Smile 2, and delivers both a terrifying supernatural horror movie and a heartbreaking tale of a star\u2019s downward spiral.\n\nNaomi Scott gives an electrifying performance as the troubled Skye Riley, a young woman overwhelmed by the pressures of the success she spent years pursuing and undone by a series of bad coping mechanisms. Even without the entity haunting her, Skye is trapped in a bad situation of handlers trying to shove her back onstage when she clearly isn\u2019t ready to return to the spotlight. Smile 2 also ends on a shocking twist that sets up the entity\u2019s return in Smile 3 as one of truly apocalyptic proportions, all predicated on the sinister smile that is the Smile franchise\u2019s terrifying trademark."

Eventually, the analysis may help to produce a better electric vehicle pack with a precise electrode analysis method, all according to a report published by EurekAlert.\n\nWhen lithium-ion batteries cycle, ions move between two electrodes \u2014 the anode and the cathode \u2014 through a substance called electrolyte. The team is interested in finding a better alternative to commonly used carbon negative electrodes, or cathodes. Carbon is subject to troublesome dendrite formation when quickly charged, which in turn can cause a short circuit and fire, as described by the lab summary and ScienceDirect.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile rare, lithium-ion battery fires can be catastrophic.\n\nIn response, the Japanese experts investigated transition metal oxides as an alternative to carbon. The oxide-based materials have great thermal stability and other attributes that promote better fire safety. A promising type is called Wadsley-Roth phase oxides, including TiNb2O7, or TNO, all per EurekAlert.\n\n\"The network structure of TNO forms lithium-ion conduction pathways and has a significant influence on the properties of negative electrodes,\" research team lead and associate professor Naoto Kitamura said in the report.\n\nBut the material's atomic structure needed to be charted. To accomplish the task, the team analyzed three unique samples. One was pristine, one was ball-milled to reduce its particle size, and one was heat-treated, according to the lab notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA series of advanced tests, including topological analysis, revealed that ball milling followed by heat treatment produced the best results for charge-discharge performance, the report continued.\n\n\"For the first time, we could prove that the combination of intermediate-range structure and topology analyses is a promising way of developing a guideline for improving electrode properties,\" Kitamura said, per EurekAlert.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nBattery innovations are happening around the world, including tech that revives Thomas Edison-era iron-alkaline science and promising solid-state power packs. Often, the goal is to increase EV range, charge speeds, and safety while lowering costs.\n\nThat's important, because each EV that replaces a gas-burning car prevents thousands of pounds of harmful, heat-trapping exhaust annually, as noted by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurbing the fumes is a goal drivers of all vehicles can help to achieve. Efficient driving habits can stack up to more than a hundred bucks in savings a year via shorter routes and less idling time. Reducing planet-warming fume production is also a lung-friendly move, as medical experts have linked the gases to a range of health risks, including carcinogen exposure.\n\nFor now, the researchers are confident that their findings will lead to better-performing lithium-ion batteries, which would be a boon to EVs and other tech.\n\n\"TNO can be used in lithium-ion batteries for cars and can contribute to the green growth strategy for achieving carbon neutrality,\" Kitamura said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Elon Musk enjoys being at the center of the universe, and so if generative AI is going to be as transformational as Silicon Valley believes, he cannot lose. Especially not to a company he helped create. To that end, Musk continues throwing more spaghetti at the wall in his attempt to slow down OpenAI, the company he co-founded in 2015 and that Musk now competes against with his own rival startup xAI.\n\nAccording to a report in the Financial Times, lawyers for Musk have contacted attorneys-general in Delaware and California to demand that a large stake in OpenAI be sold off in an open auction process. Musk has not had a good relationship with the courts in Delaware, hence the interest in moving proceedings to California where OpenAI is headquartered.\n\nThe details are complicated, but essentially, OpenAI has been working towards transitioning from a non-profit into a for-profit entity. Under the new structure, a non-profit subsidiary would remain inside OpenAI that would hold a stake in the for-profit company and continue working on philanthropic endeavors in areas like healthcare and education. Having put initial capital into OpenAI when it was founded as a non-profit, Musk seems to be arguing it would be in the best interest of the non-profit entity to sell at least some of its stake to the highest bidder and use the capital for philanthropic purposes. It would, of course, also give him an opportunity to get involved in and have influence over OpenAI again.\n\nThis latest salvo is one of several in Musk\u2019s attempts to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a for-profit altogether. Through a series of lawsuits, Musk has made a few arguments to try and blunt OpenAI, including that he was deceived into investing in the company under the impression that it would always remain a non-profit with the purpose of developing AI safely and making it available freely for anyone to use. He has for a long time now used the term \u201cClosedAI\u201d to ridicule the company and allege that on the contrary it has kept its technology closed off to itself.\n\nAnother reason he has argued in court that OpenAI should not be allowed to convert into a for-profit is because doing so would mean it was able to grow into the giant it is today without paying any taxes for years, giving it an unfair advantage over for-profit startups like his own.\n\nMusk left OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018 over disagreements about its strategy, and seemingly out of spite, founded xAI in 2023. It is not hard to see how OpenAI\u2019s sudden rise with the launch of ChatGPT may have embittered him. The best analogy might be like discovering the nerdy girl you rejected in high school had a massive glow up years later.\n\nMusk is not the most sympathetic character, particularly given his company is competing directly with OpenAI. But OpenAI is not exactly worth defending either. After receiving tens of billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and others, launching commercial products with subscription fees, and keeping much of its technology to itself rather than going the open source route, few have truly believed that OpenAI was honoring the intention and purpose of the non-profit model. Meta, which does actually open-source its models, and several other parties including a non-profit focused on AI safety have joined in on Musk\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nIf OpenAI were forced to remain a non-profit, as Musk hopes, the company would have a hard time raising more funding needed to compete in the AI race (most investors want a clear path to realizing a return). Musk\u2019s xAI has been racing to catch up with billions of dollars raised that has been used to scale up a massive supercomputer cluster for model training, and because Musk owns X, formerly Twitter, he has been able to integrate xAI\u2019s chatbot deeply with the social network.\n\nMusk is set to be one of the most influential people in the incoming Trump administration, where he could potentially cause OpenAI headaches through investigations or simply by thwarting its influence on legislation. On top of that, OpenAI is facing other headwinds. Among them, Microsoft, its biggest backer, has been distancing itself and building up its own AI models; OpenAI continues to be embroiled in legal battles with media companies including the New York Times over allegations it has participated in massive copyright infringement through its model training; and CEO Sam Altman was personally sued this week by his own sister over allegations he sexually abused her as a child."

Musk\u2019s camp simply \u201cwant more chaos,\u201d they added.\n\nThe highly unusual effort follows lawsuits launched by Musk in the past year over the attempt by OpenAI, which was founded as a non-profit dedicated to ensuring AI benefits humanity, to restructure as a for-profit company.\n\nMusk co-founded OpenAI with Altman and nine others in 2015, and was the most significant early funder before leaving the board in 2018 after clashing with Altman.\n\nOpenAI launched a for-profit subsidiary a year later in order to raise outside capital, including more than $13 billion so far from its biggest backer, Microsoft. However, the non-profit entity, along with employees and investors, currently owns that for-profit subsidiary.\n\nOpenAI is attempting to become a public benefit corporation, a type of for-profit entity committed to bettering society. The company has suggested that the non-profit\u2019s \u201csignificant interest\u201d in the existing for-profit would take the form of shares in the PBC at a fair valuation, which it says will be determined by independent financial advisers."

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

Eventually, the analysis may help to produce a better electric vehicle pack with a precise electrode analysis method, all according to a report published by EurekAlert.\n\nWhen lithium-ion batteries cycle, ions move between two electrodes \u2014 the anode and the cathode \u2014 through a substance called electrolyte. The team is interested in finding a better alternative to commonly used carbon negative electrodes, or cathodes. Carbon is subject to troublesome dendrite formation when quickly charged, which in turn can cause a short circuit and fire, as described by the lab summary and ScienceDirect.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile rare, lithium-ion battery fires can be catastrophic.\n\nIn response, the Japanese experts investigated transition metal oxides as an alternative to carbon. The oxide-based materials have great thermal stability and other attributes that promote better fire safety. A promising type is called Wadsley-Roth phase oxides, including TiNb2O7, or TNO, all per EurekAlert.\n\n\"The network structure of TNO forms lithium-ion conduction pathways and has a significant influence on the properties of negative electrodes,\" research team lead and associate professor Naoto Kitamura said in the report.\n\nBut the material's atomic structure needed to be charted. To accomplish the task, the team analyzed three unique samples. One was pristine, one was ball-milled to reduce its particle size, and one was heat-treated, according to the lab notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA series of advanced tests, including topological analysis, revealed that ball milling followed by heat treatment produced the best results for charge-discharge performance, the report continued.\n\n\"For the first time, we could prove that the combination of intermediate-range structure and topology analyses is a promising way of developing a guideline for improving electrode properties,\" Kitamura said, per EurekAlert.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nBattery innovations are happening around the world, including tech that revives Thomas Edison-era iron-alkaline science and promising solid-state power packs. Often, the goal is to increase EV range, charge speeds, and safety while lowering costs.\n\nThat's important, because each EV that replaces a gas-burning car prevents thousands of pounds of harmful, heat-trapping exhaust annually, as noted by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurbing the fumes is a goal drivers of all vehicles can help to achieve. Efficient driving habits can stack up to more than a hundred bucks in savings a year via shorter routes and less idling time. Reducing planet-warming fume production is also a lung-friendly move, as medical experts have linked the gases to a range of health risks, including carcinogen exposure.\n\nFor now, the researchers are confident that their findings will lead to better-performing lithium-ion batteries, which would be a boon to EVs and other tech.\n\n\"TNO can be used in lithium-ion batteries for cars and can contribute to the green growth strategy for achieving carbon neutrality,\" Kitamura said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "On Dec. 4, the Indiana Pacers, the high-octane offensive team that won 47 games and made it to the Eastern Conference finals last season, scored 35 measly points in the first half against the Brooklyn Nets. They finished the game with twice as many turnovers as they did made 3s. The night before, Tyrese Haliburton, the Pacers' franchise player, had said following a loss in Toronto that they were putting an embarrassing product on the floor and needed to start matching or exceeding their opponents' energy level. They did not come close to doing that at Barclays Center.\n\nBack in Brooklyn on Monday, Indiana coach Rick Carlisle called it \"our worst game of the year.\" I can't say for sure that he is haunted by the performance, but he then cited the exact number of points in the paint that they'd scored at halftime: 12.\n\n\"We were coming in and it was a back-to-back and all of that stuff, but none of that should matter, we should still look like a professional basketball team,\" he said. \"But we didn't.\"\n\nThe Pacers were 9-14 after that loss, with an offense that ranked 21st in the NBA and a defense that ranked 25th (and 27th in the halfcourt, per Cleaning The Glass). This was a stark contrast to the fun, frenzied December of 2023; the Nets loss took place on the one-year anniversary of the Pacers' NBA Cup win against the Boston Celtics in which Haliburton punched their ticket to Las Vegas with a clutch four-point play and a triple-double.\n\n\"It wasn't a good feeling,\" Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard said. \"It wasn't necessarily a feeling of disbelief, but it was a feeling of this is going to be harder to get out of this hole.\"\n\nFive weeks later, Indiana is out of the hole. By beating a severely shorthanded Brooklyn team on Monday, it climbed above .500 for the first time since it was 1-0. After taking care of business without center Myles Turner against Chicago on Wednesday, the team has now won 10 of its last 13 games, and during that stretch, it has had the NBA's third-best offense and 12th-best defense, per CTG. The Pacers' transition attack, which was weirdly ineffective early on, has been tops in the league, and their halfcourt defense, which I'm still hesitant to describe as a strength, has ranked No. 8.\n\nGiven how thoroughly they've flipped the script, does it feel like that debacle in December was a zillion years ago?\n\n\"It feels like yesterday, shit,\" Nembhard said. \"I feel like we just turned it around. We just started getting going. I think it's been a process for us to be consistent and go back to what we were doing last year, in terms of compete level and energy and playing together. I think we're just getting that feel back, a little bit. So it's nice to see where we've come in the month maybe or so since we've been here.\"\n\nThe missing piece\n\nLately, Haliburton has much more often looked like the All-NBA playmaker who earned Steve Nash comparisons in 2023-24. His usage rate has barely changed, but after averaging 17.5 points on 55.8% true shooting in the first 25 games, he has averaged 20.1 on 63.8% true shooting in the last 13. In a win in Boston on Dec. 29, Haliburton put up an efficient 31 points, six rebounds and seven assists; on consecutive fourth-quarter possessions, he broke the game open by beating Jayson Tatum off the dribble for a layup, then finding second-year wing Ben Sheppard for a corner 3 and a transition layup.\n\nIf there is one player, though, who is most responsible for Indiana finding its footing, it might be Nembhard. The 6-foot-4 guard missed more than three weeks with left knee tendinitis in November, and during that time, the Pacers' most-used starting lineup allowed 119.1 points per 100 possessions. During this turnaround, their regular starters -- Haliburton, Nembhard, Bennedict Mathurin, Pascal Siakam and Turner -- have allowed 96.1 per 100 and had the best net rating of any lineup in the league (minimum 50 minutes).\n\nWatching the team when he was hurt, Nembhard thought he could \"bring back some competitive energy, especially on the defensive side of the floor,\" he said. \"And then I think on the offensive side, some more connecting, ball movement. Just another guy that can play within our pace and play with other good players.\"\n\nHaliburton's resurgence can't be separated from Nembhard's presence. With opponents often pressuring Haliburton and denying him the ball, having another steady hand has made an enormous difference.\n\n\"I think he just helps our offensive processes a little bit more, having him to be an initiator when defenses are hugged up on me, or we're trying to free me off the ball,\" Haliburton said. \"I can be used better as a screener. The league is moving towards everybody's lineups having more than one primary initiator, so having him in our group takes some pressure off and allows me to do some other things.\"\n\nIn Haliburton's view, the conversation about the team early in the season didn't properly account for how banged-up it was. \"We were missing two starters,\" he said, referring to Nembhard and 3-and-D wing Aaron Nesmith, who has been out since the sixth game of the season with a sprained left ankle. Both of their backup centers, Isaiah Jackson and James Wiseman, suffered season-ending Achilles injuries. \"Having four injuries like that pretty early in the year was tough for us.\"\n\nOn top of that, Sheppard strained his left oblique in mid-November, which thrust Quenton Jackson, a wing on a two-way contract, into the starting lineup. As hard as Jackson played, neither he nor anyone else on the roster could replicate Nembhard's point-of-attack defense, off-ball awareness, ball-handling, smarts and shooting.\n\n\"He's just really solid,\" Carlisle said. \"He's a playmaker on offense. He can score. Defensively, he's our best on-ball defender. He's physical. He hits people. And he brings a rock-solid consistency that we need. When you talk about a glue guy, the definition of a high-level glue guy, that's what he is.\"\n\nThe silver lining\n\nIn this year's NBA Cup, the Pacers lost all four of their group-play games, and only the Washington Wizards had a worse point differential. This was not what they envisioned, having made it to the title game the previous year, but, in a way, the Cup still served them well: After a rough loss against the Charlotte Hornets on Dec. 8, the Pacers had only two games in the next 10 days.\n\n\"We got to take a mental break,\" Nembhard said. \"I think everybody underestimates how nice it is to have a break in the league. You play every other day, you're just in constant motion, so it's nice to just sit back, relax, not have as much pressure on yourself and then feel refreshed coming back. I think with a young team, that was a big thing for us.\"\n\nTo be clear, Indiana didn't just take a bunch of days off. The schedule allowed the team to take a breath, look at what was going wrong and, crucially, have proper practices.\n\n\"We were turning the ball over a lot,\" Haliburton said. \"Offensively, our concepts, we weren't doing a great job of implementing those and doing those as a team. So I think the practice time was needed. It wasn't, like, rest. We were competing. It was like training-camp practice.\"\n\nIt is not a coincidence that this is when Indiana started to string wins together. In addition to tightening things up on offense, the Pacers have gotten way stingier defensively. As Caitlin Cooper of Basketball, She Wrote pointed out, they've done more peel switching, mixed in some zone and generally done a much better job when it comes to helping defense. This defensive improvement has been the more surprising storyline, but it's difficult to disentangle one end from the other. It has been a virtuous cycle: Stops lead to easier opportunities on offense, which lead to fewer turnovers, which lead to more stops.\n\nDuring this run, the Pacers have a turnover rate of 11.7%, the lowest mark in the NBA. They have also been about average in terms of allowing shots at the rim, after allowing more than any team last season and starting this season similarly. Nembhard's work at the point of attack is a big part of that, but it wouldn't mean as much if the team's defense hadn't become more stable.\n\n\"I think it's taken a full team effort,\" Nembhard said. \"Everybody coming together, buying into their role, playing their role the harder and being consistent every night.\"\n\nThe challenge\n\nTurnovers remain a point of emphasis in practice. \"It's basic stuff, I'm getting a lot of eye-rolling on some of it from them,\" Carlisle said. \"But we're seeing some results.\"\n\nDating back to the preseason, Carlisle has continually referenced the league's increasing physicality. The Pacers want to run, and they want ball and player movement in the halfcourt, but they can't allow defenders grabbing and holding them to throw them off their game. \"Two hands, two eyes,\" Carlisle said. \"Two hands on the ball, two eyes on whoever you're throwing it to. And that's the starting point.\" The challenge is to play fast, but not loose.\n\n\"Possession, this year in the NBA is, for me, the most important aspect of the game,\" Carlisle said.\n\nDuring last season's conference finals run, most notably in the second round against the New York Knicks, Indiana tried to wear down opponents by pushing the pace, creating confusion on offense and applying full-court pressure on the other end. \"And what's every team doing more this year?\" Haliburton said. \"Picking up 94 feet and ghost-screening and getting up and down more than everybody has. And that's league-wide.\" Ironically, the Pacers struggled to adapt to some of the tactics they'd used to annoy other teams, especially the full-court pressure.\n\nThe key, Haliburton said, is to \"attack pressure with pressure.\" That means getting downhill, forcing the defense to rotate and making the right reads. It does not mean pounding the ball and dribbling into traffic. In this respect, Mathurin's recent play has been encouraging. The 22-year-old wing is a gifted scorer, and, after lots of film sessions with Carlisle, he's making better, quicker decisions.\n\n\"We know he can get his shot off at any time,\" Haliburton said. But if \"you run one ball screen and shoot it, it's not always a great shot. We know if we get the ball side to side, we'll always get a good look. He's doing a great job of committing to that, and it's working out for us.\"\n\nAfter Mathurin scored 20 points on 8-for-14 shooting in the Brooklyn win, Carlisle praised him for his \"timely buckets,\" but also for playing \"a winning brand of basketball.\" Mathurin simply has to \"play a simple game,\" he said: Run, take open shots, play hard-nosed defense.\n\nCarlisle credited him for putting \"three solid games\" together. The next step, though, for Mathurin and the team, is to keep this up. If he returns to a sixth-man role when Nesmith is healthy, will his shot selection change? If the Pacers lose some momentum when they play the Golden State Warriors on Friday and the league-best Cleveland Cavaliers (twice) after that, will they recapture it?\n\n\"We'll take this, finally get over that .500 hump,\" Haliburton said. \"But we want to stay there.\""

            "article_content": "If you\u2019re a procurement specialist looking for software to run a new car\u2019s park assist, voice commands, or chassis controls, there\u2019s now an app store for that. SDVerse, a vehicle software marketplace for automakers and suppliers, launched this past September and is already changing how the code in cars is sold and bought.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a procurement specialist, you might be wondering, \u201cSo what?\u201d It likely won\u2019t be obvious to car buyers, but success for SDVerse could eventually lead to vehicles with better and more sophisticated software than today\u2019s status quo. By helping automakers and suppliers find the right software faster, SDVerse aims to shorten the time it takes to get a new model on the road. That should help automakers reduce their development costs while also shrinking the gulf between the tech in consumer electronics and what\u2019s in a brand-new car.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of software that gets sourced in a not very efficient manner,\u201d SDVerse CEO Prashant Gulati told MotorTrend at CES 2025. \u201cWe estimate that $100 billion of software was purchased in the last three years and the annual spending is going to double in the next three years. But consumers are not going to pay double what they\u2019re paying for cars today. Where is that money going to come from? That\u2019s the work we\u2019re trying to help the industry with.\u201d\n\nPurchasing managers have traditionally relied on trade conferences, direct outreach to suppliers, and Google searches to find the software they need, and the procurement process typically starts with a request for quotes that can take up to six months just to determine what\u2019s available that meets the buyer\u2019s criteria. Even with that drawn out process, automakers sometimes don\u2019t end up with the best software for their needs. Gulati says he\u2019s heard from GM that the automaker has already used the platform to connect with a supplier that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been on its radar.\n\nGM is one of three founding members, along with suppliers Magna and Wipro, that provided the financial backing to launch SDVerse. Sixteen companies are currently signed up to sell and/or buy on the platform, including Renault Group, FEV, Valeo, Cummins, Forvia, TTTech Auto, NXP, and Bosch Engineering.\n\nLess than four months after launching, the marketplace has grown from an initial 160 software products to 200 across four categories: onboard (software that runs inside the vehicle), offboard (cloud- and mobile-based software), tools (software used to develop other software) and services (hiring another company to develop software). SDVerse simplifies the discovery and matchmaking processes by collecting information on up to 200 attributes for each product and presenting it in a way that allows easy comparison. The company is also developing an AI-powered chatbot to help users conduct research. Buyers can use the marketplace to message sellers or put out requests for information, but pricing and final purchasing agreements are handled outside of the SDVerse platform.\n\nGulati says SDVerse will be successful if it empowers buyers to find the best software and helps sellers make deals faster. That may not sound like a big deal to the average MotorTrend reader, but by speeding up the corporate-industrial machine that makes the machines we love, SDVerse might just modernize the auto industry and the cars it builds."

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

Image Credit: Komsan Loonprom/Shutterstock.com\n\nMany cancer trial results don\u2019t generalize well to real-world patients. A research team explored this issue with TrialTranslator, a machine-learning framework that systematically tests cancer RCT findings for generalizability. Findings published in Nature Medicine.\n\nPoor generalizability of RCT results\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating cancer therapies. However, their findings often fail to translate to real-world settings, leaving patients, physicians, and drug regulators concerned about the limited generalizability of these results.\n\nIn oncology, real-world survival times and treatment benefits are often significantly lower than those reported in RCTs, with median overall survival (mOS) sometimes reduced by as much as six months. Newer anti-cancer agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, also underperform when applied to the diverse patient populations seen outside clinical trials.\n\nReasons for the difference\n\nA key reason for this gap is the restrictive eligibility criteria often used in RCTs, which create study populations that do not reflect the diversity of real-world patients. Trial participants are often younger, healthier, and less likely to have comorbidities.\n\nUnofficial biases, such as preferential selection based on race or socioeconomic status, may also influence recruitment. These limitations fail to account for the heterogeneity of real-world patients, whose outcomes can vary widely even with identical treatment protocols.\n\nThe current study sought to address this issue by improving the prediction of real-world outcomes for cancer treatments evaluated in phase 3 RCTs. To do this, researchers developed TrialTranslator, a machine-learning (ML) framework designed to assess the generalizability of RCT results systematically.\n\nBy leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) and advanced ML algorithms, the framework identifies patterns and phenotypes that may influence treatment outcomes, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of survival benefits across diverse patient groups.\n\nAbout the study\n\nUsing a comprehensive nationwide EHR database from Flatiron Health, researchers applied TrialTranslator to evaluate 11 landmark RCTs. These trials covered four of the most common advanced solid cancers\u2014metastatic breast cancer (mBC), metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC).\n\nEach RCT was emulated by identifying real-world patients with matching cancer types, biomarker profiles, and treatment regimens.\n\nPatients were stratified into three prognostic phenotypes (low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk) based on their mortality risk scores derived from ML models. The framework then assessed survival outcomes, including mOS and restricted mean survival time (RMST), to compare treatment effects across these phenotypes with the results reported in the original RCTs.\n\nKey Findings: A Risk-Dependent Gap in Outcomes\n\nThe study revealed a striking disparity between RCT findings and real-world outcomes:\n\nLow- and Medium-Risk Patients: These phenotypes demonstrated survival times and treatment benefits that closely aligned with the RCT results. For instance, low-risk patients often experienced survival benefits similar to those reported in clinical trials, with only a minor reduction in mOS (approximately two months).\n\nHigh-Risk Patients: In contrast, high-risk phenotypes showed significantly worse outcomes. Survival benefits were markedly reduced\u201462% lower than RCT estimates\u2014and often fell outside the 95% confidence intervals reported in the original trials. Seven of the eleven emulated trials failed to show a clinically meaningful survival improvement (greater than three months) for high-risk patients.\n\nOverall, emulated trials consistently estimated survival outcomes that were, on average, 35% lower than those reported in the RCTs. This disparity highlights the challenges of translating trial findings to more heterogeneous real-world populations.\n\nRobust Validation of Results\n\nThe robustness of these findings was confirmed through extensive validation. Subgroup analyses, semi-synthetic data simulations, and alternative eligibility criteria demonstrated consistent results, reinforcing the reliability of TrialTranslator. Sensitivity analyses also showed that stricter eligibility criteria had little impact on the observed disparities, suggesting that patient prognosis, rather than inclusion criteria, plays a more critical role in determining treatment outcomes.\n\nImplications for Oncology\n\nThese findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift in clinical trial design and interpretation. Current RCTs often overlook the prognostic heterogeneity of real-world patients, which contributes to their limited generalizability. High-risk patients, in particular, are underserved by existing trials, as their outcomes deviate most significantly from RCT results.\n\nTools like TrialTranslator offer a promising solution. By integrating EHR-derived data with ML-based phenotyping, they can provide personalized predictions of treatment benefits at the individual patient level. This enables more informed clinical decision-making, helping patients and clinicians set realistic expectations for treatment outcomes.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, these tools could revolutionize trial design by prioritizing patient prognosis over traditional eligibility criteria. By stratifying patients based on risk phenotypes, future trials could better represent the full spectrum of cancer patients and provide more accurate estimates of treatment efficacy.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u2018\u2019This study highlights the substantial role that prognostic heterogeneity plays in the limited generalizability of RCT results,\u201d the authors conclude. While low- and medium-risk patients may benefit as expected from cancer therapies, high-risk patients often experience diminished survival gains.\n\nML-based frameworks like TrialTranslator could help bridge this gap, enabling more inclusive trials and better real-world outcomes. With tools like this, oncology can move closer to truly personalized treatment approaches that account for the diverse needs of real-world patients."

The major indexes are poised to post losses for the week amid the uncertainty about where rates are headed.\n\nThis morning's nonfarm payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that U.S. employers added 256,000 jobs last month, well above the 155,000 that economists had estimated. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, below than 4.2% rate that was expected.\n\nThe jobs report provided the latest evidence of the continued strength of the U.S. labor market and the broader economy. While the economic resilience is good news, it also sparks worries that the Fed won't be in a position to cut rates again as inflationary pressures persist. The central bank has trimmed its benchmark rate in each of its last three policy meetings\u2014the first cuts in four years\u2014but has warned that the pace of easing will likely slow this year.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is correlated with rate expectations, was at 4.74% recently, up from 4.68% yesterday, The yield jumped as high as 4.79% after the data, its highest level since late 2023.\n\nShares of mega-cap technology companies were mostly lower this morning, led by a 3% decline for AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA) and Brodcom (AVGO) also tumbled, while Meta Platforms (META) added about 1%.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) and AppLovin (APP), two of the biggest gainers in the U.S. market in 2024, continued their early-year slump, both falling nearly 4%.\n\nShares of property insurers were down as estimates of damage related to the Los Angeles wildfires continue to rise. The Travelers Companies (TRV) was down 3.5%, leading decliners in the Dow, while Allstate (ALL) and Chubb Limited (CB) fell 5% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEG) jumped 25% following news that it will acquire Calpine for $26 billion. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) were up 10% and 25%, respectively, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $93,900, up from an overnight low of $91,600 but well below the highs for the week on Monday of around $103,000.\n\nGold futures were up more than 1% at $2,730 an ounce, trading at their highest level in a month, while crude oil futures rose more than 3%."

Another company is Razer, which has only gone so far as creating Android handhelds like the Razer Edge, or controllers for phones like the Razer Kishi.\n\nBut even if Alienware isn't alone, it's an especially fascinating case considering the company showcased a handheld gaming prototype all the way back in 2020, making it five years now since we've seen the Alienware UFO.\n\nCredit: Future\n\nDuring CES 2020, we were blown away by Alienware's Concept UFO, as the device promised to let gamers play PC games from the comfort of a handheld device. To be clear, this was two years prior even the Steam Deck was announced back in January 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Turchin, who's currently Dell Director of Product Development, but at the time of the Alienware Concept UFO's unveiling was Dell Director of Engineering, claimed \"We actually view [the UFO] as the first of its kind.\" He continues \u201cWhen we look at the balance that we've achieved between performance and portability it does allow [us] to have a product that we view can be potentially viable in the market looking forward.\"\n\nTurchin was correct, as he predicted the explosive growth in popularity that handheld gaming PCs would see in the years to come.\n\nAt the time of the Alienware UFO Concept, Dell Consumer Product Reviews Manager, Raymond Watkins, claimed \"We want to take it further, and how it's received at CES I think will help shape that conversation.\" He later said \"If we got a thumbs up today I don't think it'd be eighteen months for us to get it on the shelves.\" Watkins is now Senior Manager of Marketing at AMD.\n\nOf course, the Alienware UFO never got off the ground. Eighteen months went by without any updates on its existence, and three and a half years after CES 2020, the Asus ROG Ally launched in June 2023.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what about now? Alienware just unveiled all of its CES 2025 announcements, and the Alienware UFO was nowhere to be seen. It's been five years now, but Alienware still hasn't brought the UFO back. So what gives?\n\nCredit: Future\n\nJackie Thomas at IGN asked General Manager of Alienware, Matt McGowan, why the company has no handheld. McGowan claims that \"We're continuing to look at that category,\" but he claims \"there are deficiencies,\" specifically highlighting battery life and the want for better graphics. He claims \"When that inflection point comes, we want to be there.\"\n\nIt seems as if the UFO wasn't good enough to match the company's standards, and even now, the technology isn't at a strong enough point to satisfy Alienware. Hopefully that will change in the next few years, but at the very least, lots of exciting developments are happening from companies like Asus, Lenovo, Acer, and more.\n\nAlienware has a chance to monitor the market, learn from the mistakes of its competitors, and then swoop in with the ultimate gaming handheld when the time is right. Until then, be sure to check out more of our CES 2025 coverage to get the latest on all things tech."

Huang had said that such a deployment should take four years complete. The cluster is in a data center outside of Memphis, Tennessee, and will be used for all things GenAI.\n\nHeat rumors start up again, just in time for earnings\n\nFor the second time, reports of heat problems with Nvidia\u2019s newest processors came out right before the release of earnings. In this case, the report stated that due to heat from the Blackwell chips, servers needed to be redesigned to accommodate the heat. This was dismissed by Nvidia on its earnings call \u2013 and at the same time, Nvidia reported revenue gains of 17% compared to the prior quarter and 94% compared to the prior year.\n\nAI factory designs\n\nNvidia released reference designs for what it calls AI factories, or data centers dedicated to AI processing. The company had been talking about AI factories for some time, but this was finally a blueprint telling people how to build one.\n\nEdge computing platform for AI processing\n\nNvidia launched a new platform called EGX Platform designed to bring real-time artificial intelligence to edge networks. The idea is to put AI computing closer to where sensors collect data before it is sent to larger data centers. This serves as a buffer to whittle down the data sent to data centers so only relevant data is sent down the wire for processing. This can be up to 90% or more of data collected is discarded.\n\nVerizon, Nvidia team up for enterprise AI networking\n\nNvidia announced a partnership with Verizon to build AI services for enterprises that run workloads over Verizon\u2019s 5G private network. Dubbed 5G Private Network with Enterprise AI, it will run a range of AI applications and workloads over Verizon\u2019s private 5G network with Mobile Edge Compute (MEC), a colocated infrastructure that is a part of Verizon\u2019s public wireless network."

Its rule began when the Emperor Constantine split the Roman Empire into a western and eastern half.\n\nThe eastern half remained the dominant power in ancient Europe throughout the rest of late antiquity and even during parts of the middle ages, eventually coming to be known as the Byzantine Empire.\n\nIts capital, Constantinople, was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, thus marking the end of the Empire's more than 1,000-year reign.\n\nWhile the recently excavated settlement was still active during the Byzantine period, it expanded significantly, the researchers concluded.\n\nThis growth included the construction of the monastery and the winepress.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered a 'very sophisticated' winepress, which made wine that was sent throughout the country and to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea\n\nLike the monastery, the winepress also features mosaic flooring in the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat, made of blue and white stones\n\nThe researchers also uncovered numerous artifacts from the site, including 'good quality toys that show status'\n\nLike the monastery, the winepress also features mosaic flooring in the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat, made of blue and white stones.\n\nThe researchers described this winepress as 'very sophisticated,' adding that its construction and development likely involved 'significant financial resources, time and a range of professional work and effort.'\n\nIt produced wine that was sent both throughout the country and to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea, they said.\n\nThe dig also uncovered ample evidence of local pottery production, such as detritus left behind by a ceramic factory, garbage pits, discarded vessels that were misshaped during production, and even a number of vessels that are 'unique to this site.'\n\n'The discovery of the site highlights the historical richness of Kiryat Gat and its surroundings, shedding light on the centrality of the region in antiquity,' said Svetlana Talis, Director of the Southern Region at the Israel Antiquities Authority."

Eventually, the analysis may help to produce a better electric vehicle pack with a precise electrode analysis method, all according to a report published by EurekAlert.\n\nWhen lithium-ion batteries cycle, ions move between two electrodes \u2014 the anode and the cathode \u2014 through a substance called electrolyte. The team is interested in finding a better alternative to commonly used carbon negative electrodes, or cathodes. Carbon is subject to troublesome dendrite formation when quickly charged, which in turn can cause a short circuit and fire, as described by the lab summary and ScienceDirect.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile rare, lithium-ion battery fires can be catastrophic.\n\nIn response, the Japanese experts investigated transition metal oxides as an alternative to carbon. The oxide-based materials have great thermal stability and other attributes that promote better fire safety. A promising type is called Wadsley-Roth phase oxides, including TiNb2O7, or TNO, all per EurekAlert.\n\n\"The network structure of TNO forms lithium-ion conduction pathways and has a significant influence on the properties of negative electrodes,\" research team lead and associate professor Naoto Kitamura said in the report.\n\nBut the material's atomic structure needed to be charted. To accomplish the task, the team analyzed three unique samples. One was pristine, one was ball-milled to reduce its particle size, and one was heat-treated, according to the lab notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA series of advanced tests, including topological analysis, revealed that ball milling followed by heat treatment produced the best results for charge-discharge performance, the report continued.\n\n\"For the first time, we could prove that the combination of intermediate-range structure and topology analyses is a promising way of developing a guideline for improving electrode properties,\" Kitamura said, per EurekAlert.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nBattery innovations are happening around the world, including tech that revives Thomas Edison-era iron-alkaline science and promising solid-state power packs. Often, the goal is to increase EV range, charge speeds, and safety while lowering costs.\n\nThat's important, because each EV that replaces a gas-burning car prevents thousands of pounds of harmful, heat-trapping exhaust annually, as noted by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurbing the fumes is a goal drivers of all vehicles can help to achieve. Efficient driving habits can stack up to more than a hundred bucks in savings a year via shorter routes and less idling time. Reducing planet-warming fume production is also a lung-friendly move, as medical experts have linked the gases to a range of health risks, including carcinogen exposure.\n\nFor now, the researchers are confident that their findings will lead to better-performing lithium-ion batteries, which would be a boon to EVs and other tech.\n\n\"TNO can be used in lithium-ion batteries for cars and can contribute to the green growth strategy for achieving carbon neutrality,\" Kitamura said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "The renowned physicist Richard Feynman is reputed to have once said that \u201cphysics is to math what sex is to masturbation\u201d. Exactly what comparison he was making, he didn\u2019t clarify \u2013 but if the orgasm gap is anything to go by, he presumably meant that math is often more fun, more effective, and better at getting the desired result in the face of adverse real-world conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor example: physics traditionally tells us that all particles can be classified into one of two types, either bosons or fermions, depending on their properties and behavior. But math says that\u2019s not the whole story \u2013 at least, according to a new study.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe determined that new types of particles we never knew of before are possible,\u201d said Kaden Hazzard, associate professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University and co-author of the new paper, in a statement on the findings.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not the first time the existence of such \u201cparastatistical particles\u201d, or \u201cparaparticles\u201d as they\u2019re known for short, has been suggested. Indeed, \u201cparastatistics, and their apparent absence in nature, has been discussed since the dawn of quantum mechanics,\u201d notes the paper.\n\n\u201cThe first concrete theory of parastatistics was proposed and investigated by Green in 1953,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThis theory was subsequently studied in detail and also more generally and rigorously within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, though, the idea turned out to be something of a lame duck. It wasn\u2019t that the paraparticles didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t exist \u2013 that was fine \u2013 rather, the problem was that it didn\u2019t matter whether they did or not.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThese works did not rule out the existence of paraparticles in nature,\u201d explains the paper, \u201cbut led to the conclusion that, under certain assumptions, any theory of paraparticles [\u2026] is physically indistinguishable from theories of ordinary fermions and bosons. This seemingly obviated the need to consider paraparticle theories, as they give exactly the same physical predictions as theories of ordinary particles.\u201d\n\nSo much for the paraparticles idea \u2013 or so it seemed. But when Hazzard and then-grad student Zhiyuan Wang considered the problem through a mathematical lens, they not only found that nontrivial paraparticles could exist, but they also figured out where they might turn up in nature \u2013 such as within magnetic flux.\n\n\u201cParticles aren\u2019t just these fundamental things,\u201d said Hazzard. \u201cThey\u2019re also important in describing materials.\u201d\n\nAs you might expect, these paraparticles would be weird \u2013 even considering the general oddness of quantum physics. \u201cTheir exchange statistics can be physically observed and are notably distinct from fermions and bosons,\u201d notes the paper.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLike the equally baffling new quasiparticles, the discovery of which was also announced this week, the result \u201cdemonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems,\u201d the authors write, \u201cand \u2013 more speculatively \u2013 the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particle.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s only a first step. Where this theory leads, or even possible routes to get there, are still to be determined \u2013 as of yet, we don\u2019t even know the questions, let alone the answers.\n\n\u201cThis is cross-disciplinary research that involves several areas of theoretical physics and mathematics,\u201d said Wang, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany. But \u201cto realize paraparticles in experiments, we need more realistic theoretical proposals,\u201d he added.\n\nWherever the theory takes them, though, the journey should be worth watching.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where it will go,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cBut I know it will be exciting to find out.\u201d\n\nThe paper is published in the journal Nature."

As we strive to reimagine healthcare delivery, we must find ways to sustain, and not undercut, the tremendous momentum of American biomedical science.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthcare, as experienced in America today, is miserable for just about everyone. It\u2019s awful for patients who must navigate a fiendishly Byzantine system to receive even the most basic care, and to figure out whether costly treatments will be covered by insurance. It\u2019s awful for loved ones who are increasingly pressed into service to advocate for patients\u2014such as when they are left languishing for days in the hall outside emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed to become available.\n\nIt\u2019s awful as well for exasperated and overburdened health care professionals. Doctors like those I trained with face escalating administrative burdens, including constant negotiation with insurance companies; they\u2019re experiencing unprecedented professional dissatisfaction and career burnout. Competing, ever-expanding armies of administrators\u2014and more recently, AI tools\u2014from provider and insurer organizations engage in fierce daily battles over reimbursement. These relentless bureaucratic skirmishes sap time, money, and empathy from everyone involved.\n\nShare\n\nYET WE ARE ALSO LIVING THROUGH a time of remarkable progress in biomedical science, \u201ca Golden Age for medicine\u201d as columnist David Wallace-Wells has called it. Genetics and other tools have provided critical insights into new disease targets to attack. We have added an impressive array of approaches to our therapeutic armamentarium, including traditional small molecules, biologics, nucleic acid therapeutics, cell and gene therapies, and imaginative combinations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider the remarkable results: We have improved treatments for many cancers, and developed therapies that now afford most children born with cystic fibrosis a good chance to live a nearly-normal life. Hepatitis C infections, which can lead to liver failure as well as liver cancer, can now be cured. An injectable medicine, lenacapavir, was shown to protect recipients from HIV infection for six months with 100 percent efficacy\u2014an accomplishment recognized by Science magazine as the 2024 Breakthrough of the Year. And a powerful new class of medications, the GLP-1 receptor agonists (think Ozempic and Wegovy), has proved phenomenally effective in staunching appetite, helping patients reduce excess weight and meaningfully improve their health.\n\nSupport our independent political and cultural journalism by signing up for a free or paid Bulwark subscription.\n\nBetter measurement technologies, including wearable digital devices, enable researchers to understand both disease and treatments with unprecedented precision. Over coffee in Cambridge, Massachusetts, an enthusiastic physician-scientist recently explained to me how a lightweight headset produced by his startup enables clinicians to monitor brainwaves and assess sleep disorders, attracting the interest of multiple pharmaceutical companies.\n\nLife science is also poised to benefit from the revolution in artificial intelligence; two recipients of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry developed an AI-enabled tool, AlphaFold, to predict protein structures. AI will also play a critically important role in managing drug development\u2019s exploding complexity\u2014a happy consequence of biology\u2019s remarkable progress.\n\nAT THIS TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT in life science, it seems astonishing some would spend our time and treasure looking backwards and relitigating some of medicine\u2019s most impactful and well-established successes, like the vaccinations that eliminated smallpox and saved millions of children from the scourge of dreadful diseases like polio and other preventable conditions. This regressive thinking is at once distracting and terribly misguided.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, we should look forward, and support our nation\u2019s powerful life-science engine, including both the foundational, enabling science so often funded by the National Institutes of Health as well as our vibrant biotech ecosystem that translates promising early-stage science into rigorously validated medicines.\n\nAs we contemplate how to improve access to medicines\u2014a vitally important consideration\u2014let us remember that no one can access therapies that haven\u2019t yet been discovered. Effective treatments are still urgently required for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pancreatic cancer, brain tumors, and a vast array of rare, devastating conditions that collectively affect millions.\n\nIt is essential that we aggressively challenge our conspicuously dysfunctional model of healthcare delivery, since great biomedical science means very little if it doesn\u2019t translate to better care and improved health. But amid our zeal to fix what\u2019s so obviously broken, we must do our best to preserve, refine, and build upon what\u2019s already working.\n\nShare"
