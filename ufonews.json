            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

For example, the company recently gave Gemini the ability to summarize Drive folders to provide a quick overview. We\u2019ve also recently discovered that the company is working on an AI-powered \u201cCall To-do List\u201d function. In its latest initiative, it looks like we could start seeing AI search suggestions in the Google app on iOS.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhile exploring the Google app on iOS, we noticed something interesting. Sitting neatly in the search box was a new pencil icon. Tapping on this icon opens up a new page with a text box and a few suggestions, as seen in the screenshots below.\n\nWhen you begin typing in this text box, you\u2019ll see the Gemini icon below along with text that reads \u201cGenerate AI suggestions.\u201d Once enough words are in the field, it automatically starts generating suggestions based on your query. You can then select these suggestions to narrow down your search, working like filters.\n\nYou can see an example in the video above where we asked for help buying a gift. The suggestions that were generated provided options for \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201cgift occasion,\u201d and \u201crelationship to recipient.\u201d So you could select \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201cunder $50,\u201d and \u201cbirthday\u201d to get search results for an affordable birthday gift for your friend.\n\nIt appears this feature is still in beta testing, however, as it doesn\u2019t work properly quite yet. In the video below, you can see the feature struggling to work.\n\nThis feature could possibly save users some time, as they would not have to type out these commonly used keywords to get the results they are looking for.

            "article_content": "Do you miss your therapist the second your session ends? Do you wish you could talk longer or reach out during the week to share your every thought and feeling? Then you might appreciate this interactive journaling app that uses a therapist-backed, AI-powered chat to keep the convo going.\n\nInstead of holding everything in until your next sesh, you can simply open the Rosebud app whenever you need to vent, work through anxiety, set goals, or process tough feelings. I\u2019ve been using it for the past two weeks and it never fails to help me feel a little more centered.\n\nWith hundreds of five-star reviews in the app store, Rosebud is quickly becoming a go-to for many people who want to supplement their in-person therapy \u2014 or for those who want to treat themselves to an easy, breezy, but entirely helpful journaling experience. As you type in entries and answer daily prompts, the app learns more about your thought patterns and goals, and then it responds to you with personalized Qs that help you calm down, recenter, or get to know yourself better.\n\nIt\u2019s so much easier than journaling with a notebook and pen, and I\u2019ve also found it to be extremely validating when I\u2019m going through it and need somewhere to vent ASAP. Here\u2019s what it was like to use the Rosebud journal and what to know about the app.\n\nFast Facts\n\nPrice: Free to download, Rosebud Premium for $4.99/month\n\nFree to download, Rosebud Premium for $4.99/month Best for: Journaling, working through problems, venting\n\nJournaling, working through problems, venting My rating: 4/5\n\n4/5 What I like: Easy to use app, helpful chat, feels nice to vent\n\nEasy to use app, helpful chat, feels nice to vent What I don't like: Limits what you can do with the free version\n\nWhat To Know About Rosebud\n\nRosebud\n\nRosebud is an AI-powered self-care app that uses a therapist-designed journal and habit tracker to help you dig deeper into your thoughts and feelings. It offers the option to type or voice journal to fill in your diary entries. As you chat, the app also learns more about you and your needs \u2014 similar to your most beloved counselor.\n\nAs you log journal entries, answer prompts, set goals, and reflect on your day, Rosebud gives you feedback and insight so you can learn more about your go-to beliefs and thought patterns \u2014 perfect for dissecting why you always fall into the same mental traps. It\u2019s useful for navigating anxiety and stress, grief, anger, overthinking, overwhelm, and depression, or for clarity on a big decision.\n\nThe app has five tabs across the bottom. The Today tab is where you reflect, set intentions, and check off daily goals as you complete them. The Explore tab offers guided journals, personalized prompts, and workbooks from real therapists, and the plus sign in the middle lets you quickly create a blank journal entry to write down whatever your heart desires.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Insights tab where you\u2019ll find AI-generated personal reports, your analyzed journal entries, and a graph with your moods and weekly \u201cwins,\u201d aka themes you unpacked or habits uncovered. And the History section lets you peek at past entries so you can appreciate how far you\u2019ve come. The app is free, but the premium version offers unlimited personalized prompts, prompt bookmarking, voice journaling, unlimited entry history, and more.\n\nTrying It Out\n\nRosebud\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of self-care or #WellnessTok, than you likely already know about the many benefits of journaling. Jotting your thoughts is a good way to reduce stress, increase gratitude, and work through your problems, especially when you\u2019re stressed, but I love that this app adds a dash of therapy into the mix, too.\n\nI found myself waxing poetic within five minutes of downloading Rosebud. I went straight to the morning reflection section where I quickly analyzed how I felt and what I hoped to get out of my day. It\u2019s been so easy to start a fresh journal entry whenever I\u2019m having a moment of stress and anxiety, too. The AI chat does a good job of breaking down what I\u2019m feeling and explaining it back to me.\n\nRosebud\n\nAnother nice perk is the \u201cToday\u2019s goals\u201d section where you can customize what you hope to do with your day. I\u2019ve added stretching, reading, and going for more walks \u2014 and it feels good to pop back into the app and check them off as I go.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to wind down with the Evening Reflection section too. The AI prompts you to answer questions like \u201cWhat was the highlight of your day?\u201d or \u201cWhat was stressful about your day?\u201d Similar to how a therapist would ask you check in with yourself, Rosebud encourages you to pause and reflect \u2014 and it\u2019s nice to see what I\u2019ve learned about myself in the weekly Insights reports that lay it all out.\n\nRosebud\n\nIt isn\u2019t always easy to figure out what to write, which is why I love the various journal prompts and workbook-style sections in the Explore tab. There are things like gratitude journals, dream journals, relationship check-ins, and journals made by therapists with themes like \u201cacceptance and commitment,\u201d \u201cnervous system rebalancing,\u201d and \u201cknowing your needs.\u201d\n\nAs an anxious girly, I immediately clicked on the nervous system rebalancing journal and was prompted to start off with four deep breaths. Once I was chill, the chat guided me through questions about what puts me on edge, how stress makes me feel, the triggers that set me off, and how I tend to relax and reset.\n\nRosebud\n\nIt was all very eye-opening. Turns out I need a slow, mellow morning routine or I\u2019ll be a total wreck for the rest of the day. I also can\u2019t skip daily walks \u2014 not even when it\u2019s rainy or cold \u2014 or else I kind of crumble. And it appears that I really value (and talk a lot about) accomplishing my to-do list. (Very Virgo rising of me.)\n\nAs I typed, the app offered the option to either finish my journal or \u201cgo deeper,\u201d which meant it kept asking questions and encouraging me to reflect on what I had just said. This is where I really started to notice that the AI was learning my patterns and encouraging me to think further \u2014 something I wouldn\u2019t have gotten out of a regular paper-and-pen journal.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nWhile there\u2019s no true replacement for meeting with a therapist, I like that the Rosebud AI was \u201ctrained\u201d by therapists, so it doesn\u2019t just feel like random, cold info from the internet. The chat on the app seems like a conversation you\u2019d have with a real person, which makes it feel warmer and more helpful. I\u2019d say this is a great tool for venting, noticing thought patterns, and setting goals \u2014 or if you just really miss chatting with your therapist between sessions."

            "article_content": "Nvidia has released a new $249 version of its Jetson computer meant for running artificial applications locally. The palm-sized Orin Nano is said to double the speed and efficiency of its predecessor at half the price, and it can process roughly 70% more computational tasks, according to Nvidia.\n\nThe Orin Nano is ideal for hobbyists looking to train their own artificial intelligence applications, or for developers of robots and other industrial tools to run sophisticated applications without connecting to the cloud.\n\nIn a brief video on YouTube announcing the product, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stands in his kitchen as he pulls a tray out of his oven to reveal the small, palm-sized computer. Huang goes on to say the computer can process almost \u201cseventy trillion\u201d operations per second and draws just 25 watts of power.\n\n\u201cA long time ago, we created a brand new type of processor, it was a robotics processor,\u201d Huang says. \u201cNobody understood what we were building at the time, and we imagined that someday these deep learning models would evolve and we would have robots for everything.\u201d The Jetson computers were intended to power robots, but today can also run large language models like Meta\u2019s Llama.\n\nSam Altman\u2019s startup World (formerly Worldcoin), which aims to authenticate human identity with iris scans, uses a Jetpack module inside its Orb scanning device. In a blog post back in October, World said, \u201cIn its newest iteration, the Orb is equipped with the most advanced NVIDIA Jetson module with nearly 5x the AI performance over the previous version to enable even faster, more seamless proof of human verifications.\u201d\n\nIn essence, the Orin Nano is a portable brain that can be plugged into other hardware to power its AI functionality. Cloud hyperscalers\u2014a term for companies building massive data centers for AI\u2014 like Amazon and Google charge for access to servers and AI models, and those costs can add up. Certain applications might need guaranteed uptime and minimal latency, such as warehouse robots. Connecting to a remote cloud hosting provider is not ideal. That being said, a computer like the Orin Nano will only be capable of running more lightweight AI applications\u2014it will not replace Nvidia\u2019s high-end GPUs that cost tens of thousands of dollars and are capable of training and inferring from large-scale AI models.\n\nStill, in a world where running AI is becoming increasingly cheap and accessible, startups are quickly going to learn the value of having real intellectual property. Shoving an AI model into a smart home camera is no longer going to be good enough when anyone can easily do it."

Visitors to this 19th-century Gothic mansion in Neath Port Talbot have long shared eerie tales of spectral figures, unexplained laughter, and objects that seem to move of their own accord.\n\nFrom the vengeful ghost of a murdered gamekeeper to the echoes of Victorian children\u2019s laughter, Margam Castle has earned its reputation as one of the most haunted places in Britain.\n\nREAD MORE: Fire service issues update after massive blaze at industrial site in Pontardawe\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: The lesser-known secluded Welsh waterfall that\u2019s just as stunning as its famous rivals\n\nBut the castle\u2019s haunting is just one layer of its story. As Dave explains, \u201cWe\u2019re on a historic site here at Margam, one that has been permanently occupied for at least 4,000 years.\u201d\n\nFrom the Bronze Age through to Roman times, and later the founding of the Cistercian Abbey in the 12th century, this site has seen centuries of human life\u2014and, perhaps, lingering spirits.\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park, a gorgeous 1,000-acre South Wales estate in the Neath Port Talbot region, also known as the 'Dramatic heart of Wales'.\n\nThe castle, built between 1830 and 1840 by architect Thomas Hopper for Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot, is a striking example of Tudor-Gothic architecture. \u201cIf you look up at the ceiling,\u201d Dave points out on tours, \u201cyou\u2019ll see the initials CRMT\u2014Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot\u2014very proud of his ancestry and heritage.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Talbot family owned the estate until 1942 when the castle fell into disrepair following a devastating fire in 1977.\n\nThe council owns the property today, and ongoing restoration work ensures its grandeur is preserved.\n\nDespite the fire\u2019s destruction, many original features remain, from the intricate stone carvings to the elegant stained glass windows, which, as Dave explains, \u201cdate back to when the house was built, almost 200 years ago.\u201d\n\nWhile the castle impresses with its architecture and history, its eerie ghost stories draw in thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.\n\nThe ghost of Robert Scott\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park -Credit:Robert Melen\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott, a gamekeeper who was murdered on the estate\u2014some say by a poacher, others by an escaped convict. His presence is said to rage through the castle and the estate to this day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nScott is frequently spotted making a determined ascent up the Gothic staircase that leads to the Castle. His presence is a recurring theme among psychic investigators, who all agree that his spirit seethes with fury, unable to rest after his untimely and unjust death.\n\nAfter nightfall, the castle\u2019s security guards report the unsettling sounds of hurried footsteps and low, chattering voices echoing through the empty halls\u2014though no trace of another soul is ever found.\n\nPsychic investigators have described his presence as one of anger, with inexplicable slamming doors and objects being hurled across rooms attributed to his spirit. Visitors who\u2019ve dared to investigate report an overwhelming sense of dread, as though Scott\u2019s rage still lingers.\n\nChildren\u2019s giggles and mischievous spirits\n\nAnother frequently reported occurrence is the sound of children\u2019s laughter echoing through the castle\u2019s long, empty corridors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVisitors claim to have seen ghostly figures of children in Victorian clothing flitting in and out of rooms, as though playing an eternal game of hide-and-seek. Others describe objects mysteriously moving or disappearing, believed to be the playful antics of these mischievous spirits.\n\nA shadowy blacksmith\n\nThe ghost of a blacksmith is another familiar figure at Margam, often spotted by the groundskeepers and gardeners who maintain the estate.\n\nAt night, security guards on patrol have reported unsettling sounds: hurried footsteps, murmuring voices, and shadows darting across the walls\u2014despite the castle being empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reputedly one of the most haunted places in the United Kingdom,\u201d Dave confirms. While he hasn\u2019t experienced anything personally, the sheer volume of stories visitors and staff share suggests otherwise.\n\nParanormal Activity at Margam Castle\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott -Credit:Getty Images\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe. Reports of cold spots, mysterious orbs of light, and sudden temperature drops are commonplace during overnight ghost vigils. Objects have been known to move independently, while unexplained noises chill even the bravest ghost hunters.\n\nThe spirit of Robert Scott remains the most active, with psychic investigators describing his presence as hostile and overwhelming. Rocks have been thrown during s\u00e9ances, and the sensation of being watched is unnervingly frequent in certain castle areas. For those who dare, Margam offers an experience unlike any other.\n\nGhost Zunters International at Margam Castle\n\nMargam's haunted history made waves across the Atlantic when Ghost Hunters International filmed an episode here for the SyFy Channel.\n\nThe investigation, broadcast to over a million viewers, shone a global spotlight on the site\u2019s paranormal activity, cementing its status as one of Britain\u2019s spookiest destinations.\n\nParanormal investigators used low lux cameras, full spectrum photography and super sensitive recording devices to capture \u201celectronic voice phenomena\u201d which is said to be spirit world voices.\n\nThe enthusiastic American team claimed to have captured on camera the floating figure of a monk wearing a white habit.\n\nAnd they also claimed to have \u201cspoken\u201d with a medieval monk called Brother Tom, seen a \u201cghost\u201d in shadow form of Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot \u2013 the man who commissioned the building of the castle \u2013 and heard the footsteps of Lady Emily Charlotte in the bedroom in which she died almost 100 years ago.\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:Lydia Royce\n\nAttend a ghost hunt\n\nFor those eager to experience the castle\u2019s ghostly atmosphere, Haunting Happenings offers overnight ghost hunts at Margam Castle\u2014a daunting but thrilling prospect.\n\nThese spooky events provide a unique opportunity to search for the spirits that roam the castle\u2019s many haunted rooms. Guests can expect strange light anomalies, loud footsteps echoing on the grand staircase, and sudden, extreme drops in temperature. Few are brave enough to spend time alone in the most active areas of the castle.\n\nThis popular overnight experience includes access to ghost hunting equipment such as EMF Meters and K2 Meters and interactive experiments like glass divination, table tipping, and Ouija boards.\n\nThe event features small group s\u00e9ances, ghost hunting vigils, and even free time to explore the castle\u2019s shadows alone. Teas and coffees are provided to keep spirits\u2014of the living variety\u2014high during the night.\n\nWhy visit Margam Castle?\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:South Wales Evening Post\n\nWhile the ghost stories are reason enough for many visitors, Margam Castle is also a gorgeous architectural gem surrounded by natural beauty. Dave Phillips says, \u201cThere\u2019s a story to be told here, from the stationing of American soldiers during World War II to visits from historical figures like Admiral Lord Nelson and General Dwight Eisenhower.\u201d\n\nMargam Country Park offers more than ghostly tales. From scenic walks and historic ruins to mountain biking trails and paddleboarding, there are plenty of activities for the whole family.\n\nFor those brave enough, ghost tours and overnight vigils provide the perfect opportunity to experience Margam\u2019s supernatural side firsthand.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re drawn by its history, beauty, or the chilling possibility of encountering one of its many spirits, Margam Castle is well worth a stop. But as the shadows lengthen and the night falls, keep your ears open\u2026 you might hear laughter where no one stands or footsteps where no one walks.\n\nNeed to know"

(Representational image)\n\nA drone pilot from New Jersey has described his encounter with a mysterious object near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military facility where unexplained drone sightings have been increasing.\n\nMichael B, a paranormal investigator and podcaster behind the YouTube channel \u2018Terror Talk Productions\u2019, was trying to examine a suspicious flying object when his drone malfunctioned unexpectedly.\n\nrelated stories\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Michael B said that he was flying his drone near the restricted airspace of Picatinny Arsenal when he noticed a mysterious device hovering nearby. \u201cThere was a drone just hanging out\u2026 I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone,\" he said.\n\nShortly after, a warning flashed on his screen, and his drone suddenly started descending due to a dead battery. However, the unknown object he was investigating remained in the air, sparking more questions about its origin.\n\nAlthough drones are typically grounded or forced to land when they enter restricted airspace, the mysterious object\u2019s ability to stay airborne while Michael B\u2019s drone malfunctioned is raising concerns.\n\nThe rise in reported drone sightings near Picatinny Arsenal has led to an official investigation, with authorities looking into the possible causes.\n\nAn army spokesperson confirmed that a temporary flight restriction had been imposed over Picatinny Arsenal, effective till December 26, following the recent increase in drone activity.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is also investigating the incidents and has introduced additional flight restrictions around the area, including over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.\n\nThe series of unexplained drone sightings has sparked public concern, with New Jersey State Senator Joe Pennacchio calling for a federal investigation. He even sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump, urging action over the lack of answers regarding the mysterious drones.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nWhile the origins of the drones in New Jersey remain unclear, John Kirby, the White House national security communications adviser, stated that many of the reported sightings may be of manned aircraft operating legally.\n\nDespite this, former CIA operations officer Laura Ballman speculated that the unidentified drones could be part of a secretive technology test aimed at avoiding detection or being detected.\n\nLocation : United States of America (USA)\n\nFirst Published: December 17, 2024, 16:31 IST"

'At one point, it even asked for my phone number and I said, 'Nah. I think we're good at this point.''\n\nWitt asked Michael B: 'What do you think that is? What do you think people are seeing in the sky? And why only at night?'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' Michael B responded.\n\nThe Terror Talk host also noted that he has technology to detect objects in the sky, 'none of these things that we go after are on flight radar.'\n\nTo demonstrate the government's drone deterrence capabilities, the pilot brought a DJI brand drone to a parking lot near Morristown Airport, a local flight corridor that's achieved national prominence due to Trump's use.

The mystery drone was 'unaffected'\n\nMichael B told MSNBC that he believes the government is keeping the truth about New Jersey's unidentified drones a mystery on purpose.\n\nThe real answers, he said, are likely to be 'secrets that the government don't want us to know [...] either that or aliens.'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' he told the station.\n\n'What they could be \u2014 I have no idea,' the paranormal investigator admitted, although he emphasized that he was taking it as a personal mission to keep monitoring the state's mystery drones to get answers.\n\nThe FBI has fielded over 5,000 complaints in the course of this drone UFO wave, in progress, but noted that only 100 of these cases now warrant further investigation.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security official has also noted that sightings due to mass concern over the drones has led to many false positives.\n\n'We're confident that many of the reported drone sightings are, in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones,' DHS officials said.\n\nBut the cases above sensitive military bases and US Coast Guard ships off the Jersey shore continue to worry state officials, federal investigators and the US military.\n\nThe FBI and other agencies are investigating the strange activity, but a representative from the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday, Dec. 11: 'We have no more information as to where these drones are coming from, where they're launching from, where they're landing'\n\nOfficials and residents have also seen truly odd, well-lit drones that do not resemble fixed-wing aircraft (example above) deepening the mystery of the craft's origins and intent\n\nPicatinny Arsenal told press that sightings of the unidentified drones, capable of beating their counter-drone defenses, has now climbed to 11 confirmed cases.\n\n'While the source and cause of these aircraft operating in our area remain unknown,' Picatinny's garrison commander, Lt Col Craig A. Bonham II, said, 'we can confirm that they are not the result of any Picatinny Arsenal-related activities.'\n\nAmid the uncertainty, the president-elect called for answers from the US Government as he slammed the Biden administration and urged them to shoot down the UFOs.\n\nBut this was rejected by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who said that the government does not have the authority to neutralize the drones."

            "article_content": "\u2018The Conjuring 2\u2019: One of the Best Christmas Horror Movies Ever Made\n\nThe Conjuring 2 is the perfect Christmas movie. It\u2019s also the perfect haunted house movie, the perfect showcase for James Wan\u2019s distinct brand of terror, and the perfect encapsulation of why Ed and Lorraine Warren (despite their less-than-savory history) endure as modern horror icons. The Conjuring 2 is far and away the best entry in the now gargantuan Conjuring Cinematic Universe, and I\u2019d reckon it\u2019s James Wan\u2019s most accomplished directorial feat to date. The best of the 2010s horror scene is refracted through Wan\u2019s perfection of the formula, and if you\u2019re itching to revisit, the holiday season is the perfect time.\n\nPer Prime Video: In 1977, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to north London to help a single mother of four and her possessed daughter.\n\nJames Wan himself has conceded that, yes, The Conjuring 2 is a Christmas movie. It\u2019s less a concession and more a matter of fact\u2014by design, the sequel to the behemoth hit The Conjuring was intentionally festive. Beyond the obvious setting\u2014the London Borough of Enfield in December\u2014the thematic heft of the holiday season (good and bad) is imbued into every frame. Most obviously, The Conjuring films have always been firmly, unapologetically faith-based. That might seem obvious to some, and pernicious to others, but the drive of the franchise is an unassuming belief in God and the perennial conflict between good (Christians) and evil (non-believers and devils).\n\nFor Christians, the Christmas season is (ideally) a time of gratitude and remembrance, namely for the birth of Jesus Christ and his subsequent death on the cross for our sins. Jesus is everywhere in The Conjuring 2, be it Lorraine Warren\u2019s (Vera Farmiga) rosary or the omnipresent Power of Christ \u2122 to combat the many devils and spirits seeping out of the frame. In that context, The Conjuring 2 isn\u2019t just set at Christmas\u2014it\u2019s practically about it. Faith, family, and strong values ultimately triumph over evil. The movie discards skeptics (Franka Potente\u2019s Anita Gregory, for instance) and renders them villainous simply for doubting the veracity of Valak\u2019s grip on the Hodgson family.\n\nYet, despite my personal misgivings with the franchise\u2019s unadulterated faith-based values, there\u2019s still something both agnostic and worthwhile at the core. Yes, the Warrens in real life were certainly not movie stars, and their controversial behavior over the years should have precluded them from ever being so, but there\u2019s no denying the deified versions, as played by Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, are among the most notable (and exceptional) horror protagonists of the century. They haven\u2019t grossed a cumulative $2.2 billion for nothing.\n\nStripping away the spirituality of it all, there is no denying the fuzzies instilled watching Ed and Lorraine throw themselves in harm\u2019s way to care for a family otherwise excised from public support. It\u2019s community care by way of The Conjuring. Ed Warren\u2019s ballad midway through the film, in which he sits down and performs \u201cCan\u2019t Help Falling in Love\u201d to the beleaguered, frightened Hodgson family, ranks among the purest moments in movie history. The movie earns that sentimentality.\n\nThere\u2019s an earnestness to the film that most modern horror movies reject. Irony and self-awareness are well and good, but it\u2019s just as worthwhile to feel with your whole chest. Imbued with the Christmas spirit, The Conjuring 2 does just that. None of that would matter much if The Conjuring 2 was less The Changeling, and more (well) The Devil Made Me Do It, though luckily, The Conjuring 2 remains one of the scariest movies of the century.\n\nValak was a sensational new addition to the universe, one the shareholders have had no problem deploying time and time again. James Wan\u2019s horror films have always been good with their monsters, and even the most steadfast among us would have to concede that Valak\u2019s visage is pretty damn scary. Additionally, Wan doubled down on the tactility of his world, shattering dressers, tents, and even walls with abandon. His ghosts hurt. Sure, they rarely kill anyone, but there\u2019s a refreshing tangibility to how often his baddies tango with the actors themselves.\n\nIt helps considerably that James Raleigh and his entire special effects team put real actors beneath the prosthetics. Bonnie Aarons continues to impress, though Javier Botet\u2019s Crooked Man is a real standout. Appearing only twice, the Crooked Man\u2014achieved practically for the most part\u2014is a terrifying monster whose fantastical elements shouldn\u2019t, in theory, mesh with the more grounded scares of The Conjuring 2\u2019s world. That they do, regularly augmenting the terror, is a testament to how assured the entire haunted house is.\n\nOf course, Wan\u2019s infamous jump scares\u2014regularly mimicked, never quite as successful elsewhere\u2014are top-notch. Even upon a rewatch, the movie makes me jump at least once, whether from a blaring children\u2019s toy or a ghostly apparition appearing behind a television set. Seriously, the work here is among the best of the best, and for the past eight years, filmmakers have tried to replicate the visceral magic of Wan\u2019s scares.\n\nThe Conjuring might be more haunting, but The Conjuring 2 is unequivocally scarier. The world is larger than ever before, and with the Christmas spirit imbued in every scare and ounce of worldbuilding, it ascends to the realm of seasonal repeat watch. I\u2019m certainly not the first person to posit The Conjuring 2 is a Christmas movie\u2014Wan himself has said as much, after all. I would argue, however, that it ranks among the very best.\n\nI\u2019m talking Top 3 material. Black Christmas is the best of all time, and nothing is ever going to dethrone that, but The Conjuring 2 is a close second. It not only feels like a Christmas movie but simultaneously uses those feelings to subvert expectations and scare us silly. The franchise as a whole hasn\u2019t come close to matching the high of Wan\u2019s expertly assembled sequel, though year after year, The Conjuring 2 continues to give. It\u2019s that good."

Bones with slicing cuts, as if someone had butchered the skin around them.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the remains found in a shaft at the Charterhouse Warren Farm in southwest England have been a blip in British archaeological history. Discovered by cave explorers in 1970, the collection of mismatched bones seemed to be just another Bronze Age gravesite \u2014 a few victims scattered among sediment and animal skeletons.\n\nNow, a recent study published in the Cambridge University journal Antiquity suggests a stunningly grim saga played out at Charterhouse Warren, at far greater scale than previously thought: The bones belong to at least 37 men, women and children who were slaughtered and possibly eaten in a ceremonial feast after their massacre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us all aback. It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

After digging a little deeper, they found two more teeth just below the surface. Realizing the find might be something special, the homeowner called in experts, and soon a full excavation was underway.\n\n\u201cWhen I found the teeth and held them in my hands, I knew they were something special,\u201d said the homeowner. \u201cI\u2019m so excited that our yard had something so important for science.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers uncovered a well-preserved jaw belonging to an adult mastodon, an ancient relative of today\u2019s elephants. The jaw will now be studied to figure out how old it is, what the mastodon ate and what its life was like during the Ice Age.\n\n\u201cThis jaw is an amazing discovery,\u201d said Dr. Robert Feranec, an expert from the New York State Museum. \u201cFossils like this help us learn about ancient ecosystems and give us clues about how the world has changed over time.\u201d\n\nA backyard in Orange County, New York, became the site of an incredible discovery of a complete mastodon jaw -- the first find like it in New York in more than 11 years. New York State Museum\n\nOrange County has been a great place to find mastodon fossils. In fact, about one-third of the 150 mastodon fossils found in New York have come from this area.\n\nDr. Cory Harris from SUNY Orange said they hope to keep digging in the area to see if there are more bones waiting to be found.\n\n\u201cThe jaw is the most exciting part, but the toe and rib fragments might also help us learn more about this animal,\u201d Dr. Harris explained.\n\nThe jaw will eventually be displayed at the New York State Museum in 2025, after scientists finish their research, according to Michael Mastroianni, a leader at the museum."

Since the 1800s, only 6 samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Getty Images/ PAU BARRENA / Contributor\n\nWith the holiday season upon us, many companies are finding ways to take advantage through deals, promotions, or other campaigns. OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post.\n\nAlso: I'm a ChatGPT power user - here's why Canvas is its best productivity feature\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a bit more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and will occur daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches will be both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat has been dropped so far?\n\nTuesday, December 17\n\nThe releases on the ninth day all focus on developer features and updates, dubbed \"Mini Dev Day.\" These launches include:\n\nThe o1 model is finally out of preview in the API with support for function calling, structured outputs, developer messages, vision capabilities, and lower latency, according to the company.\n\no1 in the API also features a new parameter: \"reasoning effort.\" This parameter allows developers to tell the model how much effort is put into formulating an answer, which helps with cost efficiency.\n\nOpenAI also introduced WebRTC support for the Realtime API, which makes it easier for developers \"to build and scale real-time voice products across platforms.\"\n\nThe Realtime API also got a 60% audio token price drop, support for GPT-4o mini, and more control over responses.\n\nThe fine-tuning API now supports Preference Fine-Tuning, which allows users to \"Optimize the model to favor desired behavior by reinforcing preferred responses and reducing the likelihood of unpreferred ones,\" according to OpenAI.\n\n\n\nOpenAI also introduced new Go and Java SDKs in beta.\n\nAn \"AMA\" (ask me anything) session will be held for an hour after the live stream on the OpenAI GitHub platform with the presenters.\n\nMonday, December 16\n\nThe drops for the second Monday in the 12 days of OpenAI series all focused on Search in ChatGPT.\n\nThe AI search engine is available to all users starting today, including all free users who are signed in anywhere they can access ChatGPT. The feature was previously only available to ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nThe search experience, which allows users to browse the web from ChatGPT, got faster and better on mobile and now has an enriched map experience. The upgrades include image-rich visual results.\n\nSearch is integrated into Advance Voice mode, meaning you can now search as you talk to ChatGPT. To activate this feature, just activate Advance Voice the same way you regularly would and ask it your query verbally. It will then answer your query verbally by pulling from the web.\n\nOpenAI also teased developers, saying, \"Tomorrow is for you,\" and calling the upcoming livestream a \"mini Dev Day.\"\n\nFriday, December 13\n\nOne of OpenAI's most highly requested features has been an organizational feature to better keep track of your conversations. On Friday, OpenAI delivered a new feature called \"Projects.\"\n\nProjects is a new way to organize and customize your chats in ChatGPT, meant to be a part of continuing to optimize the core experience of ChatGPT.\n\nWhen creating a Project, you can include a title, a customized folder color, relevant project files, instructions for ChatGPT on how it can best help you with the project, and more in one place.\n\nIn the Project, you can start a chat and add previous chats from the sidebar to your Project. It can also answer questions using your context in a regular chat format. The chats can be saved in the Project, making it easier to pick up your conversations later and know exactly what to look for where.\n\nIt will be rolled out to Plus, Pro, and Teams users starting today. OpenAI says it's coming to free users as soon as possible. Enterprise and Edu users will see it rolled out early next year.\n\nThursday, December 12\n\nWhen the live stream started, OpenAI addressed the elephant in the room -- the fact that the company's live stream went down the day before. OpenAI apologized for the inconvenience and said its team is working on a post-mortem to be posted later.\n\nThen it got straight into the news -- another highly-anticipated announcement:\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode now has screen-sharing and visual capabilities, meaning it can assist with the context of what it is viewing, whether that be from your phone camera or what's on your screen.\n\nThese capabilities build on what Advanced Voice could already do very well -- engaging in casual conversation as a human would. The natural-like conversations can be interrupted, have multi-turns, and understand non-linear trains of thought.\n\nIn the demo, the user gets directions from ChatGPT's Advanced Voice on how to make a cup of coffee. As the demoer goes through the steps, ChatGPT is verbally offering insights and directions.\n\nThere's another bonus for the Christmas season: Users can access a new Santa voice. To activate it, all users have to do is click on the snowflake icon. Santa is rolling out throughout today everywhere that users can access ChatGPT voice mode. The first time you talk to Santa, your usage limits reset, even if you have reached the limit already, so you can have a conversation with him.\n\nVideo and screen sharing are rolling out in the latest mobile apps starting today and throughout next week to all Team users and most Pro and Plus subscribers. Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe will get access \"as soon as we can,\" and Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next year.\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 on Wednesday. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, the live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams are held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. To make access easier, OpenAI will also post a link to the live stream on its X account 10 minutes before it starts, which will be at approximately 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET daily."

The upgrade is one of a number of new features being rolled out to OpenAI's developer customers starting today.\n\nOpenAI announced during a livestream today that the new o1 model would bring back many of the \"core features you've been missing\" from the API during o1-preview. This includes the ability to use developer messages to help guide your particular chatbot (i.e. \"You are a helpful assistant for tax professionals.\") and access to a \"reasoning effort\" parameter that tells the API how long to think about specific queries, saving time and money on simple problems so they can be used on the tougher ones. API users can also use visual information like scans of documents as input.\n\nOpenAI also highlighted improvements to the new API's use of internal function calling, where the OpenAI model decides to call functions pre-written by outside developers to generate answers to certain queries, when appropriate. The new API is also more accurate in its use of structured outputs, which use a JSON schema to present information in a specific format outlined by the developer, OpenAI said.\n\nThe o1 model uses 60 percent fewer thinking tokens than o1-preview, OpenAI said, generating faster and cheaper results. But those results are also roughly 25 to 35 percentage points more accurate on benchmarks like LiveBench and the AIME, according to OpenAI.\n\nWhile o1 access will start rolling out to tier 5 development customers today, API access to the $200/month o1 Pro model is only promised to be \"coming soon.\""

            "article_content": "OpenAI is bringing o1, its \u201creasoning\u201d AI model, to its API \u2014 but only for certain developers, to start.\n\nStarting Tuesday, o1 will begin rolling out to devs in OpenAI\u2019s \u201ctier 5\u201d usage category, the company said. To qualify for tier 5, developers have to spend at least $1,000 with OpenAI and have an account that\u2019s older than 30 days since their first successful payment.\n\nO1 replaces the o1-preview model that was already available in the API.\n\nUnlike most AI, reasoning models like o1 effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. As a drawback, they often take longer to arrive at solutions.\n\nThey\u2019re also quite pricey \u2014 in part because they require a lot of computing resources to run. OpenAI charges $15 for every ~750,000 words o1 analyzes and $60 for every ~750,000 words the model generates. That\u2019s 6x the cost of OpenAI\u2019s latest \u201cnon-reasoning\u201d model, GPT-4o.\n\nO1 in the OpenAI API is far more customizable than o1-preview, thanks to new features like function calling (which allows the model to be connected to external data), developer messages (which lets devs instruct the model on tone and style), and image analysis. In addition to structured outputs, o1 also has an API parameter, \u201creasoning_effort,\u201d that enables control over how long the model \u201cthinks\u201d before responding to a query.\n\nOpenAI said that the version of o1 in the API \u2014 and, soon, the company\u2019s AI chatbot platform, ChatGPT \u2014 is a \u201cnew post-trained\u201d version of o1. Compared to the o1 model released in ChatGPT two weeks ago, this one, \u201co1-2024-12-17,\u201d improves on \u201careas of model behavior based on feedback,\u201d OpenAI vaguely said.\n\n\u201cWe are rolling out access incrementally while working to expand access to additional usage tiers and ramping up rate limits,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post.\n\nIn a note on its website, OpenAI said that the newest o1 should provide \u201cmore comprehensive and accurate responses,\u201d particularly for questions pertaining to programming and business, and is less likely to incorrectly refuse requests.\n\nIn other dev-related news Tuesday, OpenAI announced new versions of its GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models as part of the Realtime API, OpenAI\u2019s API for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. The new models (\u201cgpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17\u201d and \u201cgpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview-2024-12-17\u201d), which boast improved data efficiency and reliability, are also cheaper to use, OpenAI said.\n\nSpeaking of the Realtime API (no pun intended), it remains in beta, but it\u2019s gained several new capabilities, like concurrent out-of-band responses, which enables background tasks such as content moderation to run without interrupting interactions. The API also now supports WebRTC, the open standard for building real-time voice applications for browser-based clients, smartphones, and Internet of Things devices.\n\nIn what\u2019s certainly no coincidence, OpenAI hired the creator of WebRTC, Justin Uberti, in early December.\n\n\u201cOur WebRTC integration is designed to enable smooth and responsive interactions in real-world conditions, even with variable network quality,\u201d OpenAI wrote in the blog. \u201cIt handles audio encoding, streaming, noise suppression, and congestion control.\u201d\n\nIn the last of its updates Tuesday, OpenAI brought preference fine-tuning to its fine-tuning API; preference fine-tuning compares pairs of a model\u2019s responses to \u201cteach\u201d a model to distinguish between preferred and \u201cnonpreferred\u201d answers to questions. And the company launched an \u201cearly access\u201d beta for official software developer kits in Go and Java."

So it raised $6.6 billion more and arranged to borrow an additional $4 billion.\n\nBut in another 18 months or so from now, OpenAI will need another cash infusion because the San Francisco start-up is spending more than $5.4 billion a year. And by 2029, OpenAI expects to spend $37.5 billion a year.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s accelerating expenses are the main reason the corporate structure of the company, which began as a nonprofit research lab, could soon change. OpenAI must raise billions of additional dollars in the years to come, and its executives believe it will be more attractive to investors as a for-profit company.\n\nIn many ways, artificial intelligence has inverted how computer technology used to be created. For decades, Silicon Valley engineers designed new technologies one small step at a time. As they built social media apps like Facebook or shopping sites like Amazon, they wrote line after line of computer code. With each new line, they carefully defined what the app would do."

            "article_content": "Experts provide insight into the rise of FinOps, how APIs will force a rise in DevSecOps, and how low-code, no-code is here to stay.\n\nThe Rise of FinOps\n\nTzvika Zaiffer, Director, Solutions, Spot by NetApp:\n\nThe DevOps landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, particularly in response to the growing demands of enterprise AI initiatives and competitive market pressures. A key development has been the rise of FinOps\u2014the integration of financial accountability into DevOps practices. DevOps teams now regularly collaborate with finance experts, making decisions that balance technical requirements with cost considerations. This evolution reflects a broader shift toward cost-conscious infrastructure management. Organizations increasingly expect DevOps teams to implement sophisticated cost visibility tools, automated provisioning systems, and real-time monitoring capabilities. These practices help control expenses while maintaining the high-performance infrastructure needed for AI workloads and other complex applications.\n\nLooking ahead, this convergence of DevOps and financial stewardship will become even more critical. Successful DevOps strategies will need to demonstrate not just technical excellence, but also clear financial viability through mature cost controls and efficient resource utilization.\n\nAPI Boom Will Yield Transition to DevSecOps Teams\n\nMoshe Lipsker, VP of Global Product Development, Imperva, a Thales company:\n\nAs we head into 2025, we\u2019ll be four years into application programming interfaces (APIs) taking over the world. As it stands, the Economic Impact of API and Bot Attacks study from the Imperva Threat Research Team found that the average enterprise managed 613 API endpoints last year. APIs enable seamless integration and user experience but, consequently, attract hacker interest as these endpoints provide direct access to sensitive data. On average, API-related security issues cost organizations $25-87 billion annually. This massive loss begs the question: are IT security teams and DevOps teams ready to work together to balance the speed of business development with security?\n\nAs more organizations continue to adopt APIs in 2025, these increasing risks will force their hand in strengthening security posture at the point of development so that they can provide widespread protection of their software. Though it\u2019s not easy, we will continue to see the transition to DevSecOps teams to ensure that security is effectively built into product development from the start. With these transitions, organizations will adopt automated solutions such as runtime application self-protection to increase security without adding overhead to development processes.\n\nLow-code/no-code: Hype or Real Value?\n\nShomron Jacob, Head of Applied Machine Learning & Platform, Iterate.ai:\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen firsthand for years now, low-code strategies are very efficient and effective at bringing AI, the IoT, data connectivity and more into production applications\u2014and doing so without facing the exorbitant cost and technical hurdles of otherwise hardcoding (and exhaustively learning) those technologies. By distilling the complexity of those technologies into modules ready to be connected to build out complete applications, businesses are achieving innovative functionality and delivering breakthrough capabilities with less direct expertise, time, and expense. That simplicity also translates into speed, from initially testing applications, to iteratively optimizing and perfecting them (both capabilities and user experiences). Those advantages will continue to drive greater low-code adoption in the coming year as organizations seek to debut applications with competitive features at an even more accelerated pace."

            "article_content": "NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iStock, a leading e-commerce platform providing premium content to SMBs, SMEs, creatives, and students everywhere, has released its 2025 Marketing Trends Report, packed with practical strategies to help businesses thrive in today\u2019s trust-driven marketplace.\n\nThe report comes at a critical time when consumer trust in social media\u2014a key tool for small businesses\u2014is declining. According to iStock\u2019s VisualGPS research platform, 81% of consumers don\u2019t trust social media content, citing concerns over misinformation. However, trust in businesses remains high, with 64% of people favoring businesses over celebrities or influencers, or even politicians, and 58% preferring brands whose values align with their own. For small businesses, this is a powerful opportunity to leverage their local ties and authentic engagement to build stronger connections and outpace larger competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rebecca Swift, Senior Vice President of Creative for iStock, emphasizes the need for a bold shift: \u201cAs we enter 2025, trust will define success, and visual content will be a critical tool in forging genuine connections with audiences. For small businesses, the advantage lies not in chasing polished perfection but in creating visuals that feel human, honest, and deeply relevant. By telling real stories and reflecting diverse experiences, small businesses can establish deep, lasting trust with their audiences\u2013proving that it\u2019s not about looking perfect but about feeling real and relatable.\u201d\n\nHere are iStock\u2019s key marketing trends to help SMBs build trust in 2025:\n\nReal Talk: Less Influencer, More Real-User Content\n\nThe genuine feel that made influencer content connect with people is disappearing. VisualGPS revealed, 67% of people believe traditional ads are more authentic than sponsored influencer posts. Even if you don\u2019t use influencers, this shift matters. People are tired of content that looks too perfect and want visuals that feel genuine and honest. A few years ago, User-Generated Content (UGC), like selfies and vertical videos, was seen as the most real and authentic. But in 2025, people expect more. This is where Real-User Content (RUC) comes in, a new concept from iStock experts which encourages businesses to move from \"generated\" content to images and videos that show \u201creal.\u201d\n\nThis change is affecting how people interact with visual content, especially on social media. Despite people\u2019s lack of trust, they still find these platforms valuable, 82% of users still go to places like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts for video content to learn something new or get inspiration. In other words, people want the benefits of social media, without the negative effects. This shift has also made video-driven social search more popular, where platforms focused on video are no longer just for scrolling \u2014they\u2019ve become places to search and discover. In 2025, to succeed, you need to speak directly to your audience, this approach will always be more effective than a flood of generic posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonesty: The New Face of Authenticity\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to marketing trends, you\u2019ve probably seen the word \u201cauthenticity\u201d everywhere. But what does it truly mean? For consumers, it means being real, truthful, and original, according to VisualGPS research. And in 2025, it will still be key to building trust\u201498% of people say authentic images and videos are important for earning trust. However, authenticity is changing. In 2025, it\u2019s will be about radical honesty. People don\u2019t want perfect images\u2014they want to see what makes your business human, imperfections and all.\n\nSharing raw moments, real customer stories, and the messy, behind-the-scenes parts of running a business can create strong emotional connections. Being honest is important\u2014whether it's showing how your processes work to teach your audience or admitting when things don\u2019t go as planned. Even humor, when used carefully, can turn simple interactions into memorable moments. In a world full of overly polished content, honesty will help your brand stand out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Frontier: Trust-Centric AI for Forward-Thinking Businesses\n\nText-to-image Generative AI is a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. However, in 2025, its successful use will depend on being transparent. While consumers are open to AI-generated ads, 86% believe it should be clearly labeled, and 74% are okay with AI-generated content IF used ethically. This means using AI to empower, not to mislead. Also, as ethical AI becomes the standard, using tools that offer commercially safe AI images with legal protection\u2014just like any other royalty-free image\u2014not only gives you peace of mind but also positions your business as a leader in responsible AI use, aligning with the values your audience expect.\n\nOn top of that, beyond creating images from scratch think of AI as a virtual studio that helps your team create flexible, cost-effective content. AI tools like iStock\u2019s AI generator, allow businesses to not only generate custom images from creative prompts but also modify visuals, remove or change elements, and expand canvases to fit specific formats\u2014all without needing expensive software or design skills. This tool even lets businesses upload reference images and product photos to build a personalized library of assets, making it quicker and easier to align visuals with your business needs, pace, and budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs 2025 approaches, the key to success for SMBs is embracing trust-first strategies. By focusing on Real-User Content, being radically honest, and using AI transparently, small businesses can not only stay ahead of the curve but also lead the way in making trust the foundation of modern marketing.\n\nTo inspire and elevate your visual marketing strategy ahead of 2025 with related imagery and videos, visit https://www.istockphoto.com/.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nIlse Noguez\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement are available at:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9508cf80-f5a7-403f-819b-68c62617e25c\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f9cc203d-5c67-45a0-8e84-a6e001ad7acb\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/80078fc0-f37b-4b57-b58b-55c54c396f5a\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ef7c3bb1-ca44-4d03-83f5-0d5f80c8af52\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f860a42a-50ab-413a-b17e-75d09e83934c"

            "article_content": "For the past nine months, Inbal Shani has been the Chief Product Officer and Head of R&D at Twilio, a customer engagement platform (CEP). She's already working hard to build a trusted platform that leverages AI to support a constantly shifting customer engagement market.\n\nShani previously worked at Github, where she was responsible for what is now called Copilot (along with other platform elements). She has over twenty years of experience in AI/ML and has been through every phase of AI growth, from neural networks to deep learning, predictive, and now generative AI. Shani's experience spans industries including aerospace, automotive, robotics, retail, cloud developer tools, and now communications and data. In all her work, she has looked at how AI can improve the business.\n\nTwilio has created trends and followed trends. But as it looks to the future, it's all about building \"one platform that is trusted, simple, and smart.' Shani argue that every company has to leverage AI, but many are taking the wrong approach.\n\nThe questions companies do ask focus more on AI and how to monetize it. The questions they should be asking are: what is the value-add that automation or having a conversational agent brings to the customer experience, and how are you using AI as a tool? How will AI make you more productive, remove friction, or provide a better customer experience?\n\nIt\u2019s the difference, she says, between successful and less successful companies. If you are grounded by the customer problem you're trying to solve and figuring out how AI can help solve that problem, you will realize ROI and see successful adoption. Companies that sprinkle a little generative AI on something that doesn't materialize into a product or feature that customers want to adopt and buy will struggle.\n\nThe other challenge she sees is that the AI strategy doesn't necessarily align with the company strategy.\n\nI think that's the biggest kind of difference in terms of perspective on AI; AI is a very useful tool. It's a very powerful tool. And you need to know how to use these tools to solve problems. But it's not a magic solution for everything, and it's not a magical solution that is going to solve everything. So, knowing how to use it in a smart way to really focus on the customer. If it's better user experience, if it's better productivity, if it's creating shorter time to value because of automation, then you have a successful AI strategy.\n\nShani says Twilio is successful because it uses AI as a tool to improve customer engagement, security, and customer satisfaction.\n\nHow Twilio CEP uses AI\n\nTwilio is not for one department. It provides the tools to support the customer end-to-end. The CDP (customer data platform) gives them customer data, and the CPaaS (communications platform as a service) provides the \"last mile connection\" - email, SMS, and voice interactions. Bringing them together creates customer engagement across the entire customer lifecycle. AI is used throughout the CEP. Shani cites the example of Fraud Guard, Twilio\u2019s first product to market, which provides SMS protection. They developed predictive AI models for this product, which they continually tune:\n\nIn Twilio, for example, in our Fraud Guard product that I mentioned before. It was never about, okay, how do we monetize predictive AI? We were grounded in solving a problem that was real and increasing, especially now in the age of AI, of spam, and impersonation. So when we built Fraud Guard, it was always the intention: how do we protect our customers, how do we create these secure communications, and we see real value? We see real savings for our customers who are using the product. And they never once asked us, are you using LLMs? Are you using predictive AI? It was not even a question. So, it was not about how you're monetizing it. But it's more in terms of what is the value that I'm getting?\n\nBut Shani is also looking into leveraging AI in the Segment business, focusing on customer data and engagement. Here, predictive audiences help companies understand what their customers are trying to do, how they will behave, and what the next best action for them is.\n\nIn addition, Twilio has launched generative AI products across communications, including their personalized IVR and Flex contact center product with a copilot agent. In this product, an AI assistant helps agents be more helpful to customers by providing advice and recommendations, sentiment analysis, and summarizing conversations.\n\nWhat\u2019s changing for developers\n\nWith a ten-million-strong developer community, it makes sense that Shani would have a strong view of how AI is affecting developers.\n\nWe are hearing more and more that in the next five years, everyone will be a developer. Shani doesn\u2019t agree. She reckons there is a big difference between a developer and a builder. Yes, everyone can use an AI tool and build something, she said. You can write better content and better code, but that doesn\u2019t make you a software developer:\n\nIt's kind of a new language that developers need to learn how to use and how to use it well.\n\nShani pitches that AI is a productivity and assistant tool, with rhe caveat that you need to know what questions to ask to get the right answer.\n\nYou see the evolution of software development languages all the time. And I think when I'm looking from a software developer perspective, what we see right now, with all these copilot assistants to write code, is really about making a developer much more productive so they can focus on getting the full value out of their time writing code which is something that they didn't have before.\n\nShani sees three themes in how AI is impacting software development. First, developers need enough software skills to validate that the AI-generated code is good and does what they want it to.\n\nSecond, AI uses data to create code, but there\u2019s a creative aspect to people that Shani doesn\u2019t see AI replacing in the near future.\n\nFinally, Shani believes there will be a shift in how developers think about code. Before, it was all about generating code to solve a problem. Now, it\u2019s thinking about systems design and overall architecture from the start. And it\u2019s about user experience, something that is becoming very critical in the world of AI, she said.\n\nWhat does this mean for developers exactly?\n\nShe explains:\n\nIf we're using an AI tool to write a document, we don't just copy, paste, and call it done. The same needs to be done in code. You have to validate whatever the AI assistant has been generating. I think that's one element. And the second thing that I advise computer science students asking me similar questions is you need to learn the basics without AI. You need to learn how to be a software developer before you earn the right to use an AI tool because you need to be able to look into the code. You need to be able to look into the product that you have generated and know if it's good or not. Because, if not, and that goes back to then, we don't really need you because that's the validation that is missing if you delegate the entire creation of a code to an AI assistant.\n\nThe key to consider here is how students are taught computer science today. Not all universities have embraced AI trends\u2014not for developers, marketers, or writers. Shani said she is seeing some effort to figure it out. But there is a balance to find. You want students to learn to code without AI first, but you also want them to learn to leverage AI tools to help them be more productive and efficient.\n\nAt the same time, these schools also need to devote more teaching time to the thinking and designing aspects of systems development. There aren't likely many schools teaching user experience in computer science courses\u2014at least not as a core subject.\n\nMy take\n\nI appreciated Shani's perspective on how organizations should think about AI. By focusing on the customer and creating better experiences, it's easy to find ways to leverage AI. Incorporating AI into a product without thinking about what benefits it truly brings may have been okay at first, but it isn't the right approach today.\n\nI also liked how she talked about developers' use of AI. This is very similar to how content marketers and writers can use AI\u2014as an assistant, as another tool. It doesn't replace the need to understand the work; it's simply a way to take more of the basic operations out of the hands of developers so they can spend more time designing products and experiences that customers will love.\n\nDoes this mean companies won't replace developers? Not necessarily. As I have said before, with AI and writers, some will get replaced. It's just the way things go. What developers want to do is find the companies that understand the true value of AI in the toolkit. And it sounds like Twilio is one of those companies."

            "article_content": "Is AI going to steal your job \u2013 or will you be able to use it to your advantage? And is the recent decrease in job listings a good or a bad thing for freelancers? It\u2019s an interesting time for freelancers and contractors and that\u2019s set to continue into 2025.\n\nWondering what could be coming up for your business next year? Keep reading to see six predictions about the state of freelance work.\n\n1. An urgent need to embrace AI?\n\nAI has been a hot topic for several years now, but recent developments suggest that 2025 is a year for change. AI has come a long way \u2013 and with easy access to tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, as well as Apple\u2019s new inbuilt Apple Intelligence, there are less barriers to introducing it into your professional life too.\n\nAs a busy freelancer, you can use generative AI to lighten your workload for things like drafting proposals, transcribing notes, and summarising emails. You can also use it to help with areas outside of your expertise, such as marketing or copywriting.\n\nA recent study from Fiverr also found that AI was the top missing skill in UK businesses \u2013 with 18 per cent of business leaders surveyed saying they hire freelancers who have AI skills full time employees don\u2019t.\n\nLooking to upskill in this area? Read our guide to AI for small businesses for some ideas.\n\n2. An end to late payments?\n\nThe new Labour government\u2019s Fair Payment Code launched in December 2024, so will start affecting the self-employed in 2025. This voluntary code of practice gives larger businesses who work with freelancers and contractors an award based on their payment record.\n\nBusinesses can be categorised one of three ways: Gold \u2013 for businesses that pay 95 per cent of their suppliers within 30 days\n\n\u2013 for businesses that pay 95 per cent of their suppliers within 30 days Silver \u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of their small business suppliers within 30 days and all other suppliers within 60 days\n\n\u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of their small business suppliers within 30 days and all other suppliers within 60 days Bronze \u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of suppliers within 60 days\n\nAdditionally, the Small Business Commissioner will be given greater enforcement powers to ensure small businesses and freelancers are getting paid on time. And with our own research showing that small businesses were owed an estimated \u00a332 billion in late payments in 2023, this is sure to be a positive change in the freelance world.\n\n3. More clarity for contractors under umbrella companies?\n\nThe 2024 Autumn Budget revealed plans to crack down on exploitative umbrella companies who fail to comply with IR35 regulations. This means that the responsibility for paying the correct income tax and National Insurance contributions will fall on the employer and not the contractor.\n\nWhile this new legislation won\u2019t come into effect until April 2026, HMRC recently published an online tool designed to help contractors better understand payment from umbrella companies. This new tool was published in December 2024, meaning freelancers will be able to use it for their 2025 contracts.\n\n4. Higher day rates for freelancers?\n\nThe new year could be the time to increase your day rate, according to a recent study from the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed. The study revealed that the average day rate of UK freelancers increased from Q2 to Q3 2024, from \u00a3457 to \u00a3576.\n\nThe same study revealed that the freelancers surveyed expected their day rates to further increase 12.2 per cent in the next year.\n\nIf you think it\u2019s time to increase your earnings, our guide to setting a freelance rate can help.\n\n5. Increased costs for freelancers outside IR35?\n\nFiverr\u2019s recent data also reveals that 83 per cent of businesses believe Labour\u2019s Budget will impact their business. This is largely in part to the increase of Employer National Insurance contributions \u2013 which are set to rise to 15 per cent from April 2025.\n\nThis increase, combined with a lower earnings threshold and an increase in corporation tax, could affect both umbrella contractors and limited company contractors. Umbrella contractors could see a reduction in their take home pay, while limited company contractors may find it harder to negotiate contracts.\n\n6. Less job vacancies?\n\nJob vacancy website Reed recently reported the number of job vacancies posted on its website had fallen 13 per cent between October and November \u2013 and is now 26 per cent lower than a year ago.\n\nThis is supported by recent data from the Office of National Statistics, which also revealed that the number of job vacancies fell by 31,000 between September and November.\n\nWhile this accounts for the job market as a whole and isn\u2019t limited to just freelance and contract work, it suggests changes for the self-employed.\n\nEither businesses will be unable to hire full time staff and will instead look to contractors, meaning more employment opportunities, or the decrease in overall opportunities will include freelancers too.\n\nDo you have any other predictions that may affect freelancers and contractors in 2025? Let us know what you\u2019ve heard in the comments below.\n\nHelpful guides for freelancers"

It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

After digging a little deeper, they found two more teeth just below the surface. Realizing the find might be something special, the homeowner called in experts, and soon a full excavation was underway.\n\n\u201cWhen I found the teeth and held them in my hands, I knew they were something special,\u201d said the homeowner. \u201cI\u2019m so excited that our yard had something so important for science.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers uncovered a well-preserved jaw belonging to an adult mastodon, an ancient relative of today\u2019s elephants.

(Fuzzy on the difference between dark energy and dark matter? Read our Fundamentals newsletter from May.) Experimenters hunting for hypothesized dark matter particles known as WIMPs \u2014 heavy, inert particles that were long considered the top candidate for the nonreflective stuff floating in and around galaxies \u2014 hit a limit. Detectors have become so sensitive that they\u2019re now picking up the glow of neutrinos from the sun, which blinds them to any subtler signals. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of the end of the WIMP detection era,\u201d the Stanford University physicist Natalia Toro told us.\n\nShe and other dark matter hunters have switched gears and now seek new dark matter candidates, especially lightweight but abundant particles that would come in multiple species. \u201cThe most common hypothesis is that this is somehow simple. Why on Earth should we expect that?\u201d said Philip Schuster, also a Stanford physicist, voicing an increasingly common sentiment among specialists.\n\nLest you suspect that dark matter is the Ptolemaic epicycle of the 21st century \u2014 a long-believed but convoluted and ultimately erroneous model of the universe \u2014 astronomers discovered a new reason to think it\u2019s really out there. The finding, an object called MACS J0018.5, has proved so compelling that people are referring to it as the new Bullet Cluster. In the original Bullet Cluster \u2014 long considered one of the single most persuasive pieces of evidence for dark matter\u2019s existence \u2014 we see two enormous clusters of galaxies crashing together. The colliding gas glows brightly in the center of the crash site, but most of the matter has sailed right through, forming heavy, light-distorting blobs on either side. That\u2019s how dark matter particles would behave, because they don\u2019t (or barely) interact.\n\nMACS J0018.5 is similar, except the galaxy clusters are merging along our line of sight. Researchers effectively pointed a radar gun at them and found that their visible gas has slowed as it collides while the majority of the mass moves faster, unimpeded by the collision.\n\nThese merging clusters are hard to explain without invoking the kind of invisible particles we\u2019re looking for."

            "article_content": "Experts provide insight into the rise of FinOps, how APIs will force a rise in DevSecOps, and how low-code, no-code is here to stay.\n\nThe Rise of FinOps\n\nTzvika Zaiffer, Director, Solutions, Spot by NetApp:\n\nThe DevOps landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, particularly in response to the growing demands of enterprise AI initiatives and competitive market pressures. A key development has been the rise of FinOps\u2014the integration of financial accountability into DevOps practices. DevOps teams now regularly collaborate with finance experts, making decisions that balance technical requirements with cost considerations. This evolution reflects a broader shift toward cost-conscious infrastructure management. Organizations increasingly expect DevOps teams to implement sophisticated cost visibility tools, automated provisioning systems, and real-time monitoring capabilities. These practices help control expenses while maintaining the high-performance infrastructure needed for AI workloads and other complex applications.\n\nLooking ahead, this convergence of DevOps and financial stewardship will become even more critical. Successful DevOps strategies will need to demonstrate not just technical excellence, but also clear financial viability through mature cost controls and efficient resource utilization.\n\nAPI Boom Will Yield Transition to DevSecOps Teams\n\nMoshe Lipsker, VP of Global Product Development, Imperva, a Thales company:\n\nAs we head into 2025, we\u2019ll be four years into application programming interfaces (APIs) taking over the world. As it stands, the Economic Impact of API and Bot Attacks study from the Imperva Threat Research Team found that the average enterprise managed 613 API endpoints last year. APIs enable seamless integration and user experience but, consequently, attract hacker interest as these endpoints provide direct access to sensitive data. On average, API-related security issues cost organizations $25-87 billion annually. This massive loss begs the question: are IT security teams and DevOps teams ready to work together to balance the speed of business development with security?\n\nAs more organizations continue to adopt APIs in 2025, these increasing risks will force their hand in strengthening security posture at the point of development so that they can provide widespread protection of their software. Though it\u2019s not easy, we will continue to see the transition to DevSecOps teams to ensure that security is effectively built into product development from the start. With these transitions, organizations will adopt automated solutions such as runtime application self-protection to increase security without adding overhead to development processes.\n\nLow-code/no-code: Hype or Real Value?\n\nShomron Jacob, Head of Applied Machine Learning & Platform, Iterate.ai:\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen firsthand for years now, low-code strategies are very efficient and effective at bringing AI, the IoT, data connectivity and more into production applications\u2014and doing so without facing the exorbitant cost and technical hurdles of otherwise hardcoding (and exhaustively learning) those technologies. By distilling the complexity of those technologies into modules ready to be connected to build out complete applications, businesses are achieving innovative functionality and delivering breakthrough capabilities with less direct expertise, time, and expense. That simplicity also translates into speed, from initially testing applications, to iteratively optimizing and perfecting them (both capabilities and user experiences). Those advantages will continue to drive greater low-code adoption in the coming year as organizations seek to debut applications with competitive features at an even more accelerated pace."

            "article_content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nMachine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become essential technologies across industries, automating tasks at a speed and scale far beyond human capabilities. However, building these systems at scale requires deep engineering expertise and skilled teams to ensure success.\n\nNiloy Gupta, Machine Learning Engineer Tech Lead at Attentive Mobile, is an expert in scaling machine learning systems for various industry verticals. Gupta\u2019s experience spans critical roles, including CTO of Lambent Logic and a pivotal position in scaling Affirm\u2019s Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) platform, one of the largest in the U.S. He was also instrumental in scaling Yelp\u2019s Ads Targeting system. Niloy holds a graduate degree from the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. His research focused on machine learning systems.\n\nEngineering AI/ML Applications\n\nNiloy\u2019s journey as a technology leader showcases his ability to build scalable AI/ML systems for diverse industries. At Affirm, he contributed to production-scale systems while advancing model interpretability.\n\nNiloy shares, \u201cAI/ML models must be interpretable to understand why a loan is approved or denied. If a FinTech company were to deny a loan, they would be legally obligated to tell the consumer why their loan application was rejected. As a result, companies are biased toward simpler and more interpretable models.\u201d\n\nNiloy\u2019s work reflects the complexities of regulated FinTech systems, where model updates need regularity approval, in contrast to AdTech\u2019s fast feedback cycles and rapid iterations.\n\nAt Yelp, he developed a distributed ML training system and online model inference to handle billions of training samples and efficiently ensure real-time predictions. Leveraging distributed computing tools, Niloy built a fault-tolerant system optimized for cost and performance.\n\n\u201cSince model predictions need to be served in real-time, having a model inference service that meets the SLA requirements is paramount. We applied novel model compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint of the model and thereby reduce cache misses,\u201d Niloy notes.\n\nNiloy\u2019s ability to adapt engineering principles to meet industry-specific challenges demonstrates his expertise. He blends technical skills with leadership to create high-impact AI/ML solutions in finance and advertising.\n\nBuilding large-scale AI/ML systems\n\nAI/ML systems intersect with machine learning theory and software engineering. The system should scale to large data sets, train models reliably and cost-effectively, and serve the model predictions while meeting latency requirements. All these stages must be monitored effectively to catch any degradation or bugs. The system should also support failure management and rollbacks.\n\nAn engineering team needs to leverage the right technologies and tools to automate all three stages of a machine learning system\u2014feature generation, model training, and model serving. These include distributed computing, microservices, security, and feature stores.\n\nThe design of the AI/ML system also depends upon the industry vertical and product. Typically, in credit underwriting, labels (defaults or repayments) arrive weeks, if not months, after the loans have been issued. This creates a long lag between model deployment and evaluation. Investing in a reliable experimentation platform is crucial for any company working with AI/ML models.\n\nNiloy\u2019s career reflects his ability to solve these challenges efficiently, ensuring models perform well and comply with industry standards. His expertise is building robust, high-performance systems that balance regulatory demands with technical innovation.\n\nAI/ML system quality assurance\n\nBuilding effective AI/ML systems requires careful planning, from data collection to model monitoring, based on Niloy\u2019s experience. He shares, \u201cThe first AI/ML model provides the biggest lift to the product, so it should be kept simple. This allows the engineering team to focus on infrastructure where typically more issues lie.\u201d\n\nGood data is essential\u2014ML models can only perform as well as the training data they are fed. Niloy emphasizes the importance of validating data to catch issues like missing values and shifts in distribution. Features must be cataloged with ownership if they originate from multiple sources, ensuring accountability.\n\nMonitoring is critical for maintaining performance over time. Niloy explains, \u201cAny AI/ML pipelines should invest in monitoring. The major one is checking for any training-serving skew. If the data at inference time has a different distribution than what was used for training, the model performance could not meet expectations.\u201d\n\nTo address challenges like feedback loops and skew, Niloy recommends piping inference data back into training pipelines and reusing code between training and serving environments. Testing models on holdout datasets ensures robustness beyond the original training data.\n\nWhile complex to build, these pipelines ultimately automate processes and unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nNiloy\u2019s expertise and contributions to production-scale machine learning reflect engineers' vital role in shaping the future of AI/ML across industries."

            "article_content": "\"It can be installed on a police cruiser,\" said the radar company director.\n\nHigh-tech radar used in Ukraine-Russia war to be deployed to crack Northeast drone mystery\n\nState-of-the-art drone-hunting technology being used on the battlefield in Ukraine could soon be deployed to crack the mystery behind a spate of unmanned flying objects purportedly spotted in the skies over New Jersey, New York and other Northeast cities, experts said.\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul have asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deploy the Robin Radar System to assist investigators in getting to the bottom of who is behind the alleged drones that residents and local and state officials say have been flying over communities at night since mid-November.\n\n\"I want to see a flock of Robin-like technology systems deployed across the New York city metropolitan area so we need the Department of Homeland Security to spring into action,\" Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor on Monday.\n\nThis photo provided by Brian Glenn shows what appears to be multiple drones flying over Bernardsville, N.J., Dec. 5, 2024. Brian Glenn/TMX via AP, FILE\n\nDrone sightings have also been reported in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Ohio. The Boston Police Department said Sunday that two men were arrested Saturday night after they allegedly flew a drone \"dangerously close to Logan International Airport.\"\n\nWhat is the Robin Radar System?\n\nKris Brost, general director of Robin Radar USA Inc., whose parent company is in the Netherlands, told ABC News that the development of his firm's Iris drone detection radar system evolved from its innovation in creating radar to detect flocks of birds near airports to prevent them from striking aircraft.\n\nSince 2014, the company has pivoted to developing drone-detecting technology to not only locate drones \u2013 officially designated unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u2013 but to \"classify small moving objects, whether they be drones, rotary, fixed-wing or if you just want to filter them out because you don't want to see birds or large crickets,\" Brost said.\n\nThe Robin Radas System deployed at an undisclosed location to detect drones. Robin Radar USA Inc.\n\nBrost said the Robin radar can discern drones from manned-operated aircraft, track their flying patterns in real time and beam data back to a laptop computer with a 360-degree, 3D view of the airspace in which the object is flying.\n\n\u201cBasically what a radar does is a radar bounces radio waves off of objects,\" said Brost, adding that the Robin radar can also read a drone's radio frequency: \"There\u2019s a sophisticated term called \u2018radar cross section\u2019 and that really comes down to what is that material made of, how fast is it moving, what altitude it\u2019s at, etc.\"\n\nKris Brost, director of Robin Radar USA Inc., speaks of technology to be used in cracking the mystery of the spate of drone sightings across skies in the Northeast. ABC News\n\nBrost said the radar system has a range of about 3.1 miles and can detect objects flying at an altitude of two to three kilometers, roughly between one and two miles.\n\nWhen combined with other technologies, Brost said the radar system can help investigators obtain a drone's remote identification. Brost warned, however, that operators are able to modify their drones in order to avoid detection, including removing the remote ID broadcast module.\n\n\"Even if someone is trying to skirt the system, we\u2019ll be able to detect them,\" Brost said. \"We won\u2019t tell you where the person is flying from, but we\u2019ll be able to help you track them.\"\n\nBrost said another advantage of the company's Robin system is that it's lightweight and mobile: \"it can be installed on a police cruiser or whatever you need to and be used on the move.\"\n\nOne thing his company's radar system can't do, however, is determine whether a drone has been weaponized.\n\n\"We don\u2019t necessarily look at payload,\" Brost said.\n\nBrost said that at the request of New Jersey authorities, his company sent a team to the state on Friday to assess how to best deploy the Robin radar in the investigation of the numerous alleged nighttime drone sightings.\n\nAsked if DHS has contacted his company, Brost could only say he is working with the federal government.\n\nThe FBI and DHS have deployed infrared cameras and drone detection technology to ensure that the purported drones flying over the New Jersey and New York area aren't harmful, according to a law enforcement source. Dozens of agencies have been out daily to find answers and track down any operators acting \"illegally or with nefarious intent,\" the FBI said recently.\n\nThe agencies are also looking at social media and other photos to determine what exactly is in the photos. Most of the photos and video depict manned aircraft, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nDeployed in Ukraine\n\nThe Robin Radar System has been used in the Ukraine-Russia war to aid Ukrainian military forces in locating incoming Russian weaponized drones, Brost told ABC News.\n\n\"The war in the Ukraine was really a turning point for our company based on the compelling needs they have and certainly some of the data that we\u2019ve been able to collect and implement based on that environment has been specular,\" Brost said. \"Having talked to some of the battlefield commanders, it\u2019s pretty compelling how important of a technology that it is.\"\n\nRobin Radar System workers use the technology in the field to determine in 3D where drones are detected. Robin Radar USA Inc.\n\nWhile on the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have shot the Russian drones out of the sky, Brost said.\n\n\"Here in the states, law enforcement's hands are very tied because they can't use anything to take a drone out of the sky even if they find it's nefarious or think it's nefarious,\" Brost said.\n\nThe Robin Radar System could soon be deployed to get to the bottom of the rash of drone sighting over Northeast cities. Robin Radar USA Inc.\n\nThe New Jersey State Police and FBI field office in Newark issued an advisory Monday asking the public not to take matters into their own hands. In a statement, authorities warned of \u201can increase in pilots of manned aircraft being hit in the eyes with lasers because people on the ground think they see an Unmanned Aircraft Systems. There is also a concern with people possibly firing weapons at what they believe to be a UAS but could be a manned aircraft.\"\n\n\"Public hysteria\"\n\nThe FBI has received more than 5,000 tips in the last few weeks about drone sightings in New Jersey and other states, said the statement issued jointly on Monday by DHS, the FBI, the FAA and the Department of Defense. Those tips have resulted in about 100 leads but, so far, the investigation has not found \"anything anomalous,\" nor do the drone sightings present a national security or public safety risk, the federal officials.\n\nAn assessment of the purported drone sightings, according to the joint statement, found that they reflect combined sightings of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones.\n\n\u201cMy suspicion is this is a situation that has become one where there\u2019s public hysteria that\u2019s largely due to the fact that the government did not clearly explain what was going on at first and hasn\u2019t differentiated and been as open and gotten in front of the story,\" said Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington D.C. think tank.\n\nBrost said he has examined images of drones spotted flying over New Jersey.\n\n\"I have seen pictures where I\u2019ve said, \u2018Man, that looks like a dead ringer for an aircraft.'\" Brost said. \"But I have seen some pretty compelling videos on something that just looks unexplainable.\""

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nRumor mill: Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, which spearheaded a recent push to promote Arm-based Windows, have exclusively powered laptops so far. However, new reports suggest that the company's next-generation lineup will fulfill its promise to expand into desktops following its canceled mini PC.\n\nEstablished leaker Roland Quandt believes the previously leaked follow-up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite series of CPUs is intended for desktops. Numerous laptops featuring the chips launched earlier this year running an Arm-based version of Windows, and the company aims to expand into other form factors.\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Elite (or possibly X Elite 2), codenamed Project Glymur, initially appeared in international import-export databases in late September, according to WinFuture. Hardware details are scarce, but Qualcomm previously used special housing to test the NAND and RAM chips for a new flagship processor with the model number SC8480XP.\n\nI think Qualcomm is coming for the desktop with Snapdragon \"X Elite 2\". They're testing \"Project Glymur\" SC8480XP with an AIO liquid cooler feat 120mm fan(s?), just like what you'd use in a (gaming) desktop \u2013 Roland Quandt (@rquandt.bsky.social) December 9, 2024 at 8:26 PM\n\nQuandt reports that the company has begun testing the CPU with AIO liquid coolers resembling those typically used for gaming desktops, suggesting Qualcomm is aiming for higher-end sectors. Snapdragon X Elite laptops have demonstrated modest gaming performance thus far, but seeing what they can accomplish with higher power budgets could be intriguing.\n\nThe company announced plans to bring Snapdragon to all PC form factors at a July Computex presentation but has since remained silent on the subject. Qualcomm unveiled a Snapdragon X Elite mini PC for use as a dev kit earlier in the year but abruptly ceased selling and supporting the device in October.\n\nGeekom might become the first company to release a Snapdragon X desktop. The mini PC manufacturer hasn't formally announced the device, but a leaked promo image reveals that it will be called the QS series and house the top-end X Elite CPU in an aluminum chassis.\n\nAlthough various laptop manufacturers released new models featuring Qualcomm's chips, they haven't amassed a significant presence in the overall PC market yet. Lower prices, which the company promises will come next year, could help attract customers.\n\nGenAI is a primary selling point of Snapdragon X Elite and other \"AI PC\" processors, but users have shown little interest in the technology. Instead, Qualcomm's main advantage might be longer battery life, with some laptops featuring the company's chips lasting a whole day on a single charge.\n\nThe likelihood of desktops running Windows on Arm is expected to increase with the emergence of Arm CPUs from other manufacturers. Nvidia has teased plans for one in 2025, and Arm previously stated that more clients are preparing chips."

Since the 1800s, only 6 samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jeremiah and Laura Burke produced their documentary about Pastor David Platt, they never imagined it would reach a global audience. Released in fall 2023, the film has garnered more than 100,000 views on Conversations that Matter alone, with additional viewership across other platforms.\n\nAn earlier BNG article about the documentary \u2014 The Real David Platt: The Hijacking of McLean Bible Church \u2014 has drawn tens of thousands of readers.\n\nIt is unusual for a group of laypeople to lead such a public revolt against their own church and pastor as what has happened at McLean, a five-campus nondenominational megachurch in suburban Washington, D.C. It is more unusual for laity to take their own church to court. And it is unheard of to create a two-part documentary series outlining grievances against the pastor.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what has happened at McLean Bible Church, where the arrival of David Platt as pastor in 2017 set off a chain of events not unprecedented in American churches but absolutely unprecedented in the public nature of the dispute. The disaffected members have their own website to tell their story.\n\nOne reason for the public attention is that Platt came to the pastorate from the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention International Mission Board.\n\nSome longtime McLean members did not want anything to do with the SBC because they are proudly nondenominational.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Platt and other church leaders have denied any wrongdoing and have protrayed themselves as victims of a campaign by disgruntled church members.\n\nJeremiah and Laura Burke\n\nAmong those leading the charge against Platt are Jeremiah and Laura Burke. He is a self-described \u201ctypical layman\u201d who comes from a business background in wealth management.\n\n\u201cI was a member of McLean since 2005 \u2026 just a rank-and-file member. A Christian husband and father of four children, just a regular everyday guy, nothing unique,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who David Platt was until he started speaking at McLean and became the pastor of the church.\u201d\n\nHis awareness of church politics at McLean heightened only after Platt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cIt had come to my attention that he had written a couple of books because he spoke in the summer of 2015,\u201d Burke recalled. \u201cHe had come to the church and was a guest pastor for a weekend event, and that was my first exposure to David Platt. Then it wasn\u2019t again until 2016 or 2017, when the church started transitioning out of their prior senior pastor, that David\u2019s name started coming up as being the new pastor to replace long-time pastor Lon Solomon.\u201d\n\nWhile initially open to Platt\u2019s leadership despite his admiration for Solomon, Burke\u2019s perspective began to shift by 2020.\n\n\u201cThere was a series of issues that had come to light over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen David first came on, I guess there was a gloominess over the church in a sense, in that it didn\u2019t seem like everyone was aware of what was happening but you kind of just trust your leadership. It seemed like there were some things that were just not right in the whole transition process.\u201d\n\nBurke reflected on the sudden leadership change: \u201cFor the 10 years I was at McLean, you had a solid pastor. Lon Solomon was a stalwart leader and then all of a sudden, he was gone, David came in and Lon never came back. We had been in Israel on a trip with him, he does these tours to Israel. I remember him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die in the pulpit. I\u2019m not leaving this church.'\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by Baptist News Global, Solomon provided this statement: \u201cIf you have seen Part 2 of the video series, you will see that I was removed by the elders from all operational involvement at MBC early in 2017 as a part of my separation agreement. Also, as part of my separation agreement, I am not at liberty to comment on events at MBC or David Platt.\u201d\n\nThe summer of 2020\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked a turning point, as Platt addressed racial and social issues from the pulpit, following controversy from his 2019 prayer over former President Donald Trump. McLean historically had attracted political figures, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, but Burke perceived a shift in atmosphere: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to see famous political people there. David made a story out of it. I guess a lot of people interpreted it as an apology, and that kind of riled some people up.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further complicated matters.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when COVID came up, the shutting down the church was another huge exodus of people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was problematic because everybody started going to other churches. At McLean you had to register to attend, you had to let them know you were coming.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point for Burke came when he discovered the nondenominational church\u2019s connection to the SBC, which he believed violated church bylaws prohibiting denominational affiliation. His investigation revealed McLean\u2019s involvement with the SBC of Virginia and the North American Mission Board through church planting initiatives.\n\n\u201cI just started to research whether we were part of the SBC or not,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn December 2020, at the first congregational meeting they had in person, I remember a lady asking if we were part of the denomination and David said from the pulpit no. However, that\u2019s not what I discovered.\u201d\n\nSBC church planting partnerships\n\nNot only was Platt educated and ordained by Southern Baptists and served in Southern Baptist leadership, the Bible church got involved in church planting partnerships with the SBC North American Mission Board.\n\nChurch leaders contend this partnership with the SBC \u201cwas not a secret.\u201d The SBC connection predated Platt\u2019s tenure, coordinated primarily through Clint Clifton, who Burke identifies as \u201cseemingly the genesis of this SBC relationship.\u201d\n\nThe discovery left Burke feeling betrayed: \u201cI had no idea I was a Southern Baptist. I had no idea for years that I was a Southern Baptist.\u201d\n\nThe conflict escalated to the point where Burke and his family were charged with trespassing at their own church. Determined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nDetermined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nConflict remains, as does attention\n\n\u201cI feel like I have two jobs now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally grassroots, but the amount of people who have seen it is kind of mind boggling. It\u2019s all over the world at this point; people in Romania and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have seen it. There\u2019s a gentleman who reached out from Russia asking if he could have permission to translate it into Russian and distribute it through Russia. It\u2019s been overwhelming.\u201d\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nSeven years after Platt\u2019s arrival as pastor, the dispute is not resolved and Burke and other unhappy members and former members continue to press their case. Their next target is seeking to document where tens of thousands of dollars from NAMB went because they do not believe all the named church plants even exist.\n\nChurch leaders, meanwhile, released their own investigation that stated: \u201cAfter review of numerous financial transactions associated with this partnership, we are encouraged that no improper financial transactions were discovered either during annual external audits by an independent accounting firm or during the discovery process in the lawsuit. We can say, however, that the financial transactions for the church planting partnership were sometimes confusing.\u201d\n\nThat report also said: \u201cIt is unquestionably clear that MBC did not give up any independence or cede any authority over our local church to the SBC or any other denomination. We at MBC remain committed to maintaining our autonomy and independence as a local body of believers according to our understanding of what the Bible teaches about the authority of the local church, and we are grateful that we are moving closer and closer to a day when these kinds of legal updates will no longer be necessary.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nUnderstanding the David Platt story | Analysis by Maina Mwaura\n\nDavid Platt hopes for a biblical gospel instead of an American gospel\n\nFor now, David Platt has won the battle against internal critics at McLean Bible Church\n\nDavid Platt steps up schedule to step down at IMB"

Designed by Antonio Alcala\u0301, and based on original paintings by Cochiti Pueblo artist Mateo Romero, the stamps capture four powwow dancers, set against colorful backgrounds.\n\nMORE:Christmas shipping deadlines for USPS, UPS, FedEx\n\nThe cosmos and the spiral galaxy\n\nIn a nod to humanity's ever-expanding exploration of space, the USPS will release a stamp featuring a high-definition image of a spiral galaxy located 32 million light-years from Earth. Captured by NASA\u2019s James Webb Telescope, this image has helped researchers understand the formation of stars, and the universe's early history.\n\nDesigned by USPS art director Greg Breeding, the stamp will be issued at the new Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelope rate, pending review by the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n\nStar Cluster\n\nA second stamp in the USPS\u2019s space-themed collection will feature an image of a star cluster, approximately 1,000 light-years from Earth. This celestial scene, also captured by the James Webb Space Telescope, reveals floating brown dwarfs \u2014 objects that are too small to be stars but larger than most planets.\n\nThese mysterious objects provide clues about the star-formation process in low-mass environments. Like the Spiral Galaxy stamp, this design was created by Greg Breeding and features an image from NASA and its international collaborators.\n\nIt will be issued at the Priority Mail Express Flat Rate Envelope rate, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nFreshwater fishing lures\n\nThese stamps showcase iconic freshwater fishing lures. With over 55 million anglers participating in the sport annually, these colorful stamps celebrate five lures that have become synonymous with fishing culture. The stamps feature photographs by Sarah Cramer Shields, with designs by USPS art director Greg Breeding.\n\nBattlefields of the American Revolution\n\nMarking the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolution, the USPS will release a pane of 15 stamps commemorating key moments in the fight for independence. The stamps feature watercolor illustrations of five pivotal battle scenes, along with photographs of the historic sites where these battles took place.\n\nDesigned by USPS art director Derry Noyes, the stamps feature artwork by Greg Harlin and photographs by Jon Bilous, Richard Lewis, Tom Morris, Gregory J. Parker and Kevin Stewart.\n\nUSPS plans to announce additional stamp designs in the near future. For more information and images, visit https://about.usps.com/newsroom/.\n\nCustomers may purchase stamps and other products through The Postal Store, by calling 844-737-7826, by mail through USA Philatelic or at select Post Office locations.\n\nHere are some of the stamp release dates and locations:"

            "article_content": "What combination of policies will lead to a clean energy future?\n\nA team from the universities of Basel and Geneva has assessed which policy measures provide the best incentives for green technologies.\n\nNearly 1,500 Swiss households were questioned about their reasons for opting or not opting for environmentally-friendly technologies. \u00a9 Maria Godfrida/Pixabay\n\nHow can we ensure that as many Swiss households as possible install solar panels, their own battery to store solar energy, a heat pump or adopt an electric car? Scientists from the universities of Basel and Geneva have been looking into this question. On the basis of a survey of more than 1,500 households, they were able to test which policy measures best met needs and would encourage the wider adoption of these technologies. Their findings have been published in the scientific journal Cell Reports Sustainability.\n\nClimate protection and the energy revolution must continue to make progress, and Swiss households could make a significant contribution to this goal if they would use environmentally friendly technologies such as solar panels, electric vehicles, and heat pumps.\n\nNearly two thirds of Swiss households are renters. This represents an enormous untapped potential.\n\nDr. Mart van der Kam, researcher at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Basel (UNIBAS), and at the UNIGE Institute of Environmental Sciences (ISE), and Professor Ulf Hahnel at the UNIBAS conducted research into the political measures that would be necessary to fully realize this potential.\n\n\n\nTheir team first surveyed nearly 1,500 Swiss households on why they decided for or against environmentally friendly technologies. They then fed the data into a dynamic model representing the households and their interactions as a society of decision-makers. This allowed the researchers to test which policy measures best met the needs of the households and would therefore support these technologies being more widely adopted. Their findings recently appeared in the scientific journal Cell Reports Sustainability.\n\n\n\nIndividual incentives have too little effect\n\nMart van der Kam acknowledges that increasing competition among manufacturers is making it more affordable and more attractive for consumers to adopt environmentally friendly technologies such as electric cars. However, he says that political measures are necessary to encourage more widespread use of technologies such as solar panels and heat pumps.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not individual incentives, but rather the proper mix of political measures that makes a decisive difference,\u201d he emphasizes, summarizing their findings. Subsidies for solar panels or heat pumps, for example, are just one piece of the puzzle. It is also important to remove the barriers that prevent renters from using these technologies. \u201cUntil now, the building owners have had to make the investment, but the renters have profited from the reduced energy costs,\u201d van der Kam points out. This has made the investment less worthwhile for the owners.\n\n\n\nSolutions for renters\n\nThe example of solar panels demonstrates how such hurdles for renters can be dismantled via government intervention: for several years now, renters have had the right to install solar panels on their balconies. Van der Kam suggests that policies supporting similar solutions for heat pumps or energy storage might be possible in the future, perhaps in the form of neighborhood batteries that could be supplied with solar energy from multiple buildings or an entire district at once and then used as a power source.\n\n\n\n\u201cNearly two thirds of Swiss households are renters. This represents an enormous untapped potential that could provide a major step forward toward the energy revolution,\u201d says Ulf Hahnel. He argues that interdisciplinary research that not only takes technological innovations into account, but also consumers\u2019 various preferences, can identify paths for targeted stimulus packages and structures. \u201cWe must bring different disciplines and their methods together to tackle complex and multifaceted challenges such as climate change and the energy revolution,\u201d Hahnel concludes."
