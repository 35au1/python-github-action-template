It\u2019s the largest collection of UFO sighting documents in the country, and maybe the world.\n\nNow, thanks to a partnership with Rio Rancho Public Schools, the amateur collectors who kept all these records safe over the years are finally making them available to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally overwhelming. People don\u2019t have any conception until they come here how much material that we\u2019re talking about. And it really, I think, makes people pause and realize there\u2019s a lot more to this UFO subject than I ever thought,\u201d said David Marler, executive director of the National UFO Historical Records Center.\n\nMarler knows the idea of a UFO records archive probably sounds silly to some folks, but he says that skepticism is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t care what your take is on the UFO subject. In fact, we welcome differing opinions, differing perspectives,\u201d said Marler.\n\nThe National UFO Historical Records Center is a nonprofit organizing hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents, news clippings, photos, videos and more evidence from across the globe all under one roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional historical archive dedicated to a non-traditional subject. We want serious research to be conducted here in the hopes ultimately of maybe gaining a better insight into this mystery that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for 75 plus years,\u201d said Marler.\n\nHe says there are countless connections to be discovered now that all these case files are together.\n\n\u201cSome organizations interviewed witnesses that the other did not, and vice versa, and sometimes there\u2019s new insights provided by one investigative organization that was never obtained by this one,\u201d said Marler. \u201cThe more minds, the more set of eyeballs we have looking at the data as with any subject, the better we\u2019re going to be if we truly want to try to understand what we\u2019re dealing with when we talk about UFOs.\u201d\n\nMarler\u2019s collection \u2013 which used to live inside his Rio Rancho home \u2013 is largely a collection of other collections sent in from fellow UFO archivists. With all this extra space donated by Rio Rancho Public Schools, Marler says they\u2019re ready for more.\n\n\u201cWe have about 10 to 12 other collections that are also in the queue,\u201d Marler said. \u201cTwo individuals I know in Ohio have stated, \u2018You\u2019re already in my will. If anything happens to me, my material is coming to Rio Rancho.'\u201d\n\nWhether or not you believe in aliens, Marler says the overwhelming amount of documentation is worth preserving.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important because it is an element of history, it is an element of our culture. So that\u2019s really how we try to view it,\u201d said Marler. \u201cIf we can\u2019t define the answers to the UFO mystery, maybe in 40, 50, 60, years someone might, but they can only do that by looking at the data.\u201d\n\nWhile this is a public archive, it\u2019s a not a free for all. Marler says you\u2019ll have to submit a request on their website to set up a time to come and visit. The idea is that you\u2019ll have full access to everything inside.\n\nBut why would Rio Rancho Public Schools get involved with something like this.\n\n\u201cOur students find the subject matter of UFO investigation very intriguing. And so we want to do is we want to use that as a catalyst in order to get students involved in other types of learning,\u201d said RRPS Chief Operating Officer Michael Baker. \u201cSo we think that the parents, as long as the students are learning, we\u2019re not trying to persuade thinking one way or another, we think we\u2019re going to see some really good benefits from this area.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials say the partnership is expected to last at least five years.\n\nAnother New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect."

She ultimately sought the help of a counselor. It was not until her most recent pregnancy that she also started to use an AI chatbot on the fem-tech app Soula, which she said helped with reducing depressive symptoms and reassuring her about her mental health.\n\n\"It tells me: 'Welcome back, LeRonika. Your reactions are natural,'\" said Francis, who is based in New Iberia, Louisiana.\n\nThe AI chatbot called \"Dua\" also sent her some videos that she could watch about self-hugging, a practice that could reduce stress levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I feel like Dua is there more than anything. It really showed me: OK, this is what you could do. Make sure you make time for yourself, too, because that's important as well,\" said Francis.\n\nSoula was co-founded by Natallia Miranchuk and Andrei Kulik, who conceptualized a 24/7 AI doula that could close the gap in mental health support for mothers during pregnancy and postpartum periods. Rather than replacing medical providers, apps such as Soula aim to increase broader access to maternal healthcare. Healthcare providers said that these apps could also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system, where wait times can be long and workers face burnout.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with OB/GYN doctors and doulas, who largely welcomed the rise in AI chatbots because they can make information more accessible to patients.\n\nAccording to data obtained from Sensor Tower, Soula now has more than 35,000 downloads. The startup has fundraised over $750,000 and is backed by investors such as Andrey Mikhaylyuk, the former vice president of product at Flo Health, a period tracking app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranchuk told BI that her experiences as a single mother of two and her work as a former maternity photographer inspired her to develop a supportive app for women. Initially conceptualized as a hub to connect doulas worldwide to those in need, the generative AI boom shifted the startup's focus to integrating a chatbot that could serve more populations.\n\n\"Women are shy to ask questions, even in the community, because they have the feeling that maybe 'as a mom, I should have known that, but I don't.' And she doesn't know where to go,\" Miranchuk said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe ease of customizing ChatGPT has spurred a wave of new AI-based chatbots like Soula. According to Sensor Tower, the companion apps Character.ai, Talkie, and Paradot have more than 73 million collective downloads, soaring more than 130% between 2023 and 2024. AI therapy apps such as Wysa and Woebot received over 1 million downloads, the data said.\n\nCorenia Smith, director of the Birth Justice Collaborative in Minnesota, said that while popularizing tools like chatbots can help broaden healthcare access, it is important to avoid a \"one size fits all\" and ensure that AI can reflect the communities it serves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are cultural practices that exist and have existed for thousands of years that people still use,\" Smith said. \"A human could talk about all their experience and what they've seen and give referrals. When you reach that limitation with an AI, it has to have the ability to hand over care or make a referral in a way where people don't feel dropped.\"\n\nThe role of a doula\n\nThe AI chatbot Dua aims to function like a doula, providing mothers with information about the pregnancy experience during a time of transition.\n\nDoulas are trained professionals who can provide non-medical, continuous physical, emotional, and information support for women before, during, and after childbirth, helping to reduce mental health-related morbidity for the mother and reduce infant mortality rates.\n\nAccess to doulas can be costly. While there's Medicaid coverage for doulas in several states, not all private health insurance plans cover these expenses. Long wait times and socioeconomic inequality also contribute to increased levels of stress and lack of healthcare usage among mothers and pregnant people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Traditionally, it's been something that's been available only to folks with a lot of money and a lot of resources. The people that benefit the most from doula care are those that might not trust the healthcare system,\" said Dr. Devon Rupley, an attending physician and OB/GYN specialist at NYC Health. \"That tends to be people of color who've had previously negative experiences with racism and bias that can really harm their experience in the healthcare system generally.\"\n\nRupley added that using an AI healthcare app to address basic questions can allow patients to spend higher-quality time with doctors by asking high-level questions and discussing their healthcare issues.\n\nDua is the Soula app's built-in AI chatbot. Soula\n\nHow to design an empathetic AI chatbot\n\nSoula enlisted real-life doulas to help train its chatbot and strike the right tone.\n\n\"We can't create it to be as personable as talking to a real-life person, but we can try to create that as much as possible,\" said Lexi Pacheco, a doula from Arizona who worked to help refine the dialogue in Soula's chatbot Dua. For $22 per hour, she helped improve the chatbot by using it \"hand-in-hand\" during her pregnancies, adding in her expertise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile asking questions on Google could yield more informational responses, Pacheco said mothers would want something that provided \"more of that reassurance that Google wouldn't.\"\n\nFor Armani Grant, a Soula user who became pregnant at 18, Google felt overwhelming. The chatbot allowed her to ask questions that she wouldn't feel comfortable asking her mother.\n\nPacheco said many women she's worked with reported similar experiences.\n\n\"They might even feel incompetent to ask the question, which no woman should ever feel, but with my history of working with people, they definitely tend to revert to: I'm sorry, I'm asking this question for some reason, and that might just be because of the societal pressure that more medicalized doctors have put on people that they don't give the time and day to us,\" Pacheco said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app isn't meant to completely replace a doula. Moreover, retention rates of AI healthcare chatbots can be low, said Johannes Eichstaedt, a computational social scientist and assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University. The high dropout rates for healthcare apps are \"an elephant in the room,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Pacheco said AI bots can help \"calm nerves\" and fill the gaps when patients feel they are \"bothering\" their healthcare providers.\n\n\"AI isn't like a healthcare provider to give you guidance, but it's supposed to be there to give you a little bit more comfort,\" Pacheco said."

You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Khyati Sundaram, a 39-year-old CEO of Applied based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the CEO of Applied, a recruitment platform that currently oversees the hiring processes of over 200 customers. Our hiring approach relies on skills tests rather than traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\nSince joining Applied in 2018, I've reviewed thousands of applicants' skill-based test answers, and I've noticed multiple subtleties that indicate AI was used. AI can be a powerful tool for improving efficiency and formatting, but AI-written answers often sound generic and structurally look the same.\n\nBeyond that, using AI can also strip an application of personality and diminish an applicant's ability to set themself apart among potentially thousands of other applicants. Here's how we spot AI and how it can impact the decision to hire an applicant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall details can show that an applicant has used AI\n\nI've noticed many candidates are now trying to strike a balance between using AI for inspiration while still writing their test answers themselves. In those cases, it's unlikely I, or any other person, could spot the usage of AI when looking at a piece of text in isolation.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAlso, I don't know of any AI models that can decipher human versus AI-generated content with 100% accuracy. In fact, a recent study showed large AI models falsely classifying things like the Bible and the US Constitution as AI-generated. This leaves us in a very cloudy atmosphere with no foolproof way of deciphering whether AI was used.\n\nTherefore, at Applied, we've begun utilizing a similarity detector. In this method, a human from our team compares several answers to the same question and flags any recurring similarities between syntax, paragraph structure, and language.\n\nWe've found it much easier to see patterns emerging when examining 20 to 30 applications simultaneously rather than just looking at one in isolation. After doing countless rounds of similarity detecting, we've found that it's often small details, like formatting and punctuation, that giveaway an applicant's usage of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDead giveaways AI was used\n\nWe've found that text is more likely to be AI-generated if every word in a sentence is capitalized or if there are unnecessary capital letters in phrases.\n\nAI-written text also tends to generate extra punctuation that doesn't read in the way people speak. I've also noticed, when examining multiple applications for a specific role, a lot of AI-assisted r\u00e9sum\u00e9s have the exact same number of headings, paragraphs, and bullets.\n\nSometimes using AI to complete an application isn't a big deal\n\nWe give power to the human reviewer to decide whether each application is worth flagging for AI, and even then, we won't automatically reject someone if one person believes AI was used. It's a lot more nuanced.\n\nI believe in the power of the crowd, so if someone flags a skills-test answer, we'll have other team members review it and come to a collective decision that considers the candidate's entire application and skillset. We allow for a lot of control and debate within each hiring team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's important to mention that many organizations operate in different ways. They may not mind the use of AI, or they might discard an applicant entirely if there is even suspicion that AI was used.\n\nAI isn't going anywhere, so use it to your advantage\n\nI believe that AI will continue to be used in applications. I've had conversations with several people on the job hunt who've told me they use AI to even out the power dynamic between themselves and employers, many of whom use AI in their own hiring processes. I think that's fair. But, if you're going to use it, use it well.\n\nLarge language models like GPT are great at synthesizing information, writing concisely, and creating structure, which can be incredibly useful for candidates whose native language isn't English or who aren't fluent. People applying to software engineer and data science roles might be asked to use AI during practical tests. In these cases, don't be afraid to put your digital skills on show.\n\nOverall, rather than use AI to complete job applications, I advise candidates to use AI to help identify the key skills and attributes that hiring managers will be looking for. Run the job description through ChatGPT, and ask it to summarise and share examples of relevant skills and how they might be used in practice. This valuable information can then be used to inform your own responses to application and interview questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you're an employer who would like to share your experience with AI in the hiring process, email Tess Martinelli at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com."

        "source": "TechCrunch",
        "article_content": "In a pitch to investors last spring, Anthropic said it intended to build AI to power virtual assistants that could perform research, answer emails, and handle other back-office jobs on their own. The company referred to this as a \u201cnext-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching\u201d \u2014 one it believed that could, if all goes according to plan, automate large portions of the economy someday.\n\nIt took a while, but that AI is starting to arrive.\n\nAnthropic on Tuesday released an upgraded version of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model that can understand and interact with any desktop app. Via a new \u201cComputer Use\u201d API, now in open beta, the model can imitate keystrokes, button clicks, and mouse gestures, essentially emulating a person sitting at a PC.\n\n\u201cWe trained Claude to see what\u2019s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \u201cWhen a developer tasks Claude with using a piece of computer software and gives it the necessary access, Claude looks at screenshots of what\u2019s visible to the user, then counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor in order to click in the correct place.\u201d\n\nDevelopers can try out Computer Use via Anthropic\u2019s API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI platform. The new 3.5 Sonnet without Computer Use is rolling out to Claude apps, and brings various performance improvements over the outgoing 3.5 Sonnet model.\n\nAutomating apps\n\nA tool that can automate tasks on a PC is hardly a novel idea. Countless companies offer such tools, from decades-old RPA vendors to newer upstarts like Relay, Induced AI, and Automat.\n\nIn the race to develop so-called \u201cAI agents,\u201d the field has only become more crowded. AI agents remains an ill-defined term, but it generally refers to AI that can automate software.\n\nSome analysts say AI agents could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars that they\u2019re pouring into AI. Companies seem to agree: According to a recent Capgemini survey, 10% of organizations already use AI agents and 82% will integrate them within the next three years.\n\nSalesforce made splashy announcements about its AI agent tech this summer, while Microsoft touted new tools for building AI agents yesterday. OpenAI, which is plotting its own brand of AI agents, sees the tech as a step toward super-intelligent AI.\n\nAnthropic calls its take on the AI agent concept an \u201caction-execution layer\u201d that lets the new 3.5 Sonnet perform desktop-level commands. Thanks to its ability to browse the web (not a first for AI models, but a first for Anthropic), 3.5 Sonnet can use any website and any application.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s new AI can control apps on a PC. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\n\u201cHumans remain in control by providing specific prompts that direct Claude\u2019s actions, like \u2018use data from my computer and online to fill out this form\u2019,\u201d an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cPeople enable access and limit access as needed. Claude breaks down the user\u2019s prompts into computer commands (e.g. moving the cursor, clicking, typing) to accomplish that specific task.\u201d\n\nSoftware development platform Replit has used an early version of the new 3.5 Sonnet model to create an \u201cautonomous verifier\u201d that can evaluate apps while they\u2019re being built. Canva, meanwhile, says that it\u2019s exploring ways in which the new model might be able to support the designing and editing process.\n\nBut how is this any different than the other AI agents out there? It\u2019s a reasonable question. Consumer gadget startup Rabbit is building a web agent that can do things like buying movie tickets online; Adept, which was recently acqui-hired by Amazon, trains models to browse websites and navigate software; and Twin Labs is using off-the-shelf models, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, to automate desktop processes.\n\nAnthropic claims the new 3.5 Sonnet is simply a stronger, more robust model that can do better on coding tasks than even OpenAI\u2019s flagship o1, per the SWE-bench Verified benchmark. Despite not being explicitly trained to do so, the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet self-corrects and retries tasks when it encounters obstacles, and can work toward objectives that require dozens or hundreds of steps.\n\nThe new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model\u2019s performance on various benchmarks. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nBut don\u2019t fire your secretary just yet.\n\nIn an evaluation designed to test an AI agent\u2019s ability to help with airline booking tasks, like modifying a flight reservation, the new 3.5 Sonnet managed to complete less than half of the tasks successfully. In a separate test involving tasks like initiating a return, 3.5 Sonnet failed roughly a third of the time.\n\nAnthropic admits the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet struggles with basic actions like scrolling and zooming, and that it can miss \u201cshort-lived\u201d actions and notifications because of the way it takes screenshots and pieces them together.\n\n\u201cClaude\u2019s Computer Use remains slow and often error-prone,\u201d Anthropic writes in its post. \u201cWe encourage developers to begin exploration with low-risk tasks.\u201d\n\nRisky business\n\nBut is the new 3.5 Sonnet capable enough to be dangerous? Possibly.\n\nA recent study found that models without the ability to use desktop apps, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, were willing to engage in harmful \u201cmulti-step agent behavior,\u201d such as ordering a fake passport from someone on the dark web, when \u201cattacked\u201d using jailbreaking techniques. Jailbreaks led to high rates of success in performing harmful tasks even for models protected by filters and safeguards, according to the researchers.\n\nOne can imagine how a model with desktop access could wreak more havoc \u2014 say, by exploiting app vulnerabilities to compromise personal info (or storing chats in plaintext). Aside from the software levers at its disposal, the model\u2019s online and app connections could open avenues for malicious jailbreakers.\n\nAnthropic doesn\u2019t deny that there\u2019s risk in releasing the new 3.5 Sonnet. But the company argues that the benefits of observing how the model is used in the wild ultimately outweigh this risk.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s far better to give access to computers to today\u2019s more limited, relatively safer models,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThis means we can begin to observe and learn from any potential issues that arise at this lower level, building up computer use and safety mitigations gradually and simultaneously.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Anthropic\n\nAnthropic also says it has taken steps to deter misuse, like not training the new 3.5 Sonnet on users\u2019 screenshots and prompts, and preventing the model from accessing the web during training. The company says it developed classifiers to \u201cnudge\u201d 3.5 Sonnet away from actions perceived as high-risk, such as posting on social media, creating accounts, and interacting with government websites.\n\nAs the U.S. general election nears, Anthropic says it is focused on mitigating election-related abuse of its models. The U.S. AI Safety Institute and U.K. Safety Institute, two separate but allied government agencies dedicated to evaluating AI model risk, tested the new 3.5 Sonnet prior to its deployment.\n\nAnthropic told TechCrunch it has the ability to restrict access to additional websites and features \u201cif necessary,\u201d to protect against spam, fraud, and misinformation, for example. As a safety precaution, the company retains any screenshots captured by Computer Use for at least 30 days \u2014 a retention period that might alarm some devs.\n\nWe asked Anthropic under which circumstances, if any, it would hand over screenshots to a third party (e.g. law enforcement) if asked. A spokesperson said that the company would \u201ccomply with requests for data in response to valid legal process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no foolproof methods, and we will continuously evaluate and iterate on our safety measures to balance Claude\u2019s capabilities with responsible use,\u201d Anthropic said. \u201cThose using the computer-use version of Claude should take the relevant precautions to minimize these kinds of risks, including isolating Claude from particularly sensitive data on their computer.\u201d\n\nHopefully, that\u2019ll be enough to prevent the worst from occurring.\n\nA cheaper model\n\nToday\u2019s headliner might\u2019ve been the upgraded 3.5 Sonnet model, but Anthropic also said an updated version of Haiku, the cheapest, most efficient model in its Claude series, is on the way.\n\nClaude 3.5 Haiku, due in the coming weeks, will match the performance of Claude 3 Opus, once Anthropic\u2019s state-of-the-art model, on certain benchmarks at the same cost and \u201capproximate speed\u201d of Claude 3 Haiku.\n\n\u201cWith low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data\u2013like purchase history, pricing, or inventory data,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post.\n\n3.5 Haiku will initially be available as a text-only model and later as part of a multimodal package that can analyze both text and images.\n\n3.5 Haiku\u2019s benchmark performance. Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nSo once 3.5 Haiku is available, will there be much reason to use 3 Opus? What about 3.5 Opus, 3 Opus\u2019 successor, which Anthropic teased back in June?\n\n\u201cAll of the models in the Claude 3 model family have their individual uses for customers,\u201d the Anthropic spokesperson said. \u201cClaude 3.5 Opus is on our roadmap and we\u2019ll be sure to share more as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

        "article_content": "In the fanfare surrounding generative AI, and in particular its ability to write software, I wondered if low code application development platforms were set to be negatively disrupted. But at last week\u2019s annual conference, low code pioneer OutSystems and its senior leadership did more than strike a positive note; they are confident that generative AI is going to be the making of low code.\n\nIn keeping with major tech vendor events in 2024, OutSystems NextStep Experience in Amsterdam was the showcase for the firm to announce an AI-driven tool. Dubbed Mentor, this application aims to allow organizations to develop applications and AI agents. Mentor, which will be available in early 2025, uses AI to generate applications and AI agents and is therefore in keeping with the Low Code application development heritage of OutSystems.\n\nDemand for Generative AI is changing the economic dynamics of enterprise applications, according to CEO and founder Paulo Rosado. In an interview, he told diginomica that the mantra of buy, don\u2019t build is going to be challenged by generative AI software development and that his company has the toolset to enable CIOs to drop that mantra:\n\nThe risk is so low, you have the opportunity to clean up your digital platforms.\n\nAccording to Rosado, the major software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms have taken the place of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) technologies that become immovable monoliths in the business:\n\nBefore it was SAP, Siebel, and PeopleSoft, then they got replaced by SaaS, which they have become the monoliths.\n\nERP became synonymous with over-customization and then complex and costly maintenance for the CIO, whilst the move to SaaS platforms ushered in an era of standardized business processes. Process conventions are ideal for run-of-the-mill business operations, but these don\u2019t deliver a competitive advantage; in addition, some digital leaders are finding data and cost lock-in from the SaaS platforms is prohibitive to efficiency and innovation. These trends are feeding Roasado\u2019s confidence:\n\nYou can build what you want, with no lock-in risk. The big difference is that there is no shifting the blame to the business because they changed their mind because the cost of change is so cheap. It is expected and it is acceptable to change your mind.\n\nAsked if there was any concern in the low code community towards generative AI, Rosado says:\n\nFor us Generative AI is another capability in our first principle, that you shouldn\u2019t need to take ages to build something.\n\nOn stage in his keynote, Rosado described the empowerment generative AI is giving low code as:\n\nWe are on the verge of an economic shift from buy to build. As we replace these monoliths and SaaS and chop them into small incremental applications or enthuse them with generative AI agents. The conversation with our business peers, the CEO, CFO and COO will change. It takes away a lot of the anxiety of what the future looks like. For us, if you want to be truly agile, you need a small collection of agile apps so you don\u2019t end up with tech debt.\n\nBuilding Mentor\n\nCentral to this confidence was the unveiling of Mentor, which they describe as a software development lifecycle digital worker that uses AI for app building, delivery and monitoring using low code. OutSystems customers will have seen Mentor on the horizon through Project Morpheus over recent years. Using AI, Mentor automates code quality checks, builds a minimum viable product (MVP), carries out governance, and OutSystems claims to increase developer productivity, a subject that concerns a growing number of CTOs.\n\nOn stage, OutSystems Chief Product and Technology Office (CPTO) Luis Blando uploaded a requirements document into Mentor and created an order management system for an automotive dealer in minutes, with the technology even identifying that the requirements document had not added a stage for order cancellations. Rosado says:\n\nUsers simply describe the App they need or their vision, and Mentor generates an initial version with front-end functionality, data models, and embedded business logic. By automating App prototyping and ensuring best-in-class code quality.\n\nOutSystems claims that the combination of Low Code and Generative AI will prevent the build-up of orphaned and poor code and ensure the CIO has transparency and explainability from their use of AI. Adding that Mentor will become part of the OutSystems Developer Cloud platform. Blando said on stage:\n\nThis means all the apps are bespoke to you, reliable and yours in every which way. Developers building on our platforms are at a much higher level of abstraction which has 20 years of experience, and Mentor is no different. Mentor can create proven abstraction models, it can therefore handle more complex and larger applications.\n\nIn our interview, Rosado added:\n\nGenerative AI has shown that these gigantic manual coding practices are a thing of the past. Our community has built 100,000 applications, so we know what good looks like, and we can import that knowledge and have Mentor act like some of the top subject matter experts, it can be a co-pilot. We see AI as a fundamental factor that allows us to take something that is already fast into a new level of speed. We have been compressing four-year projects down to seven or 14 months and projects of a year and a half to four months.\n\nAI agents are a hot topic for the vendors at present, and OutSystems has their take on the trend, on stage Rosado said Mentor will:\n\nEnable enterprises to harness Generative AI and enthuse new agents into the middle of their traditional software.\n\nThey claim Mentor will increase the speed that digital teams can implement AI abilities such as natural language understanding to applications and processes.\n\nLow code\u2019s moment\n\nAsked if there was any risk of AI overshadowing Low Code, Rosado says:\n\nGenerative AI allows us to concentrate on the functions of the business.\n\nAnd on developers, he says:\n\nA low code developer has the skill set to understand the business, user experience, and workflows. The people that are really successful in the OutSystems community often come with a care for the outcome. They want to get stuff done, and these tools elevate our community.\n\nAs a result, OutSystem believes generative AI will give low code its moment in the sun as organizations focus on digital business outcomes. In his keynote, Rosado said:\n\nThis allows us to address the imperative from the board - what are you doing with generative AI? You will have an ecosystem that is agile and the capability so that anyone in the business can ask for a new product line, or the regulations change and be ahead; this builds agility.\n\nMy take\n\nThe proof will be in the adoption of Mentor, and this time next year, I look forward to discussing with end user CIOs and CTOs about the business outcomes delivered by Mentor."

Maybe.\n\nSusan Crane, a program manager for the Oak Park Park District, won\u2019t say what\u2019s there, but evidently it was enough to hire a team of paranormal investigators to find out exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\nAnd they\u2019re inviting interested spectators to join them on a \u201cthrilling journey through the dimly lit corridors and eerie rooms of this renowned estate, rumored to be a hotspot for supernatural activity,\u201d according to materials provided by the Park District.\n\nOn Friday, anyone over 21 can see, feel or hear for themselves what all lurks in the old home during a Park District event featuring paranormal experts Other Side Investigations.\n\nCrane said it will be OSI\u2019s first investigation for the Park District, though they\u2019ve been active in the Midwest for years. The team has been on site for preliminary inspection, however and Crane hosted another Pleasant Home ghost investigation a few years ago. But she\u2019s keeping mum about whatever she learned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say a word,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put any ideas into anybody\u2019s head. And when they came to look at the house, I didn\u2019t say anything. I can tell you one thing \u2014 there\u2019s nothing harmful or evil or anything like that. That\u2019s as specific as I want to get.\u201d\n\nThe event, listed on the Park District\u2019s website, has been a hot ticket item, with almost all 50 spots already gone \u2014 Crane said only about eight $50 tickets remain. At the very least, visitors are guaranteed a snack, a beverage and a tour of one of the oldest and grandest addresses in Oak Park.\n\nCrane said she wanted the event to be, above all, a fun night out for people. A chance to see friends, see history and tour a beautiful, restored local property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old house, it was built in 1897,\u201d Crane said. \u201cWe manage two homes; both are over 100 years old. This is another way to make the patrons engaged and see the historic houses. The Pleasant Home is one of the earliest examples of prairie style architecture in the country, so it\u2019s well-known to architecture buffs and the tour is another way for people to enjoy the home.\u201d\n\nVisitors will also get to learn a bit more about what it takes to detect the paranormal. The OSI team will divide the 50 people into two or three smaller groups and introduce attendees to their gear first \u2014 equipment to measure light, temperature, noise and more.\n\n\u201cThere is a science behind it, it\u2019s not just them talking about what they feel and what they may or may not see,\u201d Crane said.\n\nFrom there the tour will continue through the home, room by room, looking, listening and feeling things that just aren\u2019t right, maybe a cold spot, a strange, sudden bump or maybe a slight glimmer in a mirror, a face in the shadow something fleeting something you\u2019re sure you saw and you hope was caught on film.\n\nWhatever happens, Crane is ready for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think when we\u2019ve done it in the past, it\u2019s been really well received and I\u2019m looking forward to Friday night.\u201d\n\nAnd who knows. Maybe the house is looking forward to the visit, too.\n\nJesse Wright is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press."

Brittany Fournier photo\n\nclick to enlarge Slevin uses every device and method in his and his team's toolbox to find out what's really going down. Bill Slevin photo\n\nWhen world-famous paranormal investigator Bill Slevin spoke during our interview about ghosts and demons, the recording device on my computer started to skip around. Listening back on our conversation, portions became fuzzy, especially as he spoke about exorcisms. The hair stood up on my neck, but the Coral Springs resident was such a compelling storyteller that it was hard to stop chatting.Slevin has been investigating these unknown forces for 35 years but has experienced paranormal events his whole life. Growing up in the 1970s and '80s, nobody talked about supernatural things. \"I never knew what an empath was. I just knew I would go places and feel weird things,\" he recalls. As an empath, he felt other people's emotions and sometimes carried them with him. As a kid, he was also into horror movies and was never scared \u2014 except when he sawHe was curious about paranormal experiences and started to research everything he could about them. He went on to get his PhD in parapsychology and metaphysical humanistic science and has studied quantum physics and mechanics.The first of his more than 1,000 residential haunting jobs was in 1989. A friend brought him in on a frightening investigation. \"Demons are very rare; it's not like TV,\" he says. \"It happened to be a rare demonic case. The guy with me got full-on attacked. That team never did this again, but it gave me a million questions.\" He realized this was his calling. \"I really wanted to know what was real and what was not,\" Slevin says.He and his team at the nonprofit Paranormal Existence Research Society (PERS) are based out of Coral Springs, with teams in other Florida cities, Georgia, Nebraska, the UK, Italy, and Greece. They don't charge people for their work \u2014 it's all free \u2014 but if someone out of state wants to work with them, they will let them pay for travel. \"We don't feel it's ethical [to charge] because it's not 100 percent science.\" His team is a diverse group of talents and includes a Peruvian shaman, hypnotherapist, licensed psychologist, mediums, and psychics.\"We're a mix of intuition and science,\" he says. \"We help these people no matter what.\" That includes people who are suffering from mental illness or substance use issues. Slevin works a day job as an IT director for a psychiatric drug and alcohol treatment facility, which has provided him with the knowledge to identify when clients are suffering from these issues and not an actual haunting.When they first get asked to investigate, the team interviews the clients. If they take the case, they go to the homes at night using a combination of his empath abilities and certain devices. \"Being IT and paranormal \u2014 a very bad mix,\" he jokes. \"I have a ridiculous amount of equipment.\" They experiment with audio and video tools and observe environmental cues with a healthy amount of skepticism. They first assess to see if there are natural causes for the experiences of the clients, like animals in the walls, and they determine if it's a case of the paranormal.\"Everything is energy. When you die, your energy doesn't die. Energy can't be destroyed or created,\" he says. The most common thing his team finds is residual hauntings, in which a person leaves behind energy. He remembers a haunting incident in New Jersey when a client in an old house said that every day at 7 p.m., they heard footsteps up the stairs. The team heard them but couldn't connect with a spirit. It was likely, he says, a \"footprint\" left by someone who passed that walked there daily. The solution? To cleanse the area is something his team teaches people to do for themselves. \"Anybody can wave sage around the house, and it's not going to do anything. It's your intention [that matters],\" and even then, energy can return.To cleanse or protect themselves and their clients, they respect the religious and spiritual beliefs of the people they're helping. If someone is Jewish, for instance, they won't come in waving crucifixes. Unless, that is, if they suspect it's a demonic entity, then they'll use everything in their arsenal to protect themselves.It's usually not anything that sinister. Even funky energy from living clients can cause hauntings. \"Sometimes people can watch five hours of, and now they're panicked, and they can actually manifest stuff to the house. It might not be real.\" He says parapsychology studies have shown that \"a lot of Poltergeist activity is caused by teenagers. That their energy shift is so strong, especially females, that it can actually make things move,\" he says. \"It's not going to pick up a couch and throw it across the room.\"In South Florida, you may not have very old houses, but there are a lot of Indigenous American burial grounds. He used to bring new members of his team to Belgrade, Florida, where there was a 280-acre abandoned prison in the middle of a sugarcane field. \"Because you can say you're into this, but when you're in an abandoned prison at two o'clock in the morning, there's a lot of activity in that place,\" he says. There's now a warehouse built in that spot. \"If they'd built houses there, I'd be going door to door to drop off my card.\"Slevin educates the public about issues related to the supernatural. He's the director and manager of the Warren Legacy Foundation for Paranormal Research, founded by Lorraine Warren and Chris McKinnell, the grandson of Ed and Lorraine Warren, who investigated the Amityville haunting. He speaks as a celebrity guest at conferences and has appeared on TV, radio, podcasts, magazines, and newspapers. He's been on the cover ofmagazine five times.He also spoke about demonology on the Travel Channel documentary, which also streams on Discovery+ and Max. It explores a possible mass possession at the Miami Aerospace Academy High School in 1970. Students ripped doors off the hinges, one girl levitated, and another boy jumped out of the second-floor window unscathed, landing face-first on the concrete and then threw the security guard across the parking lot. The interviewing process unnerved him because when the producers asked specific demonology questions, he didn't want to share any misinformation with the public. He says they're very real but very rare.Slevin will speak at upcoming events at the Coconut Grove and Coral Springs libraries. At his library shows, you can hear more of Slevin's spooky stories, learn about haunted places in South Florida, and see evidence that the paranormal is actually quite normal."

        "article_content": "The city of Pueblo is said to be home to a number of ghosts, apparitions, and other unexplained phenomena.\n\nFrom a handprint that mysteriously appears in a fire museum window and a house said to have hosted satanic rituals and animal sacrifices, to mysterious mists at the old Pueblo Honor Farm and more unexplained phenomena, the Home of Heroes is also home to many ghost stories.\n\nPueblo's Honor Farm is home to paranormal phenomena, dark history\n\nThe Honor Farm, located on a stretch of land from 11th to 13th streets near Pueblo Boulevard, was purchased by the Colorado State Insane Asylum in 1879 to serve as a dairy farm for patients to work on.\n\nAccording to coloradourbanlegends.com, at least one satanic sacrifice allegedly occurred on the abandoned asylum's grounds, leading to apparitions and ghostly sightings.\n\n\"Even today, those visiting the grounds of the asylum at night hear the screams and see apparitions of children in all directions, only to fade if sought after,\" according to Colorado Urban Legends' website. \"Many of those seeking to experience the spirits there have seen a black goat approaching them from out of a low, thick mist that seems to come out of nowhere, only to disappear before it reaches them.\"\n\nA variety of unexplained phenomena such as mist, orbs, and voices have been reported by southern Colorado paranormal investigators.\n\nGold Dust Saloon\n\nA bustling bar offering burgers and brews, the Gold Dust may seem unsuspecting to the average Puebloan out for a night on the town, but the grounds have an allegedly dark history with a haunting to match.\n\nThe saloon opened in 1984 at 130 S. Union Ave., and was later moved to 217 S. Union Ave. where it stands today.\n\nOutside the building stood the old hanging tree, a site with its own grim urban legend: on the boughs of the tall tree, legend has it many convicted criminals were hanged for their crimes in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nAccording to various historical accounts, 14 people were hanged from different branches of the tree at different times. At least one account put the number of people hanged at 16, although other accounts debate if anyone was actually hanged there at all, the Chieftain reported in 2019.\n\nAllegedly, those who died on the hanging tree continue to haunt the saloon to this day.\n\nA paranormal investigation of the restaurant was conducted in 2017 by Last Rites Paranormal Investigators, a group that has been investigating since 1998 in many locations, both private homes and businesses.\n\nDuring an investigation, Christopher Lucero and his team, usually composed of three to five people, set up equipment, ask questions, and record for intelligent responses, apparitions, and other paranormal activity, Lucero said. The team also looks for natural occurrences that may debunk their findings, such as noisy pipes, animal activity, or other explanations.\n\n\"We always try to debunk our own findings as much as we can,\" Lucero said. \"We don't jump to saying 'That's a ghost' when really it could have just been like a pipe or something.\"\n\nIn an investigation of the Gold Dust Saloon, Lucero stated the team recorded small orbs in pictures, as well as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), such as a child saying \"help\" twice.\n\nLucero also recalled feeling a presence at the saloon, although he stated he was not a psychic and relied on his equipment for results.\n\nThe Cortner House and reports of hauntings on the St. Charles Mesa\n\nThe Cortner House on Cortner Road past 27th Lane was demolished more than 20 years ago, but once was a destination for paranormal activity, the Chieftain reported in 2021.\n\nLocal urban legend has it that the abandoned house was haunted, mostly with spirits of those who'd died there and some who'd allegedly been sacrificed.\n\nLegend says that teenagers looking for a scare would participate in \"satanic rituals\" in the house, sacrificing live animals in hopes of summoning the entities that haunted the house.\n\nOne urban legend tells of an apparition of a legless, white dog with red eyes that supposedly can be seen hovering about in the area where the house stood.\n\nAnother story from the St. Charles Mesa and Vineland tells of a girl dressed in a hospital gown who will appear on the roads east of Pueblo. The girl is said to appear in the backseats of drivers who pass her on the road, hitching a ride before disappearing again.\n\nPueblo Central High School home to unexplained phenomena\n\nFormer Central High School drama teacher Elizabeth \"Bebe\" Mestas and her husband Richard told the Chieftain in 2017 about haunted phenomena in the high school's historic grounds.\n\nThe couple told the Chieftain about the theater's alleged haunting by a former drama teacher, Mary Richardson, who appeared as an apparition sitting in a chair in the theater where she used to sit to observe rehearsals.\n\nAlong with that ghost, the sounds of kids chattering and other unexplained phenomena could often be heard in the halls late at night, and on at least one occasion, an apparition appeared in the locked theater sound booth, the Mestas family said.\n\nSometimes, lights would also flicker, and equipment occasionally refused to function properly.\n\nStonemoor Hills haunted by goat-like specter\n\nStonemoor Hills, a residential area on the south side of Pueblo, is said to be haunted after a past murder. Some legends say the spirit that haunts the area is a goat-like creature called \"The Goat Man.\"\n\nDuring an October 2008 investigation, Last Rites captured the strongest EVP they've recorded, Lucero said.\n\n\"We got two different voices,\" Lucero recalled. \"One of them said, 'When?' and the other said, 'Right now.' Nothing happened to us but it sounded like they were planning something.\"\n\nLucero said during investigations, paranormal investigators commonly capture EVP, most often saying \"Help me\" or \"Get out.\"\n\nFire Station 3 Hose Museum sees truck moving by itself, ghostly handprint\n\nThe Hose Co. No. 3. Fire Museum, located at 116 Broadway Ave., is said to be helplessly haunted.\n\nStories tell of a fog that covers an upstairs window and a permanent handprint that can be seen in the fog. In 2005, a replica of a vintage fire engine was left idling outside and reportedly began moving by itself and made several turns, all with no driver in sight, as reported by the Boulder County Paranormal Research Society during a 2008 investigation.\n\nThe former firehouse was built in 1895 and was served by horse-drawn firefighting equipment for the first 20 years of its use. It now serves as a museum that honors the history of Pueblo first responders.\n\nIn a 2023 investigation, Last Rites investigators stated that while they were unable to record any EVPs or visible apparitions, electromagnetic field detectors, meant to detect changes in electromagnetic signatures resulting from the appearance of entities, went off several times, which Lucero stated was an indicator of possible ghosts in the building.\n\nPioneer Cemetery said to be haunted\n\nWhile Pioneer Cemetery Association President Joe Talbott confirmed that he has heard rumors of hauntings and apparitions at Pioneer Cemetery, he stated that he has personally never seen anything unexplainable.\n\nThe cemetery was established in 1870 and houses the graves of some of Pueblo's earliest residents.\n\n\"I know there has been a group go through, paranormal researchers, and apparently they found evidence 8-10 years ago,\" said Talbott. \"I wanted them to send me the information when they got done but they never did.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything or heard anything myself,\" Talbott emphasized. \"It's a nice, quiet, peaceful place.\" Talbott has led the association since 1997.\n\nSpooky season things to do in Pueblo:Ghost hunts, haunted houses and other spooky events to check out in Pueblo this October\n\nQuestions, comments, or story tips?

        "article_content": "ABOVE: Gender bias and workplace toxicity fuel mental health deterioration and drive many mid-career female scientists out of academia. \u00a9 iSTOCK,useng\n\nEmbracing change is never easy. The hills and valleys of life are often defining moments, serving as a catapult for growth. In academia, like all other aspects of life, course correction takes courage. An increasing number of successful mid-career scientists grapple with the difficult decision to leave academia for greener pastures, with almost 50 percent leaving within ten years of publishing their first paper.1 Universities are losing their top talent as scientists confront waning motivation, misaligned ideals, workplace toxicity, inequalities, poor work-life balance, clinical burnout, and mental health deterioration.2\u20135 For some, the process between the first niggling of discontent to the first step out of the ivory tower is long, arduous, and fraught with guilt. For others, it is a natural career trajectory towards new measures of success and growth opportunities.\n\nFalling Out of Tune in Academia\n\nGreg Tietjen, chief executive officer of Revalia Bio, lives life like a jazz musician, riffing off opportunities that bridge the many facets of his existence. Tietjen, who also happens to be a jazz guitarist, is a biophysicist/biomedical engineer with a faculty position at Yale University until recently. \u201cI grew up with a deep love and passion for science. I loved space and astrophysics; it was like a bridge to a world beyond the one I was in,\u201d Tietjen said. After high school, he completed an English degree and considered becoming a writer, so that he could translate the complexities of the human experience.\n\nImprovisation and the Path to Self Discovery\n\nGreg Tietjen is both a cofounder and the chief executive officer of Revalia Bio. Yale University\n\nTietjen also played guitar in college, a passion that intensified after graduating, but a physical impairment prevented him from pursuing a musical career. \u201cI was at my wit's end and starting to think about what I should do with my life when fate intervened.\u201d A fall while playing soccer changed the trajectory of Tietjen\u2019s life. One shattered elbow and several surgeries later, he was told he may never hold a guitar again, let alone earn a living from it. Tietjen described receiving the news as \u201ca huge relief.\u201d He recalled lying in his hospital bed contemplating his next move: \u201cI will turn the page; I'm not giving up, but I have to do something different.\u201d He revisited his childhood love of science and mapped out the path to a scientific academic career, starting with an undergraduate degree in physics, followed by a graduate degree in biophysics, and eventually a faculty position.\n\nTietjen pursued a career in translational science, intent on using his skills and knowledge to help patients. \u201cI was missing the humanities part of my brain, that feeling of connection to purpose,\u201d Tietjen said. He joined a clinical department at Yale University and excelled at the challenges of establishing and growing his lab, including securing National Institutes of Health funding and other milestones of professorship. \u201cIt was amazing. The plan I had laid out for myself in the hospital bed came true. It was really profound.\u201d\n\nDissonant Chords\n\nAs Tietjen climbed the academic ranks, he felt a dissonance between his identity as a professor and his inner sense of purpose. The rigors and monotony of academic responsibilities dampened the sparks of passion and inspiration. \u201cYou start to get pulled in all these other directions,\u201d Tietjen said. \u201cTo make that leap from where I was about to get promoted to associate professor, I'd have to jump through additional hurdles, and from there [to becoming a] tenured professor. I didn't feel the motivation to do all that.\u201d Working in an academic setting also limited the type of translational research that interested Tietjen. He began to feel that leaving academia would put him in a better position to derive more immediate satisfaction from his work and to align more closely with his identity and world view. Driven strongly by the need to feel happy and fulfilled in his work, Tietjen soon began considering alternative career paths.\n\nFear keeps people in this loop of dissatisfaction. It's scary to prioritize happiness over certainty and make a choice to walk away from it all to create something even better.\n\n\u2013 Greg Tietjen, Revalia Bio\n\nAfter 10 years as a postdoctoral fellow and faculty member, Tietjen left academia in the same way he entered, with a jazz performer\u2019s knack for fearlessly traversing the next improvisational bridge towards self discovery. \u201cI wouldn't say that I got burned out. Part of what has allowed me to jump through different fields is this intuition around realizing my full potential,\u201d Tietjen said. He saw burnout often amongst his colleagues though, and attributes this to a disconnect between what academics would like to achieve and what they can accomplish when their energy is distributed in many different directions. \u201cI'm not one to judge or demonize the institutions I've been a part of which have unlocked so much potential for me, but I think what can happen in these large organizations is that things become harder than they need to be. Friction builds up over time, and people get tired of losing that energy to the environment instead of seeing the forward momentum [of their research].\u201d\n\nFinding Resonance\n\nTietjen views his academic journey as a process of self discovery and growth. \u201cThere was something deeper I was meant to do. When I saw that I felt like I didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said. Tietjen cofounded Revalia Bio, a startup that builds on his academic work. Free from the constraints of pursuing translational research in an academic environment, he was able to align more closely with the scientific passions that motivated him. Tietjen\u2019s company runs human organ trials using resuscitated donor organs, which are sustained outside the body with perfusion machines like those used in clinical settings. \u201cIt's like a reinvented version of a first-in-human clinical trial. Now you can do experiments that you could never do in any other setting, on the real human system,\u201d Tietjen said. He hopes this work will transform patient care and create a profoundly impactful legacy for organ donors and their families. Tietjen described the immediacy of this work as deeply satisfying. \u201cWe receive this incredibly precious gift of a human organ. My promise to that donor family and to every physician that has enabled this is that we're going to drive massive impact, not just write papers and win awards and grants. It has to change the experience of patients and care providers.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tietjen, humans best thrive when they align with their deep drivers of joy. Trying different things and seeing what resonated helped Tietjen understand what made him happy. \u201cWe don't focus on helping people find the resonance, as much as we do setting standards everyone has to follow,\u201d he explained. Tietjen described the fear of change as a significant challenge for both scientists and organizations. \u201cFear keeps people in this loop of dissatisfaction. It's scary to prioritize happiness over certainty and make a choice to walk away from it all to create something even better.\u201d Tietjen believes the goal should be to maximize human potential rather than shoehorn people into roles that make them unhappy. Personal measures of success are shifting towards feelings of impact and the undeniable reality that life is fleeting. \u201cYou have no idea how much time you have on earth and if you spend it doing things that you don't want to, you may have wasted all that. I've seen people confront that a lot more.\u201d\n\nFacing Workplace Toxicity\n\nMental health is the elephant in the bright halls of academia. Elizabeth Nesika (name changed to protect identity), a former tenured biogeochemist at a small liberal arts college, never imagined that a toxic workplace culture would catalyze her mental health deterioration and precipitate the decision to leave her dream job.\n\nI don't like to think of myself as leaving academia because I was burned out. I was bullied out.\n\n\u2013 Elizabeth Nesika\n\nNesika was ecstatic when she was first offered the position. She described it as one of those experiences in life when the stars align just so. She was thrilled to have the opportunity to combine her passions for environmental science and mentoring. \u201cAt the beginning, it was pretty good. Exhausting, but that's just how it is,\u201d Nesika recalled. \u201cBut there were things that seemed amiss, like I hadn\u2019t been told the whole truth when I was being recruited, specifically around facilities.\u201d Nesika\u2019s first year was one of the most successful in her academic career. \u201cI got two NSF grants and had two high profile publications. It meant that I got a lot of attention in my first year and was on the [departmental] website a lot,\u201d she said, recalling that this attention was not well received by all her colleagues.\n\nNesika multi-tasked the mammoth responsibilities of academic science and continued to push through the challenges, focusing on the things she loved most about her job, amongst which were mentoring students. \u201cI loved the ability to have this huge impact on their lives, much in the same way that I had the privilege of having when I was younger. It was the reason I went to get my PhD, I wanted to be that for someone,\u201d Nesika said. \u201cI had all these amazing students. I loved my classes, I loved my research, and I loved most of my colleagues. It\u2019s like when you get course evaluations. Most of them are positive, but it's really hard not to focus on those few negative ones.\u201d\n\nApproaching the Exit Ramp\n\nNesika travelled the long and winding road towards the academic exit ramp amid what she felt was an insidious drip of toxicity consisting of backhanded remarks, gender biases, gas lighting, minimizing accomplishments, and bullying. \u201cLittle by little I felt less wanted. Resources were withheld from me. I ended up paying for things for my classes out of my research budget and startup,\u201d she recalled. Nesika also sat on various committees and voiced her opinions during meetings. As a junior faculty member at the time, she noticed the inherent power dynamics between junior and tenured faculty. \u201cI really didn\u2019t read the room correctly. I didn\u2019t recognize that \u2018we want to hear from everyone\u2019 wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nOver time, Nesika\u2019s mental health declined, and she realized that tenure would not solve her workplace challenges. Her therapist expressed deep concern for Nesika\u2019s well being and facilitated a medical leave. The tipping point for Nesika came after her department underwent an external evaluation. She was pulled aside by two of the evaluators who suggested that she explore other job opportunities because it was unlikely she would find the support she sought in her current environment. \u201cThat was what led to me applying for jobs, it was the validation I needed. Things had gotten progressively worse,\u201d she said. By the time Nesika left, she was the sixth woman in STEM to leave her small liberal arts college, all for some combination of personal and work-life balance reasons. \u201cMy closest colleague [left] the year after me, and I don\u2019t have a single professor friend who didn\u2019t feel some level of burnout,\u201d she said. Nesika herself was exhausted before leaving academia. Her workload made her less able to cope with the workplace negativity directed towards her.\n\n\u201cI don't like to think of myself as leaving academia because I was burned out. I was bullied out,\u201d Nesika said. \u201cDid I work too much? For sure. But that was in direct response to trying to achieve enough to get a tenure track job.\u201d\n\nNavigating New Roads\n\nNesika felt lost, and when she wrote openly on social media about her experiences, several women in senior positions reached out to provide mentorship. She described the ongoing support from her mentors and friends as \u201camazing and lovely,\u201d particularly the validation she received. \u201cThey told me that it was not okay what was happening to me. Otherwise, I might have been the frog boiling in water.\u201d Nesika also hired a career coach who helped her consider her values and goals, and how they align with her work identity in a more fulsome way. \u201cI don't know if I could have done it with therapy alone, [which] was about surviving. Now, it's about healing and moving towards thriving. The amount of progress I've made on my mental health in the last six months is shocking, I feel like I'm free,\u201d she said.\n\nAs part of this progress, Nesika acknowledged the importance of setting healthy boundaries and realistic expectations. \u201cI bought into this idea that my department was going to be my family and support system and when that didn\u2019t work, and in fact was the opposite, I didn\u2019t have an alternative model to fall back on,\u201d she said. Nesika has also navigated feelings of failure and guilt for leaving her career in academia. \u201cI don\u2019t have it anymore, but [I had] tons of guilt for leaving my friends and colleagues in that toxic space and guilt for that sunk cost that I had put into my career and feeling like a failure,\u201d she described. Nesika now advocates against the pain Olympics that academics engage in\u2014the competition that rewards the highest tolerance for being overworked. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend that I haven\u2019t partaken. It\u2019s hard to be in that space and not have it influence how you behave.\u201d\n\nAdvocating for Change\n\nNesika applied for academic jobs at other institutions but was unable to get her foot in the door. With each rejection she felt as though she was being sentenced to return to the toxic environment she was trying to leave. In her search for a new path, she prioritized opportunities that enabled her to advocate for making science more inclusive, and eventually transitioned to the science policy space. As a scientist, activist, and educator, Nesika continues to apply her passion for advocacy to broaden participation and increase equity, inclusivity, and justice in science.\n\nNesika emphasizes the importance of clarifying a workplace\u2019s code of conduct when applying for jobs. \u201cThat includes things above and beyond what\u2019s legally acceptable. Rules that can be enforced around workplace conduct. Just be clear about their expectations for you and your expectations for yourself,\u201d she said. Recalling her time in academia, Nesika feels little remorse. \u201cI don't regret working there. I'm a better researcher, a better person, a better mentor, [and] a better communicator because of that job. Like any toxic relationship, I wish I had left earlier. But I couldn't tell you when that would have been.\u201d\n\nExperiencing the Fallout of Burnout\n\nAndrew Pelling, a former professor of physics and biology at the University of Ottawa, retired amid a wildly successful career. Pelling is famous for his work using fruits and vegetables for tissue regeneration and creating an open-source DIY cell culture incubator from scavenged trash items. Like the grocery aisle produce he used in his stem cell experiments, Pelling\u2019s approach to science is fresh, combining a knack for biohacking with an appreciation for play and exploration. His lab hosted a diverse group of scientists, artists, and engineers, endowed with the creative freedom to engage in vibrant cross-pollination of ideas.\n\nPelling described the process of scientific discovery as hard and heartbreaking, with incredibly sweet moments in between. \u201cYou're usually completely alone in a dark microscope room when you realize you've discovered something new. It's a special thing to be holding that new piece of knowledge, you are the only person holding on to it in that moment. For me, that's where the addiction started,\u201d Pelling said. He also found tremendous satisfaction in mentoring students. \u201cThat\u2019s what drove me to academia. When I started seeing [the mentorship] piece fall to the wayside that was a signal to me that something was not right. Something had to give.\u201d\n\nThe Bridge to Burnout\n\nAndrew Pelling is founder of multiple startup companies and an adjunct professor at the University of Ottawa. Peter Thornton\n\nPelling left academia because of clinical burnout, one of the many mental health concerns that researchers increasingly face.6 \u201cIt was a long time coming, not a sudden thing,\u201d he said. He described the experience of becoming a full professor in 2018 as anticlimactic. Shortly afterwards, he began asking himself: \u201cWhat\u2019s the next challenge?\u201d He was advised to consider joining the ranks of upper administration but decided against it. \u201cThat's a great path for some people, but not for me. It's not satisfying enough,\u201d Pelling said.\n\nHe began accepting other roles that limited his academic focus. \u201cI was doing a lot and already starting to think it's time to move to something new. This went on for four or five years, to the point where I was pretty burnt out.\u201d Between managing a lab, mentoring students, reviewing papers and grants, serving on committees, starting several companies, consulting, speaking, and travelling, Pelling reached his tipping point. \u201cIt all added up, and at the end of 2022, those final straws broke my back.\u201d\n\nAs Pelling struggled with clinical burnout, he realized it was impacting his mentoring. \u201cI was getting more frustrated with my students. I've always loved working with students and was not feeling that anymore. Once I started to admit to myself that I was burnt out, I realized I had to step back. I wasn't serving my students.\u201d After months of soul searching, he decided to leave academia. \u201cIt's hard because for almost 30 years, this has been my identity. That was tough to grapple with,\u201d Pelling said. \u201cI made a decision in late 2022 but wanted to make sure I landed the plane smoothly.\u201d He told his dean he would take 18 months to wrap up. \u201cThat day I felt amazing. This unbelievable weight came off my shoulders. I had not realized I'd been carrying all this stress and anxiety. It was definitely the right move.\u201d\n\nReflections on Academic Life\n\nPelling described academia as lacking work-life balance. The intense focus on a specific topic is a basic requirement for driving discovery, but it is easy to get carried away. The increasingly arduous demands on professors to take on additional roles creates a slippery slope towards burnout. \u201cIt\u2019s your identity, all the time, 24/7. It caught up with me [after] a lot of bad decisions. It's normalized, this type of life,\u201d Pelling said. \u201cWe're trying to do research at the bench. We're not ever trained to manage people, money, and bureaucracy, or to teach. We\u2019re thrown into these things. Some of us are good at it, some of us are not, and it just all piles on every day. For me it just got to be way too much.\u201d\n\nAcademic science uses imperfect metrics to measure outcomes and impact. Much of this is driven by the need to create accountability for publicly funded projects and balance the responsibilities of universities. However, this creates an environment that is challenging to navigate, ultimately driving away academics who do not want to deal with the operational burdens. \u201cThere are a lot of academics leaving. As I was going through the process, I just kept meeting one mid-career professor after another who had left. It's just all over the place. They get burned out. We must be more intentional about how we design these systems so that we're not burning out our top talent,\u201d Pelling said.\n\nTeaching Moment\n\nPelling\u2019s exit from academia is perhaps one of his greatest lessons for his students. Graduate students are eager to discuss non-academic career trajectories, but there are not many opportunities to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s still very rare; most professors haven't spent time in the private sector,\u201d Pelling said. His advice to students is to attend graduate school only if there is a tangible goal for being there. \u201cIf you want to do fundamental research and spend a lot of time deeply thinking about the fine details of a specific area, go to grad school. But it shouldn\u2019t be the default or backup plan. I\u2019ve never seen anybody really thrive who went to grad school because they graduated from undergrad and that\u2019s what you do next.\u201d\n\nPelling\u2019s decision to leave academia validates the value of course correction, at any career stage. \u201cLet's say you're two years into a PhD, and already put all that time in. That's not an easy conversation but you have to, if you're not happy, make the call. I've met with students to have those conversations, and I really probed them on this,\u201d Pelling said. He dissuades students from spending years in graduate school unhappy and encourages them to do the hard work of considering what they want. \u201cLife is so short; you need to be pursuing things that drive you deep down. There is a responsibility on your shoulders to figure that out. If you don't know what you want, you're going to be rudderless.\u201d\n\nAct Two\n\nPelling views his years in academia as an asset. \u201cThere's so much there I don't think we give ourselves enough credit for, the value you can bring to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm lucky I get to see that in the private sector, how all those skills are translating over. I feel like I may do an even better job in my second act.\u201d In celebration of act two, Pelling and his wife are planning a trip to the Arctic, far up into the Northwest Passage, a trip they delayed for years. Pelling looks forward to the forced disconnection from the internet and outside world. \u201cWe like this type of thing. A few years ago, we went to the Serengeti, camping in the wild for a few weeks. Once I'm back, I'll start to think more carefully about stuff.\u201d\n\nPelling has not yet made plans for his post-academic career. He described the advice he received from other former academics who now hold senior scientific and leadership positions outside of academia. \u201cEvery single one of them told me to take the time and stop. End that portion of your career and make sure it ends well.\u201d Pelling wants to avoid overextending himself with new opportunities but intends to continue working with his start-up companies in active or advisory roles. \u201cI'm very sensitive to taking on too much too soon. I do not want to immediately start overdoing it again, because I know my instinct is to say yes to everything. I'm trying not to make the same mistakes again.\u201d"

We\u2019re so close,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says she is officially joining the Republican Party.\n\nGabbard ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020, but broke from the party and has endorsed Trump.\n\nShe says during an appearance at his rally in North Carolina that Trump is \u201cour best and only hope in this election.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump chief of staff John Kelly says the former president \u2014 his former boss \u2014 \u201ccertainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\u201d Speaking to the New York Times, Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, told the paper that Trump \u201ccertainly prefers the dictator approach to government.\u201d\n\nThey marked the former top aides\u2019 most extended public comments about the former Republican president and the party\u2019s 2024 nominee for the White House. Kelly declined to endorse any candidate for the White House, but told the paper, \u201cit\u2019s a very dangerous thing to have the wrong person elected to high office.\u201d\n\nTrump is lashing out at former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who has been campaigning with Kamala Harris in a bid to appeal to Republican voters who are uneasy about Trump.\n\nTrump says of Cheney that \u201cher father brought years of war and death to the Middle East.\u201d He was referring to former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served under President George W. Bush.\n\nHe asserted that Harris would do poorly in Michigan for aligning with Cheney.\n\n\u201cWhy would a Muslim or why would an Arab want to vote for someone that has Liz Cheney as her hero,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump has a long history of Islamophobic rhetoric, including, at one point, calling for a ban on Muslims entering the country during his 2016 campaign.\n\nEminem welcomes former President Barack Obama to the stage in Detroit as the Detroit rapper\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d plays.\n\nTrump in a campaign rally is focusing heavily on border security and claiming that illegal immigrants are taking jobs from African Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\nEconomic data shows Black and Hispanic unemployment at the lower end of recent decades. In September, the unemployment rate stood at 5.7% for Blacks and 5.1% for Hispanics, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe unemployment rates for both populations have plummeted since the pandemic.\n\nJust before the pandemic, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 5.6% in December 2019 and 4.2% for Hispanics that same month.\n\nTrump says that Madison Square Garden isn\u2019t the only big city mega rally he\u2019s hoping to hold as he closes out his third campaign for the White House.\n\nHe says his staff are looking at booking big arenas in Atlanta as well as Philadelphia, after his event in liberal Manhattan this coming Sunday.\n\nTrump is also waxing nostalgic that his campaigning days are coming to a close.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad because we\u2019re sort of wrapping it up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re wrapping up something that has been incredible.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIt\u2019s been great to be with you and now we want to close it out with a beautiful bang.\u201d\n\nTrump has said that, regardless of what happens, he does not plan to run again - though he has been known to change his mind.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign is seizing on President Joe Biden saying \u201clock him up\u201d in reference to Trump during an appearance in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden just admitted the truth: he and Kamala\u2019s plan all along has been to politically persecute their opponent President Trump because they can\u2019t beat him fair and square,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, calling on Harris to \u201ccondemn Joe Biden\u2019s disgraceful remark.\u201d\n\nBiden, during his appearance, had been casting Trump as a threat to Democracy when he made the remark.\n\n\u201cPolitically lock him up,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cLock him out, that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nTrump has routinely blamed Biden for the indictments against him, though there is no evidence the president had anything to do with them.\n\nTrump is portraying the nation\u2019s economy as in shambles during a campaign stop in Greensboro, N.C. He claims that \u201cwith four more years of Kamala Harris, North Carolina will be an economic wasteland.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s in contrast to a CNBC study earlier this year that named North Carolina as the second best state to do business, and it\u2019s been in the top three of CNBC\u2019s survey for five years in a row.\n\nThe state\u2019s Department of Commerce says that since 2017, North Carolina has announced more than 115,300 jobs and promised capital investments of $53.45 billion. Major projects have been announced by companies including Apple, Toyota and Wolfspeed.\n\nTrump is kicking off his rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, by asking his audience if they\u2019re better off now than they were four years ago. And he\u2019s going after Harris, calling her the country\u2019s worst-ever vice president and \u201ca radical left lunatic.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s calling the country \u201ca failing nation\u201d and saying this election \u201cis a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetent failure and disaster, or whether we\u2019ll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of you. We\u2019re going to work together\u201d\n\nTrump is urging those who were displaced by Hurricane Helene to visit his campaign\u2019s website to see how they can vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s team and Republicans have backed a series of modifications to make it easier for those in the state to vote, despite having railed against changes so that people could more safely vote during the pandemic.\n\nHe says his supporters need to make the election \u201ctoo big too rig.\u201d\n\nTrump is speaking to supporters at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, saying he\u2019s seen a lot of the state lately and has followed the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene.\n\nTrump began his rally complaining that the state\u2019s residents \u201chaven\u2019t had much help from our government in Washington. I can tell you that.\u201d\n\nHe says that following Jan. 20th, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of me. We\u2019re going to fix it up and make it better than ever.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Telemundo, Harris said she will help construct an economy that \u201csupports the working class.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish-language news channel spoke to Harris in English, but her interview was dubbed into Spanish for listeners. In response to claims by Donald Trump that she\u2019s a socialist, she said she was a \u201ccapitalist. A pragmatic capitalist.\u201d\n\nAnd she said she would focus on bringing capital to community banks to help Latino men get small business loans\n\nHarris says she still believes Joe Biden is \u201ccapable in every way\u201d of being president, after his disastrous debate against Trump forced him to abandon his reelection campaign, clearing the way for her to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News, Harris says \u201cyou\u2019d have to ask him if that\u2019s the only reason why\u201d he dropped out of the race, but that she has \u201cno reluctance\u201d in saying he\u2019s up for the job.\n\nHarris says she\u2019s not going to \u201cget into those hypotheticals\u201d about potentially pardoning Trump if she wins the White House. Trump has been convicted in a New York hush money trial and faces federal charges over his role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAsked if she thought pardoning Trump would help the country move on, she says, \u201cLet me tell you what\u2019s going to help us move on. I get elected President of the United States.\u201d\n\nHarris tells NBC News she doesn\u2019t believe that religious exceptions should be granted as Democrats look to restore a national right to abortion. Harris says she\u2019s not \u201cgoing to engage in hypotheticals\u201d about negotiations with Congress, but appears to reject having a carve-out for providers with a religious objection to providing abortions. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be making concessions when we\u2019re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,\u201d she says.\n\nHarris says she\u2019s not focused on pointing out the historic nature of her candidacy. She tells NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m clearly a woman, I don\u2019t need to point that out to anyone.\u201d\n\nHarris would be the first woman elected to the White House if she wins. She says she\u2019s not worried about sexism harming her candidacy, saying she\u2019s focused on speaking to all voters.\n\n\u201cI will never assume that anyone in our country should elect a leader based on their gender or their race, instead that that leader needs to earn the vote based on substance and what they will do to address challenges and to inspire people,\u201d she said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris says that if elected she will be more focused on lowering costs for American families than President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News, Harris says: \u201cMine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it, and it has informed a number of my areas of focus.\u201d She added that those focus areas are on \u201clowering costs.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden has laid into his predecessor, Donald Trump, declaring during a visit to New Hampshire that the former president is a \u201cgenuine threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nBiden gave a speech focused on prescription drug prices but used the end to suggest that world leaders are terrified of a second Trump term. He said they often pull him aside at summits and quietly wonder what a Trump return to the White House will do to democratic rule around the world.\n\nBiden got so wrapped up in his criticism that he declared at one point of Trump, \u201clock him up,\u201d echoing similar calls that some supporters make at the rallies of Vice\n\n\u201cPolitically lock him up,\u201d Biden continued over applause from attendees. \u201cLock him out, that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nRecord numbers of people are voting early, driven partly by a surge of Republicans convinced to do so by Donald Trump. Trump previously turned his party off voting early with his election lies, but he\u2019s changed direction this year and now encourages it.\n\nThe early vote doesn\u2019t tell you who\u2019s going to win an election. You just know who\u2019s casting a ballot, not who they\u2019re voting for. Wait until Election night to find that out.\n\n\u25b6 Meanwhile, you can see who\u2019s voting in your state here.\n\nBiden veered into talking about the election as he closed his prescription speech in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cFolks, there\u2019s so much at stake so please call your neighbors, get your friends, get your relatives,\u201d the president said, urging people to vote in the presidential election.\n\nBiden made veiled references to Trump when he said that every world leader he meets pulls him aside to tell him they don\u2019t want Trump to win.\n\n\u201cIf America walks away, who leads the world? Who?\u201d Biden asked his audience.\n\nBiden is criticizing Trump on the issue of health care, specifically the former president\u2019s attempts to unravel the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe president is in Concord, New Hampshire, to talk about prescription drug savings under the Inflation Reduction Act he signed into law.\n\nBiden noted that Trump recently said he has \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d when he was asked about his plans for health care in the United States.\n\nSaid Biden of Trump, \u201cHe has no concept of anything. No plan.\u201d\n\nFlorida-based voter advocacy group Equal Ground launched its Pastors at the Polls community initiative intended to ensure voter safety throughout the final leg of this year\u2019s election season.\n\nCommunity pastors in Florida will receive various training sessions including poll monitoring and de-escalation training. Then, over the final two weekends of early voting, they\u2019ll be deployed and stationed at precincts across the state with higher voter intimidation risks.\n\nThe 2024 election marks the first presidential since three major voter suppression laws have gone into effect. Florida is one of several states where Republicans have enacted voting restrictions that created or enhanced criminal penalties and fines for those who assist voters. A federal judge blocked portions of a Florida measure earlier this year, including the one targeting felons and those who are not citizens.\n\nEven so, the law initially had a direct effect on the operations of Equal Ground and other voter advocacy organizations in the state before the ruling.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama tells a Wisconsin audience \u201cyou\u2019d be worried if grandpa was acting like\u201d Donald Trump.\n\nCampaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris, Obama honed in on Trump\u2019s actions at some of his rallies as well as calling himself the \u201cfather of IVF,\u201d or in vitro fertilization.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what that means. You don\u2019t either,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama said to the crowd when it comes to Trump that they would call up their brother or cousin, and ask \u2019have you noticed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is coming from somebody who wants unchecked power,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo, Wisconsin, we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails. America is ready to turn the page.\u201d\n\nTim Walz campaigning in Wisconsin is mocking billionaire Elon Musk for his appearance at a campaign rally for Donald Trump, saying \u201cElon\u2019s on that stage jumping around, skipping like a dipsh\u2014\u2014t on the stage. You know it.\u201d\n\nThe Madison audience roared its approval in response.\n\nWalz said Musk is \u201cliterally the richest man in the world, spending millions of dollars to help Donald Trump buy an election.\u201d\n\nHe asserts that Musk is doing so because Trump has \u201calready promised that he would put Elon in charge of government regulation that oversees the businesses that Elon runs.\u201d Trump has said he would create a government efficiency commission to audit the entire federal government, an idea suggested by Musk, who would lead it\n\n\u201cWe had a nice road trip instead,\u201d Obama said to laughs from the crowd.\n\nThe drive from Chicago to Madison takes around three hours. Obama took the stage about two hours after the rally started.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz preceded Obama, along with a host of Wisconsin candidates and officeholders.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to confirm the taping.\n\nTrump and Rogan have a complicated history. While the two shook hands and spoke briefly at a UFC fight, Trump criticized Rogan after he said that then-candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. was the only one running who made sense to him.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site in August.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris have appeared on a slew of popular podcasts \u2014 with Trump\u2019s typically aimed at young men.\n\n\u2014 Jill Colvin\n\nThe webpage provides information for voters in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, who may be confronting lost identification, relocated polling places or other disruptions because of the hurricanes.\n\nThe Justice Department has compiled information about changes states have made to aid those affected by the storms. The page answers questions such as how people who\u2019ve been displaced can get a ballot mailed to their new location and how residents can check to see if the place where they usually cast their ballot is open for voting.\n\nGroups in Russia created and helped spread viral disinformation targeting Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, a senior U.S. intelligence official said Tuesday.\n\nThe content, which includes baseless accusations about the Minnesota governor\u2019s time as a teacher, contains several indications that it was manipulated, said the official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nAnalysts identified clues that linked the content to Russian disinformation operations, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director.\n\nDigital researchers had already linked the video to Russia, but Tuesday\u2019s announcement is the first time federal authorities have confirmed the connection.\n\nThe disinformation targeting Walz is consistent with Russian disinformation seeking to undermine the Democratic campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz, her running mate. Russia also has spread disinformation aimed at stoking discord and division ahead of voting, officials said, and may seek to encourage violent protests after Election Day.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Russian disinformation.\n\nThe participants gathered around Trump with their hands on his shoulders. Trump remained seated and had his eyes closed.\n\nThey asked God to continue to protect Trump and give him strength. And to \u201cmake America godly again.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that switching to all-electric trucks would require rebuilding every one of the country\u2019s bridges and that solar fields kill rabbits.\n\nHe says he recently saw a solar field \u201cthat looked like it took up half the desert.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all steel and glass and wires. And it looks like hell,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see rabbits, they get caught in it.\u201d\n\nTrump often rails against wind power, saying the turbines \u201ckill all the birds\u201d and confuse whales. He\u2019s been more complimentary of electric cars since he received the backing of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nBut he is criticizing their range and weight at an event with Latino supporters Tuesday, claiming the nation would need to rebuild every one of its bridges if truck fleets swap diesel for electric vehicles to handle the extra weight.\n\nHe called it a \u201cbad thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you imagine somebody doing that? That\u2019s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within,\u201d he said, repeating the phrase he\u2019s used in recent speeches to refer to Democratic lawmakers such as U.S. Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t stand for this incompetence anymore.\u201d\n\nThe FBI said Tuesday that it\u2019s investigating the unauthorized release of these documents.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Bob Unanue, is a vocal supporter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite good out of the can,\u201d Trump says of the company known for its beans and other products.\n\n\u201cI eat it whenever I can,\u201d he claims.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama will also be there.\n\nSpringsteen will hold another concert with Obama on Monday in Philadelphia.\n\nA senior campaign official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said more concerts will be announced in the coming days.\n\n\u2014 Chris Megerian\n\nAt the event, Trump said Harris is \u201cslow\u201d and has a \u201clow IQ.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another low IQ person,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not what you want.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s jabs come after Harris tried to cast him as \u201cexhausted\u201d after he pulled out of several interviews \u2014 though Trump has had a busy schedule of interviews with conservative outlets and podcasts.\n\nIn the opening remarks, notable Florida Republicans including Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott proclaimed Trump\u2019s record in supporting the Hispanic community during his previous term.\n\nSuarez was one of three Florida Republicans running for president in the earlier campaign cycle, but despite running against Trump, the mayor endorsed the former president in March. Suarez said that under Trump\u2019s term, Hispanics experienced the lowest unemployment and the biggest reduction in poverty.\n\nScott, who\u2019s running for reelection, emphasized Trump would be the best to handle Latin American conflicts and fight against dictatorial regimes, where the families of many voters in the crowd escaped from.\n\nMiami is home to one of the largest Hispanic communities in the country, with about 70% of Miami-Dade County\u2019s population identifying as Hispanic according to 2023 Census data.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful day in Miami, with blue skies framing the property\u2019s many palm trees.\n\nScott\u2019s main message to Hispanic voters was that under Trump\u2019s presidency, Hispanic voters were better off, because the border was more secure and inflation was lower.\n\nScott is saying Harris\u2019 policy will institute price controls, which is socialism. He said her administration would raise taxes.\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic vote is the deciding factor. If you want someone to fight for Latin America, Trump\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Scott said.\n\nWhen Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and Kamala Harris jumped in, a cascade of Zoom meetings with hundreds of thousands of participants popped up seemingly out of nowhere and helped propel her to the Democratic nomination.\n\nNow organizers are trying to turn that burst of digital enthusiasm into traditional get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banking and door knocking. They\u2019ve created a loose constellation of volunteer networks operating independently of the Harris campaign, all geared toward marshaling local or online communities behind the vice president.\n\nPeople are sending postcards, texting friends, canvassing battleground states, making friendship bracelets with campaign messages, and sometimes surprising themselves by getting involved in ways they\u2019ve never done before.\n\nThe question is whether the Zoom meetings that drew so much attention during the summer \u2014 for Black women, Black men, white women, white dudes, cat ladies, Taylor Swift fans and more \u2014 will turn out to be a short-lived phenomenon or a powerful catalyst for Harris to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Zoom organizing by Democrats.\n\nBut she\u2019s not necessarily trying to sway voters there. She\u2019s trying to highlight a make-or-break issue for Democrats: abortion rights.\n\nHarris will seek to show how Texas\u2019 restrictive abortion ban is creating increasing medical distress for women. During her campaign, the Democratic presidential nominee has often highlighted the increasingly perilous landscape for women since the fall of Roe, and she links it to Donald Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned the landmark abortion rights ruling.\n\nBut it\u2019s unusual for her to do it from a state she\u2019s highly unlikely to win. Campaign officials say the plan is a nontraditional way to capture the attention of voters in battleground states who are inundated with campaign ads and run-of-the-mill campaign events.\n\nBut Harris also thinks the issue is resonating with Republican voters, too, particularly women.\n\nPennsylvania is arguably the hardest fought of the battleground states and happens to have one of the fastest-growing Hispanic communities in the country, in what is known as the 222 Corridor, after the highway that connects small cities and towns west and north of Philadelphia.\n\nIt\u2019s fertile ground for both Democrats and Republicans to test their strength among Latinos in a state where small margins decide who gets 20 electoral votes. It\u2019s a place where Democratic nominee Kamala Harris can prove that her party still commands a large share of the demographic\u2019s support, and where Republican Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has been working to gain ground.\n\n\u201cThis is the epicenter for Latino voters in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Victor Martinez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and lives in and broadcasts his show from Allentown. \u201cI like the fact that Kamala Harris has to keep sending people over here to listen to us and talk to us. I like it. I like the fact that JD Vance has to keep coming back. I like it, because that means that they have to pay attention to us.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s Latino-eligible voter population has more than doubled since 2000 from 208,000 to 579,000, according to the Latino Data Hub from the University of California, Los Angeles\u2019 Latino Policy & Politics Institute. The population in cities like Allentown and Reading is now more than half Hispanic, with a majority being of Puerto Rican descent and a sizable portion of Dominican origin.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the Latino vote in this election.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration is awarding $428 million for 14 clean-energy manufacturing projects in Pennsylvania and other states hit hard by the decline of the U.S. coal industry.\n\nOne of the larger grants, $87 million, will go to a Pennsylvania company to make state-of-the-art linear generators at a plant outside Pittsburgh, a key battleground in the presidential election.\n\nLinear generators can use any fuel source to produce low-carbon power for utilities, data centers and industry. Mainspring Energy plans to use Energy Department funds to create enough electricity annually to power more than 40,000 homes. Harris, like Biden, has pledged to help workers displaced by the transition to clean energy, a key issue in energy-rich Pennsylvania.\n\nTwo weeks out from Election Day, the crisis in the Middle East is looming over the race for the White House, with one candidate struggling to find just the right words to navigate its difficult cross-currents and the other making bold pronouncements that the age-old conflict can quickly be set right.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has been painstakingly \u2014 and not always successfully \u2014 trying to balance talk of strong support for Israel with harsh condemnations of civilian casualties among Palestinians and others caught up in Israel\u2019s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, for his part, insists that none of this would have happened on his watch and that he can make it all go away if elected.\n\nBoth of them are bidding for the votes of Arab and Muslim American voters and Jewish voters, particularly in extremely tight races in the battleground states of Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the Mideast conflict\u2019s role in the election.\n\nFor the past year, Project 2025 has endured as a persistent force in the presidential election, its far-right proposals deployed by Democrats as shorthand for what Donald Trump would potentially do with a second term at the White House.\n\nEven though the former president\u2019s campaign has vigorously distanced itself from Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation\u2019s proposal to gut the federal workforce and dismantle federal agencies aligns closely with his vision. Project 2025\u2019s architects come from the ranks of Trump\u2019s administration and top Heritage officials have briefed Trump\u2019s team about it.\n\nIt\u2019s rare for a complex 900-page policy book to figure so dominantly in a political campaign. But from its early start at a think tank, to its viral spread on social media, the rise and fall and potential rise again of Project 2025 shows the unexpected staying power of policy to light up an election year and threaten not only Trump atop the ticket but down-ballot Republicans in races for Congress.\n\nThrough it all, Project 2025 hasn't gone away. It exists not only as a policy blueprint for the next administration, but as a database of some 20,000 job-seekers who could staff a Trump White House and administration and a still unreleased \u201c180-day playbook\u201d of actions a new president could employ on Day One.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Project 2025.\n\nIn-person early voting kicks off Tuesday across battleground Wisconsin, with former President Barack Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz hosting a rally in liberal Madison and Republicans holding events to encourage casting a ballot for Donald Trump before Election Day.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin by just under 21,000 votes in 2020, an election that saw unprecedented early and absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are expecting another razor-thin margin in Wisconsin and both sides are pushing voters to cast their ballots early.\n\nTrump was highly critical of voting by mail in past elections, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud. But this election, he and his backers are embracing all forms of voting, including by mail and early in-person. Trump himself encouraged early voting at a rally in Dodge County, Wisconsin, earlier this month.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about early voting in Wisconsin.\n\nHarris is set to discuss how her plan will lower costs, increase their chances for homeownership and expand job opportunities for Latino men in an interview she\u2019s taping Tuesday in Washington with Telemundo, the Spanish-language TV network.\n\nThe campaign says Harris, running mate Tim Walz and her husband, Doug Emhoff, are giving interviews to several Hispanic media outlets this week in a bid to get her message across to Latino men.\n\nHarris\u2019 Telemundo interview is set to air Wednesday night."
