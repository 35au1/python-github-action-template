            "article_content": "The unexplained sightings of drones across North Jersey's night skies have sparked curiosity and unease.\n\nReports of the hovering crafts buzzing the region have left residents wondering if they are the tools of hobbyists, covert military experiments or something even more mysterious.\n\nThe puzzling spectacle is, of course, not the first for the state, which has hosted steered flying objects in its skies since 1863. For generations, New Jersey has played host to stories of the strange and the surreal, including Martian invasions and ghostly treasure guardians.\n\nDrones fly over Parsippany, NJ near the Boonton Reservoir on Monday, Dec. 2, 2024. This drone appeared to be northwest of the reservoir just after sunset. More were seen in subsequent hours, up to four at a time.\n\nWas a UFO seen in NJ in 1966?\n\nOne of the most famous stories came on a 1966 cold, clear winter evening in Wanaque, when residents reported seeing mysterious lights hovering over the Wanaque Reservoir. The event, which would later be recounted as one of New Jersey\u2019s most famous UFO sightings, involved numerous witnesses, including police officers and town officials. All described a strange, glowing object moving in inexplicable ways.\n\nThe floor of the north end of the Wanaque Reservoir in Ringwood is exposed Wednesday, November 20, 2024, as drought conditions persist in New Jersey.\n\nThe first reports came around 6:30 p.m. Patrolman Joseph Cisco, responding to a dispatch about a glowing light, spotted what he described as a pulsating orb, larger than a star, hovering silently in the sky. Other calls quickly followed, with sightings reported in Ringwood, Paterson and Oakland.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWanaque Mayor Harry Wolfe, along with Councilmen Warren Hagstrom and Arthur Barton, happened to be nearby and joined Cisco at the scene. The mayor\u2019s 14-year-old son, Billy Wolfe, identified the object, describing it as a brilliant, steady light changing colors from white to red to green.\n\nThe intensity of the incident escalated as additional witnesses claimed to see the light interact with the frozen reservoir. Civil Defense Director Bentley Spencer reported seeing a beam of light shoot down toward the ice, which some described as \"burning a hole.\" Reservoir worker Fred Steines confirmed the unusual activity at the dam. Other witnesses described the object as disc-shaped or oval.\n\nAfter encountering what he believed to be a UFO at Splitrock Reservoir in 1966, Jerry Simons drew this sketch of what he saw.\n\nThe following night, Patrolman Jack Wardlaw reported seeing a similar object near his home in Stonetown moving erratically and disappearing over nearby mountains. By October 1966, more sightings followed, including one from Sgt. Ben Thompson, who described a glowing object moving low over the mountains before accelerating upward.\n\nVarious explanations were offered in the years that followed. A study by Vestigia in 1979 theorized that seismic activity near the Ramapo fault might have caused luminous phenomena, while the Pentagon suggested a rare celestial alignment of Venus and Jupiter. Eyewitnesses, however, rejected these theories and the events remain unexplained.\n\nA UFO hoax perpetrated in NJ in 2009\n\nLike many of New Jersey's more unbelievable stories, another UFO mystery turned out to be a hoax. It started in January 2009 in Morristown, when five red lights appeared in the night sky. Dubbed the \"Morristown UFO,\" these lights sparked widespread speculation about extraterrestrial activity, with some residents and UFO enthusiasts convinced they were witnessing a genuine sighting when they reportedly saw them hover in a triangular formation before moving across the sky.\n\nPhoto of supposed UFO in Wanaque.\n\nHowever, on April 1, 2009, two young men, Joe Rudy and Chris Russo \u2014 now a Morristown councilman \u2014 revealed that the event was a carefully orchestrated hoax.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing helium balloons and road flares, they had staged the \"UFO\" as a social experiment to highlight the unreliability of eyewitness testimony and the sensationalism surrounding UFO investigations. They released videos documenting their process, which debunked theories of advanced aircraft or alien visitation and underscored how easily UFO stories could gain traction without substantial evidence.\n\nA witch trial in New Jersey?\n\nNew Jersey's strange happenings and hoaxes date back centuries. In 1730, an account emerged in the Pennsylvania Gazette about New Jersey's only alleged witch trial.\n\nDrawing a crowd of 300 villagers, the trial was reportedly held in Mount Holly to determine the fate of two residents accused of casting spells on a neighbor\u2019s livestock. The spells allegedly caused the sheep to dance and the hogs to sing psalms.\n\nThe story ended without a definitive conclusion and its veracity was never confirmed or truly debunked. Many historians, however, have claimed newspaper publisher and Founding Father Benjamin Franklin devised the article as a satire meant to criticize superstition and possibly poke fun at residents of Burlington County.\n\nA prank by New Jersey's P.T. Barnum\n\nFranklin's Mount Holly hoax set the stage for New Jersey\u2019s reputation as a fertile ground for pranks. That ground in 1843 would be trodden by famous prankster P.T. Barnum, who with a bombardment of posters promised residents of New York City a summertime display like none other across the Hudson River.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ads claimed Hoboken would host a thrilling \"Grand Buffalo Hunt\" on Aug. 31. Cowboys were to showcase their lasso skills on a herd of American bison brought from the untamed West. Best of all, the event was free. Thousands ultimately made the journey, according to the 1995 book \"P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman.\"\n\nBarnum, in his biography, described partnering with ferry operators to get half of the day's fares. The gamble paid off spectacularly. More than 20,000 people reportedly crossed to Hoboken. By day\u2019s end, Barnum had cleared a profit of $3,500, a windfall for the era.\n\nInstead of powerful beasts, attendees were greeted by a motley collection of frail buffalo that Barnum purchased for $700. Making matters worse was weak fencing that allowed frightened bison to break through the arena holding the event and flee into the nearby swamps.\n\nHidden Revolutionary War treasure ghost in NJ? No!\n\nA legend of British Loyalists burying treasure as they fled George Washington\u2019s forces during the Revolutionary War led another hoax perpetrator to bring fright to the Morristown area. Ransford Rodgers, a former Connecticut schoolteacher, arrived in the area in the late 1780s claiming he could unlock the mystery of the fabled treasure many believed was hidden on Schooley Mountain.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodgers wove an enticing narrative, insisting that the treasure's location was protected by a ghost, as detailed in Peter Zablocki's recent book \"The 1788 Morristown Ghost Hoax. This spirit, Rodgers claimed, could only be exorcised with his specialized skills.\n\nProminent families in Morristown, entranced by the promise of both riches and adventure, were extorted for large sums of money. Rodgers' elaborate ruse, complete with staged supernatural encounters and spiritual ceremonies, duped the town\u2019s elite before it all unraveled and Rodgers fled the area.\n\nMundane and dumb hoaxes that happened in New Jersey\n\nHeadline-making hoaxes in the 20th century generally included fake kidnappings, deaths and, in the century's second half, bomb scares.\n\nThere were the mundane hoaxes, including one involving taxicab owner William A. Carlock from Pearl River, New York, who claimed to be held up by three armed and masked bandits in Park Ridge in November 1939. In reality, it was Carlock's attempt to steal revenue intended for a coach company so he could pay off his debt.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere were also the dumb ones, including the one involving the fake merchant seaman hero from Dumont. At 16, William E. Jerlat left home to work odd jobs between Albany and New Orleans before returning home in April 1942 with claims he had joined the U.S. Maritime Service and twice cheated death, The Record reported in September 1943.\n\nThe first time, Jerlat said the merchant freighter he was on was attacked and he went overboard with his hair on fire to save a shipmate. The second time, he said U-boats attacked his ship and he somehow woke up in Africa. The claims were later debunked and investigated by U.S. Naval Intelligence.\n\nAnother hoax took place in April 1981 at the Veterans Administration hospital in East Orange, where an alleged gunman dressed as a doctor purportedly threatened to kill state Sen. James Wallwork. The hospital\u2019s chief of police, Joseph Lancellotti, claimed to have wrestled the would-be assailant to the ground, but said the individual managed to escape. However, an FBI investigation soon revealed that the entire incident was a hoax orchestrated by Lancellotti.\n\nNew Jersey's most famous hoax\n\nMost prominently, New Jersey played host to one of the most famous hoaxes of all time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn Halloween Eve in 1938, the Garden State became the epicenter of mass hysteria, thanks to Orson Welles' infamous radio broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds.\" For listeners across America, the mock news reports describing a Martian invasion felt chillingly real. But for residents of Grovers Mill, a small community in West Windsor, the drama hit far too close to home.\n\nThe broadcast, performed by Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air, reimagined H.G. Wells\u2019 1898 novel as a live event. Interspersed between music segments, faux news bulletins described explosions on Mars followed by a Martian landing in Grovers Mill. With its realistic tone, the broadcast sparked chaos. Traffic jams clogged the streets, phones rang off the hook and panic swept across the nation.\n\nOne Grovers Mill resident, William Dock, reportedly fired shots at a water tower in the moonlight, mistaking it for a Martian war machine. Families packed their belongings and fled in search of safety, while others drove into the hamlet, hoping to catch a glimpse of the alien invaders.\n\nBob Sanders, then 6 years old, recalled the surreal scene in a 2013 interview with USA Today. \"Fathers put their families in a car and took off for parts unknown,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cOther people came to see what they [the Martians] looked like.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor some, the simulated invasion seemed far too real. In Newark, dozens of families fled their homes, believing a gas attack was underway. The New York Times reported widespread disruption, with households and religious services interrupted, roads gridlocked and communication lines overwhelmed.\n\nWelles' inspiration reportedly came from the Hindenburg disaster of 1937. His team mimicked the measured tones of news announcers and fueled the staged panic's believability.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: NJ drones: Hoaxes, UFOs, witches not strange happenings in NJ"

            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "Imprisoned in a small wooden box with glass windows sits the doll Claire, bathed in red hell-light, tied to a chair \u2212 just as she was found years ago in the crawl space of a New Orleans home.\n\nNow, creepy Claire, whose is said to scratch, move its leg on occasion and is \"definitely demonic,\" is on display in Pensacola, along with dozens of alleged haunted dolls, Ouija boards, a full human skeleton, and many more \"haunted artifacts.\"\n\nThe Museum of Shadows opened last week just across the street from Warrington Elementary School on Navy Boulevard.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We already have had some school kids come by wanting to know what's going on here,\" said Museum of Shadows owner Nater Raterman, 40. \"They get pretty excited when they find out.\" (Children are welcome at the museum, but it might be a bit too scary for some. Just be warned.)\n\nThe Warrington location is the second Museum of Shadows for Raterman. He opened up his first Museum of Shadows in his home state of Nebraska in 2016, and that location has been featured on numerous networks, including the Travel Channel, Discovery Plus+, Destination America and Raterman is currently shooting a program to be streamed on Amazon Prime, with much of the filming taking place at the Pensacola location. The Nebraska location remains open.\n\nWhile Pensacola has a few ghost hunting groups and ghost tours, this is the city's first collection of haunted artifacts.\n\nRaterman is said to own the largest collection of haunted artifacts, with thousands of dolls, spirit boards, demon boards, clothing and so much more. They even have a collection of soil from the home of one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, Ed Gein, the \"Plainfield Ghoul,\" who served as a ghastly inspiration for various fictional weirdos and killers, from Norman Bates (\"Psycho\") to Leatherface (\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\") and Buffalo Bill (\"Silence of the Lambs\").\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe place will definitely give you the creeps, and, once past the entrance area and gift shop, and into the dark red glow of the museum, and you might, like me, feel a tightening in the chest and a cold chill lingering in the air. Visitors are given flashlights to navigate through the museum and observe the artifacts. While most are encased, some are not but visitors are prohibited from touching any items. (After telling my wife I was covering this story, she firmly said that I \"better not touch anything\" and not to bring any clinging spirit home with me.)\n\nRaterman and his girlfriend, Haleigh Sullivan of Pensacola, gave us \u2212 photographer Gregg Pachkowski and me \u2212 a tour of the museum, and it is Claire that is seen when one first enters, still tied to her chair.\n\n\"Claire is more on the evil side,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"She was found in a crawl space and tied to this chair,\" Raterman said. Before the doll was encased, it was said to scratch people, he said. \"She's very active and is definitely demonic.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there are more dolls, including a creepy old Raggedy Ann doll and an accompanying mirror donated by a woman in Los Angeles, who claimed the items led to her basement flooding and birds flying into her windows and then dying. The mirror is said to \"go dark\" at times and then show a person younger or older versions of themselves, as well as other figures appearing in the mirror.\n\n\"Don't look into the mirror,\" Sullivan warned, as I leaned closer to read the exhibit's details card. Not wanting to tempt fate, I didn't look.\n\nAnother doll is \"Eyes,\" donated by a woman from Long Island, New York, who said the doll blinks and moves and claimed to even capture the movement on video tape before deciding to donate it to Raterman, who receives haunted artifact donations from across the world.\n\nRaterman said he owns about 5,000 haunted artifacts and will be able to move various objects between the two museum locations. Raterman's most famous item is currently in Nebraska but will moving to its new Pensacola location soon. That item is \"Ayda,\" a 19th-century doll that was voted as the Most Haunted Doll in a Destination America poll, beating out the famous Annabelle doll that was the inspiration for \"The Conjuring\" and other films.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even without Ayda, the Pensacola location is plenty scary, especially if you're susceptible to haunts and scary stuff.\n\nThere's Sheila, a doll whose head keep falling off and who sometimes blinks when it's attached, and Chester, the skeleton found in an old Odd Fellows Lodge.\n\n\"He likes to communicate with the spirit box,\" Raterman said. \"Some are more active than others.\"\n\nAdmission to the Museum of Shadows is $25, and visitors can rent spirit boxes and other paranormal investigative tools to use during the visit. The museum also conducts ghost hunts at the location, with the most recent taking place on Friday \u2212 Friday the 13th. Visitors can bring their own paranormal equipment, though photographs at the museum are not allowed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRaterman began exploring the paranormal in 2006 when he moved into a Nebraska home and began experiencing strange activity, which he would eventually record, and post on social media. From there, his interest in the spooky was born and since then he has appeared on numerous ghost hunting and paranormal programs.\n\nHe said he's not scared of the unknown, but instead chooses to embrace it.\n\n\"I've investigated all over the world, so I'm used to it,'' said Raterman, who lives with Sullivan in Navarre, making his way between Florida and Nebraska. \"It becomes such a rush, and you never know what you're going to run into. Every item has an attachment for a specific reason. I believe there are other dimensions and that's more to the world than what we know and what we can see.\"\n\nAnother feature of the museum is the 10-minute sit-challenge when, for a $10 fee, a brave soul enters a small, darkened room with haunted items on the wall. There's a picture of a woman, \"Jan,\" whose picture is sometimes said to be surrounded by a mist, and a creepy \"Demon\" Ouija board, some haunted clown garb and more. Sit (or stand) in total darkness surrounded by the haunts for 10 minutes without tapping out (turning on a supplied flashlight) and you get to write your name on the room's wall showing you beat the challenge.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOf course, Gregg challenged me. Of course, I accepted. My wife said not to touch anything. She didn't say anything about sitting alone with haunted items.\n\nSo, I sat quietly, while Gregg, Raterman and Sullivan watched the live footage of me through a night-vision camera on a computer screen. The board was the creepiest, with the words \"Yes,\" \"Demon\" and \"No\" at the top, with the board various letters below. Sheets of rain pounded the roof of the museum, and, in the darkness, there was a sense of gloom in the room. I really felt weird about sitting there with the word \"Demon\" directly over my head. After a few minutes, I stood and stretched.\n\nTen minutes later, they came to get me, and I got to pen my name onto the wall.\n\nBut there was something.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Did you sense anything or stand for a reason?'' Gregg asked.\n\n\"No, just to stretch,\" I said. \"I'm old.\"\n\n\"Funny, because about that time an orb showed up,\" he told me. The others had seen it too.\n\nSure enough, he had shot some video and there was a tiny white orb spinning across, directly in front of me.\n\nI didn't feel anything, hear anything but rain, or see or experience anything too freaky. But I had some surgery recently and was heavily medicated, so I might not have noticed much anyway.\n\nThe Museum of Shadows is located at 341 N. Navy Blvd. and is open from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pensacola News Journal: Museum of Shadows Pensacola haunted artifact collection has doll Ayda"

            "article_content": "As a musician, being dubbed a one-hit-wonder who accidentally created 'one of creepiest songs ever' isn't exactly ideal.\n\nMost people would much prefer a row of Grammy awards positioned on their mantlepiece, but unfortunately for Tiny Tim, his tracks didn't get that kind of recognition.\n\nThe singer - real name Herbert Butros Khaury - has instead become synonymous with horror films and eerie online videos thanks to his cover of 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips'.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt was written by Al Dublin and Joe Burke for the 1929 Warner Brothers musical Gold Diggers of Broadway, before being performed by Nick Lucas.\n\nAlthough a lot of people wouldn't believe it, the song is actually 'romantic' and tells the story of a lovers rendezvous among the tulips which ends with a kiss.\n\nSo, how did Tiny Tim manage to drastically rebrand this sweet tune into the soundtrack of our nightmares?\n\nWell, let's start from the beginning.\n\nAdvert\n\nTiny Tim's hit track wasn't intended to be creepy (Bettmann/Getty)\n\nKhaury was first bit by the musical bug when he was just five years old after his father gifted him a vintage wind-up gramophone, so he started honing his craft when he was just a little boy.\n\nAs we all know, Tim had quite the unique voice and was well known for his falsetto and ability to play instruments - which allowed him to get a foot in the door of the entertainment industry.\n\nGigs led to TV appearances, and the New Yorker soon became a popular public figure.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe finally got his big break after recording his own version of 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' in 1968, almost four decades after it's initial release.\n\nTim's cover ended up reaching number 17 on the US Billboard charts and he cemented himself as a cult hero - but 56 years later, the singer is now instead regarded as a pillar in the paranormal films sphere.\n\nWe heard 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' in a completely different context to people half a century ago, which has played a big part in how we perceive the song.\n\nThe majority of people consider it to be downright disturbing due to the fact it's been used in frightening flicks such as 2010's Insidious.\n\nAdvert\n\nThose who have seen it will know all too well what kind of terror is evoked when the chilling track randomly starts playing on the record player - and sadly for Tim, people just can't shake it.\n\nThe fact a cover of 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' by Cherry Glazerr was also featured in the trailer for Insidious: Chapter 3 didn't help matters, either.\n\nBut the directors really sealed the fate of Tim's track when they again including his version in the fifth film of the franchise, Insidious: The Red Door.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt seems that all of our brains now correlate the whimsical tune with an absolute scare-fest, hence why it's become 'one of creepiest songs ever' in the eyes of music fans.\n\nOne said: \"It is not inherently a scary or horror-themed song. The song has been used ironically or juxtaposed with creepy or unsettling scenes in various media, creating an eerie and unsettling effect.\n\n\"This has led to its association with horror and fear in the minds of some people.\"\n\nAnother added: \"What makes it scary is the context of how its commonly portrayed nowadays, as it's used as a theme for a sociopathic serial killer, a murdering clown, etc.\"\n\nTiny Tim tragically suffered a heart attack on stage while performing at a ukulele festival in Massachusetts and passed away on 30 November, 1996.\n\nReports claim he was buried with both a ukulele and a single tulip in his coffin."

The specimen, a near-perfectly preserved male, was discovered washed ashore on a South Island beach, marking a monumental moment for both marine science and Maori cultural heritage.\n\nThe dissection revealed fascinating biological details, including nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, and vestigial teeth that provide insights into its evolutionary past. However, the whale's broken jaw and bruising led scientists to believe that head trauma might be the cause of its death, though the exact circumstances remain unknown.\n\nThe collaboration between scientists and local Maori communities was a unique aspect of this project, integrating Indigenous knowledge into the scientific process. Post-dissection, the whale's jawbone and teeth will be preserved by the Maori tribe, with 3D replicas to be displayed in museums. This event underscores New Zealand's status as a whale-stranding hotspot and emphasizes the cultural significance of whales as a taonga, or treasure, to the Maori people.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

So far we haven\u2019t heard any specific details about an ETA for a return to normal operation, but we\u2019ll update you as news comes in.\n\nUpdate, December 11, 2024 (07:26 PM ET): OpenAI has posted a status update on this evening\u2019s outage:\n\nChatGPT, Sora, and the API remain down. We have identified the issue and are rolling out a remediation. We are working as fast as we can to return service to normal and apologize for the downtime.\n\nUpdate, December 11, 2024 (09:33 PM ET): We\u2019re getting there, but not quite all the way back to regular operation just yet. OpenAI\u2019s latest update reads:\n\nAPI and ChatGPT traffic is partially recovered.

            "article_content": "Harvard University announced Thursday it\u2019s releasing a high-quality dataset of nearly 1 million public-domain books that could be used by anyone to train large language models and other AI tools. The dataset was created by Harvard\u2019s newly formed Institutional Data Initiative with funding from both Microsoft and OpenAI. It contains books scanned as part of the Google Books project that are no longer protected by copyright.\n\nAround five times the size of the notorious Books3 dataset that was used to train AI models like Meta\u2019s Llama, the Institutional Data Initiative's database spans genres, decades, and languages, with classics from Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, and Dante included alongside obscure Czech math textbooks and Welsh pocket dictionaries. Greg Leppert, executive director of the Institutional Data Initiative, says the project is an attempt to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by giving the general public, including small players in the AI industry and individual researchers, access to the sort of highly-refined and curated content repositories that normally only established tech giants have the resources to assemble. \u201cIt's gone through rigorous review,\u201d he says.\n\nLeppert believes the new public domain database could be used in conjunction with other licensed materials to build artificial intelligence models. \u201cI think about it a bit like the way that Linux has become a foundational operating system for so much of the world,\u201d he says, noting that companies would still need to use additional training data to differentiate their models from those of their competitors.\n\nBurton Davis, Microsoft\u2019s vice president and deputy general counsel for intellectual property, emphasized that the company\u2019s support for the project was in line with its broader beliefs about the value of creating \u201cpools of accessible data\u201d for AI startups to use that are \u201cmanaged in the public\u2019s interest.\u201d In other words, Microsoft isn\u2019t necessarily planning to swap out all of the AI training data it has used in its own models with public domain alternatives like the books in the new Harvard database. \u201cWe use publicly available data for the purposes of training our models,\u201d Davis says.\n\nTom Rubin, OpenAI's chief of intellectual property and content, described the company as \u201cdelighted\u201d to support the project in a statement.\n\nAs dozens of lawsuits filed over the use of copyrighted data for training AI wind their way through the courts, the future of how artificial intelligence tools are built hangs in the balance. If AI companies win their cases, they\u2019ll be able to keep scraping the internet without needing to enter into licensing agreements with copyright holders. But if they lose, AI companies could be forced to overhaul how their models get made. A wave of projects like the Harvard database are plowing forward under the assumption that\u2014no matter what happens\u2014there will be an appetite for public domain datasets."

            "article_content": "White & Case's Public Company Advisory Group has conducted a survey of publicly filed insider trading policies to assess emerging trends with respect to key insider trading policy terms. Starting with Form 10-K/20-F annual reports for June 30 fiscal year end companies, new SEC rules1 (under Item 408 of Regulation S-K) now require companies to disclose whether they have adopted an insider trading policy, and, if so, to file such policy as Exhibit 19 to their Form 10-K2 or Exhibit 11 to their Form 20-F. Companies with calendar year-end fiscal years will be required to meet these new insider trading policy requirements in their upcoming annual reports filed in early 2025.3\n\nWhite & Case Survey of Filed Insider Trading Policies\n\nWhite & Case has surveyed the insider trading policies recently filed by 50 public companies, including 25 Fortune 100 companies and 25 mid-cap companies. At their most basic level, a U.S. public company's insider trading policy prohibits insiders who possess material non-public information (\"MNPI\") from purchasing, selling, or otherwise trading in that company's securities, or in the securities of a related company about which the insider has MNPI as a result of serving as an employee, director or officer of his/her own company. They also typically prohibit \"tipping,\" or providing MNPI to anyone outside of the company and recommending that they purchase, sell, or otherwise trade in the company's securities or the securities of a related company. Our survey found the trends set forth below.\n\nHow long after its release is MNPI considered \"public\" (outside of quarterly blackout periods)?\n\nFor information to be considered \"public,\" it must be broadly disseminated, and the public market must be given adequate time to absorb and respond to the information. Companies adopt a variety of approaches on how much time should pass after the company's release of material information via broad dissemination before that information is no longer \"non-public.\" The data we found showcases this variety.\n\nTime Period for MNPI to be considered \"public\" Number of Companies Percentage of Companies One trading day 22 44% Two trading days 21 42% Three trading days 1 2% Not specified 6 12%\n\nWhen do quarterly \"blackout periods\" start and end, and who is subject to them?\n\nAll companies surveyed impose a quarterly blackout period, or a set period running from sometime near the end of a quarter until the release of financial results for such quarter, when all or certain insiders are prohibited from trading in the company's stock given their access to MNPI about those results.\n\nStart of quarterly blackout period\n\nThe start date of a quarterly blackout period should be determined in part by when insiders might first have knowledge of the company's quarterly results, which can in turn depend upon a company's particular data accumulation and financial close processes and timeline for preparing and accumulating consolidated quarterly financial information.\n\nStart of quarterly blackout period Number of Companies Percentage of Companies ~ Two weeks before quarter end 26 52% ~ Three to four weeks before quarter end 11 22% ~ Five to six weeks before quarter end 4 8% ~ One week before quarter end 3 6% Last day of quarter 3 6% Other 3 6%\n\nEnd of quarterly blackout period\n\nThe end date for a quarterly blackout period is tied to the release of quarterly financial information, but the precise date depends on when information is considered to be broadly disseminated in the public market. To be clear, in every policy that specifically addresses both points, the end date for quarterly blackouts is the same time period for when a company considers MNPI in general to be \"public.\"\n\nEnd of quarterly blackout period Number of Companies Percentage of Companies One full trading day after earnings are released 27 54% Two full trading days after earnings are released 20 40% Three full trading days after earnings are released 1 2% Company discretion 2 4%\n\nInsiders subject to quarterly blackouts\n\nA significant majority of companies surveyed do not subject all insiders to quarterly blackouts. Instead, they only impose quarterly blackouts on directors and Section 16 officers/executive officers, along with other employees with access to quarterly financial information.\n\nGroup of insiders subject to quarterly blackout periods Number of companies Percentage of companies Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and other designated employees with access to quarterly financial information 43 86% Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and all other employees 7 14%\n\nWho is subject to preclearance procedures?\n\nAll but one surveyed company imposes preclearance procedures, or procedures by which all or certain insiders must receive pre-approval from the administrator of the policy before trading. The insiders subject to preclearance procedures largely, but not entirely, align with those who are subject to a company's quarterly blackout periods.\n\nGroup of insiders subject to preclearance procedures Number of companies Percentage of companies Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and other designated employees with access to quarterly financial information 43 86% Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and all other employees 2 4% Directors and Section 16 officers/executive officers only 4 8% Not addressed in insider trading policy4 1 2%\n\nHow are hedging and pledging addressed?\n\nAll but one company surveyed prohibits hedging and/or pledging in some form. The overwhelming majority extend this prohibition across all insiders, and allow no exceptions, with only a small minority of two companies providing exceptions or distinguishing treatment of hedging and pledging among categories of insiders. One of these companies allows for an exception to the prohibition on pledging where a person wishes to pledge company securities as collateral for a loan (not including margin debt) and clearly demonstrates the financial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the pledged securities. The other company allows hedging and pledging for any insider if the transaction is for legitimate non-speculative purposes and the insider obtains prior approval from the relevant parties at the company.\n\nGroup of insiders Who is prohibited from hedging/pledging? Are exceptions allowed? Number of companies Percentage of companies Number of companies Percentage of companies All insiders (including all employees) 46 88% 2 4% Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and other designated employees, with all other insiders strongly discouraged5 2 4% 0 0% Directors and Section 16 officers/executive officers only 1 2% 0 0% Not addressed in insider trading policy 1 2% n/a n/a\n\nHow are gifts addressed?\n\nTreatment of gifts of company securities in insider trading policies has become a hot topic recently, in part due to the SEC's statement on gifts in dicta in a recent rule adopting release.6 The vast majority (72%) of companies explicitly address gifts, with varying treatments.\n\nHow are gifts treated? Number of companies Percentage of companies The same as other trading activity (prohibited when insider has MNPI or is subject to blackout; requires preclearance) 28 56% Allowed even when the insider is in possession of MNPI or in a blackout, unless the insider has reason to believe that the recipient will sell at a time when the insider has MNPI 11 22% Treatment depends on the circumstances; insider must consult with the legal department and all Section 16 officers must pre-clear gifts 1 2% Charitable and non-profit gifting by directors and officers is permitted at any time (no preclearance required) 1 2% Not explicitly addressed 14 28%\n\nHow are other transactions addressed?\n\nNet exercises of options: 56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out net exercise of options (without any corresponding market sales) as exempt from the restrictions in the insider trading policy.\n\n56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out net exercise of options (without any corresponding market sales) as exempt from the restrictions in the insider trading policy. ESPP purchases: 56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out employee stock purchase plan purchased made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not have employee stock purchase plans).\n\n56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out employee stock purchase plan purchased made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not have employee stock purchase plans). 401(k) plan purchases: 36% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out 401(k) plan purchases in company stock made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not offer investment of their employees' 401(k) plans in company stock).\n\n36% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out 401(k) plan purchases in company stock made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not offer investment of their employees' 401(k) plans in company stock). Changes in the form of beneficial ownership: While a feature of some policies, none of the policies in our survey specifically addresses changes in the form of ownership only.\n\nHow is shadow trading addressed ?\n\n\"Shadow trading\" is the practice of an insider trading shares of another company that is \"economically linked\" to the insider's company, while in possession of MNPI about the insider's company. Companies are \"economically linked\" when the MNPI about the insider's company could influence the market price of shares of the other company. The SEC recently successfully prosecuted SEC v. Matthew Panuwat, an insider trading case based on shadow trading.7 This may cause companies to reconsider the extent to which their insider trading prohibitions apply to securities of other companies, considering the potential reputational consequences of an insider trading action. In our survey, 18% of companies specifically prohibit \"shadow trading\" by insiders.8\n\nWho administers the policy?\n\nPolicy administrator Number of Companies Percentage of Companies General counsel (GC)/chief legal officer 28 56% Compliance officer 8 16% Corporate secretary's office/corporate governance department 7 14% Chief executive officer (CEO) 6 12% Chief financial officer (CFO) 6 12% Legal/compliance department 5 10% In-house securities counsel 2 4%\n\nAre waivers of the policy permitted, and if so, who can approve them?\n\nA majority (56%) of companies surveyed permit waivers of the policy, but differ with respect to the individual or group of individuals approving these waivers.\n\nApprover of waivers Number of Companies Percentage of Companies GC/assistant GC/chief legal officer 12 24% Compliance officer 7 14% Corporate law department 3 6% Corporate secretary 2 4% CFO 1 2% Audit committee 1 2% Board of directors 1 2%\n\nDoes the policy explicitly apply post-termination?\n\nHalf of the companies surveyed explicitly extend the application of the policy past the date an individual ceases to be employed by or serving the company, while the other half do not.\n\nExplicit post-termination application Number of companies Percentage of companies Yes, to all insiders, until any MNPI they possess has become public or is no longer material (for those subject to blackouts, the later of the opening of the blackout period or until MNPI becomes public or is no longer material) 22 44% Yes, to Section 16 officers and designated employees only, until the later of 90 days or when any MNPI they possess has become public or is no longer material 2 4% Yes, to all insiders, without specifying a period 1 2% No 25 50%\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile this preliminary data is instructive, it is based on a limited sample selected only from companies with a June 30 or September 30 fiscal year end; policies filed in the upcoming Form 10-K/20-F reporting season will provide a more robust picture of market practices and procedures. In addition, companies' policies should and will vary based on their specific circumstances and needs, and we expect policies and practices to evolve as companies continue to update and refine their policies in light of emerging market trends.\n\n1 Our alert on these rules is available here.\n\n2 This exhibit filing requirement is satisfied if all of the company's insider trading policies and procedures are included in its \"code of ethics,\" as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, and the company has filed its code of ethics as Exhibit 14 to its Form 10-K pursuant to Item 406(c)(1) and Item 601(b)(14). In these cases, the exhibit index should list Exhibit 19, Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, and include a statement similar to the following: \"Included in Exhibit 14.\"\n\n3 Companies with a June 30 or September 30 fiscal-year end were already required to include this disclosure in their recently-filed Form 10-Ks/20-Fs.\n\n4 This company references additional policy documents that may be supplied to company personnel who are notified that they are subject to such additional policies.\n\n5 One of these companies also requires any insider to preclear a hedge or pledge of company securities.\n\n6 In the context of the 2023 rule change for Section 16 reporting of gifts, the SEC provided commentary on gifts, noting \"that a gift followed closely by a sale, under conditions where the value at the time of donation and sale affects the tax or other benefits obtained by the donor, may raise the same policy concerns as more common forms of insider trading\u2026.[B]ecause the donor is in a position to benefit from the asset's value at the time of donation and sale, the donor may be motivated to give at a time when the donor is aware of [MNPI] and may expect the donee to sell prior to the disclosure of such information.\" The SEC also stated that \"a gift made with the knowledge that the donee will soon sell can be seen as in effect a sale for cash followed by gift of the cash.\"\n\n7 For details on the case, see our prior alerts here and here, and for a discussion of the implications of the case for insider trading policies, see here.\n\n8 The 18% of companies surveyed that specifically prohibit \"shadow trading\" by insiders were mainly part of the group of established Fortune 100 companies."

            "article_content": "Led by Bucknell University Professor Jack Gallimore, physics & astronomy, an international team of astronomers and students, including Bucknell physics student Virginia Hostetter '25, set out on a new way to study NGC 1068, a well-known, relatively nearby (45 to 50-million light years away), bright galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center.\n\nTheir research had twin goals: astrometric mapping of the galaxy's radio continuum and measurements of polarization for its water masers \u2014 naturally occurring sources of microwave radio emissions. In radio astronomy, water masers observed at a frequency of 22 GHz are particularly useful because they can shine through much of the dust and gas that obscures optical wavelengths around the black hole.\n\nUsing the High Sensitivity Array (HSA) \u2014 a multi-facility network supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) \u2014 the international team observed for the first time evidence of magnetic filaments in the accretion disk surrounding the galaxy's supermassive black hole. Their discovery was announced Wednesday by the NRAO and reported in a recent paper published by The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nBy measuring the polarization of water masers and the continuum of radio emissions from NGC 1068, the team generated a map revealing the compact radio source now known as NGC 1068*, as well as mysterious extended structures of more faint emissions.\n\nMapping the astrometric distribution of NGC 1068 and its water masers revealed that they are spread along filaments of structure.\n\nProfessor Jack Gallimore, physics & astronomy. Photo courtesy of Jack Gallimore\n\n\"It really came out in these new observations that these filaments of maser spots line up like beads on a string,\" Gallimore said in the NRAO story. The team was stunned to see that there was a clear offset \u2014 a displacement angle \u2014 between the radio continuum showing the structures at the galaxy's core and the locations of the masers themselves. \"The configuration is unstable, so we are probably observing the source of a magnetically-launched outflow,\" he said.\n\nHSA measurements of the polarization of these water masers revealed striking evidence of magnetic fields.\n\n\"No one has ever seen polarization in water masers outside our galaxy,\" Gallimore said. Similar to the looping structures seen on our sun's surface as prominences, the polarization pattern of these water masers clearly indicates that magnetic fields are also at the root of these light-year-scale structures as well. \"Looking at the filaments and seeing that the polarization vectors are perpendicular to them, that's the key to confirming that they are magnetically driven structures. It's exactly what you'd expect to see.\"\n\nPrevious studies of the region hinted at patterns usually associated with magnetic fields, but such conclusions remained beyond the reach of observing technology until recently. This discovery is the first to confirm the existing theory.\n\n\"Only the HSA has the combination of resolution and sensitivity needed to map out magnetic fields using polarized light,\" said Gallimore.\n\nTheir findings reveal evidence of a compact central radio source (the galaxy's supermassive black hole), clear polarization of the water masers indicating structure within NGC 1068's magnetic fields, and spectacular extended features across the continuum of radio frequencies. Together, these findings indicate that magnetic fields are the underlying drivers of these phenomena.\n\nPlenty of mysteries remain, however. Within the radio continuum map, for instance, there is a diffuse, faint protrusion that the team nicknamed \"the foxtail,\" which extends northward from the central region.\n\n\"We said to ourselves when we set out to do this, \u2018let's see if we can really push the limits and get a good continuum as well as polarization data. And both of those goals succeeded,\" Gallimore said. \"With the NSF NRAO High Sensitivity Array, we detected water megamaser polarization for the first time, and we also made a really amazing continuum map that we're still trying to wrap our minds around.\"\n\nSpecial thanks to the NRAO and author Jessi Almstead for the use of their story."

The specimen, a near-perfectly preserved male, was discovered washed ashore on a South Island beach, marking a monumental moment for both marine science and Maori cultural heritage.\n\nThe dissection revealed fascinating biological details, including nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, and vestigial teeth that provide insights into its evolutionary past. However, the whale's broken jaw and bruising led scientists to believe that head trauma might be the cause of its death, though the exact circumstances remain unknown.\n\nThe collaboration between scientists and local Maori communities was a unique aspect of this project, integrating Indigenous knowledge into the scientific process. Post-dissection, the whale's jawbone and teeth will be preserved by the Maori tribe, with 3D replicas to be displayed in museums. This event underscores New Zealand's status as a whale-stranding hotspot and emphasizes the cultural significance of whales as a taonga, or treasure, to the Maori people.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

His 261.2 passing yards per game represents his lowest average since 2019, while his 89.0 passer rating is his worst mark since 2014.\n\nCousins' subpar performance is especially worrisome after he signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract to join Atlanta as a free agent in March.\n\nDespite his turnover issues and the Falcons' inconsistent offense, Morris has remained steadfast in his approach to the top quarterback spot on the depth chart.\n\nHe confirmed that Cousins would remain Atlanta's starter following a 42-21 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.\n\nDianna Russini of The Athletic also reported that the Falcons haven't held any \"internal discussions\" regarding a change at quarterback.\n\nEven though Cousins is expected to retain his status as the starter, Morris also expressed his support for Penix as the team's eventual top signal-caller.\n\n\"I told you right from the beginning, he's our future,\" Morris said on Thursday, per Raimondi.\n\nPenix, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, still appears to have the support of the coaching staff as a long-term option."

            "article_content": "Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 MSRP $279.99 Score Details \u201cCanon's MegaTank Pixma G4280 is an affordable inkjet tank with economical ink, but there are some trade-offs at that price.\u201d Pros Low price for an inkjet tank\n\nIncludes 2 years of ink\n\nInk costs are super low\n\nSetup was quick and easy Cons Slow scanning and printing\n\nLow-contrast plain paper photos\n\nDisplay is small\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Specs Design Printing performance Special features Software and compatibility Price Is the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon recently introduced the new MegaTank Pixma G4280 all-in-one, a low-cost inkjet tank printer that refills with bottles instead of cartridges. That means ink lasts much longer and costs significantly less.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPrice isn\u2019t the only important consideration when you\u2019re shopping for the best printer. I went hands-on with the MegaTank Pixma G4280 to test print quality and speed, make copies, and scan photos to check out the automatic document feeder (ADF) and flatbed scanner.\n\nSpecs\n\nCanon MegaTank Pixma G4280 Dimensions 16.4 x 14.3 x 8.4 inches Weight 16.5 pounds Print speed 11 ppm (black), 6 ppm (color) Copy speed 8 cpm (black), 3.5 cpm (color) Print resolution 4800 x 1200 dpi Scan resolution 600 x 1200 dpi Ports Hi-Speed USB Paper capacity 100 sheets Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, dual band\n\nDesign\n\nThe MegaTank Pixma G4280 is very compact for an all-in-one printer with an ADF. The footprint is 16.4 inches by 14.3 inches and it stands just 8.4 inches high. The weight is 16.5 pounds, so it\u2019s easy to unbox and move around.\n\nThe lightly textured body in off-white works well in a home office and every corner is rounded, softening the appearance. It\u2019s a tank printer, so the ink levels are visible at a glance. The black tank is on the left side of the printer, with cyan, magenta, and yellow on the right.\n\nThe adjustable central control panel tilts up 45 degrees for easy viewing while standing or seated. Canon gave the MegaTank Pixma G4280 a 2.7-inch color touchscreen for easy access to menus. The controls also include buttons to make monochrome or color copies with one touch.\n\nThe main paper tray is in the back and holds 100 sheets. The ADF can handles 35 pages at a time. Overall, it\u2019s a nice design, but paper capacity could be larger.\n\nPrinting performance\n\nThe Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 is fast for short documents, completing the first page in about seven seconds. Inkjet printers don\u2019t have to warm up before starting, so they can beat laser printers in a sprint.\n\nFor longer print jobs, I felt the slowdown. Monochrome prints have a maximum speed of 11 pages per minute (ppm) and color manages just 6 ppm.\n\nA faster inkjet tank like Epson\u2019s EcoTank ET-3850 (16 ppm) or EcoTank Pro ET-5850 (25 ppm) cost more upfront, but offer economical printing without having to wait as long for the prints and copies.\n\nThat said, color and black-and-white documents look professional, and the MegaTank Pixma G4280 supports borderless printing. Fine lines and small print are sharp and easy to read.\n\nPhoto quality is good on glossy paper, but contrast is a little low. That problem is more obvious on plain paper where blacks look gray.\n\nWith tinkering, it\u2019s possible to improve picture quality. For example, selecting Photo Matte as the paper type improves plain paper photo quality.\n\nThere are better photo printers out there, and some are quite affordable.\n\nSpecial features\n\nThere\u2019s an option for duplex in copy settings, but the printer has what Canon calls semi-auto, which means I had to manually reinsert each sheet to complete the scan. It works, but takes time.\n\nIf you need to copy double-sided documents often, Canon\u2019s Maxify GX2020 costs more, but the full-duplex capability will save you a huge amount of time.\n\nThe copy quality is good and relatively fast for a slow printer. There are options to reduce, enlarge, and copy multiple pages to a single sheet, saving paper costs.\n\nThe flatbed scanner captures up to 600 dots per inch (dpi), which is good enough in most cases. For photos and negatives, you might want a dedicated scanner to maintain maximum resolution.\n\nSoftware and compatibility\n\nInstalling the MegaTank Pixma G4280 took about 15 minutes and was quite simple. I plugged in power, scanned the QR code on the printer\u2019s screen to get the app, and pressed the link button to connect Wi-Fi. There\u2019s a USB-B port if you prefer to use a wired connection to a computer.\n\nCanon ships the MegaTank Pixma G4280 with four full ink bottles, including a large supply of cyan, magenta, and yellow, along with a double-sized container of black. The box also contained replaceable black and color printheads.\n\nEverything was clearly marked. I installed the printheads and filled the ink tanks in about two minutes. The printer alerted me that the initial ink priming takes about seven minutes, so I could be productive elsewhere instead of waiting for it to finish.\n\nLike most major brands, Canon printers are easy to connect to Windows PCs and Macs. The Canon Print app allows printing and scanning from mobile devices and Chromebooks.\n\nPrice\n\nCanon\u2019s list price for the MegaTank Pixma G4280 is $280, but the printer is often available for $230. The low upfront price might catch your eye, but the real value is in the ink, which Canon estimates is equal to about $1,000 worth of ink cartridges.\n\nThe included bottles hold enough ink to last up to two years, equivalent to 30 black (PG-260) and color (CL-261) cartridges. That\u2019s the type used in the Canon\u2019s budget-priced Pixma TR7020a inkjet printer.\n\nWith full tanks, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 can print up to 6,000 monochrome pages and 7,700 color pages. Based on current ink prices, that means each color document costs about five-tenths of a cent per page, while black ink costs drop to two-tenths of a cent per page.\n\nIs the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 is inexpensive for an inkjet tank printer, but there are trade-offs to keep the cost that low. It\u2019s slower than cartridge-based inkjets and laser printers and has limited 100-sheet paper capacity. The semi-auto duplex ADF works, but is slow and requires your presence through the entire process.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t in a hurry, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 minimizes ink costs. It handles color document copies and prints nicely. Glossy photo prints also look good.\n\nAll in all, though, there are better all-in-one printers with full-duplex ADFs, and you can save you money on specialty paper costs by choosing the best photo printers, which can print with good quality on plain paper.\n\nThat means Canon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 could work well in a home office where you aren\u2019t sharing the printer with co-workers, but it\u2019s compromises make it harder to recommend for its intended audience."

From fintech to healthcare and hospitality, I have had the privilege of developing and deploying innovative AI solutions that blend technical excellence with business strategy. My expertise spans a wide range of areas, including generative AI, predictive analytics, and data observability.\n\nBeyond my technical work, I am a passionate mentor, a published co-author of books on AI and ML, and a patented innovator. I thrive on building solutions that not only solve complex problems but also inspire others to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.\n\nYou\u2019ve had an extraordinary career in AI and machine learning, spanning various industries like healthcare, hospitality, and fintech. Can you walk us through your journey and how it has shaped your current role as Director of Advanced Data Science at Marriott International?\n\nI began my professional journey in consumer-focused research for a CPG brand, here I developed a fascination for consumer behaviour change indicated through and their business implications . This passion deepened as I worked on leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze behavioral changes and their impact on business outcomes. My focus has always been on helping organizations use patterns in data to inform strategy and drive results.\n\nWorking in large scale consulting such as Wipro brought me close to enterprises\u2019s pain areas and help create machine learning cored solutions for them. In 2012, I established a Center of Excellence for analytics at Agilis, a lesser-known company at the time, helping telecom clients predict fraud and mitigate risks like churn. Over the years, Agilis went through multiple acquisitions, becoming Infogix and later Precisely Inc. During this period, I led the development of a bespoke software product with an embedded ML-based \u2018Anomaly Detection\u2019 system. This solution predicts \u2018data drift and shift\u2019, ensuring data quality and integrity. Today, it\u2019s a multimillion-dollar offering used by Fortune 100 companies to maintain operational excellence of data dependent functions.\n\nCurrently, as the Director of Advanced Data Science at Marriott International, I lead transformative AI initiatives, including personalization models, generative AI applications, and global acquisition strategies. My journey has been about building scalable AI solutions that align technical innovation with business impact, and I continue to be inspired by the limitless potential of machine learning and AI to transform industries.\n\nIn your article, \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed\u201d, you discuss the challenges of fragmented chatbot strategies. What inspired you to advocate for a unified chatbot framework, and how do you see it transforming industries?\n\nThe inspiration came from witnessing the inefficiencies and frustrations caused by fragmented chatbot strategies in enterprises\u2014siloed implementations, inconsistent user experiences, and high maintenance costs. I realized the need for a unified framework that could streamline development, ensure scalability, and provide a seamless experience across touchpoints.\n\nA unified chatbot framework transforms industries by enabling businesses to deliver consistent, personalized interactions while reducing operational overhead. It empowers enterprises to integrate.\n\nEnterprises often face the dilemma of balancing ROI with the complexity of AI solutions. How do you approach this challenge in your projects, and can you share a specific example where you had to make such decisions?\n\nBalancing ROI with AI complexity is a common challenge, but I approach it by focusing on simplification and scalability without compromising value. In my article, The Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed, I discussed how fragmented chatbot strategies often create inefficiencies and diminish user satisfaction. To address this, I advocate for a unified framework that prioritizes intent-driven design and reusable components.\n\nA specific example is a chatbot project for a travel enterprise. Initially, individual bots were handling separate use cases like booking management, trip planning, and customer support, leading to redundancy and confusion. By implementing a unified triage bot as the primary entry point, we streamlined user interactions and routed intents to specialized APIs. This reduced operational complexity and boosted ROI by consolidating efforts into a cohesive system.\n\nThe result? Enhanced user satisfaction and scalable deployment across multiple business units\u2014all while maintaining a strong ROI through reduced maintenance costs and improved efficiency. Simplifying complexity is not just about technology\u2014it\u2019s about creating value for both users and businesses.\n\nYour work highlights generative AI\u2019s role in creating personalized user experiences, such as credit card recommendations. How do you envision the future of generative AI in personalization across industries?\n\nGenerative AI is revolutionizing personalization by creating tailored, intuitive experiences that resonate with individual users. In the context of chatbots, like those for credit card recommendations, generative AI plays a pivotal role in breaking decision paralysis. It simplifies complex choices by presenting relevant options in a conversational and engaging way, helping customers make faster and more confident decisions.\n\nLooking ahead, I envision generative AI expanding its influence across industries\u2014from retail to healthcare\u2014where it will not only personalize user interactions but also anticipate needs, provide proactive solutions, and streamline decision-making. The future of personalization lies in AI\u2019s ability to combine deep contextual understanding with dynamic adaptability, ultimately creating experiences that are both efficient and deeply human-centered.\n\nYou\u2019ve authored books, published scholarly articles, and filed patents in advanced AI domains. How do you balance your role as a technical leader and a thought leader in the ever-evolving field of AI?\n\nBalancing my roles as a technical and thought leader in AI comes down to a shared foundation: curiosity , giving back to learners community and a commitment to impact. As a technical leader, I focus on driving practical innovations\u2014building systems like scalable enterprise chatbots or anomaly detection frameworks that solve real business problems. This hands-on work keeps me connected to the evolving challenges and opportunities in AI.\n\nAs a thought leader, I view my role as amplifying these learnings for a broader audience. Writing articles on social blogs like \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots\u201d allows me to distill complex ideas into actionable strategies, fostering industry-wide collaboration and growth. It\u2019s a synergy\u2014my technical work feeds my thought leadership, while my engagement with the AI community sharpens my ability to lead in dynamic environments.\n\nUltimately, the key is staying grounded in purpose: using AI not just to innovate, but to inspire and drive meaningful change.\n\nMany of your projects aim to enhance customer experience through AI, like anomaly detection and marketing optimization. How do you align technical innovation with customer-centric outcomes?\n\nI believe the key to aligning technical innovation with customer-centric outcomes is to start with the end in mind\u2014understanding what the customer truly values. Whether it\u2019s anomaly detection, marketing optimization, or enterprise chatbots, my approach combines cutting-edge AI techniques with a deep focus on creating seamless and meaningful experiences for users.\n\nFor instance, in my article \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed,\u201d I emphasized building unified frameworks that deliver consistent, personalized customer interactions. Similarly, my work on marketing optimization involves leveraging predictive models to understand behavioral patterns, enabling hyper-targeted engagement that feels intuitive to the customer.\n\nAt the core, it\u2019s about using AI as a bridge\u2014not just to solve technical problems but to anticipate and enhance the customer journey. By embedding intelligence into every interaction, we not only drive business impact but also create solutions that resonate with people in real and tangible ways.\n\nWith increasing emphasis on data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, how do you ensure that your AI models remain compliant while delivering actionable insights?\n\nEnsuring compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA starts with embedding guardrails into the design and deployment of AI models. Guardrails ensure that privacy, security, and transparency are foundational, not an afterthought.\n\nIn my work, I advocate for privacy-by-design principles\u2014data minimization, anonymization, and secure pipelines are non-negotiables. For instance, when building models for personalized customer targeting or chatbots, we ensure that data used is aggregated and anonymized, aligning with both regulations and user trust.\n\nBalancing compliance with actionable insights requires robust governance frameworks. These frameworks monitor data usage and provide explainability, ensuring that while insights drive business value, they do so ethically and legally. In the age of AI, it\u2019s not just about what we can do with data, but what we should do, and that\u2019s where compliance meets innovation.\n\nAs an internationally recognized expert, what advice would you give aspiring data scientists looking to make a significant impact in the field of AI and machine learning?\n\nMy advice to aspiring data scientists is simple: focus on solving practical problems and always prioritize the user experience. AI and machine learning aren\u2019t just about building sophisticated models\u2014they\u2019re about creating solutions that make a tangible difference.\n\nStart by immersing yourself in real-world challenges. Learn how businesses operate, identify pain points, and think about how data and AI can address them. For instance, in my own journey, I\u2019ve worked on everything from predictive analytics to creating a unified chatbot framework. These experiences taught me that the best solutions are the ones that simplify complexity and put the user first.\n\nStay curious, keep experimenting, and don\u2019t shy away from asking questions like: \u201cHow does this impact the end user?\u201d and \u201cIs this scalable for enterprise needs?\u201d A data scientist\u2019s true power lies not just in technical expertise but in the ability to translate it into meaningful impact. Keep that as your north star, and you\u2019ll create solutions that truly transform industries."

            "article_content": "KYIV \u2014 Russia launched a large-scale aerial attack Friday on Ukraine involving dozens of cruise missiles and nearly 200 drones, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, in what Moscow described as a direct response to Ukraine\u2019s recent use of American missiles against targets inside Russia. The attack was \u201cone of the largest strikes targeting our energy infrastructure\u201d to date, Zelensky said.\n\nRussia launched at least 93 missiles, he said, including at least one North Korean weapon. Ukraine was able to down 81 of them, 11 of which were intercepted with F-16 jets, he added. But some struck targets, expanding the already widespread power blackouts caused by prior Russian strikes.\n\nRussia has regularly struck power grids across the country in a bid to damage Ukraine\u2019s economy and civilian morale on the darkest and coldest days of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry posted on Telegram that the attack was in direct response to a Dec. 11 Ukrainian attack on a Russian airfield near the southwestern city of Taganrog, when it said six U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles were used.\n\nUkraine had long demanded that Washington allow it to fire the missiles into Russia, saying that only deep strikes against Russian targets could change the course of the war. The Biden administration resisted until last month, when it approved the limited use of ATACMS inside Russia in what Moscow has described as an escalation of the war.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday\u2019s attack was, \u201camong other things,\u201d in reply to Ukrainian strikes on Taganrog.\n\n\u201cA massive strike was carried out by air- and sea-based long-range precision weapons of destruction and strike drones against critical facilities of Ukraine\u2019s fuel and energy infrastructure that support the work of the military-industrial complex,\u201d Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry wrote Friday. \u201cThe purpose of the strike has been achieved. All facilities have been hit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine\u2019s biggest private power company, DTEK, said Friday that Russia targeted energy infrastructure including thermal power plants. \u201cThe massive attack caused significant damage to the power plants\u2019 equipment,\u201d it said, adding that there were no casualties and that energy workers were trying to restore operations.\n\nWith repeated strikes on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, many businesses now rely on generators and large external batteries to keep their doors open. As cold weather sets in across the country, many Ukrainians fear that such attacks will plunge Ukraine into darkness in the months to come.\n\nUkraine\u2019s national power grid operator Ukrenergo said \u201cenergy facilities in several regions\u201d were damaged by the strikes and that engineers were carrying out emergency restoration work.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the Ukrainian power system continues to recover after 12 massive attacks by Russians since the beginning of this year,\u201d the operator said in a statement. Ukrenergo warned consumers that there would be \u201chourly outages\u201d for households and \u201ccapacity limitation schedules\u201d for businesses as a result. It added that winter weather, including ice and strong winds, was adding to challenges, with areas in Kyiv and elsewhere without power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce again, the energy sector across Ukraine is under massive attack,\u201d Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on social media.\n\nUkrainians sought shelter in areas including the capital, Kyiv, the second-largest city Kharkiv, and Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west as air raid alerts were issued across the country, the air force said. Although western Ukraine has typically suffered fewer attacks than elsewhere in the country, energy facilities there have been repeatedly targeted.\n\nThe attack comes just over a month before President-elect Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated in Washington. Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine and recently met with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Ukraine insists it needs a NATO invitation and that it will not accept any negotiated peace deal that helps Russian President Vladimir Putin achieve his goals of isolating Ukraine from the west.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelensky accused Putin of \u201cterrorizing millions of people\u201d and called for a \u201cstrong\u201d reaction from global allies and further sanctions on him.\n\n\u201cThis is Putin\u2019s so-called \u2018peace plan\u2019 \u2014 to destroy everything. This is how he seeks \u2018negotiations\u2019 \u2014 by terrorizing millions of people,\u201d Zelensky wrote Friday. \u201cHe faces no limits in range or in acquiring the necessary components to produce these missiles. Oil revenues give him enough resources to believe in his impunity.\u201d\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha echoed the sentiment.\n\n\u201cRussia aims to deprive us of energy,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI reiterate my call for the urgent delivery of 20 NASAMS, HAWK, or IRIS-T air defense systems,\u201d he added."

            "article_content": "Opinion:\n\nRussia\u2019s military intervention in Syria since 2015 has allowed it to assert its power, creating a misleading perception of its military might. In contrast, Ukraine has dispelled that illusion and significantly injured its invaders.\n\nRussia\u2019s decadelong involvement in Syria has failed, much like its invasion of Ukraine. Although Russia\u2019s stature has declined, it will keep up the pretense.\n\nNow that the rebels have ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, they have also exposed Russia\u2019s fragility and difficulty supporting its client states like neighboring Belarus. This turn of events will undoubtedly change the geopolitical landscape, particularly affecting Iran, which is providing Russia with drones. That bodes well for Israel.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring in 2011, people rose up and ousted the leaders of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen. However, Russia protected Syria, enabling Assad to remain in power. Russia has also benefited, gaining a foothold in the Middle East and establishing two military bases. The country has invested heavily in Syria by deploying troops, conducting airstrikes and providing economic support \u2014 money down the tubes. Russia has given refuge to Assad, and even Russia\u2019s state-controlled media can\u2019t hide that dark reality.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has described Russia as little more than a large gas station with nuclear weapons, suggesting that its influence is mainly regional \u2014 thinking with which President Joe Biden agrees.\n\nUkraine has underscored this critique by stating that Russia cannot effectively fight on two fronts and that Ukraine\u2019s military efforts have significantly weakened Russia\u2019s capacity to exert international influence. This experience serves as a warning to other countries that they cannot rely on Russia. To engage in the conflict with Ukraine, Russia must dedicate all of its workforce and weaponry.\n\nMoreover, Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy symbolize the quest for sovereignty and the defense of democracy, aligning themselves with the rebels who overthrew Assad and, by extension, opposed Russia\u2019s presence in Syria. At the same time, Ukraine highlights Russia\u2019s alleged war crimes, drawing parallels to its actions in Syria, particularly the indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians.\n\nKyiv portrays itself as the bulwark against Russian imperialism and the \u201ciron curtain\u201d \u2014 an ironic label \u2014 to prevent further aggression. Any Russian notion that it could remake the Soviet Union and relive its \u201cglory days\u201d is an illusion: Ukraine and Syria are perfect illustrations.\n\nRussia is a declining power struggling to maintain its ambitions beyond its borders.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the world welcomed Russia into the international fold. But Vladimir Putin\u2019s rise to power in 2000 has gradually reversed progress to the point where his regime has imprisoned more political prisoners than Leonid Brezhnev in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cToday, Russia respects neither borders nor human rights. There are no free media or honest elections,\u201d said Poland\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Radek Sikorski, at a December meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt proved too difficult to emerge from their own political culture. Russia\u2019s rulers chose the path of aggressive, repressive kleptocracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not taken in by your lies, and we know what you are doing. You are trying to rebuild the Russian empire. We will not let you. We will resist you every inch of the way. You are successful in destroying Ukraine. But you are also destroying the future of your own country.\u201d\n\nAlthough Russia has managed to avoid an economic collapse, its war with Ukraine and military involvement in Syria have negatively affected its economy. The country\u2019s national wealth supports its war efforts rather than build its economy.\n\nAdditionally, Western nations and their allies have imposed extensive sanctions on Russia\u2019s banking, energy and military industries, restricting its ability to obtain essential technologies.\n\nHistorically, Russia\u2019s energy exports have provided economic muscle. However, Europe, which has relied on Russian oil and gas, is now imposing a boycott on these resources. While it directs some of this energy to China and India, Russia sells it at discounted prices. Consequently, Russia is experiencing inflation and a shortage of goods.\n\nRussia has drained its coffers, and Assad\u2019s fall has further damaged its reputation. Indeed, the emperor has no clothes \u2014 a cautionary tale for other aligned leaders in Iran, North Korea and Belarus.\n\nKen Silverstein has covered energy and the environment for years. He wrote this for InsideSources.com."

If you want to write it out, it\u2019s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.\n\n\"This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.\"\n\nApparently, all these wires help to draw information from parallel universes (Google)\n\nAdvert\n\nProfessor Deutsch is a physicist at the University of Oxford, and is known for his work in quantum computing after putting in research during the 1990s, supporting Neven's claims.\n\nSkeptics cast doubts\n\nHowever, some doubters say that these claims about its performance are based on the company's own benchmark to measure quantum performance, and that it doesn't prove that people in parallel universes are getting our information for us.\n\nThe development of Willow and the scientific findings behind it have been published in the journal, Nature."

            "article_content": "Led by Bucknell University Professor Jack Gallimore, physics & astronomy, an international team of astronomers and students, including Bucknell physics student Virginia Hostetter '25, set out on a new way to study NGC 1068, a well-known, relatively nearby (45 to 50-million light years away), bright galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center.\n\nTheir research had twin goals: astrometric mapping of the galaxy's radio continuum and measurements of polarization for its water masers \u2014 naturally occurring sources of microwave radio emissions. In radio astronomy, water masers observed at a frequency of 22 GHz are particularly useful because they can shine through much of the dust and gas that obscures optical wavelengths around the black hole.\n\nUsing the High Sensitivity Array (HSA) \u2014 a multi-facility network supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) \u2014 the international team observed for the first time evidence of magnetic filaments in the accretion disk surrounding the galaxy's supermassive black hole. Their discovery was announced Wednesday by the NRAO and reported in a recent paper published by The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nBy measuring the polarization of water masers and the continuum of radio emissions from NGC 1068, the team generated a map revealing the compact radio source now known as NGC 1068*, as well as mysterious extended structures of more faint emissions.\n\nMapping the astrometric distribution of NGC 1068 and its water masers revealed that they are spread along filaments of structure.\n\nProfessor Jack Gallimore, physics & astronomy. Photo courtesy of Jack Gallimore\n\n\"It really came out in these new observations that these filaments of maser spots line up like beads on a string,\" Gallimore said in the NRAO story. The team was stunned to see that there was a clear offset \u2014 a displacement angle \u2014 between the radio continuum showing the structures at the galaxy's core and the locations of the masers themselves. \"The configuration is unstable, so we are probably observing the source of a magnetically-launched outflow,\" he said.\n\nHSA measurements of the polarization of these water masers revealed striking evidence of magnetic fields.\n\n\"No one has ever seen polarization in water masers outside our galaxy,\" Gallimore said. Similar to the looping structures seen on our sun's surface as prominences, the polarization pattern of these water masers clearly indicates that magnetic fields are also at the root of these light-year-scale structures as well. \"Looking at the filaments and seeing that the polarization vectors are perpendicular to them, that's the key to confirming that they are magnetically driven structures. It's exactly what you'd expect to see.\"\n\nPrevious studies of the region hinted at patterns usually associated with magnetic fields, but such conclusions remained beyond the reach of observing technology until recently. This discovery is the first to confirm the existing theory.\n\n\"Only the HSA has the combination of resolution and sensitivity needed to map out magnetic fields using polarized light,\" said Gallimore.\n\nTheir findings reveal evidence of a compact central radio source (the galaxy's supermassive black hole), clear polarization of the water masers indicating structure within NGC 1068's magnetic fields, and spectacular extended features across the continuum of radio frequencies. Together, these findings indicate that magnetic fields are the underlying drivers of these phenomena.\n\nPlenty of mysteries remain, however. Within the radio continuum map, for instance, there is a diffuse, faint protrusion that the team nicknamed \"the foxtail,\" which extends northward from the central region.\n\n\"We said to ourselves when we set out to do this, \u2018let's see if we can really push the limits and get a good continuum as well as polarization data. And both of those goals succeeded,\" Gallimore said. \"With the NSF NRAO High Sensitivity Array, we detected water megamaser polarization for the first time, and we also made a really amazing continuum map that we're still trying to wrap our minds around.\"\n\nSpecial thanks to the NRAO and author Jessi Almstead for the use of their story."
