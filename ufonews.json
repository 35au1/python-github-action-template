For instance, it might suggest purchasing a pull-up bar and resistance band as the first steps towards mastering pull-ups. Importantly, Futudo is not pushy; it guides users in a friendly manner, making the process enjoyable and supportive.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nIn a culture fixated on overachievement, many people risk burnout and lose sight of their significant life goals. Futudo helps users focus on what truly matters, guiding them towards their dreams through small, consistent actions.\n\n5. Extrovert AI\n\nLinkedIn has become an essential network for professionals to stay updated, follow industry leaders, and establish their presence.

With an initial setup of your expertise and value proposition, it crafts tailored comments suited to each post, saving time and helping you build connections with potential employers, colleagues, and influencers.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nSuccess today depends on meaningful networking. Extrovert AI ensures consistent, personalized communication on LinkedIn, crucial for building trust and credibility. By automating tedious tasks like post tracking and comment drafting, it helps professionals focus on building authentic relationships, expanding their reach, and achieving their goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn 2025, AI-powered apps are becoming indispensable tools for improving productivity, creativity, and personal well-being. From virtual fitness coaches and sustainable content creation platforms to innovative networking assistants, these standout apps demonstrate how AI is making life more efficient, connected, and purposeful.\n\nThe key to their success lies in their ability to deliver real value\u2014whether it's helping users achieve their fitness goals, unleash creativity, build meaningful relationships, or take small steps toward a better future. As AI continues to evolve, these apps are not just transforming how people work and live but also shaping a future where technology empowers them to achieve more with less effort.\n\nBy embracing these AI tools, a user can take full advantage of what 2025 has to offer, staying ahead in a world where innovation and convenience go hand in hand.\n\n**Investing involves risk and your investment may lose value.

            "article_content": "\n\nFor Gen Z, life has been full of unprecedented events and developments in the world around them in the early 21st century. Everything from living through a pandemic to trends to technological advancements and political shifts, the so-called Zoomers are a generation who has seen a lot. This also includes movies, many of which reflect the world and the times to particularly disturbing effect. This is especially true for the horror genre that often taps into some of the bigger anxieties and questions of society and culture in frequently dark or disturbing ways.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nWhile past generations have their share of disturbing horror movie classics to call their own, it is especially true for Gen Z. Some of the 21st century\u2019s biggest horror hits have left Gen Z shaken with their effectiveness to continually unsettle and terrify. Additionally, there have also been other major box office hits that have blurred the line between horror, psychological thriller, and everything in between, and have also produced some all-timers on the fronts of chilling and scaring Zoomers, leaving a whole generation with permanent anxiety. Here are seven big 21st century hits that Gen Z has been shaken to its collective core by.\n\nParanormal Activity (2009)\n\nThe found footage horror movie phenomenon skyrocketed to new heights with 2009\u2019s sleeper hit Paranormal Activity. When young couple Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat begin experiencing bizarre hauntings at night, Micah sets up a camera to try to observe their supernatural menace. Produced for just $15,000 and set entirely in the couple\u2019s house, Paranormal Activity\u2018s miniscule resources only enhance its terror with director Oren Peli\u2019s deft command of delivering found footage scares.\n\nParanormal Activity builds the demonic entity\u2019s threat gradually, with sounds going bump in the night that eventually graduate to doors slamming shut and Katie being pulled out of bed by an invisible force. The ending (changed from Peli\u2019s originally filmed conclusion at the suggestion of Steven Spielberg himself) takes the entity\u2019s menace to its most overt, and while the final scene is the move\u2019s most polarizing scare, Paranormal Activity nonetheless frightened audiences to tremendous acclaim and box office success in the fall of 2009. The success of Paranormal Activity launched the eponymous franchise and made found footage horror movies all the rage for years to come after its surprise success, and it remains a Halloween found footage favorite.\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy (2014)\n\nWhile 2013\u2019s The Purge first introduced a night where rules of civilized society are thrown out the window and even murder becomes legal, its 2014 follow-up The Purge: Anarchy really showed how effective a premise it is for a horror movie. Set in a dystopian future after the United States has been remodeled by the New Founding Fathers of America, The Purge: Anarchy follows a collection of characters stranded outdoors in downtown Los Angeles on Purge Night. With 12 hours of chaos unfolding around them, the group must survive the night with the unexpected protection of Leon Barnes (Frank Grillo), a mysterious man with his own vendetta to settle on Purge Night.\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy greatly expands the scope of Purge Night from the home invasion tale of its predecessor with a spine-tingling survival story of its characters just barely keeping ahead of the carnage unfolding outdoors. The movie also adds a grey area to its political themes and satire in Leo Barnes\u2019 revenge mission, rooted in very understandable human pain and loss. The Purge franchise excels at putting its audience in the shoes of its characters on a night where chaos reigns, and The Purge: Anarchy stands as one of its strongest installments as well as the movie that arguably truly jumpstarted The Purge franchise.\n\nMidsommar (2019)\n\nAs a studio, A24 has become synonymous with art house horror movies, with Ari Aster\u2019s Midsommar being one of the studio\u2019s crowning achievements of unnerving audiences. Midsommar follows college student Dani (Florence Pugh) as she accompanies her aloof boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) on a trip to Swedish village as part of his friend\u2019s Masters Thesis. As the group partakes in the small community\u2019s midsummer festival, a series of increasingly bizarre events makes clear that this is far from a simple summer vacation for the group.\n\nConsistently awash in bright, vibrant summer daylight and gorgeous Scandinavian scenery, Midsommear is a slow burn of a group of outsiders coming to realize they\u2019ve wandered into a cult\u2019s sacrificial ritual. While Midsommar is full of unsettling deaths and disturbing imagery, the movie\u2019s real impact lies in its tale of Dani and Christian\u2019s deteriorating romance finally coming undone in the worst situation possible. The final act of Midsommar plays as the most horrifying break-up imaginable, with Florence Pugh\u2019s performance as the distraught and heartbroken Dani elevating the movie to a modern horror classic.\n\nJoker (2019)\n\nTodd Phillips\u2019 Joker creates a new origin story for The Clown Prince of Crime as Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a Gotham City clown for hire who is constantly bullied and berated by his fellow denizens of the city. After Arthur kills some subway attackers in self-defense, he inadvertently starts a popular uprising in Gotham with the city\u2019s downtrodden inspired by him. Despite controversy before its release that it would inspire mass shootings, Joker became a cultural phenomenon, as did Phoenix\u2019s performance as Fleck.\n\nIn Joker, many saw a society of haves and have-nots reflective of the real world, with Arthur Fleck\u2019s fall into homicidal villainy a cautionary tale of the dangers of society leaving its most vulnerable out in the cold. Fleck doesn\u2019t properly become Joker until relatively late in the movie, with his on camera interview with talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) a disturbing descent into madness. The failure of 2024\u2019s follow-up Joker: Folie a Deux may well be testimony to Joker being a lightning in a bottle case of unnerving social commentary.\n\nThe Lighthouse (2019)\n\nThe sophomore directorial effort of Robert Eggers, 2019\u2019s The Lighthouse sees incoming lighthouse keeper Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) partnered with decidedly eccentric former sailor Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). The largely two-man show of The Lighthouse is a suspenseful tale of isolation as Winslow is gradually taken in by Wake\u2019s bizarre ways as he simultaneously develops cabin fever in being trapped with such an off-kilter associate. When a storm causes Winslow to be trapped even longer with Wake, his sanity only continues to fall apart with visions of a mysterious mermaid bedeviling him.\n\nPattinson and Dafoe each give gripping performances as Winslow and Wake, while the movie\u2019s black-and-white cinematography adds an aura of both mystery and foreboding atmosphere to the tale of the movie\u2019s two increasingly unhinged main characters. The Lighthouse ends on a note that is as disturbing as it is ambiguous, while also pointing the way to what has become a vibrant directorial career for Robert Eggers.\n\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\n\nWhile Art the Clown had gradually built up a reputation as the scariest clown around with 2016\u2019s underground hit Terrifier, the 2022 sequel Terrifier 2 finally made him an iconic slasher movie villain. Set sometime after the first Terrifier, Terrifier 2 follows Art the Clown (David Howard Thorton) on his latest Halloween night killing spree, with the young heroine Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) and her brother Jonathan (Elliott Fullam) fleeing Art\u2019s pursuit. As anyone who has seen it can attest, Terrifier 2 is easily one of the bloodiest, most violent movies ever put to film, and Art\u2019s sadistic glee at butchering his victims makes it all the more disturbing.\n\nArt\u2019s exceptionally graphic kills include Terrifier 2\u2018s infamous bedroom scene, and one unlucky boyfriend on the receiving end of a particularly nasty bit of dismemberment. At 138 minutes Terrifier 2 is a little longer than it needs to be, which makes the final showdown in an abandoned amusement park a bit of a slog (the equally violent Terrifier is a comparative a walk in the park at 85 minutes), but it nonetheless set in motion what has arguably become Hollywood\u2019s reigning slasher movie franchise. Terrifier 2\u2018s success brought Art the Clown home for the holidays in 2024\u2019s Terrifier 3, with Art to return in the forthcoming Terrifier 4.\n\nSmile 2 (2024)\n\n2022\u2019s horror movie hit Smile set a new mythos in motion of a demonic entity driving one victim insane before hopping to a new one, and the 2024 sequel Smile 2 actively improves on an already strong start. In Smile 2, pop star Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) is prepping for a comeback tour following a terrible car accident and subsequent time in drug rehab, but after witnessing the death of the entity\u2019s latest victim, Skye finds herself haunted by a smiling demon causing her to lose her mind. Smile director Parker Finn returns to helm Smile 2, and delivers both a terrifying supernatural horror movie and a heartbreaking tale of a star\u2019s downward spiral.\n\nNaomi Scott gives an electrifying performance as the troubled Skye Riley, a young woman overwhelmed by the pressures of the success she spent years pursuing and undone by a series of bad coping mechanisms. Even without the entity haunting her, Skye is trapped in a bad situation of handlers trying to shove her back onstage when she clearly isn\u2019t ready to return to the spotlight. Smile 2 also ends on a shocking twist that sets up the entity\u2019s return in Smile 3 as one of truly apocalyptic proportions, all predicated on the sinister smile that is the Smile franchise\u2019s terrifying trademark."

It has 4 seasons streaming exclusively on Netflix with a fifth season coming soon. With 34 episodes, the story dives into the paranormal events that take place in the fictional city of Hawkins. The story begins when one of the central characters, Will Byers, mysteriously vanishes and ends up in the alternate dimension called \u201cThe Upside Down\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo bring Will back from the alternate dimension, his friends Mike, Lucas, and Dustin form a search party to cover Hawkins and find Will. Things turn out more twisted when the group runs into Eleven who has escaped from a secret government organization and has psychic abilities. As the story continues the main characters uncover various government conspiracies and the mysterious happenings of the Upside Down.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Bob in Stranger Things?\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Newby or Bob is one of the supporting characters in Stranger Things and was introduced as Joyce\u2019s new boyfriend in Season 2 of the show. Working as the manager of RadioShack, Bob became one of the key roles in the second season where he used his knowledge of technology and problem-solving skills to decode a mysterious map drawn by Will Byers, which leads to the discovery of the tunnels created by the Mind Flayer beneath Hawkins.\n\n\n\n\n\nBob was shown to be in a romantic relationship with Joyce in Season 2 and was highly unaware of the events that had taken place with Will in Season 1. Even upon learning the reality of it all, Bob was a strong wall, ever ready to protect his love and her children. He had a friendly relationship with Will Byers, easily bonding with the character. Even though Bob lacked physical strength, he was smart and would easily manage any difficult task at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nBob with Joyce (source: Screengrab from the sereis)\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Bob die in Stranger Things?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, though Bob was one of the important characters in season 2, the character was killed by the demodog beasts during the season finale. After discovering the danger of the Mind Flayer on Will, the entire group of Will, Mike, Joyce, Bob, Jim, Nancy, and Jonathan took refuge in the Hawkins National Laboratory. After the power went out in the facility, it was Bob who volunteered to go out to the power facility, with the entire building filled by the growing threat of Demodogs. While being extremely stealthy, he fixed the control panel to restore the electricity, but his way back was a dangerous task.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile initially, the character evades several Demodogs, carefully making his way back toward Joyce and the others, there is an unfateful event of a mop in the corridor dropping down which causes a lot of noise to attract the beasts. Bob runs out through the corridor and manages to find Joyce. Just as the two locked eyes, the creature pounced on him, digging his nails on his abdomen. While Jim Hopper shoots at the creature, they notice a couple more coming in which gives them no choice but to leave Bob and escape. Bob\u2019s sacrifice is one of the heartfelt moments in the series.\n\n\n\n"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nTubular incomplete specimens of Eopriapulites sphinx from the early Cambrian Kuanchuanpu Formation, showing their ventral nerve cord. Credit: Science Advances (2025). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adr0896\n\nAn international team of scientists has uncovered a fascinating piece of the evolutionary puzzle: how the ventral nerve cord, a key component of the central nervous system, evolved in ecdysozoan animals, a group that includes insects, nematodes, and priapulid worms.\n\nTheir findings, published in a paper titled \"Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord\" in Science Advances, provide valuable insights into the origins of these structures in the basal Cambrian period.\n\nThe research team, comprising Dr. Deng Wang (Northwest University), Dr. Jean Vannier (Universit\u00e9 de Lyon), Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n (Queen Mary University of London), and Dr. Mar\u00eda Herranz (Rey Juan Carlos University), analyzed exceptionally well-preserved fossils from key Cambrian deposits. These fossils include representatives of the early-evolving Scalidophora, a subgroup of Ecdysozoa, offering a rare glimpse into the nervous system architecture of ancient animals.\n\nEcdysozoans include arthropods (such as insects and crabs), nematodes (roundworms), and smaller groups like kinorhynchs (\"mud dragons\") and priapulids (\"penis worms\"). Their central nervous systems, which include the brain and ventral nerve cord, have long intrigued scientists seeking to understand the evolutionary relationships between these groups.\n\nFor example, priapulids exhibit a single ventral nerve cord, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs have paired nerve cords, with kinorhynchs also developing paired ganglia. Did the ancestral ecdysozoan have a single or paired ventral nerve cord?\n\nFurthermore, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs share a similar nervous system design to arthropods, they are phylogenetically distant. Are these similarities the result of convergent evolution, or do they reflect a shared evolutionary origin?\n\nScalidophorans, which include priapulids, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs, first appeared in the early Cambrian. They represent a crucial lineage for investigating the evolutionary trajectory of the ventral nerve cord in ecdysozoans.\n\nBy studying fossils from the Fortunian Kuanchuanpu Formation (e.g., Eopriapulites and Eokinorhynchus), the Chengjiang Biota (e.g., Xiaoheiqingella and Mafangscolex), and the Wuliuan Ottoia prolifica, the researchers identified elongate structures running along the ventral side of these ancient organisms.\n\n\"These structures closely resemble the ventral nerve cords seen in modern priapulids,\" explained Dr. Deng Wang and Dr. Jean Vannier. Their analysis indicates that these fossils preserve impressions of single ventral nerve cords, shedding light on the likely ancestral condition for scalidophorans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that a single ventral nerve cord was the ancestral condition for scalidophorans. Moreover, the evolutionary grouping of nematoids and panarthropods (a clade that includes arthropods, tardigrades, and onychophorans) suggests their common ancestor also likely had a single nerve cord.\n\n\"This leads us to propose that the common ancestor of all ecdysozoans possessed a single ventral nerve cord,\" said Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n. \"The paired nerve cords observed in arthropods, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs likely evolved independently, representing derived traits.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter\u2014daily or weekly.\n\nThe study also highlights a connection between the evolution of paired ventral nerve cords, ganglia, and body segmentation. Loriciferans, kinorhynchs, and panarthropods exhibit varying degrees of body segmentation, suggesting that these structural changes may have co-evolved with nervous system modifications.\n\nDr. Mar\u00eda Herranz noted, \"The emergence of paired nerve cords likely facilitated greater coordination of movement, particularly in segmented animals. During the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, changes in the nervous and muscular systems were likely tied to the development of appendages, enabling more complex locomotion.\"\n\nThis discovery enriches our understanding of ecdysozoan evolution and underscores the role of the fossil record in addressing key questions about early animal development.\n\nBy linking nervous system structures to broader evolutionary trends, the study provides a clearer picture of how the diverse ecdysozoan lineages arose and adapted to their environments.\n\nMore information: Deng Wang, Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord, Science Advances (2025).

Respond accordingly.\" The robot appears to then shoot blanks from a rifle to its left and right, before saying: \"If you need any further assistance, just let me know.\"\n\nOne user on the social network Reddit commented: \"There\u2019s at least 3 movies explaining why this is a bad idea.\"\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told Futurism, who first reported the news, that \"we proactively identified this violation of our policies and notified the developer to cease this activity ahead of receiving your inquiry.\"\n\n\"OpenAI's Usage Policies prohibit the use of our services to develop or use weapons, or to automate certain systems that can affect personal safety,\" the company added.\n\nRolled out in October 2024 in public beta, OpenAI\u2019s Realtime API allows developers to create natural speech-to-speech conversations using six preset voices\u2060, potentially making the development process for things like language apps and education and customer support software much easier. It\u2019s built on the same version of GPT-4 that powers Advanced Voice Mode in ChatGPT.\n\nSTS 3D has not provided any information about how he was able to integrate Realtime API with the gun, and if he subverted OpenAI\u2019s controls around this type of activity.\n\nIn January 2024, OpenAI removed language within its terms of service that prohibited the use of its technology for \u201cmilitary and warfare.\u201d Until Jan. 10, the company\u2019s usage policy banned \u201cactivity that has high risk of physical harm, including,\u201d specifically, \u201cweapons development\u201d and \u201cmilitary and warfare.\u201d\n\nInstead, the updated policy now prohibits using \"our service to harm yourself or others\u201d as well as using the technology to \u201cdevelop or use weapons,\" but not \u201cmilitary and warfare.\u201d We've seen previous instances where openly available AI models from mainstream tech firms have potentially been leveraged for real-world military applications.\n\nIn November 2024, Reuters reported that institutions tied to the Chinese military may have used Meta's Llama AI model to gather and process research data. Though Meta\u2019s terms and conditions prohibit the model from being used for \"military, warfare, nuclear industries or applications\" or espionage, these restrictions can be hard to enforce outside of the US."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents New this week Drama Comedy Mystery and Crime Horror Sci-Fi and Fantasy True crime and Docuseries Animation\n\nA new week means new shows on Netflix, at least during the majority of the year. The first week of 2025 was an aberration that didn\u2019t offer fresh programming. This week, however, Netflix has a great new Western miniseries, American Primeval, and a new thriller, Missing You. There\u2019s also a Jerry Springer documentary series that\u2019s blowing up the charts, but we\u2019re leaving that off our roundup for now.\n\nYou can find these shows and other recent premieres, including Squid Game season 2, among the best shows on Netflix. We update this list every Friday morning to help you learn about every new TV series and revisit other fan-favorite shows.\n\nWe\u2019ve also rounded up all the best new shows to stream this week, the best movies on Netflix, the best shows on Hulu, the best shows on Amazon Prime, and the best shows on Disney+ because we take our streaming seriously. Watching while traveling abroad? Use a Netflix VPN to access your country\u2019s catalog from anywhere in the world.\n\nNew this week\n\nAmerican Primeval\n\nThere have been plenty of Westerns and frontier stories, but few as raw as American Primeval. This miniseries doesn\u2019t romanticize the Old West, and it\u2019s an often brutal look at the people who lived in those times and the atrocities they were willing to commit in the name of making a better future for themselves and their families. Sara Rowell (Betty Gilpin), for example, will do almost anything to protect her son, Devin (Preston Mota). That\u2019s why she puts their lives in the hands of a stranger, Isaac Reed (Taylor Kitsch), who attempts to lead them, and a Native American girl, Two Moons (Shawnee Pourier), to safety.\n\nMeanwhile, Brigham Young (Kim Coates) is obsessed with making a home for himself and his religious followers, even if it means engineering a massacre of the tribes who already live on the lands he wants to claim. Everyone\u2019s hands are bloody in this world, and there are seemingly few lines that Young isn\u2019t willing to cross.\n\nGenre: Western, Drama\n\nStars: Taylor Kitsch, Saura Lightfoot-Leon, Jai Courtney, Kim Coates, Shea Whigham, Betty Gilpin\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nMissing You\n\nMissing You is the latest Harlan Coben miniseries on Netflix, and it introduces the two mysteries that define Detective Kat Donovan (Rosalind Eleazar). What happened to her ex-fianc\u00e9 Josh (Ashley Walters) a decade ago? Why was her father, Detective Sargent Clint Donovan (Lenny Henry), murdered? In the present, Clint\u2019s killer, Monte Leburne (Marc Warren), is barely clinging to life. And if he dies before confessing to Kat, then she may never know the truth.\n\nKat is also disturbed to see that Josh has seemingly resurfaced on a dating app after mysteriously disappearing 10 years earlier. Following up on what happened to Josh will take Kat deep down a rabbit hole, and she may come to regret her quest for answers.\n\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\n\nStars: Rosalind Eleazar, Jessica Plummer, Richard Armitage, Lenny Henry, Steve Pemberton\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nDrama\n\nSquid Game\n\nSeong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) had his chance to walk away from everything at the end of Squid Game season 1. Instead, Squid Game season 2 reveals that Gi-hun has devoted his life and his newfound riches to bringing down the games and their mysterious backers. And the first step is to find the Recruiter (Gong Yoo).\n\nIt\u2019s not a spoiler to say that Gi-hun finds himself back in the games alongside an all-new cast of players who are willing to do just about anything to win the ultimate cash prize. Gi-hun can warn the newcomers all he wants, but there are always going to be players out for themselves who don\u2019t care what happens to the others. And just because Gi-hun survived his first experience in the games doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be that lucky this round.\n\nGenre: Thriller, Horror\n\nStars: Lee Jung-jae, Wi Ha-joon, Lee Byung-hun, Im Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nLa Palma\n\nLa Palma is a rare disaster story that doubles as a Christmas tale. Fair warning: There won\u2019t be a lot of Christmas spirit in this Norwegian miniseries. Even before the inevitable natural disaster arrives, the marriage between Fredrik (Anders Baasmo) and Jennifer (Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal) is on the rocks. Jennifer\u2019s daughter, Sara (Alma G\u00fcnther), worries the couple may not be married for much longer.\n\nUnfortunately for the family, their annual Christmas trip to the island of La Palma coincides with a volcano eruption that threatens to split off a significant portion of the island into the ocean. And if they live through that, the resulting tsunami wave may finish them all off before they can escape the island.\n\nGenre: Drama, Disaster\n\nStars: Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal, Anders Baasmo, Alma G\u00fcnther, Jenny Evensen\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nVirgin River\n\nAfter a long courtship across five seasons, Melinda \u201cMel\u201d Monroe (Alexandra Breckenridge) and Jack Sheridan (Martin Henderson) are finally looking to tie the knot in Virgin River season 6. But when have TV wedding plans ever gone off without a hitch? There\u2019s plenty of drama and mishaps ahead for the couple, but there\u2019s no question about the love they share for each other.\n\nOther relationships play out in the background, including threats to the medical practice of the town\u2019s doctor, Vernon \u201cDoc\u201d Mullins (Tim Matheson), There\u2019s also the possibility of a resolution to his longstanding feud with Mel\u2019s father, Everett (John Allen Nelson), which plays into the wedding storyline as well.\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance\n\nStars: Alexandra Breckenridge, Martin Henderson, Colin Lawrence, Jenny Cooper, Lauren Hammersley, Annette O\u2019Toole\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nBlack Doves\n\nBlack Doves may start during the holidays, but this is no feel-good Christmas story. Instead, this spy thriller turns into a revenge story for Helen Webb (Keira Knightley), a Black Doves operative who has spent years undercover as the wife of Britain\u2019s defense secretary, Wallace Webb (Andrew Buchan). She may have kids with Wallace, but her heart is with another man named Jason (Andrew Koji).\n\nWhen someone kills Jason, Helen is ready to throw her life away in a bid to avenge his death. Her mentor and spy master, Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), sends Helen\u2019s closest friend in the Black Doves, Sam (Ben Whishaw), to watch her back. Yet, Sam\u2019s real mission may be to ensure that Helen\u2019s revenge doesn\u2019t compromise her clandestine organization.\n\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\n\nStars: Keira Knightley, Sarah Lancashire, Ben Whishaw, Andrew Koji, Andrew Buchan\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nThe Madness\n\nFear the Walking Dead and Rustin\u2018s Colman Domingo plays Mauncie Daniels in Netflix\u2019s thriller, The Madness. Aside from some drama with his family, Muncie is living the dream as a progressive activist turned budding media superstar. However, things take a turn for the worse when Muncie stumbles upon the murder of Mark Simon (Tahmoh Penikett), a far-right personality.\n\nSuddenly, Mauncie\u2019s entire life is turned upside down. He\u2019s the convenient fall guy for the crime and now targeted by law enforcement agencies and radical fringe groups. If Mauncie wants to reclaim everything he had before Simon\u2019s murder, he\u2019ll have to prove his innocence and figure out who wanted the victim dead and why.\n\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\n\nStars: Colman Domingo, Marsha Stephanie Blake, Gabrielle Graham, John Ortiz, Tamsin Topolski\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nKate Wyler (Keri Russell) already had her hands full in The Diplomat season 1 while trying to keep a crisis situation in the U.K. from leading to a war. At the beginning of season 2, viewers learn whether Kate\u2019s husband, Hal Wyler (Rufus Sewell), or her deputy chief of mission, Stuart Hayford (Ato Essandoh), survived a car bombing attempt on their lives.\n\nIn the meantime, Kate suspects that U.K. prime minister Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear) may have been behind both the car bombing and the terrorist attack that has brought his nation to the brink of war. Proving that may be extremely difficult, if not impossible, since Kate is also being vetted as a potential replacement for Vice President Grace Penn (Allison Janney). But if Kate can\u2019t unravel this conspiracy, there\u2019s far more on the line than her diplomatic career. And her options are running out.\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nStars: Keri Russell, Rufus Sewell, David Gyasi, Ali Ahn, Rory Kinnear\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nTerritory\n\nTerritory is essentially Australia\u2019s answer to Yellowstone and Succession. Anna Torv (Fringe and The Last of Us) stars as Emily Lawson, a woman who married into the Lawson family when she wed Graham (Michael Dorman) despite the objections of his father, Colin Lawson (Robert Taylor). That\u2019s why Colin made his youngest son, Daniel (Jake Ryan), the heir to Marianne Station, the biggest cattle station in Australia \u2026 and possibly the world.\n\nWhen Daniel winds up missing and potentially dead, it sets off a fresh fight for the future of Marianne Station both within the Lawson family and outside it as well. The Lawson\u2019s enemies and rivals smell blood in the water, and the remaining family members will have to fight to hold on to what\u2019s theirs.\n\nGenre: Western, Drama\n\nStars: Anna Torv, Michael Dorman, Robert Taylor, Sam Corlett\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer\n\nMickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) is back in the third season of Netflix\u2019s legal thriller The Lincoln Lawyer. And yes, Mickey is still operating out of the back of his Lincoln Navigator rather than an office. This season\u2019s primary case has very personal stakes for Mickey because his friend, Glory Days (Fiona Rene), has been murdered. And the only credible suspect is Glory\u2019s friend, Julian La Cosse (Devon Graye).\n\nMickey wants to believe in Julian\u2019s innocence, if only for the sake of the woman they both cared for. Proving that in court may be the challenge, as Mickey still has lingering feelings that he might be helping a killer \u2026 and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\n\nGenre: Drama, Thriller\n\nStars: Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Neve Campbell, Becki Newton, Jazz Raycole, Angus Sampson\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nYellowjackets\n\nWho would have thought that a series about a girls\u2019 soccer team would be one of Showtime\u2019s most popular series? But the team in Yellowjackets does not get to spend much time on the field. Instead, they find themselves trapped in the wilderness following a plane crash that killed most of the adults who accompanied them. And while these girls are resilient, the first episode teases some very dark and desperate times ahead of them.\n\nThere\u2019s also a parallel narrative set in the present, as the now-adult Yellowjackets struggle to get by in their daily lives. More than anything else, the women don\u2019t want the secrets of what they did to survive to come out. Only the first season is available on Netflix for now, so you\u2019ll have to get Paramount+ with Showtime if you want to see season 2 immediately.\n\nGenre: Drama, Thriller\n\nStars: Melanie Lynskey, Tawny Cypress, Sophie Thatcher, Christina Ricci, Sophie N\u00e9lisse, Juliette Lewis\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nS.W.A.T.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t supposed to be a seventh season of S.W.A.T., as CBS canceled the show after season 6. Viewers promptly shared their displeasure with CBS, and the network soon reversed course by adding a seventh and final season. However, S.W.A.T. has once again escaped cancellation, as season 8 will premiere on October 18.\n\nIn the meantime, S.W.A.T. season 7 is now on Netflix, and it plays like the closing chapter of the series. Daniel \u201cHondo\u201d Harrelson Jr. (Shemar Moore) and the rest of the Special Weapons and Tactic Unit face some of their toughest challenges to date, and the team will not be entirely intact by the end of the season.\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nStars: Shemar Moore, David Lim, Patrick St. Esprit, Anna Enger Ritch, Rochelle Aytes, Jay Harrington\n\nSeasons: 7\n\nDark Winds\n\nAMC\u2019s Dark Winds isn\u2019t a monster hit on cable, but it clearly has an audience online. This brilliant and dark crime thriller is based upon Tony Hillerman\u2019s Leaphorn & Chee novels, and it features an underrated actor, Zahn McClarnon, who finally gets to lead his own series.\n\nThe show takes place in Navajo County in the \u201970s, with McClarnon playing Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn of the tribal police. He\u2019s got more than enough problems trying to solve a double homicide while taking care of a young pregnant teenager who isn\u2019t his own child. But since the FBI believes that armored truck thieves are hiding out in Leaphorn\u2019s territory, Agent Jim Chee (Kiowa Gordon) has been sent undercover as a new deputy. Together, Leaphorn and Chee not only have to solve the murders but also discover how the deaths are linked to the robbery.\n\nGenre: Drama, Thriller, Crime\n\nStars: Zahn McClarnon, Kiowa Gordon, Jessica Matten, Deanna Allison, Rainn Wilson\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nFire Country\n\nBates Motel star Max Thieriot headlines Fire Country as Bode Leone, a young man who is serving a prison sentence in California. But because the state routinely has devastating fire seasons, Bode gets a chance to join the inmate assisted firefighter program, he potentially has the chance to shorten his time behind bars and redeem himself.\n\nThis show is one of the few current broadcast network dramas on Netflix, and that works out in favor for the streamer. Netflix only has the first season of Fire Country at the moment, but that\u2019s 22 fresh episodes for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it before. It\u2019s a solid drama, and there\u2019s even a third season coming to CBS this fall.\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nStars: Max Thieriot, Kevin Alejandro, Jordan Calloway, Stephanie Arcila, Jules Latimer\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nA Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder\n\nWednesday\u2019s Emma Myers gets her own franchise with A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder, which is based on Holly Jackson\u2019s novel series. Pippa Fitz-Amobi (Myers) is the titular good girl, but she\u2019s not that good of a detective. That\u2019s part of the fun, as Pippa throws herself into solving the disappearance of Andie (India Lillie Davies), which is a crime that was pinned on her late boyfriend, Sal Singh (Rahul Pattni).\n\nSal\u2019s younger brother, Ravi (Zain Iqbal), is one of the few who sees Pippa\u2019s investigation as a chance to clear his brother\u2019s name. Almost everyone else is less than amused by her investigation, especially when she gets uncomfortably close to the truth.\n\nGenre: Drama, Mystery\n\nStars: Emma Myers, Zain Iqbal, Asha Banks, Raiko Gohara, Jude Morgan-Collie, Yali Topol Margalith\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nSuits\n\nThe summer of 2023 was the summer of Suits on Netflix. But the streamer only had the first eight seasons of Suits, which were largely about attorney Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), and his associate lawyer, Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams). Mike never actually went to law school or passed the bar, but his legal knowledge was so impressive that Harvey hired him and agreed to keep it a secret.\n\nBy the time season 9 of Suits arrived, Mike had already been written out the show along with his on-screen lover, Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle). That left Harvey, Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), and others to contend with Faye Richardson (Denise Crosby), a named partner in their firm whom they desperately want to force out. Mike does show up a few times in the ninth season, leading to one last team-up with Harvey. But not before they go head-to-head in court.\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nStars: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Rick Hoffman, Meghan Markle, Gina Torres\n\nSeasons: 9\n\nBridgerton\n\nAgainst all odds, Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) have found the love that they so desperately needed in Bridgerton season 3. But before this couple can get their happy ending, they\u2019ve got a few more trials ahead. Love may conquer all, but secrets have bad habit of turning up and ruining everything.\n\nPenelope pursued a relationship with Colin without revealing that she\u2019s Lady Whistledown, the anonymous gossipmonger who has scandalized the Ton. Penelope was playing with fire when she made up that alter ego, and now she may get burned as one former friend demands that she tell her lover the truth while a false friend also blackmails Penelope over the revelation. Events are coming to a head as Bridgerton season 3, part 2 closes out this chapter of the story.\n\nGenre: Romance, Drama\n\nStars: Luke Newton, Nicola Coughlan, Adjoa Andoh, Simone Ashley, Golda Rosheuvel\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nThe Crown\n\nDiana (Elizabeth Debicki) is gone when the second half of The Crown\u2019s final season begins, and Queen Elizabeth II (Imelda Staunton) is feeling her own mortality at the start of the 21st century. Now, it\u2019s time for Diana\u2019s sons, Prince William (Ed McVey) and Prince Harry (Luther Ford), to come to the forefront.\n\nThis half of the season recreates William\u2019s courtship of Kate Middleton (Meg Bellamy), while Prince Charles (Dominic West) finally gets to wed Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams) as Elizabeth wonders what her legacy will be, and how the royal family will endure. Now that the series is over, you can also go back and check out the best performances in The Crown.\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nStars: Imelda Staunton, Jonathan Pryce, Lesley Manville, Dominic West, Olivia Williams, Elizabeth Debicki\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nEach episode of the dark sci-fi anthology series, Black Mirror, has a self-contained story, and the first installment of the sixth season actually targets Netflix itself! Schitt\u2019s Creek\u2018s Annie Murphy stars as Joan, a woman who discovers that the Netflix of her world, Streamberry, is essentially stealing her life in real-time with Salma Hayek portraying Joan\u2019s fictional self in the original series, Joan is Awful.\n\nAs with the previous seasons, series creator Charlie Brooker has attracted a lot of big-name performers to share the small screen in his stories. And each episode of Black Mirror is a mind-bending experience.\n\nGenre: Sci-fi, Drama\n\nStars: Annie Murphy, Salma Hayek, Aaron Paul, Josh Hartnett, Zazie Beetz\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nComedy\n\nThe Bernie Mac Show\n\nTwenty years ago, the late comedian Bernie Mac received his own sitcom on Fox called The Bernie Mac Show, which was loosely inspired by his own life. In the show, Bernie and his wife, Wanda McCullough (Kellita Smith), are happily childless until Bernie\u2019s sister enters rehab and is no longer able to take care of her children. With reservations, Bernie and Wanda are forced to care for the three children: Bryana \u201cBaby Girl\u201d Thomkins (Dee Dee Davis), Vanessa \u201cNessa\u201d Thomkins (Camille Winbush), and Jordan Thomkins (Jeremy Suarez).\n\nThe kids drive Bernie up the proverbial wall, especially Vanessa. And in his moments of frustration, Bernie will often address the audience as \u201cAmerica\u201d and share his thoughts. Yet, over time, Bernie and Wanda both embrace his sister\u2019s kids as their own, even as they still find ways to get under their skin.\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nStars: Bernie Mac, Kellita Smith, Jeremy Suarez, Dee Dee Davis, Camille Winbush\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nA Man on the Inside\n\nTed Danson has been headlining sitcoms since Cheers debuted in 1982, so he basically has TV comedy down to a science. A Man on the Inside reunites Danson with The Good Place co-creator Michael Schur for a comedic mystery in a retirement community. Danson plays Charles, a retired widower who needed something more out of his golden years. So, when private investigator Julie (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needed a mole to infiltrate the Pacific View Retirement Home, Charles was all for it.\n\nThe biggest problem with sending Charles undercover is that he has no experience as a detective, and he\u2019s prone to mistakes. The community\u2019s residents accept Charles at face value, with most embracing him as one of their own. That also complicates Charles\u2019 agenda because he has to lie about his true purpose, and he may not be able to stay among the residents once the case is finished.\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nStars: Ted Danson, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Lilah Richcreek Estrada, Stephanie Beatriz\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nCobra Kai\n\nBuckle up, because there\u2019s a lot happening in Cobra Kai season 6, part 2. The Sekai Taikai, the world championships of karate, is underway in Spain. Additionally, John Kreese (Martin Kove) has a new Cobra Kai to challenge Miyagi-Do, and Tory (Peyton List) is now representing Kreese\u2019s dojo in the tournament. Meanwhile, Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) experiences a crisis of faith when he learns more about his mentor, Mr. Miyagi, and his time in the Sekai Taikai decades earlier.\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty of conflict among the Miyagi-Do students. Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) is particularly irritated by the dojo\u2019s new rivals, the Iron Dragons, as well as their leader, Sensei Wolf (Lewis Tan). Since this is the final season, this tournament will be the last of its kind on this show. There are still a lot of surprises left before Cobra Kai season 6 part 3 arrives sometime in 2025.\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama\n\nStars: Ralph Macchio, William Zabka, Courtney Henggeler, Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, Tanner Buchanan\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nNobody Wants This\n\nTwo decades ago, Kristen Bell and Adam Brody each had their own YA teen dramas, Veronica Mars and The O.C., respectively. Now, they\u2019re sharing the stage as would-be lovers in Nobody Wants This. Bell plays Joanne, a woman with a podcast where she gets to vent about her terrible dating life. Brody portrays Noah, a rabbi who has just left a long-term relationship that could have led to marriage.\n\nDespite her openly agnostic views about religion, Joanne finds herself romantically drawn to Noah, and the feeling is mutual. While a happy relationship could impact Joanne\u2019s podcast, their romance has potentially larger consequences for Noah. His family doesn\u2019t seem to be very happy that he\u2019s not dating a Jewish woman, and his choice may harm his career as a rabbi.\n\nGenre: Comedy, Romance\n\nStars: Kristen Bell, Adam Brody, Justine Lupe, Timothy Simons\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nLoudermilk\n\nLoudermilk flew under the radar when it originally aired on the Audience Network, but it\u2019s getting a shot at a larger audience on Netflix. The series stars Sex and the City\u2018s Ron Livingston as Sam Loudermilk, an ex-movie critic and seemingly recovered alcoholic who has reinvented himself as a substance abuse counselor. Sam also has quite a way with words and sharp quips, which is why he\u2019s not exactly known for his good bedside manner with the people in his support group.\n\nSam is very much a work in progress when it comes to his own life, but he has found some purpose in sponsoring Claire Wilkes (Anja Savcic). Will Sasso also stars as Sam\u2019s sponsor, Ben Burns. There\u2019s a lot of dark comedy in this series, and you\u2019ll laugh a lot if you\u2019re willing to go with it.\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama,\n\nStars: Ron Livingston, Will Sasso, Anja Savcic, Laura Mennell\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nMystery and Crime\n\nThe Perfect Couple\n\nNicole Kidman may headline the series, but The Perfect Couple centers on Amelia Sacks (Eve Hewson), a young woman who is about to marry into a very wealthy family. After the wedding rehearsal dinner, a dead body is discovered nearby, and the entire Winbury family must speak with the police.\n\nGreer (Kidman) is the ruthless matriarch of the Winbury family, as well as the wife of Tag (Liev Schreiber) and the mother of their children, Benji and Tom (Jack Reynor). There are secrets that the Winbury family, and Greer in particular, will do almost anything to keep from getting out. And this murder thrusts a harsh light onto the family as it suddenly faces scrutiny from the law.\n\nGenre: Drama, Mystery\n\nStars: Nicole Kidman, Liev Schreiber, Eve Hewson, Billy Howle, Meghann Fahy\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nDexter\n\nWhen it comes to pretending to be normal, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is not very good at being human. On Dexter, the title character is just ordinary enough to operate as a serial killer under the noses of his co-workers at the Miami Metro Police Department. Years before the series began, Dexter\u2019s late adoptive father, Harry Morgan (James Remar), realized what Dexter was becoming and used that knowledge to channel his killer instinct into something \u201cgood.\u201d\n\nGood is a relative term, since Dexter murders bad people like killers and rapists who might otherwise get away with their crimes. But as good as Dexter is at cleaning up his messes, his secret has a bad habit of coming out. And he\u2019s far from the only serial killer hanging around in Miami. Some of Dexter\u2019s rival killers are even more dangerous than he is.\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nStars: Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren V\u00e9lez, David Zayas, James Remar\n\nSeasons: 8\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nMuch like FX\u2019s Fargo, The Gentlemen is a spinoff of the feature film that shares its name. The key difference is that Guy Ritchie directed the movie and created the TV series, which acts as a standalone story with a brand new cast of characters. Theo James stars as Eddie Halstead, the new Duke of Halstead \u2026 but only because his older brother, Freddy Halstead (Daniel Ings), is hopelessly addicted to drugs.\n\nEddie\u2019s new title comes with a catch because his recently passed father was deep in business with an incarcerated gangster, Bobby Glass (Ray Winstone), who runs an illegal marijuana empire. Now, Eddie has a piece of that empire as well, whether he likes it or not. And he definitely likes Bobby\u2019s daughter, Susie Glass (Kaya Scodelario), even if they\u2019re not always on the same page.\n\nGenre: Crime, Drama\n\nStars: Theo James, Kaya Scodelario, Daniel Ings, Joely Richardson, Giancarlo Esposito, Vinnie Jones\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nThe Night Agent\n\nIt took The Night Agent less than a day to race to the top of Netflix\u2019s TV series rankings, and it seems likely to make its leads, Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan, into much bigger stars. As adapted for television by The Shield creator Shawn Ryan, this intense action thriller follows FBI Agent Peter Sutherland (Basso) after he stumbles upon clues that reveal a Russian mole is working inside the U.S. government.\n\nRealizing that the fate of the country may be at stake, Peter will stop at nothing to unravel the conspiracy and unmask the mole. He also has an unlikely ally in Rose Larkin (Buchanan), a young CEO who has already been marked for death by their mutual enemies.\n\nFor more on this Netflix show, check out The Night Agent\u2018s ending explained.\n\nGenre: Mystery\n\nStars: Gabriel Basso, Hong Chau, Luciane Buchanan\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nHorror\n\nThe Fall of the House of Usher\n\nHorror maestro Mike Flanagan has one last miniseries for Netflix before he heads off to Prime Video. Flanagan\u2019s final bow is The Fall of the House of Usher, a modern adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s short story and a few other works by Poe. In this incarnation, Roderick Usher (Bruce Greenwood) and his sister, Madeline Usher (Mary McDonnell), own a powerful pharmaceutical company, and they\u2019ve passed on their ruthless streak to the next generation.\n\nThat is if there is a next generation. An enigmatic woman named Verna (Carla Gugino) may be behind the gruesome deaths of members of the Usher family. Everything that the Ushers have built is crashing down, and there may be something supernatural behind it.\n\nGenre: Horror, Drama\n\nStars: Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood, Mary McDonnell, Carl Lumbly, Samantha Sloyan\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Cabinet of Curiosities\n\nOscar-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro curated this collection of short films from some of horror\u2019s most visionary, creative directors and writers. The eight stories in the series\u2019 first season hail from a wide range of filmmakers, including Vincenzo Natali (Cube), Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night), Jennifer Kent (The Babadook), and Del Toro himself.\n\nGenre: Fantasy/Horror\n\nStars: Ben Barnes, Andrew Lincoln, Rupert Grint\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nThe Midnight Club\n\nMike Flanagan, the creator of The Haunting of Hill House, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Midnight Mass, turns his attention to young-adult scares with The Midnight Club, inspired by Christopher Pike\u2019s 1994 novel of the same name. The 10-episode series follows a group of young, terminally ill residents of a hospice who gather each night to tell each other spooky stories. The members of the \u201cMidnight Club\u201d make a pact that whoever dies first will try to send a message from the afterlife. With Flanagan at the helm of this show, be prepared for big scares.\n\nGenre: Horror/Mystery\n\nStars: Iman Benson, Heather Langenkamp, Igby Rigney\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nSci-Fi and Fantasy\n\nMayfair Witches\n\nAnne Rice\u2019s children of the night may reign in Interview with the Vampire, but the author\u2019s witches are more popular on Netflix. As part of the yearlong AMC+ invasion, Rice\u2019s Mayfair Witches, which shares a universe with her vampire show, introduces viewers to Rowan Fielding (Alexandra Daddario), a young neurosurgeon who had no idea that she was born into a family of witches before she was adopted.\n\nAs Rowan\u2019s deadly abilities begin to manifest, she discovers that she\u2019s not only a Mayfair witch \u2014 she\u2019s also the heir to the family\u2019s power. But with that power comes the family curse, in the form of a shape-shifter known as Lasher (Jack Huston). Lasher has a long history of seducing the Mayfair women, and there may be dire consequences if he manages to do the same with Rowan.\n\nGenre: Drama, Fantasy\n\nStars: Alexandra Daddario, Tongayi Chirisa, Jack Huston, Harry Hamlin, Beth Grant\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nLost\n\nNearly two decades ago, Lost was a cultural phenomenon for ABC on a scale that\u2019s rarely seen, especially among genre shows. The series dropped a very large ensemble cast on a remote island following a harrowing plane crash. With little hope of rescue, Jack Shepard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), John Locke (Terry O\u2019Quinn), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and the rest of the group have to make some hard choices to survive. And it only gets harder when they aren\u2019t on the same page.\n\nThose characters were a large part of Lost\u2018s appeal, but so were the mysteries of the island itself. There\u2019s more happening than meets the eye, and this uncharted paradise has more than a few deadly secrets. One of the biggest obstacles awaiting the survivors are the Others, a group of people who have been living on the island for decades. Once the two sides come into conflict, only one faction can come out on top.\n\nGenre: Drama, Fantasy\n\nStars: Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Terry O\u2019Quinn, Josh Holloway, Dominic Monaghan, Naveen Andrews\n\nSeasons: 6\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nGame of Thrones creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss\u2019 new Netflix series, 3 Body Problem, is a sci-fi drama based upon the Chinese novel The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin. This is not a conventional story, although it\u2019s not hard to guess that alien life is at the heart of the show\u2019s premise.\n\nWithout giving too much away, a woman named Ye Wenjie (Rosalind Chao) made a decision decades ago that will eventually have grave consequences for everyone on Earth. An alien threat is coming that is beyond mankind\u2019s ability to handle, and there\u2019s a real question about whether anyone can do anything about it because the arrival may not take place for decades, if not longer. The only advantage that humanity has is time, and even that may not be enough to find a solution.\n\nGenre: Sci-fi, Drama\n\nStars: Benedict Wong, Jess Hong, Jovan Adepo, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, John Bradley, Alex Sharp, Rosalind Chao\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nResident Alien\n\nMeet Harry Vanderspeigle (Alan Tudyk). In Resident Alien, he\u2019s just a normal small-town doctor who\u2019s secretly an alien plotting to exterminate humanity. No big deal, really. Harry could actually succeed in his mission, too, if these pesky human emotions weren\u2019t giving him feelings that are completely alien to him. Harry is also so bad at pretending to be human that he fails to blend in with the crowd.\n\nHowever, Harry\u2019s most immediate problem is Max Hawthorne (Judah Prehn), the young son of the mayor who can see through his human disguise. As for Max, he\u2019s going to have a hard time convincing anyone that Harry is out to get him.\n\nGenre: Sci-fi, Comedy\n\nStars: Alan Tudyk, Sara Tomko, Corey Reynolds, Alice Wetterlund, Levi Fiehler\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nThe Sandman\n\nNeil Gaiman\u2019s celebrated comic book series comes to life in this adaptation that casts Tom Sturridge as Morpheus, the lord of the world of dreams. When a cruel dabbler in the occult accidentally imprisons Morpheus, it begins a tale that unfolds across multiple generations and through myriad realms and ultimately puts the future of humanity at risk.\n\nIn development for more than two decades, The Sandman is a project long thought impossible to adapt faithfully, but the series somehow manages to weave together the enthralling stories and powerful themes of Gaiman\u2019s acclaimed fantasy saga.\n\nGenre: Fantasy\n\nStars: Tom Sturridge, Boyd Holbrook, Jenna Coleman\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nThe Witcher\n\nGeralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) and Yennefer of Vengerberg (Anya Chalotra) now know who\u2019s been pulling their strings in the Continent, but that knowledge might not be enough to save them as The Witcher returns with the final three episodes of season 3.\n\nWith Geralt waylaid and fighting for his life, Ciri (Freya Allan) is off on an adventure of her own that may prove to be a transformative experience. But all roads lead back to Geralt as the series faces a turning point and a very, very long wait until the fourth season arrives.\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Adventure, Action, Drama\n\nStars: Henry Cavill, Freya Allan, Anya Chalotra, Eamon Farren\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nStranger Things\n\nOne of the most popular original series on Netflix, Stranger Things has become a cultural touchstone in the short time since its 2016 debut. The series\u2019 opening sequence lays out its sci-fi aspirations clearly: A scientist flees down an empty hallway, pursued by some unseen force that eventually nabs him as he waits for elevator doors to close; it then cuts to a group of kids playing D&D in a suburban basement.\n\nThe series is rooted in \u201880s genre nostalgia, from the mysterious creature terrorizing the fictional Indiana town to the secret government agency chasing the group of kids who encounter it. There are pieces of Stephen King, Steven Spielberg, and John Hughes strewn throughout Stranger Things, and the result is a show that will feel immediately familiar to people who grew up with that source material.\n\nFor more info on the final season, check out Stranger Things season 5: Plot, date, and casting rumors.\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi\n\nStars: Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown\n\nSeasons: 4\n\nTrue crime and Docuseries\n\nThe Kings of Tupelo: A Southern Crime Saga\n\nThere have been some wild true crime stories on Netflix before, but The Kings of Tupelo: A Southern Crime Saga might take the cake. If you thought that Tiger King had some eccentric people at the middle of the narrative, then you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. This is a tale that starts with an Elvis impersonator stumbling across a stolen body parts ring and ends with an attempt to frame him for trying to assassinate President Barack Obama.\n\nAll of this really happened to Kevin Curtis, who became a hardcore conspiracy theorist after his initial discovery of the severed body parts. People didn\u2019t listen to Kevin, and someone tried to silence him in the most bizarre way possible. Kevin lived to tell the tale, and what a tale it is.\n\nGenre: True Crime\n\nStars: Everett Dutschke, Kevin Curtis\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nOur Oceans\n\nFormer President Barack Obama produces and narrates Our Oceans, a five-part Netflix original documentary series. This show features some jaw-dropping footage of life beneath the sea as it explores the connections between what\u2019s happening in the water and how it affects everything on land.\n\nOur Oceans starts with breathtaking glimpses of sea life in their natural environment before shifting gears to demonstrate how climate change and human-created pollution have impacted these creatures. Some of the sea life have even found inventive ways to adapt to the presence of plastics in their oceans. The series also explores the ways that these underwater dwellers find mates, which seems to amuse Obama at times.\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nStars: Barack Obama\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nThis is the Zodiac Speaking\n\nThe Zodiac Killer remains an enthralling mystery because the serial killer who terrorized California in the 1960s was never caught. No one was ever formally charged with being the Zodiac killer, but the cops did have at least one suspect: Arthur Leigh Allen. This is the Zodiac Speaking focuses on David and Connie Seawater, a pair of siblings who were close to Allen when they were children.\n\nThe Seawaters share their recollections of Allen, contending that he not only confessed that he was the killer to them, but he also brought them along on some of his murder sprees. Both Seawater siblings are convinced that Allen was behind this reign of terror, but delivering definitive proof may take more than vivid memories shared over three decades after Allen died.\n\nGenre: Documentary, True Crime\n\nStars: J.C. Smith, David Seawater, Connie Seawater\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nPredators\n\nThere are several world-class nature documentaries on Netflix, and the latest addition to that genre, Predators, is all about some of the deadliest hunters in nature. Actor Tom Hardy narrates the series, and naturally, three of the episodes focus on the big cats: cheetahs, lions, and pumas. The remaining two episodes focus on polar bears and wild dogs.\n\nThis miniseries offers a rare opportunity to watch these wild creatures facing real challenges to their survival beyond hunting down their next meal. Unfortunately for these magnificent creatures, climate change and natural disasters may prove to be even deadlier than they are.\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nStars: Tom Hardy\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nOur Planet II\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus, Our Planet is back for another season on Netflix, and it remains one of the most stunningly beautiful nature documentaries on the streamer. David Attenborough returns as the narrator of Our Planet II, which once again explores the impact that climate change has had on the environment and the creatures that live all over the world.\n\nOne of the major themes of this season is migration, as animals struggle to find new places to survive and thrive as they deal with both predators and pollution. As in the first season, the visuals are breathtaking and this is a unique look at the world that most people have never seen in person.\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nStars: David Attenborough\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nAnimation\n\nPantheon\n\nIf the world as we know it is going to end, you can blame the UIs. Uploaded Intelligences may be the next stage of merging man and machine, and the company known as Logorhythms has nearly perfected the process of transferring a human mind into computer code. Pantheon\u2018s animation brings this sci-fi idea to life in startling fashion, with an A-list voice cast that includes Paul Dano, Aaron Eckhart, Rosemarie DeWitt, Daniel Dae Kim, William Hurt, and Ron Livingston.\n\nMaddie Kim (Katie Chang) is thrust into this insane new world when a UI intervenes in her life to protect her from bullies at school. While trying to unravel the mystery, Maddie becomes convinced that the UI is her late father, David Kim (Kim). Meanwhile, another teenager, Caspian Keyes (Dano), is looking into the UIs as well, unaware that Logorhythms is manipulating his entire life.\n\nGenre: Sci-fi, Thriller, Drama\n\nStars: Katie Chang, Paul Dano, Aaron Eckhart, Rosemarie DeWitt, Daniel Dae Kim\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nArcane\n\nArcane is reportedly the most expensive animated series ever created, and every dollar shows up onscreen. The jaw-dropping first season was released in 2021, and now the show has returned for its second and final season, which will be stretched out over three weeks.\n\nIn a steampunk sci-fi fantasy world, the wealthy city known as Piltover has lorded over the poor people of Zaun for decades. Two sisters, Violet (Hailee Steinfeld) and Jinx (Fallout\u2018s Ella Purnell) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. Jinx wanted a war between the cities, and she got her wish in the season 1 finale. Now, the consequences of Jinx\u2019s choice have come home as open warfare breaks out. And the sisters will have to confront each other at least one more time before the end.\n\nGenre: Sci-fi, fantasy, action\n\nStars: Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, Katie Leung, Jason Spisak\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nTerminator Zero\n\nFor the first time in its 40 years of existence, the Terminator franchise is finally getting an animated series of its own. Terminator Zero is ignoring everything but the first two movies and setting the clock back to 1997, shortly before Judgment Day. In Japan, scientist Malcolm Lee (Andr\u00e9 Holland) has created Kokoro (Rosario Dawson), an AI program that may be able to counter Skynet and prevent the end of the world.\n\nFrom Skynet\u2019s future perspective, that\u2019s why Malcolm has to die. Toward that end, a new Terminator (Timothy Olyphant) has been dispatched to the past to kill Malcolm. Meanwhile, the human resistance sends Eiko (Sonoya Mizuno) to protect Malcolm. But if the Terminator can\u2019t find Malcolm, it will move on to its next targets: his children.\n\nGenre: Sci-fi\n\nStars: Timothy Olyphant, Andr\u00e9 Holland, Sonoya Mizuno, Rosario Dawson, Ann Dowd\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nMasters of the Universe: Revolution\n\nThere\u2019s a crisis on Eternia in the next chapter of He-Man\u2019s story in Masters of the Universe: Revolution. For the first time in his life, Prince Adam (Chris Wood) must choose between being the king of his people and being their champion as He-Man. Meanwhile, Teela (Melissa Benoist), undergoes a startling metamorphosis as well.\n\nBut those may be the least of Adam and Teela\u2019s problems, as Skeletor (Mark Hamill, one of the best Joker actors ever) reemerges as the harbinger of Motherboard and the Horde. A revolution is coming, and this time He-Man and his allies are badly outnumbered.\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\nStars: Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Melissa Benoist, Liam Cunningham, Lena Headey\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nSometimes, a show can sneak up on you and become a breakout hit when you least expect it. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now with Blue Eye Samurai, Netflix\u2019s unconventional anime series. Logan and Blade Runner 2049 screenwriter Michael Green teamed up with his wife, Amber Noizumi, to create the series set in Japan\u2019s Edo period when the country was closed off from the world.\n\nMizu (Maya Erskine) is the titular blue-eyed samurai, a distinctive physical trait that she goes to great lengths to hide in her quest for revenge. Mizu\u2019s skills quickly make her a lot of powerful enemies, even though her greatest secret is that she\u2019s a woman, despite passing herself off as a man. She also tends to leave behind a lot of collateral damage in her wake, because she lets nothing get between her and her deadly goal.\n\nGenre: Anime, Drama\n\nStars: Maya Erskine, Masi Oka, Brenda Song, Darren Barnet\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nThe first Castlevania anime was a crossover hit for Netflix that appealed to fans of the video games that inspired it, as well as horror and animation lovers.

With Dracula out of the picture, the Vampire Queen, Erzsebet B\u00e1thory (Franka Potente), is planning an apocalypse that could bring about the end of the world.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take some new heroes to defeat B\u00e1thory, including Richter Belmont (Edward Bluemel), Maria Renard (Pixie Davies), and a former slave-turned-sorceress named Annette (Thuso Mbedu). Each of the trio has a personal stake in this conflict, but none more than Richter. A vampire killed Richter\u2019s mother, Julia Belmont (Sophie Skelton), and he wants his revenge.\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Horror\n\nStars: Edward Bluemel, Pixie Davies, Thuso Mbedu, Franka Potente\n\nSeasons: 1"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nTubular incomplete specimens of Eopriapulites sphinx from the early Cambrian Kuanchuanpu Formation, showing their ventral nerve cord. Credit: Science Advances (2025). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adr0896\n\nAn international team of scientists has uncovered a fascinating piece of the evolutionary puzzle: how the ventral nerve cord, a key component of the central nervous system, evolved in ecdysozoan animals, a group that includes insects, nematodes, and priapulid worms.\n\nTheir findings, published in a paper titled \"Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord\" in Science Advances, provide valuable insights into the origins of these structures in the basal Cambrian period.\n\nThe research team, comprising Dr. Deng Wang (Northwest University), Dr. Jean Vannier (Universit\u00e9 de Lyon), Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n (Queen Mary University of London), and Dr. Mar\u00eda Herranz (Rey Juan Carlos University), analyzed exceptionally well-preserved fossils from key Cambrian deposits. These fossils include representatives of the early-evolving Scalidophora, a subgroup of Ecdysozoa, offering a rare glimpse into the nervous system architecture of ancient animals.\n\nEcdysozoans include arthropods (such as insects and crabs), nematodes (roundworms), and smaller groups like kinorhynchs (\"mud dragons\") and priapulids (\"penis worms\"). Their central nervous systems, which include the brain and ventral nerve cord, have long intrigued scientists seeking to understand the evolutionary relationships between these groups.\n\nFor example, priapulids exhibit a single ventral nerve cord, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs have paired nerve cords, with kinorhynchs also developing paired ganglia. Did the ancestral ecdysozoan have a single or paired ventral nerve cord?\n\nFurthermore, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs share a similar nervous system design to arthropods, they are phylogenetically distant. Are these similarities the result of convergent evolution, or do they reflect a shared evolutionary origin?\n\nScalidophorans, which include priapulids, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs, first appeared in the early Cambrian. They represent a crucial lineage for investigating the evolutionary trajectory of the ventral nerve cord in ecdysozoans.\n\nBy studying fossils from the Fortunian Kuanchuanpu Formation (e.g., Eopriapulites and Eokinorhynchus), the Chengjiang Biota (e.g., Xiaoheiqingella and Mafangscolex), and the Wuliuan Ottoia prolifica, the researchers identified elongate structures running along the ventral side of these ancient organisms.\n\n\"These structures closely resemble the ventral nerve cords seen in modern priapulids,\" explained Dr. Deng Wang and Dr. Jean Vannier. Their analysis indicates that these fossils preserve impressions of single ventral nerve cords, shedding light on the likely ancestral condition for scalidophorans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that a single ventral nerve cord was the ancestral condition for scalidophorans. Moreover, the evolutionary grouping of nematoids and panarthropods (a clade that includes arthropods, tardigrades, and onychophorans) suggests their common ancestor also likely had a single nerve cord.\n\n\"This leads us to propose that the common ancestor of all ecdysozoans possessed a single ventral nerve cord,\" said Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n. \"The paired nerve cords observed in arthropods, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs likely evolved independently, representing derived traits.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Loriciferans, kinorhynchs, and panarthropods exhibit varying degrees of body segmentation, suggesting that these structural changes may have co-evolved with nervous system modifications.\n\nDr. Mar\u00eda Herranz noted, \"The emergence of paired nerve cords likely facilitated greater coordination of movement, particularly in segmented animals. During the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, changes in the nervous and muscular systems were likely tied to the development of appendages, enabling more complex locomotion.\"\n\nThis discovery enriches our understanding of ecdysozoan evolution and underscores the role of the fossil record in addressing key questions about early animal development.\n\nBy linking nervous system structures to broader evolutionary trends, the study provides a clearer picture of how the diverse ecdysozoan lineages arose and adapted to their environments.\n\nMore information: Deng Wang, Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord, Science Advances (2025).

How to see it in Arizona\n\nWe can expect some stunning celestial events in 2025, including the Jan. 13 Wolf Moon and a remarkable planetary parade, where seven planets will align in the night sky, that starts tonight.\n\nA parade of planets occurs when four or more planets appear to line up from our perspective on Earth, though their exact alignment in the solar system is not physically possible.\n\nThe 2025 parade of planets starts on Friday, Jan. 10, peaks on Tuesday, Jan. 21 and will last until Friday, Feb. 21. Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Saturn and Uranus visible to the naked eye. Mercury will briefly join the parade on Jan. 25, though it\u2019s difficult to spot due to its proximity to the sun.\n\nFor all the biggest celestial events of 2025, check out our comprehensive astronomical calendar as well as our guide to all the comets coming our way this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere is everything to know about the planet parade.\n\nWhat does the parade of planets mean?\n\nThe parade of planets is an astronomical phenomenon in which several planets appear aligned or grouped in the night sky from Earth's perspective.\n\nAlthough the planets are not physically aligned in space, they form a visually striking configuration along the ecliptic plane, the apparent path of the sun across the sky.\n\nDepending on the number of visible planets, this phenomenon can range from a mini planetary alignment involving three planets to a grand parade showcasing all the solar system's major planets.\n\nHow rare is a planet parade?\n\nThe rarity of a planet parade depends on the number of planets involved and their arrangement. Planet parades can be categorized into different types, according to Star Walk:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMini planet parade (three planets) : This is fairly common, occurring a few times each year.\n\nModerate planet parade (four or five planets) : Happens approximately every 1 to 2 years.\n\nLarge planet parades (six or seven planets) : This is much more rare, occurring roughly every 10 to 20 years.\n\nGrand alignments (all eight planets): True grand alignments involving all eight planets are extremely rare, occurring once every 100 to 200 years or more.\n\nWhen was the last time all the planets aligned?\n\nThe last time all eight planets aligned was on Dec. 28, 2022, according to Sky and Telescope.org.\n\nA six-planet parade of planets occurred in June 2024.\n\nWhen can you see the parade of planets?\n\nThe parade of planets will begin to take shape on Friday, Jan. 10, as the planets gradually start aligning in the night sky, according to the Farmers' Almanac.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe alignment will peak on Jan. 21, when Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Saturn and Uranus will be visible together. The planets will remain visible through the end of February, with the best viewing conditions happening just after sunset.\n\nWhat will the planet align in 2025?\n\nIn 2025, six planets will be in alignment: Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune and Saturn, according to Live Science.com.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Mercury will briefly join the planetary parade, creating a rare lineup of all seven planets visible from Earth. However, spotting Mercury will be challenging due to its small size and proximity to the sun, where its glare hides it from the naked eye.\n\nWhere will the Planet Parade be visible?\n\nMost, if not all, locations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico should be able to see the planetary parade. In Arizona, look toward the southwestern horizon just after sunset.\n\nCan you see the planet parade without a telescope?\n\nYou can see a good deal of the planet parade without a telescope, but visibility depends on the darkness of your location and each planet's brightness.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVenus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Mercury, Uranus and Neptune require a telescope or strong binoculars because they are much dimmer.\n\nFor the best viewing, find a dark sky location with minimal light pollution and a clear horizon view.\n\nGot a story you want to share?

            "article_content": "If you\u2019re a procurement specialist looking for software to run a new car\u2019s park assist, voice commands, or chassis controls, there\u2019s now an app store for that. SDVerse, a vehicle software marketplace for automakers and suppliers, launched this past September and is already changing how the code in cars is sold and bought.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a procurement specialist, you might be wondering, \u201cSo what?\u201d It likely won\u2019t be obvious to car buyers, but success for SDVerse could eventually lead to vehicles with better and more sophisticated software than today\u2019s status quo. By helping automakers and suppliers find the right software faster, SDVerse aims to shorten the time it takes to get a new model on the road. That should help automakers reduce their development costs while also shrinking the gulf between the tech in consumer electronics and what\u2019s in a brand-new car.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of software that gets sourced in a not very efficient manner,\u201d SDVerse CEO Prashant Gulati told MotorTrend at CES 2025. \u201cWe estimate that $100 billion of software was purchased in the last three years and the annual spending is going to double in the next seven years. But consumers are not going to pay double what they\u2019re paying for cars today. Where is that money going to come from? That\u2019s the work we\u2019re trying to help the industry with.\u201d\n\nPurchasing managers have traditionally relied on trade conferences, direct outreach to suppliers, and Google searches to find the software they need, and the procurement process typically starts with a request for quotes that can take up to six months just to determine what\u2019s available that meets the buyer\u2019s criteria. Even with that drawn out process, automakers sometimes don\u2019t end up with the best software for their needs. Gulati says he\u2019s heard from GM that the automaker has already used the platform to connect with a supplier that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been on its radar.\n\nGM is one of three founding members, along with suppliers Magna and Wipro, that provided the financial backing to launch SDVerse. Sixteen companies are currently signed up to sell and/or buy on the platform, including Renault Group, FEV, Valeo, Cummins, Forvia, TTTech Auto, NXP, and Bosch Engineering.\n\nLess than four months after launching, the marketplace has grown from an initial 160 software products to 200 across four categories: onboard (software that runs inside the vehicle), offboard (cloud- and mobile-based software), tools (software used to develop other software) and services (hiring another company to develop software). SDVerse simplifies the discovery and matchmaking processes by collecting information on up to 200 attributes for each product and presenting it in a way that allows easy comparison. The company is also developing an AI-powered chatbot to help users conduct research. Buyers can use the marketplace to message sellers or put out requests for information, but pricing and final purchasing agreements are handled outside of the SDVerse platform.\n\nGulati says SDVerse will be successful if it empowers buyers to find the best software and helps sellers make deals faster. That may not sound like a big deal to the average MotorTrend reader, but by speeding up the corporate-industrial machine that makes the machines we love, SDVerse might just modernize the auto industry and the cars it builds."

            "article_content": "These 17 leaders, pioneers, and experts are driving the auto industry toward a future with smarter and more sophisticated cars.\n\nWhile EVs and autonomous cars earn all the headlines, software-defined vehicles are quietly revolutionizing how we move around the world with relatively little fanfare. Cars with fewer but more powerful computers running cutting-edge software are changing every interaction we have with our vehicles\u2014from unlocking and starting them to steering and braking them.\n\nWhile it largely goes unnoticed by the general public and mainstream media, the work being done on SDVs is transforming not just the cars we drive, but how automakers design and engineer them. That\u2019s why, in addition to MotorTrend\u2019s ongoing coverage of SDVs themselves, for the past three years we\u2019ve recognized the key individuals behind this transformation.\n\nThe 2025 MotorTrend Software-Defined Vehicle Innovator Awards, presented in partnership with QNX, celebrate the executives, engineers, and product managers steering the auto industry toward a new software-centric paradigm. The awards are given in three categories\u2014Pioneers, Leaders, and Experts\u2014with individuals nominated by their colleagues and collaborators. A panel of MotorTrend senior editorial staff chose the winners based on their achievements and impact.

Musk has alleged that OpenAI has strayed from its nonprofit origins, claiming it abandoned its founding mission of advancing AI for the public good when it began receiving billions in funding from Microsoft starting in 2019.\n\nMusk\u2019s recent filing seeks an injunction to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model, labeling the move \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nA hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Tuesday in Oakland, California.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI has dismissed Musk\u2019s lawsuit as baseless, arguing that his claims are inconsistent with his past support for a corporate structure that allowed for-profit operations.\n\nThe company has defended the board stints of Hoffman and Templeton, stating they did not breach antitrust laws.\n\nOpenAI has so far refrained from commenting on Friday\u2019s filing but maintains that its restructuring aligns with its strategic goals.\n\nA long-running dispute\n\nThis legal battle marks the latest chapter in Musk\u2019s history with OpenAI. The billionaire, who departed from the company in 2018 and later founded rival AI firm xAI in 2023, first filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in February before withdrawing it in June.\n\nThe litigation was reintroduced in federal court in August.\n\nMusk argues that without immediate judicial intervention, OpenAI\u2019s market dominance could stifle competition, making it nearly impossible for rivals to compete with what he describes as Altman\u2019s \u201cbehemoth.\u201d\n\nThe case, Musk v. Altman, continues in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, with significant implications for AI regulation, corporate governance, and the future of the technology sector."

            "article_content": "TrialTranslator uncovers the survival gap for high-risk patients and offers a path to better cancer research.\n\nStudy: Evaluating generalizability of oncology trial results to real-world patients using machine learning-based trial emulations. Image Credit: Komsan Loonprom/Shutterstock.com\n\nMany cancer trial results don\u2019t generalize well to real-world patients. A research team explored this issue with TrialTranslator, a machine-learning framework that systematically tests cancer RCT findings for generalizability. Findings published in Nature Medicine.\n\nPoor generalizability of RCT results\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating cancer therapies. However, their findings often fail to translate to real-world settings, leaving patients, physicians, and drug regulators concerned about the limited generalizability of these results.\n\nIn oncology, real-world survival times and treatment benefits are often significantly lower than those reported in RCTs, with median overall survival (mOS) sometimes reduced by as much as six months. Newer anti-cancer agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, also underperform when applied to the diverse patient populations seen outside clinical trials.\n\nReasons for the difference\n\nA key reason for this gap is the restrictive eligibility criteria often used in RCTs, which create study populations that do not reflect the diversity of real-world patients. Trial participants are often younger, healthier, and less likely to have comorbidities.\n\nUnofficial biases, such as preferential selection based on race or socioeconomic status, may also influence recruitment. These limitations fail to account for the heterogeneity of real-world patients, whose outcomes can vary widely even with identical treatment protocols.\n\nThe current study sought to address this issue by improving the prediction of real-world outcomes for cancer treatments evaluated in phase 3 RCTs. To do this, researchers developed TrialTranslator, a machine-learning (ML) framework designed to assess the generalizability of RCT results systematically.\n\nBy leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) and advanced ML algorithms, the framework identifies patterns and phenotypes that may influence treatment outcomes, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of survival benefits across diverse patient groups.\n\nAbout the study\n\nUsing a comprehensive nationwide EHR database from Flatiron Health, researchers applied TrialTranslator to evaluate 11 landmark RCTs. These trials covered four of the most common advanced solid cancers\u2014metastatic breast cancer (mBC), metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC).\n\nEach RCT was emulated by identifying real-world patients with matching cancer types, biomarker profiles, and treatment regimens.\n\nPatients were stratified into three prognostic phenotypes (low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk) based on their mortality risk scores derived from ML models. The framework then assessed survival outcomes, including mOS and restricted mean survival time (RMST), to compare treatment effects across these phenotypes with the results reported in the original RCTs.\n\nKey Findings: A Risk-Dependent Gap in Outcomes\n\nThe study revealed a striking disparity between RCT findings and real-world outcomes:\n\nLow- and Medium-Risk Patients: These phenotypes demonstrated survival times and treatment benefits that closely aligned with the RCT results. For instance, low-risk patients often experienced survival benefits similar to those reported in clinical trials, with only a minor reduction in mOS (approximately two months).\n\nHigh-Risk Patients: In contrast, high-risk phenotypes showed significantly worse outcomes. Survival benefits were markedly reduced\u201462% lower than RCT estimates\u2014and often fell outside the 95% confidence intervals reported in the original trials. Seven of the eleven emulated trials failed to show a clinically meaningful survival improvement (greater than three months) for high-risk patients.\n\nOverall, emulated trials consistently estimated survival outcomes that were, on average, 35% lower than those reported in the RCTs. This disparity highlights the challenges of translating trial findings to more heterogeneous real-world populations.\n\nRobust Validation of Results\n\nThe robustness of these findings was confirmed through extensive validation. Subgroup analyses, semi-synthetic data simulations, and alternative eligibility criteria demonstrated consistent results, reinforcing the reliability of TrialTranslator. Sensitivity analyses also showed that stricter eligibility criteria had little impact on the observed disparities, suggesting that patient prognosis, rather than inclusion criteria, plays a more critical role in determining treatment outcomes.\n\nImplications for Oncology\n\nThese findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift in clinical trial design and interpretation. Current RCTs often overlook the prognostic heterogeneity of real-world patients, which contributes to their limited generalizability. High-risk patients, in particular, are underserved by existing trials, as their outcomes deviate most significantly from RCT results.\n\nTools like TrialTranslator offer a promising solution. By integrating EHR-derived data with ML-based phenotyping, they can provide personalized predictions of treatment benefits at the individual patient level. This enables more informed clinical decision-making, helping patients and clinicians set realistic expectations for treatment outcomes.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, these tools could revolutionize trial design by prioritizing patient prognosis over traditional eligibility criteria. By stratifying patients based on risk phenotypes, future trials could better represent the full spectrum of cancer patients and provide more accurate estimates of treatment efficacy.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u2018\u2019This study highlights the substantial role that prognostic heterogeneity plays in the limited generalizability of RCT results,\u201d the authors conclude. While low- and medium-risk patients may benefit as expected from cancer therapies, high-risk patients often experience diminished survival gains.\n\nML-based frameworks like TrialTranslator could help bridge this gap, enabling more inclusive trials and better real-world outcomes. With tools like this, oncology can move closer to truly personalized treatment approaches that account for the diverse needs of real-world patients."

Today, North Korea\u2019s secretive dictator oversees an isolated society and command economy, portraying himself as the benevolent protector of a nation under siege from hostile foreign powers. Its wealthy, democratic southern neighbor is an industrial and technological powerhouse that\u2019s exporting its culture to the world, shielded from the nuclear-armed North by a defense treaty with the US.\n\nMore than 1 million troops, and one of the heaviest concentrations of weapons anywhere, face off along a strip of no-man\u2019s land that\u2019s divided the two Koreas since 1953. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been raising the stakes by expanding his nuclear arsenal and threatening to unleash it on the US and its allies. North Korean soldiers destroyed main roads and rail links to the South in October 2024, the latest symbolic blow to prospects for reunification. Meanwhile, a postwar generation is dying without ever having fulfilled the dream of meeting their relatives living across the border.\n\nWhy are North Korea and South Korea separate countries?\n\nKorea was a single nation for centuries under the Goryeo and the Joseon dynasties, and through a period of Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. The Soviet Union joined with the US to expel the Japanese from the peninsula in the latter days of World War II. The victors divided the country, with Russia exerting its influence north of the 38th parallel \u2014 the line of latitude 38 degrees north of the equator \u2014 and the US doing the same in the south. What was supposed to be a temporary arrangement became permanent as the Cold War set in and the two Koreas became proxies for the superpowers. The Republic of Korea was formed in the South in August 1948. Its first president was Syngman Rhee, a convert to Christianity who was educated at an American Methodist school. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea was established in the North the following month, led by the Soviet-trained Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the country\u2019s current leader.\n\nIn June 1950, North Korea invaded the South in an attempt to unite the peninsula under Soviet-style rule. US-led United Nations forces fought back on behalf of the South, and communist China sent in troops to support North Korea. An estimated 3 million people died as a result of the fighting, a large majority of them civilians. In 1953, an armistice was signed and a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) wide demilitarized zone established along the lines where the opposing forces had reached a stalemate, severing cross-border movement and separating families and friends living on either side of it. With no permanent peace treaty, the conflict never formally came to an end.\n\nUS marines at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, December 1950.

Today, South Korea produces more goods and services in six days than North Korea does in a year, even though the South, with almost 52 million people, is only twice as populous. Its industrial conglomerates make much of the world\u2019s consumer electronics and household appliances and are major players in semiconductors, smartphones and electric cars. Samsung Electronics produces 41% of the world\u2019s DRAM chips and 33% of NAND memory chips \u2014 crucial inputs for companies from Apple Inc. to Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s decades-long economic boom has lifted living standards to a point where the country outperforms many other wealthy nations in terms of education and health. High disposable incomes have underpinned its creative industries, and Korean culture, including hit Netflix shows such as Squid Game and K-Pop bands like BTS, has become a major export.\n\nDividing Lines Disputed waters west of Korea are a potential conflict zone Source: Data compiled by Bloomberg\n\nNorth Korea is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. South Korea\u2019s central bank estimates that the North\u2019s annual gross domestic product per capita is about $1,000, positioning it among the ranks of instability-wracked countries such as Sudan and Yemen. South Korea\u2019s per capita GDP was $33,121 in 2023, according to the World Bank.\n\nBecause of frequent droughts, severe flooding and economic mismanagement, food scarcity is often a problem. A famine in the 1990s caused untold misery, with death estimates ranging from 240,000 to 3.5 million people. It only ended thanks in large part to Chinese aid.\n\nThe two countries are almost entirely cut off from one another, with no telephone, internet or postal links, no direct air or sea connections, and now no roads or railways either.\n\nA production line at a tractor plant in North Korea in 1980.

Photographer: Jun Michael Park/The New York Times/Redux\n\nAre North Koreans able to move to South Korea?\n\nNorth Koreans are rarely allowed to travel abroad. An unauthorized effort to leave the country can result in imprisonment or death. Dodging soldiers, razor-wire fencing and landmines in the DMZ is especially dangerous. Those who successfully defect usually cross the border with China instead, with some then making their way to a third country before seeking asylum in South Korea. China and North Korea have stepped up surveillance of their frontier in recent years and defections have declined sharply. From a record of almost 3,000 in 2009, the number fell to 196 in 2023, according to South Korean government data.\n\nHow different are the people of North and South Korea?\n\nBecause of poor diet and harsh living conditions, North Koreans on average are between 3 and 8 centimeters (1.1-3.1 inches) shorter than South Koreans. Refugees from the North often struggle to assimilate in South Korea and their children find it hard to adjust to its highly competitive school system. Some complain of a stigma associated with their origin and try to lose their northern accents. Navigating online bureaucracy and cashless payments add further challenges as North Koreans are often unfamiliar with digital technology and the South is one of the world\u2019s most digitalized societies.\n\nThe Korean language has evolved differently in the two countries. The regime in the North has sought to purge foreign words, including some associated with western consumerism. South Koreans have embraced English vocabulary, incorporating a slew of borrowed and mashed-up \u201cKonglish\u201d phrases into the vernacular. These include words such as \u201cwonpiesu\u201d (from \u201cone piece\u201d) for the word \u201cdress\u201d and \u201capatu\u201d for \u201capartment.\u201d\n\nLanguage in the North has been influenced by the harsh tone of much of the propaganda that pervades media there. The rough style of many North Korean greetings is sometimes misconstrued as rudeness by Southerners.\n\nSouth Korea has mandatory military service for young men, meaning that almost all serve for a time in the armed forces to defend against a possible attack from the North. Military life is even more deeply embedded in northern society. The country has 1.28 million active military personnel \u2014 about 5% of the population.\n\nIn this photo provided by the North Korean government, youth groups perform at an event in February 2024 to mark the 76th anniversary of the country's founding.

As leadership has passed from the founder Kim Il Sung to his son Kim Jong Il and now his grandson, Kim Jong Un, the family has built a vigorous personality cult. State propaganda asserts that their bloodline hails from Mount Paektu, which straddles the border between North Korea and China and is considered a sacred site by many Koreans.\n\nKim\u2019s rule is stable, and the fixtures of his regime are pervasive. State security stamps out dissent and the country\u2019s propaganda machine relentlessly portrays Kim as the protector of the Korean people. Much of the country\u2019s limited resources have gone to building its military, bolstering the narrative of a nation united against the constant threat of annihilation by the US and its allies. The current Kim has brought his preteen daughter, identified by South Korean intelligence as Kim Ju Ae, to missile tests and military parades, demonstrating that there\u2019s another generation waiting in the wings that will be equipped for survival.\n\nReunification of the two Koreas would carry big opportunities but enormous risks.\n\nSouth Korean companies could benefit from low-cost workers and new commercial opportunities. But merging two countries with such divergent cultural outlooks and contrasting levels of economic development and education would be a vast enterprise. South Korea\u2019s National Assembly Budget Office said in a 2015 report that spending of 4.8 quadrillion won ($3.45 trillion) would be required over half a century to raise the North\u2019s per capita income level to 66% of the average in the South.\n\nKim Jong Il with his father, Kim Il Sung, in an undated photograph.

Photographer: Kim Hong-Ji/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWho is Kim Jong Un?\n\nWhen he took power after his father\u2019s death in 2011, foreign observers questioned whether a leader in his late 20s could rule a country where seniority was revered. He soon exerted authority over geriatric generals and eliminated potential rivals. He executed his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, on charges of treason, corruption and factionalism. (Analysts said Jang was viewed as a threat to Kim\u2019s power.) Kim was also suspected of having ordered the killing of his older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam. The exiled sibling, whose existence may have undermined the legitimacy of Kim\u2019s rule, died after being exposed to the nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.\n\nKim\u2019s remaining siblings include older brother Kim Jong Chol, who has no official title and seems to be more interested in playing guitar than politics, according to a book by a senior North Korean diplomat who defected. Kim\u2019s younger sister Kim Yo Jong has been the point person for pressure campaigns on South Korea and the US. Her tasks include shaping propaganda, appearing at her brother\u2019s side for high-level meetings, and picking up the cigarette butts he flings in the corridors of power.\n\nNow in his 40s, Kim is overweight and a heavy smoker, and questions surround his health. South Korea\u2019s spy agency assesses that he has three children, including perhaps a school-age son and the daughter, Ju Ae, who has been dubbed the \u201crespected daughter\u201d and \u201cbeloved child\u201d by state media and is a potential future leadership candidate.\n\nIn this photo provided by the North Korean government, Kim Jong Un and his daughter observe an air force demonstration to commemorate the \"Day of Airmen\" in North Korea, in November 2023.

Source: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service/AP\n\nDo North Koreans approve of Kim\u2019s leadership?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know because citizens are compelled to show unwavering support for the regime, and unwelcome expressions of personal opinion can result in imprisonment. South Korea\u2019s government has conducted extensive surveys of North Korean emigres. In a 2024 poll of more than 6,350 defectors, 44% said that when they lived in the North they did not want the Kims to remain in power, while 38% said they did. Younger North Korean defectors were more likely to have been exposed to outside influences and were more skeptical of the North Korean state\u2019s messages, the survey showed. Among respondents age 50 and older, 47% had a favorable view of North Korea\u2019s leadership.\n\nHow does Kim keep the North Korean people in line?\n\nState media drills it into the people that they should fear the US and its \u201cpuppet traitors\u201d in South Korea. The leader is presented as a father figure who deserves the love and respect due to a good parent. The message is inescapable, because all media are controlled by the state. TV and radio devotedly recount Kim\u2019s visits to factories, farms and military bases, conveying the idea that he\u2019s deeply concerned about the lives of workers, farmers and soldiers. Another theme: If citizens encounter problems, it\u2019s always the fault of government officials who failed to faithfully follow Kim\u2019s advice.\n\nKim Jong Un tours a North Korean munitions factory in January 2024. Source: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service/AP\n\nWhat is the likelihood of a coup?\n\nA coup is a possibility given the concentration of power in a single leader with health issues, and the potential for North Korea's grinding poverty to produce political instability. North Korea watchers suggest that if it were to happen, it would be orchestrated by the military. Kim Jong Un cycled through top military officials and defense ministers in the first several years of his rule, \u201cwhich points to fears of a coup or at least insubordination at crucial moments,\u201d Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute think tank, wrote in NK News, a Seoul-based news site focused on North Korean affairs.\n\nHowever, an overthrow is not seen as likely. The government has cut the population off from the outside world, listens in on people\u2019s communications, has citizens keep tabs on each other, and punishes anyone who gets out of line by sending them to prison. North Korea employs a system known as \u201cthree generations of punishment,\u201d in which the parents and children of political prisoners can also be jailed for their transgressions, according to the US State Department. Milder punishments include banishment from the capital, Pyongyang, which can end a person\u2019s career and deny their children any chance of advancement.\n\nRecently, Kim\u2019s regime has received a boost from aid, including food and fuel, sent by Moscow in exchange for military supplies useful in Russia's war in Ukraine. The deliveries have helped to stabilize prices in North Korea and expand the economy, according to South Korean officials.\n\nBloomberg Originals explores how North Korea managed to build a formidable nuclear arsenal despite being one of the poorest nations in the world. Though Pyongyang regularly threatens the West, the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Un, recently has raised the stakes, with the help of Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhat is the North Korean nuclear threat?\n\nKim has focused much of his energies on turning North Korea into a country that can credibly deliver a nuclear attack on the US mainland. He has expanded its arsenal of atomic warheads and modernized the missiles that would carry them, relying on domestic technology that can be manufactured despite sanctions. The buildup has led to speculation as to his intentions. Some experts see it as a form of insurance policy, showing the US it would pay a high price if it tried to oust Kim. Success in nuclear weapons may also help to divert attention at home from Kim\u2019s failures in other areas.\n\nA ceremony to mark the delivery of nuclear-capable missile launchers in Pyongyang, August 2024.

Source: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service/AP\n\nHave North Korea and South Korea attacked each other since the war?\n\nThere have been no cases where exchanges of live fire went on for days and resulted in mass casualties. But there have been deadly and isolated altercations, almost always initiated by North Korea. One flashpoint is the Yellow Sea border islands that are part of South Korea but located in waters claimed by the North. In 2010, some two years before Kim Jong Un took power, Yeonpyeong Island was the scene of a deadly artillery bombardment that killed two South Korean soldiers and two civilians. About six months earlier, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing its warship Cheonan near the island, killing 46 sailors \u2014 an allegation the North denied.\n\nDo South Koreans want reunification?\n\nIt depends on whom you ask. Younger South Koreans are generally more comfortable with the idea of North Korea as a foreign country. Fewer than half of millennials in the South think unification is necessary, compared with nearly three-quarters of people born before 1950, according to a 2024 survey from the Korea Institute for National Unification."

            "article_content": "The collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has alarmed many regional countries, including the UAE and Egypt - but Israel is particularly concerned by this development.\n\nAn Israeli government committee has even suggested that a Syria ruled by Sunni Islamists who don\u2019t recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist could potentially pose a bigger threat to the country than Iran, Israel\u2019s archenemy.\n\nThe committee was particularly unnerved by Turkey\u2019s influence in Syria, claiming that Ankara could use the new Syrian government as a proxy force \u201cto restore the Ottoman Crown to its former glory\u201d - whatever that means.\n\nThe report noted that Ankara could rapidly rearm the new Syrian government, potentially triggering a direct conflict between Israel and Turkey.\n\nBut is this a realistic scenario? In short, the answer is no.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nAlthough Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gradually weakened Turkish-Israeli bilateral relations - cutting trade ties, denying air travel to senior Israeli officials, accusing Tel Aviv of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and delivering fiery populist speeches hinting that the Turkish army could one day aid the Palestinian people - there is no indication that Ankara seeks a military confrontation with Israel.\n\nApart from the fact that both Turkey and Israel are US allies, and the two sides have never engaged in a military conflict, Ankara has no appetite for such adventures - especially while the region is already grappling with an ongoing war between Iran and Israel, alongside the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.\n\nTurkey's objectives in Syria\n\nTurkey\u2019s aims in Syria are very clear, and they have been communicated both publicly and privately to all actors involved.\n\nFirstly, as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted, Ankara wants a stable Syria that poses no threat to other nations. Secondly, Turkey envisions a democratic, unitary and civil state in Syria - one that embraces minorities and all ethnic groups, while preventing the formation of a Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) statelet.\n\nAfter hosting millions of Syrian refugees for more than a decade and conducting multiple military operations, which have cost Turkish lives and hundreds of millions of dollars, Ankara wants a Syria that can economically and socially flourish. A conflict with Israel, whether direct or indirect, does not align with that goal.\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake\n\nSo far, Turkey\u2019s actions have supported these objectives.\n\nAnkara initially - and to a large extent - turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s aerial campaign to destroy remnants of the Assad regime\u2019s military facilities. But after Israel expanded its targets significantly, Fidan announced that Turkey had relayed a message to Israel that such attacks must stop.\n\nFidan acknowledged Israeli concerns that arms, such as chemical weapons, could fall into the wrong hands. Notably, Israel has avoided striking any Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) targets.\n\nFurthermore, Turkey has reportedly taken the first steps to establish a deconfliction mechanism with the Israeli military in Syria. Reports also point to routine engagements between Turkish and Israeli intelligence agencies.\n\nIn addition, according to my sources, Ankara has encouraged HTS leaders, including Ahmed al-Sharaa, to issue statements advocating calm with Israel. Several HTS figures have publicly said they are not seeking a clash with Israel.\n\nRisks of fragmentation\n\nMeanwhile, according to my Turkish contacts, there are indications that Damascus may seek to engage Ankara militarily, potentially moving Turkish advisers to Syrian military academies and airbases, to help re-establish a unified Syrian army under the Syrian defence ministry.\n\nTurkey is mindful of Israeli concerns regarding such cooperation. What I hear is that Turkey's deployments will be limited. They would not go beyond Hama and, to some extent, Damascus - an effort to reassure Israel that Ankara\u2019s actions are not hostile.\n\nBut Israel must come to terms with the fact that Ankara will not tolerate a PKK-controlled statelet in northern Syria. Turkey has consistently insisted that Kurdish groups must be integrated into a unified Syrian state.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Syria threaten regional stability and will ultimately backfire Read More \u00bb\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake.\n\nAnother report in Israel Hayom this week also talked about Israel's plan for an international conference to divide Syria into canons.\n\nA fragmented Syria would be a breeding ground for armed groups, further destabilising the region and creating long-term risks for Israel. By contrast, a democratic and inclusive Syria serves everyone\u2019s interests.\n\nUnfortunately, it is clear that Israel\u2019s leadership prefers dealing with autocratic regimes, which are more transactional and reliable in their oppressive policies - making Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and the occupied West Bank easier to justify and swallow.\n\nIt is true that Turkey now has a friend in Damascus. Erdogan stands to benefit from this relationship on multiple fronts: domestically, economically and regionally.\n\nBut this does not mean that the new Syrian government will become a Turkish proxy. On the contrary, if fortune is on our side, Syria will - for the first time - have a legitimate administration focused on one thing only: rebuilding the country as a place of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "New AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D gaming CPUs could have been produced with even better specs, but to do so would have made them far too expensive. That\u2019s according to AMD, who stated at CES this week that its new Ryzen 9000X3D series only has a single 3D V-Cache, rather than a long-speculated dual configuration, to keep them cheap enough to make and sell for gamers.\n\nThe inclusion of the 3D V-Cache into Ryzen CPUs has given AMD the edge over Intel in recent years, when it comes to gaming performance, with its flagship models regularly reaching the top of best gaming CPU charts. However, while it makes sense for the likes of the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D to only feature a single 3D V-Cache \u2013 as that chip only has one CPU die \u2013 higher-end models that use two CPU dies could in theory host two cache dies, yet AMD has chosen not to implement this option.\n\nIn an interview with German tech site HardwareLuxx, AMD confirmed that there isn\u2019t a technical limitation that prevents a dual 3D V-Cache being used in Ryzen CPUs. Instead, it\u2019s all down to cost, as it would \u201csimply be too expensive\u201d to produce and sell.\n\nAMD also believes that \u201cgames would not benefit\u201d from having a 3D V-Cache on both chiplets because the potential performance boost is essentially already provided by the single additional 64MB 3D V-Cache die. There would be a benefit in some situations but not enough that the extra cost of manufacturer and to customers would be worthwhile.\n\nAccording to HardwareLuxx\u2019s report, AMD has \u201crepeatedly considered\u201d producing Ryzen X3D CPUs with 3D V-Cache on both chiplets, but continually come to the conclusion that production and likely retail cost wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\n\nWhile AMD has tweaked the layout of recent X3D chips to improve thermal performance, it looks like a Ryzen X3D CPU launch with two larger caches isn\u2019t going to be in the pipeline, at least for now.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean these CPUs are likely to underperform, however. During the 9900X3D announcement at CES this week, AMD suggested that the new CPUs will continue to outpace Intel, with the 9950X3D set to be 20% faster than the Intel Core Ultra 285K and within 1% of the performance of the 9800X3D in games. We\u2019ll have to wait until these new X3D CPUs launch, sometime in Q1 2025, before we can test that theory out for ourselves.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our AMD Ryzen 9800X3D review to see just how well these X3D CPUs perform in the real world, with the 9800X3D offering the best performance for gaming that you can find right now."

(Peter Kramer/Getty Images)\n\nBut when an autopsy was done following Williams\u2019 death, it revealed he was actually suffering from undiagnosed Lewy body dementia (LBD) that was progressively causing his Parkinson's-type symptoms.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe NHS explains this is one of the most common types of dementia and that those with it may experience; hallucinations and hearing voices; problems with understanding, thinking, memory and judgement; confusion or sleepiness; slow movement, stiff limbs and tremors; disturbed sleep; fainting spells, unsteadiness and falls; depression and anxiety.\n\nThere is currently no cure for LBD or treatment that will slow it down but there are treatments to help control some symptoms. It is said the average survival time after a diagnosis is about five to seven years but that\u2019s highly variable.\n\nIn 2021, Williams\u2019 son Zak spoke out about the disease and his dad\u2019s misdiagnosis which left him \u2018very uncomfortable\u2019 and \u2018frustrated\u2019 in his final years.\n\nRobin and Zak Williams. (Jamie McCarthy/WireImage for Timo Wallets LLC)\n\nAdvert\n\nHe said on Max Lugavere's The Genius Life podcast: \u201cWhat he was going through didn't match one-to-one [with] many Parkinson's patients' experiences. So, I think that was hard for him.\n\n\u201cThere was a focus issue that frustrated him, there were issues associated with how he felt, and also from a neurological perspective, he didn't feel great. He was very uncomfortable\", he continued, adding that the incorrect medical information and medication may have 'exacerbated the situation'.\n\n\"They're also really hard on the mind and the body.\n\n\"The diagnosis was different than the disease so I think it could be a situation where you're taking stuff and experiencing purely the side effects of [the drug].\"\n\nAdvert\n\nHe added that the disease and misdiagnosis prevented his father\u2019s ability to \u2018perform his craft\u2019, having further impact on his mental health.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been affected by any of these issues and want to speak to someone in confidence, please don\u2019t suffer alone.

Its rule began when the Emperor Constantine split the Roman Empire into a western and eastern half.\n\nThe eastern half remained the dominant power in ancient Europe throughout the rest of late antiquity and even during parts of the middle ages, eventually coming to be known as the Byzantine Empire.\n\nIts capital, Constantinople, was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, thus marking the end of the Empire's more than 1,000-year reign.\n\nWhile the recently excavated settlement was still active during the Byzantine period, it expanded significantly, the researchers concluded.\n\nThis growth included the construction of the monastery and the winepress.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered a 'very sophisticated' winepress, which made wine that was sent throughout the country and to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea\n\nLike the monastery, the winepress also features mosaic flooring in the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat, made of blue and white stones\n\nThe researchers also uncovered numerous artifacts from the site, including 'good quality toys that show status'\n\nLike the monastery, the winepress also features mosaic flooring in the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat, made of blue and white stones.\n\nThe researchers described this winepress as 'very sophisticated,' adding that its construction and development likely involved 'significant financial resources, time and a range of professional work and effort.'\n\nIt produced wine that was sent both throughout the country and to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea, they said.\n\nThe dig also uncovered ample evidence of local pottery production, such as detritus left behind by a ceramic factory, garbage pits, discarded vessels that were misshaped during production, and even a number of vessels that are 'unique to this site.'\n\n'The discovery of the site highlights the historical richness of Kiryat Gat and its surroundings, shedding light on the centrality of the region in antiquity,' said Svetlana Talis, Director of the Southern Region at the Israel Antiquities Authority."

Credit: Science Advances (2025). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adr0896\n\nAn international team of scientists has uncovered a fascinating piece of the evolutionary puzzle: how the ventral nerve cord, a key component of the central nervous system, evolved in ecdysozoan animals, a group that includes insects, nematodes, and priapulid worms.\n\nTheir findings, published in a paper titled \"Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord\" in Science Advances, provide valuable insights into the origins of these structures in the basal Cambrian period.\n\nThe research team, comprising Dr. Deng Wang (Northwest University), Dr. Jean Vannier (Universit\u00e9 de Lyon), Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n (Queen Mary University of London), and Dr. Mar\u00eda Herranz (Rey Juan Carlos University), analyzed exceptionally well-preserved fossils from key Cambrian deposits. These fossils include representatives of the early-evolving Scalidophora, a subgroup of Ecdysozoa, offering a rare glimpse into the nervous system architecture of ancient animals.\n\nEcdysozoans include arthropods (such as insects and crabs), nematodes (roundworms), and smaller groups like kinorhynchs (\"mud dragons\") and priapulids (\"penis worms\"). Their central nervous systems, which include the brain and ventral nerve cord, have long intrigued scientists seeking to understand the evolutionary relationships between these groups.\n\nFor example, priapulids exhibit a single ventral nerve cord, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs have paired nerve cords, with kinorhynchs also developing paired ganglia. Did the ancestral ecdysozoan have a single or paired ventral nerve cord?\n\nFurthermore, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs share a similar nervous system design to arthropods, they are phylogenetically distant. Are these similarities the result of convergent evolution, or do they reflect a shared evolutionary origin?\n\nScalidophorans, which include priapulids, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs, first appeared in the early Cambrian. They represent a crucial lineage for investigating the evolutionary trajectory of the ventral nerve cord in ecdysozoans.\n\nBy studying fossils from the Fortunian Kuanchuanpu Formation (e.g., Eopriapulites and Eokinorhynchus), the Chengjiang Biota (e.g., Xiaoheiqingella and Mafangscolex), and the Wuliuan Ottoia prolifica, the researchers identified elongate structures running along the ventral side of these ancient organisms.\n\n\"These structures closely resemble the ventral nerve cords seen in modern priapulids,\" explained Dr. Deng Wang and Dr. Jean Vannier. Their analysis indicates that these fossils preserve impressions of single ventral nerve cords, shedding light on the likely ancestral condition for scalidophorans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that a single ventral nerve cord was the ancestral condition for scalidophorans. Moreover, the evolutionary grouping of nematoids and panarthropods (a clade that includes arthropods, tardigrades, and onychophorans) suggests their common ancestor also likely had a single nerve cord.\n\n\"This leads us to propose that the common ancestor of all ecdysozoans possessed a single ventral nerve cord,\" said Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n. \"The paired nerve cords observed in arthropods, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs likely evolved independently, representing derived traits.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Loriciferans, kinorhynchs, and panarthropods exhibit varying degrees of body segmentation, suggesting that these structural changes may have co-evolved with nervous system modifications.\n\nDr. Mar\u00eda Herranz noted, \"The emergence of paired nerve cords likely facilitated greater coordination of movement, particularly in segmented animals. During the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, changes in the nervous and muscular systems were likely tied to the development of appendages, enabling more complex locomotion.\"\n\nThis discovery enriches our understanding of ecdysozoan evolution and underscores the role of the fossil record in addressing key questions about early animal development.\n\nBy linking nervous system structures to broader evolutionary trends, the study provides a clearer picture of how the diverse ecdysozoan lineages arose and adapted to their environments.\n\nMore information: Deng Wang, Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord, Science Advances (2025).

            "article_content": "The renowned physicist Richard Feynman is reputed to have once said that \u201cphysics is to math what sex is to masturbation\u201d. Exactly what comparison he was making, he didn\u2019t clarify \u2013 but if the orgasm gap is anything to go by, he presumably meant that math is often more fun, more effective, and better at getting the desired result in the face of adverse real-world conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor example: physics traditionally tells us that all particles can be classified into one of two types, either bosons or fermions, depending on their properties and behavior. But math says that\u2019s not the whole story \u2013 at least, according to a new study.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe determined that new types of particles we never knew of before are possible,\u201d said Kaden Hazzard, associate professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University and co-author of the new paper, in a statement on the findings.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not the first time the existence of such \u201cparastatistical particles\u201d, or \u201cparaparticles\u201d as they\u2019re known for short, has been suggested. Indeed, \u201cparastatistics, and their apparent absence in nature, has been discussed since the dawn of quantum mechanics,\u201d notes the paper.\n\n\u201cThe first concrete theory of parastatistics was proposed and investigated by Green in 1953,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThis theory was subsequently studied in detail and also more generally and rigorously within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, though, the idea turned out to be something of a lame duck. It wasn\u2019t that the paraparticles didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t exist \u2013 that was fine \u2013 rather, the problem was that it didn\u2019t matter whether they did or not.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThese works did not rule out the existence of paraparticles in nature,\u201d explains the paper, \u201cbut led to the conclusion that, under certain assumptions, any theory of paraparticles [\u2026] is physically indistinguishable from theories of ordinary fermions and bosons. This seemingly obviated the need to consider paraparticle theories, as they give exactly the same physical predictions as theories of ordinary particles.\u201d\n\nSo much for the paraparticles idea \u2013 or so it seemed. But when Hazzard and then-grad student Zhiyuan Wang considered the problem through a mathematical lens, they not only found that nontrivial paraparticles could exist, but they also figured out where they might turn up in nature \u2013 such as within magnetic flux.\n\n\u201cParticles aren\u2019t just these fundamental things,\u201d said Hazzard. \u201cThey\u2019re also important in describing materials.\u201d\n\nAs you might expect, these paraparticles would be weird \u2013 even considering the general oddness of quantum physics. \u201cTheir exchange statistics can be physically observed and are notably distinct from fermions and bosons,\u201d notes the paper.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLike the equally baffling new quasiparticles, the discovery of which was also announced this week, the result \u201cdemonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems,\u201d the authors write, \u201cand \u2013 more speculatively \u2013 the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particle.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s only a first step. Where this theory leads, or even possible routes to get there, are still to be determined \u2013 as of yet, we don\u2019t even know the questions, let alone the answers.\n\n\u201cThis is cross-disciplinary research that involves several areas of theoretical physics and mathematics,\u201d said Wang, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany. But \u201cto realize paraparticles in experiments, we need more realistic theoretical proposals,\u201d he added.\n\nWherever the theory takes them, though, the journey should be worth watching.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where it will go,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cBut I know it will be exciting to find out.\u201d\n\nThe paper is published in the journal Nature."

As we strive to reimagine healthcare delivery, we must find ways to sustain, and not undercut, the tremendous momentum of American biomedical science.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthcare, as experienced in America today, is miserable for just about everyone. It\u2019s awful for patients who must navigate a fiendishly Byzantine system to receive even the most basic care, and to figure out whether costly treatments will be covered by insurance. It\u2019s awful for loved ones who are increasingly pressed into service to advocate for patients\u2014such as when they are left languishing for days in the hall outside emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed to become available.\n\nIt\u2019s awful as well for exasperated and overburdened health care professionals. Doctors like those I trained with face escalating administrative burdens, including constant negotiation with insurance companies; they\u2019re experiencing unprecedented professional dissatisfaction and career burnout. Competing, ever-expanding armies of administrators\u2014and more recently, AI tools\u2014from provider and insurer organizations engage in fierce daily battles over reimbursement. These relentless bureaucratic skirmishes sap time, money, and empathy from everyone involved.\n\nShare\n\nYET WE ARE ALSO LIVING THROUGH a time of remarkable progress in biomedical science, \u201ca Golden Age for medicine\u201d as columnist David Wallace-Wells has called it. Genetics and other tools have provided critical insights into new disease targets to attack. We have added an impressive array of approaches to our therapeutic armamentarium, including traditional small molecules, biologics, nucleic acid therapeutics, cell and gene therapies, and imaginative combinations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider the remarkable results: We have improved treatments for many cancers, and developed therapies that now afford most children born with cystic fibrosis a good chance to live a nearly-normal life. Hepatitis C infections, which can lead to liver failure as well as liver cancer, can now be cured. An injectable medicine, lenacapavir, was shown to protect recipients from HIV infection for six months with 100 percent efficacy\u2014an accomplishment recognized by Science magazine as the 2024 Breakthrough of the Year. And a powerful new class of medications, the GLP-1 receptor agonists (think Ozempic and Wegovy), has proved phenomenally effective in staunching appetite, helping patients reduce excess weight and meaningfully improve their health.\n\nSupport our independent political and cultural journalism by signing up for a free or paid Bulwark subscription.\n\nBetter measurement technologies, including wearable digital devices, enable researchers to understand both disease and treatments with unprecedented precision. Over coffee in Cambridge, Massachusetts, an enthusiastic physician-scientist recently explained to me how a lightweight headset produced by his startup enables clinicians to monitor brainwaves and assess sleep disorders, attracting the interest of multiple pharmaceutical companies.\n\nLife science is also poised to benefit from the revolution in artificial intelligence; two recipients of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry developed an AI-enabled tool, AlphaFold, to predict protein structures. AI will also play a critically important role in managing drug development\u2019s exploding complexity\u2014a happy consequence of biology\u2019s remarkable progress.\n\nAT THIS TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT in life science, it seems astonishing some would spend our time and treasure looking backwards and relitigating some of medicine\u2019s most impactful and well-established successes, like the vaccinations that eliminated smallpox and saved millions of children from the scourge of dreadful diseases like polio and other preventable conditions. This regressive thinking is at once distracting and terribly misguided.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, we should look forward, and support our nation\u2019s powerful life-science engine, including both the foundational, enabling science so often funded by the National Institutes of Health as well as our vibrant biotech ecosystem that translates promising early-stage science into rigorously validated medicines.\n\nAs we contemplate how to improve access to medicines\u2014a vitally important consideration\u2014let us remember that no one can access therapies that haven\u2019t yet been discovered. Effective treatments are still urgently required for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pancreatic cancer, brain tumors, and a vast array of rare, devastating conditions that collectively affect millions.\n\nIt is essential that we aggressively challenge our conspicuously dysfunctional model of healthcare delivery, since great biomedical science means very little if it doesn\u2019t translate to better care and improved health. But amid our zeal to fix what\u2019s so obviously broken, we must do our best to preserve, refine, and build upon what\u2019s already working.\n\nShare"
