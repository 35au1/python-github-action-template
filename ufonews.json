        "article_content": "Experts have theorized that UFOs appear to defy the laws of physics potentially thanks to an anti-gravity machine, and that as a result, humans look like we're moving in slow-motion.\n\nLuis Elizondo, the former Pentagon insider who's been blowing the lid off the government's UFO secrets, has made shocking claims in his book, 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs.'\n\nIn his bombshell memoir, he outlines a theory that gained steam during his time as part of the AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) group: UFOs harness anti-gravity to circumvent the laws of physics.\n\nAn anti-gravity device, forming what Elizondo's team calls a 'bubble' around a craft, would potentially make the object immune to Earth's gravitational forces - which might explain its incredible acceleration abilities.\n\nAnd without any gravity affecting the craft, there would also be no time dilation taking place, meaning that while time for everyone on Earth would be slowed down by the Earth's gravity, time for anything operating a craft would be considerably faster.\n\nThis would mean anything looking outside a craft would see the entirety of humanity moving at a fraction of their speed.\n\nLuis Elizondo, the former Pentagon insider who's been blowing the lid off the government's UFO secrets, has made shocking claims in his book, 'Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs'\n\nResearch by Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, and Harvard's Avi Loeb has shocked the scientific community when they concluded that recent UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) observations defy laws of physics\n\nPhysicist Erik Lentz from the University of G\u00f6ttingen has similarly proposed a mind-boggling theory that could explain how these otherworldly visitors traverse the vast distances of space.\n\nHis research suggests a way to create the above mentioned 'warp bubble' that could allow spacecraft to travel faster than light without breaking Einstein's cosmic speed limit, as reported by Physics World.\n\nBut the catch is that it would require energy equivalent to 'hundreds of times the mass of the planet Jupiter'\n\n'A warp bubble traveling faster than light cannot be created from inside the bubble, as the leading edge of the bubble would be beyond the reach of a spaceship sitting at its center,' he said.\n\n'The problem is that you need energy to deform space all the way to the very edge of the bubble, and the ship simply can't put it there.'\n\nErik Lentz suggests a 'warp bubble' could allow spacecraft to travel faster than light without breaking Einstein's cosmic speed limit\n\nMeanwhile, a groundbreaking paper by Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, and Harvard's Avi Loeb also sheds light - or bends it - on how UFO seem to create optical illusions.\n\nThe paper states that these mysterious objects should create 'a bright optical fireball, ionization shell and tail' due to friction with air or water, as reported by Popular Mechanics.\n\n'The friction of UAP with the surrounding air or water is expected to generate a bright optical fireball, ionization shell and tail \u2014 implying radio signatures,' it wrote.\n\nOn top of that, many of the observed UAPs show no signs of these telltale signatures.\n\nThis could mean that UFOs could be nothing more than 'sensor-induced optical illusions.'\n\n'The lack of all these signatures could imply inaccurate distance measurements (and hence derived velocity) for single site sensors without a range gate capability,' the authors wrote.\n\n'Typical UAP sightings are too far away to get a highly resolved image of the object and determination of the object's motion is limited by the lack of range data.'\n\nA groundbreaking paper by Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, and Harvard's Avi Loeb also sheds light - or bends it - on how UFO seem to create optical illusions\n\nWithout any gravity affecting the craft, there would also be no time dilation taking place, meaning that while time for everyone on Earth would be slowed down by the Earth's gravity, time for anything operating a craft would be considerably faster\n\nHowever, Elizondo points out in his book that the optical illusion could be generated by the 'bubble'.\n\nCiting the Doppler effect, the former intelligence officer said that light moving in and out of the medium would skew based on if the object was moving away from you or toward you.\n\nElizondo, risking his life, has alleged in his book that the US military has been running a top-secret program to retrieve and reverse-engineer alien craft for years.\n\nHe even has claimed they've recovered non-human specimens.\n\n'We're not alone,' Elizondo told NewsNation. 'We are not alone in this universe, and it is a simple fact. The U.S. government has been aware of that fact for decades now. I think if the American public knew just how deep this lie went, that we would have a very significant constitutional crisis on our hands.'\n\nElizondo, risking his life, has alleged that the US military has been running a top-secret program to retrieve and reverse-engineer alien craft for years\n\nHe even has claimed they've recovered non-human specimens\n\nHis book contains, among its many incredible revelations, details on a 2016 plan hatched by Elizondo and his military colleagues to catch a UFO in the ocean.\n\n'The United States has been involved in the recovery of objects,' Elizondo told the outlet. 'Vehicles of unknown origin that are neither from our country or any other foreign country that we're aware of.'\n\nBut it's not just conspiracy theories anymore.\n\nIn August, Elizondo told reporters that he can confirm one of two 'vehicles of unknown origin' were recovered from the now legendary Roswell UFO crash of 1947.\n\nMore shocking still, Elizondo said, 'We, as a nation have, been interested in not only the vehicles themselves but the occupants,' which he called 'biological specimens.'\n\nElizondo helped release three of the most famous UFO videos in history after leaving his role in the US Department of Defense in late 2017.\n\nElizondo first rose to national prominence in late 2017 in the pages of the New York Times \u2014 where he blew the whistle on the US military and intelligence community's pervasive mismanagement and excessive secrecy on the topic of UFOs.\n\nHis public resignation and opaque role within the Pentagon's UFO-hunting portfolio, known to its Senate backers as the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), brought fame and a lead role in a History channel docu-series.\n\nIn April 2020, the Pentagon officially released three videos that Elizondo had helped leak in 2017, each taken by US Navy fighter pilots who had reportedly witnessed 'unexplained aerial phenomena' (UAP) as UFOs are now more technically known.\n\nElizondo first rose to national prominence in 2017 in the pages of the New York Times, after he helped release three US Navy infrared UFO videos - including the GOFAST video (above)\n\nThe videos depict, as Elizondo told CNN, 'things that don't have any obvious flight surfaces, any obvious forms of propulsion [...] maneuvering in ways that include extreme maneuverability beyond, I would submit, the healthy G-forces of a human or anything biological.'\n\nDespite corroboration from his peers and the late Senate Majority leader who helped create AATIP, Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, the Department of Defense has maintained that Elizondo's military role had no official UFO-hunting duties.\n\nPentagon officials denied the existence of any 'credible evidence of extraterrestrial activity,' in a statement responding to NewsNation's forthcoming interview.\n\n'As we have stated previously, Luis Elizondo had no assigned responsibilities for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) while assigned to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security,' DoD spokesperson Sue Gough told NewsNation.\n\nCritics of Gough have pointed to a 2003 research paper on psychological warfare that she wrote for the US Army War College, implying the Pentagon spokesperson might be part of a coordinated campaign to undermine Elizondo's credibility.\n\nAnd, in May 2021, Elizondo filed a 64-page complaint to the DoD's Office of the Inspector General accusing high-ranking military officials of attempting to silence him by threatening his security clearances and obfuscating of his work with AATIP.\n\nElizondo said he endured 'malicious activities, coordinated disinformation, professional misconduct, whistleblower reprisal and explicit threats perpetrated by certain senior-level Pentagon officials.'\n\nAbove, veteran Australian TV news broadcaster and investigative reporter Ross Coulthart - who conducted the first televised interview with government UFO whistleblower David Grusch last year - conducted the new interview with Elizondo, which airs in full on Friday\n\nThese actions, he and his attorneys said, suggested 'a coordinated effort to obfuscate the truth from the American people, while impugning my reputation as a former intelligence officer at the Pentagon.'\n\nHis new memoir, 'Imminent,' sees the former Pentagon official opening up about much more incredible personal accounts \u2014 including the story of his own family's disturbing experience with 'green orbs' floating through their house.\n\nIn the book, Elizondo also details he and another AATIP member's plan to catch UFOs on the high seas.\n\nHe told Dailymail.com in August that their investigations pointed to these craft having an apparent interest in military operations, nuclear power, and were often seen around bodies of water.\n\nSo they coordinated with the Navy and other branches to create 'Project Interloper': an attempt to lure the mysterious craft and record them with high-tech equipment."

According to CTV News, the photo was released through a freedom of information request. Several redacted pages accompany the photo in question, though it is interesting to note how the photo was approved for release days after the incident but held back.\n\nThe incident was one of a few within days in February 2023. At least three objects were found and downed over Alaska, the Yukon, and Lake Huron. According to the New York Post, these three objects are \"small metallic [balloons] with a tethered payload,\" and were much smaller than the suspected Chinese spy balloon that traveled across the U.S. before being shot down over South Carolina on Feb. 4, 2023.\n\nCanada has unveiled the first-ever image of the UFO downed during a joint US-Canada mission in February 2023. The grainy photo shows a circular, white object shot by a US Air Force F-22 fighter jet.pic.twitter.com/re0pQB6QX7 \u2014 Breaking News (@TheNewsTrending) September 24, 2024\n\n\"Should the image be released, it would be via the [Canadian armed forces] social media accounts,\" an official wrote in the documents. \"Given the current public environment and statements related to the object being benign, releasing the image may create more questions/confusion, regardless of the text that will accompany the post.\"\n\nThe delay is implied to be the result of a pause due to \"pending U.S. engagement.\" At the time, President Joe Biden confirmed the three objects were downed but added that there weren't any \"suggestions they were related to China's spy balloon program, or that they were surveillance vehicles from any other country.\"\n\nThe debris from these objects was never recovered due to poor weather and the slim odds that anything could be recovered after being shot down. Some descriptions of the object in the documents indicate it had a distinctive shape.\n\n\"Visual \u2013 a cylindrical object,\" the email with the photo described. \"Top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20-foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended from it.\"\n\nThe photo seems to be taken from below the object, and some have pointed out that the photo resembles similar balloons photographed from below. That said, others are taking the photo as evidence of secret aircraft possibly from an otherworldly intelligence.\n\nIf anything, the object stands as evidence that there is a lot of stuff floating around in the sky that we have no clue about."

        "article_content": "As more and more companies scramble to jam artificial intelligence into literally everything, I find myself becoming increasingly desensitized to the prospect of using AI for really anything. I loathe the anti-creative powers of generative AI for text and image creation, and I\u2019m so over products carrying AI branding for no reason (I\u2019m looking at you, Samsung Family Hub AI Vision fridge).\n\nAs a serial gym goer, however, there\u2019s one area of my life where AI has proven indispensable for more than a year, and that\u2019s in powering my workouts. Last year, I was introduced to PUSH, an AI-powered workout app and gym tracker designed to help you build muscle as quickly as possible by taking a scientific approach to workout creation.\n\nGive or take a couple of injuries and some holidays, I\u2019ve used PUSH six days a week, every week, for over a year. I\u2019ve done hundreds of workouts, and in that time I\u2019ve learned more about exercise than all my previous years of experience attending the gym. It\u2019s definitely one of the best fitness apps I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nPUSH is a delight to use, it\u2019s got a great interface that\u2019s very easy to use, rest counters, custom workout plans, and more. Yet more valuable than the joy I\u2019ve had using the app, PUSH has taught me some invaluable lessons about building muscle in the gym I can\u2019t wait to share with you. Here\u2019s everything I\u2019ve learned.\n\nProgressive overload really matters\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIf you\u2019re new to the gym or building muscle, you might have heard the term \u2018progressive overload\u2019 bandied around. Even as a long-time gym goer, I was familiar with the concept, but until I started using PUSH, I\u2019d never really taken it seriously.\n\nPUSH is hyper-tuned to help you gradually increase the amount of weight you\u2019re lifting over time, a tried and tested vehicle for building muscle. I\u2019d spent years bench pressing maybe 70 or 80kgs (175lbs-ish), occasionally pushing the boat out to 85kgs if I was feeling sprightly.\n\nPUSH has helped me elevate my bench press to a consistent 100kgs for multiple sets of five in less than 12 months. Across the board, all of my movements and lifts have increased in power and weight because PUSH doesn\u2019t let you take your foot off the gas. As soon as you can achieve the desired number of reps at a certain weight, PUSH uses its AI algorithm to calculate your next increment. If you fail a set or can\u2019t see a certain weight through to completion, it\u2019ll automatically calculate a plateau-breaker exercise, usually an increased weight for fewer reps, to help you smash through your next barrier.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWith PUSH in my pocket, I\u2019m no longer guessing weights for workouts, or retreading ground. I\u2019m just making clear consistent progress week-in, week-out.\n\nIt\u2019s time to ditch the Bro Split\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nMost people tend to split their gym program up into body parts. Chest on Monday, back on Tuesday, then legs, shoulders, arms, etc\u2026 in gym circles, this is known as the \u201cBro Split\u201d. If it works for you then that\u2019s fine, but PUSH\u2019s tailor-made program uses AI and peer-reviewed scientific research to calculate a plan that lets you train your entire body in an optimal cycle.\n\n\n\nFor instance, on some days, I train back, legs, arms, and shoulders, all at once. It took some getting used to \u2013 doing lateral pulldowns right after squats isn\u2019t fun \u2013 but by carefully training muscles in a more target way, rather than just blasting chest on a Monday once a week and so on, I\u2019ve noticed a much more consistent and manageable progression in my strength and improved recovery. You can opt for a push, pull, leg split in the PUSH app if you so desire, but I\u2019ve put my faith in the AI algorithm and its unconventional muscle groupings, and I\u2019ll never go back.\n\nRest is important\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWhile the aforementioned muscle groupings help with longer-term fatigue over the weeks and months, PUSH also comes with a built-in rest timer for use between sets. I probably spent six years in the gym just guessing at how long I was taking between sets, choosing when to start my next exercise based purely on vibes and whether or not I\u2019d finished cruising Instagram.\n\nPUSH\u2019s regimented rest timer, which varies depending on the type of exercise you\u2019re doing, has shown me the importance of training to a precise period of rest. Too little time between sets, and your muscles won\u2019t have recovered, leaving you unable to push as much as you need. Too long, and you won\u2019t be fatiguing your muscles enough to make any progress.\n\nAgain, PUSH uses AI to determine what constitutes an ideal rest time but gives you the final say in how long you take, letting you tweak rest periods slightly based on how you\u2019re feeling. With set rest times between exercises, I\u2019ve massively improved the progress I make in the gym, all while reducing how long I actually spend in the gym.\n\nGrowth takes time\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWe live in a world of instant gratification, but PUSH has helped me understand that growing and building muscle takes time and commitment. Having an app show me my progress week-by-week has been vital in keeping me motivated, even when the results aren\u2019t physically obvious or immediate.\n\nSeeing consistent strength gains each time I return to the gym is a terrific motivator, and has helped me to take my eyes off trying to make big jumps in performance or expecting huge changes in my physique. What\u2019s more, knowing you\u2019re on a steady upward trajectory takes ego lifting and overexerting yourself out of the equation, with measured increases drastically reducing the chances of injury, and of course embarrassment.\n\nInvesting in a program is worth it\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nI pay \u00a315.99 ($21 / AU$23.49) a month for the privilege of using PUSH. That\u2019s a lot of money for a monthly subscription app, but for me the investment is priceless. I\u2019m convinced that with PUSH I\u2019m getting good value out of the app. It\u2019s well-built, gets regular updates, and most importantly has proven effective for me. However, there\u2019s also an extra kick of motivation in knowing that if I\u2019m paying \u00a316 a month for a workout app, I should probably use it to the full, instead of wasting my money.\n\nIt\u2019s the same tortured logic that says buying a pair of the best running shoes will help you get out an exercise, or that paying for a gym membership is more likely to get you out of the house each January. It might not work for everyone, but the financial commitment I\u2019ve made to this app keeps me coming back for more.\n\nAnd a whole lot more besides\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nPUSH has more to offer. It\u2019s got a great library of exercises that help me plan around a busy gym or lack of equipment. Its plethora of peer-reviewed source material is well presented and makes for an interesting read, and its daily insights tell me which muscles I\u2019m growing and which might be stalling, another fabulous motivator. It\u2019s not a perfect app and it won\u2019t work for everyone, but after 12 months in my pocket, it\u2019s become an indispensable training partner."

Sure, Nvidia and the clouds are cleaning up, but they\u2019re primarily selling to enterprises that are mostly kicking tires, not running mission-critical AI applications. Others, like the Financial Times, suggest that AI startups are cleaning up but, again, this could simply be a matter of reselling GPUs, as Chris Gaun points out.\n\nSo where is the money? I recently posited that the real money in AI will hit once its infrastructure is turned into applications. Perhaps I should have clarified further, though: The real money in sexy AI may be in the unsexiest of applications like\u2026call centers?\n\nMaking AI boring\n\n\u201cBoring\u201d is good when it comes to enterprise IT (no one wants drama from their Linux servers, for example), and it\u2019s also good for AI. When a longtime friend, Zack Urlocker, pinged a group of friends about a small AI startup he\u2019d joined called Crescendo, my interest was piqued.

        "article_content": "How you can search for ghosts with a medium at Winchendon Historical Society on Saturday\n\nRight in time for the spooky season of October, psychic and medium Brandie Wells will host two paranormal events next week where people can connect with the spirit world.\n\nThe events will be held at the Murdock-Whitney House and the Isaac Morse House in Winchendon on Saturday, Oct. 5, and the SK Pierce Victorian Mansion in Gardner on Wednesday, Oct. 2.\n\nWells has been investigating the paranormal for over a decade. She said she frequently conducts spirit galleries and paranormal investigations at SK Pierce Mansion, even before the 2022 renovations on the mansion were completed, and at the Murdock-Whitney House as well. Wells said she services and guides about 5,000 people every year.\n\n\"I just really enjoy bringing messages of hope to people and I'm very comfortable with it,\" she said. \"Although there are the spooks and scares of the paranormal, the reality is that the reason why spirits make themselves known at the mansion is because they loved the SK Pierce mansion.\"\n\nThe Wednesday night Spirit Gallery and Mansion Tour at SK Pierce Victorian Mansion is sold out but tickets for the The Haunts & History of The Winchendon Historical Society are still available.\n\nThe Murdock-Whitney house in Winchendon\n\nSearch for ghosts at Winchendon Historical Society\n\nWells said the event at Winchendon Historical Society differs from her SK Pierce Mansion event because instead of connecting and passing over messages to people's dead loved ones, people will get to use equipment to detect any life after death.\n\nTickets for the Saturday night event are $69 per person, and an additional $25 is required to participate in a spirit gallery earlier that day. The history and tour of the Murdock-Whitney House and the Isaac Morse House start at 6 p.m., while the spirit gallery starts at 4 p.m.\n\nGreen Mountain Paranormal Investigations, a supernatural investigation group based in Northern Vermont, will help lead the investigation in Winchendon. Wells said both she and the Green Mountain team will bring equipment that people can use to detect hot spots in both houses.\n\n\"I always create a sacred space for people to open themselves up to the idea and I find that it's a wonderful learning experience for people to understand how they connect to the spirit realm,\" she said. \"I prepare people on a spiritual level to be open to spirits if that's what they desire.\"\n\nSupport local historic organizations even if you don't believe\n\nWells said whether you believe it or not, coming to these events with an open mind is important because you never know what you will experience.\n\n\"It's not my job to prove anything to anyone,\" she said. \"I feel that everyone has their own interpretation and their own experiences, so whether someone comes in as a skeptic or a full believer, I am open to giving everyone an equal opportunity to connect with the supernatural realm.\"\n\nWells said honoring old buildings rich in history that exist within the community is one of the biggest reasons she loves hosting paranormal investigation and spirit gallery events at historic houses and organizations.\n\n\"It's fascinating that these buildings still exist and they're being preserved, loved, and cared for by their community,\" she said. \"These buildings and historical societies need our support financially, so whether it's a paranormal investigation or a baby shower, hosting and attending events is an important part of keeping them in our community.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Psychic coming to Winchendon, SK Pierce Mansion: How to get tickets"

        "article_content": "Many fish species are finding it harder to survive because of warmer ocean temperatures, overfishing, and increasing plastic pollution. In a troubling new study, French researchers found the number of fish species at risk of extinction is five times higher than previously thought.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nResearchers from the MARBEC Unit (the Marine Biodiversity, Exploitation, and Conservation Unit) in France predicted, based on their models, that nearly 13% of marine teleost fish species \u2014 which include salmon, tuna, catfish, and cod \u2014 are at risk of dying out, a fivefold increase from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's previous estimate of 2.5%.\n\n\"Our analysis of 13,195 marine fish species reveals that the extinction risk is significantly higher than the IUCN's initial estimates,\" Nicolas Loiseau, one of the study's lead researchers, said in a news release in the Public Library of Science, via Phys.org.\n\nWhile the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species tracks over 150,000 species to assess their extinction risk status and inform conservation policies (as the release reported), many species have slipped under the radar.\n\nAccording to the report summary, 38% of marine fish species (around 4,992 species) are deemed Data-Deficient, meaning there isn't enough information to determine their extinction risk.\n\nTo close this data gap, Loiseau, fellow lead researcher Nicolas Mouquet, and colleagues used the power of machine learning and AI to give the overlooked species a conservation status. Of the 4,992 species, 1,671 were categorized as Predicted Threatened, up from the prior estimate of 334.\n\nWhy is the increased extinction risk among fish concerning?\n\nAccording to The Nature Conservancy, over 3 billion people depend on healthy oceans for their primary food source and livelihood. Fisheries and ocean-based tourism provide jobs for many coastal communities, so protecting marine ecosystems is crucial for people to feed their families and earn a living.\n\nHealthy ecosystems need biodiversity to thrive and sustain the food chain. When part of the complex food web collapses, it has a ripple effect on other species.\n\nFor example, warming ocean temperatures already affect sardines' migratory patterns, leaving whales, dolphins, and other large marine creatures without a critical food source. Sardines are also an important food source for fish that humans eat, such as tuna and salmon, per The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nDo you think America has a plastic waste problem?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nWhat's being done to protect fish?\n\nThe latest research didn't detail the exact species at risk of extinction, but it did pinpoint hot spots of Predicted Threatened species.\n\nResearchers listed the South China Sea, the Philippine and Celebes Seas, and the Australian and North American west coasts as locations that would benefit from greater conservation efforts. They also recommended a higher conservation priority in the Pacific Islands and Southern Hemisphere's polar and subpolar regions.\n\nWith the help of advanced technologies such as AI, tracking the conservation status of fish could be much easier and cheaper than relying on direct evaluations \u2014 though the researchers noted the importance of both.\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables the reliable assessment of extinction risks for species that have not yet been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature,\" Loiseau said.\n\n\"We propose to incorporate recent advancements in forecasting species extinction risks into a new synthetic index called 'predicted IUCN status.' This index can serve as a valuable complement to the current 'measured IUCN status.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, we can help protect fish and the oceans by opting for plant-based meals more often and using green technologies such as solar panels and electric vehicles, which maximize clean energy and can help cool the planet.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

At 38 points on DraftKings, it is fairly low.\n\nBoth teams struggled on defense last week so perhaps that bodes well for each of these offenses.\n\nNo matter the outcome on Sunday, the winning team will still have a lot to prove and the losing team will have to take a hard look in the mirror."

It was a third down and cameras caught Watson in an animated conversation with right tackle Dawand Jones, who was supposed to block Wilson, after the play. After the game, Watson said the outburst was about \u201cjust trying to be great\u201d but the missed opportunity was the latest sign of how far from great the unit has been throughout the team\u2019s 1-3 start.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing enough,\u201d Watson said, via Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal. \u201cSo it starts with me. If I\u2019m going to be the quarterback of this offense, we\u2019ve all got to be all the way locked in, and right now we\u2019re not doing enough to get the W. So you can put it on me for sure.\u201d\n\nWatson finished the day 24-of-32 for 176 yards, a touchdown and an interception on a day that did nothing to change the impression that the Browns are on the right track offensively. Watson\u2019s right that those shortcomings will be put on his shoulders, but it\u2019s unclear if the Browns can do anything to fix it."

It also examines the industry\u2019s regulations and policies and potential future advancements.\n\nGlobal Medical Image Analysis Software Market is valued at approximately USD 3.03 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 7.8% over the forecast period 2023-2030.\n\nRead the Market Summary Here:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9846\n\nMedical image analysis software refers to any software application capable of processing and analyzing data derived from medical images. These images are typically generated through diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-rays, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and more. The software plays a pivotal role in supporting healthcare professionals by aiding in disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and ongoing condition monitoring. The market is witnessing significant growth due to surging demand for diagnostic imaging software across diverse medical specialties, including orthopedics, dental, neurology, urology, and oncology. Additionally, the rising adoption of ultrasound imaging systems, because of increasing diagnosis of chronic disorders, is expected to contribute to the increased demand for this software. Also, ongoing innovations in imaging technology, particularly advancements such as Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), as well as the increasing need for efficiency and effectiveness in medical infrastructure are projected to provide an additional growth prospect for the demand for medical image analysis software.\n\nMoreover, the increasing incidences of chronic diseases are fueling the market demand at a substantial rate. Chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders require frequent monitoring and imaging, leading to higher demand for image analysis tools. Healthcare providers\u2019 escalating need for precise and detailed diagnostic imaging is further fostering market expansion. According to World Health Organization (WHO) data published in April 2021, An estimated 41 million people die from chronic illnesses each year, or 71% of all deaths worldwide. Seventy-seven percent of deaths in low- and middle-income nations are caused by chronic diseases. About 17.9 million people each year die from chronic diseases, the majority of which are related to cardiovascular diseases, followed by cancers (9.3 million), respiratory diseases (4.1 million), and diabetes (1.5 million). Therefore, the high prevalence rate and mortality rate associated with chronic diseases increase the demand for early diagnosis, thus driving the market demand across the globe. Moreover, the rise in the inclination towards cloud-based image analysis solutions, as well as the growing investment in technological advancement presents various lucrative opportunities over the forecast years.
