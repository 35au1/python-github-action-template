Fourth St.\n\nThese vehicles, which include things such as a replica of the 1960s Batmobile, a Delorean with a flux capacitor and even an \"invisible\" Boatmobile from the animated series \"Spongebob Squarepants,\" showcase a look at the most odd, weird and quirky things someone might see driving down the street.\n\n'Oddities' in Salina: A fun exhibition to curate\n\nMatthew Miller-Wells, the director of education for The Garage who worked on getting vehicles this exhibition, said it has been one of the more fun things to curate.\n\n\"There's just some weird, obscure stuff here,\" Miller-Wells said.\n\nIt's not only the 1995 \"ChewBaru,\" a Subaru Boxer covered with dental tools, dentures, toothbrushes and more, that excites Miller-Wells, but the rare vehicles that have gone out of style.\n\n\"The (K-Car) '83 LeBaron that's over there excites me just as much as like the (floating) Amphicar, because you just don't see those anymore,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the words that have already been used to describe this show, like odd and weird, he said one word is going to stick with him as people visit.\n\n\"I think 'polarizing' could absolutely be one,\" he said. \"There are cars here that people will love to see and ones that people will be really confused and don't like.\n\n\"That's the fun of it, is that what is strange is subjective. Someone may think it makes no sense that a K-Car is in here, because they remember a time when they were everywhere.\"\n\nThe Garage, an automotive museum in downtown Salina, opened its latest exhibition this week: \"Oddities.\" The exhibition, which features such vehicles as the Batmobile, a UFO and an amphibious car, will be on display through the end of the year.\n\nWhen is 'Oddities' on display in Salina? How much is admission?\n\n\"Oddities\" is now open at The Garage for people to come and see.\n\nDaily general admission for the museum is $15, with discounts for seniors, students and military being $12.\n\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nMemberships are also available beginning at $45 a year, with unlimited admission to the museum and other benefits included.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Salina Journal: Salina automobile museum's newest exhibit includes the weird and odd"

        "article_content": "Disco Volante is a watch style. In Italian, it also means \u201cflying disc\u201d but neither Frisbee nor mid-argument dinner plates. It\u2019s simply a term for a UFO and harks back to the mid-20th century. With such a rich history of Italian people collecting watches, many terms and nicknames have an Italian origin, but is this design ethos a new and rising trend?\n\nJudging from the response to the seemingly lugless Furlan Marri Disco Volante in its three versions, we will see more, and I, for one, will rejoice. Like the odd Cartier Pebble with its massive resurgence, round or roundish watches with short or no lugs are comfortable daily wearers. They also offer a much-needed alternative to the plethora of diver\u2019s watches that abound and are sleek options if small rectangles do not convince you. Let\u2019s look at the Furlan Marri, a smooth alternative to it, as well as some strong pre-owned options.\n\nA different take on vintage, now with a bracelet\n\nI already covered the Furlan Marri inspiration for this story, now known as the Disco. Read my article on it here, and it will serve as an intro to a style that has gone fairly viral in #watchfam circles. Even if my forearm has a tattoo that reads \u201ccontrarian,\u201d I do get the hype because we need new retro styles to covet.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen \u201960s diver\u2019s watches and know the time-traveling style they bring. I get it, but I enjoy dressing smart and have never quite caught the rectangular-Cartier bug, so I hope this is a new trend. In its three versions (Verde, Havana, and Celeste), the Furlan Marri Disco has been improved with the addition of a chic mesh bracelet that only heightened my desire. Better still, the price has remained the same at CHF 2,500\n\nVintage UFO grails from AP\n\nThe Furlan Marri Disco has a soft, circular case that takes inspiration from the most well-known flying saucers. Audemars Piguet might be known mostly for the Royal Oak and its Offshore brethren today, but when it comes to vintage dress watches, the brand excels. Most Disco Volante-style watches come with spare, minimalist dials like the Tiffany-signed one above sold by Amsterdam Vintage Watch Co. It has a Genta-revised design from the \u201970s that AP made for many years. In fact, the one above is from the early 2000s. The elaborate oversized bezel with its concentric rings gives it a big presence, only underlined by the big added value of a Tiffany signature.\n\nThe AP Disco Volantes come in many references with wildly varying price points. But I should underline one important fact here. Though I mentioned that G\u00e9rald Genta revised the design, in fact, a German designer should get the credit for its creation. Gebhard Duve originally sketched the \u201cDiscovolante\u201d 5093 models in the 1950s, as Audemars Piguet writes on its excellent AP Chronicles. The lovely 5093 above is my favorite, recently sold by Tempus Orologi in Italy for an unknown sum. It boasts a patinated cream dial and an architectural hobnail bezel in 18K white gold. Do a quick search on Chrono24, and you\u2019ll find an exceedingly wide spread of prices, starting with this lovely manual-wind 1960s model at just less than \u20ac4,000 up to more than \u20ac30K.\n\nSports watches, JLCs, Omegas, and more\n\nYou will find a lot more if you do a general Disco Volante search. And you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on vintage UFO gems for less than \u20ac1,000. The trend took off (get it?) around 50 years ago, and the choices are vast. With this search on Chrono24, you\u2019ll find quirky alternatives, such as this Longines Admiral powered by the caliber 431. It rocks a big (for a Disco Volante) 42mm case with a broad, radially brushed bezel. It\u2019s very unusual and shows that some brands appropriated the style into a sportier context, which only adds spice.\n\nOmega also had a UFO affair with the De Ville dress line. And within my search, they routinely appear for less than \u20ac1,000, offering big value. Of other brands, you will even find some Jaeger-LeCoultre variants and a delightful brace of Vacheron Constantin references. They are usually of the mid-\u201950s variety with a strong hobnail bezel design and a 35mm yellow gold case. However, the important question that needs to be asked is whether the Furlan Marri is the first of many new Disco Volantes to come. I say yes, and another lugless watch offers proof.\n\nA triangular Disco Volante?\n\nLike the rest of the team, I have only just decompressed from three days of horological wonder at Geneva Watch Days. And between running way too fast for 28\u00b0 Celsius to catch a meeting, I met with Matteo Violet-Vianello. He\u2019s the charming designer behind the brand Anoma. Brad Homes covered the Anoma A1 for us back in May, and after getting it on my wrist, I was smitten. The first model may have sold out and gone viral for good reason, but is it a Disco?\n\nI would say \u201cyes\u201d as I\u2019m sure there are triangular-shaped UFOs in the underground bunkers of Area 51. The Anoma has all the qualities except a circular case. It has a minimal design with a dressy touch sans lugs and is remarkably smooth with pebble-soft charm. The first run is sold out, but stay tuned to Anoma for more. I believe \u00a31,300 is a fair price to enter the realm of flying objects.\n\nDo wrist-worn flying objects tempt you, Fratelli? I\u2019m certainly feeling them, and I will also add an image of the epitome of the term. No, it\u2019s is not a watch but, rather, the amazing Bertona Alfa Romeo Disco Volante from 1952. Feel free to comment on the watches and the trend (and even the car) in the comments."

        "article_content": "We recently published a list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Science Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC) stands against the other not-tech AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been desperately searching for a safer way to play the AI boom that has swept the US stock market over the past few months. Prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs recently released an investor note detailing which sectors of the economy would benefit from the AI craze, replacing obvious bull cases in the technology domain by thoughtful insights on the long-term impact of AI on utilities, industrials, retail, and healthcare. According to analysts at Goldman, AI tools looked set to help companies outside of the technology sector improve productivity and reduce labor costs. The investment titan detailed the insatiable appetite for AI, evidenced by NVIDIA becoming one of the valuable firms in the world over the past year, and noted that the market was yet to reward companies that have downstream AI exposure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nDavid Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in the investor note that the AI boom was likely to play out in four key phases. The first phase, per the analyst, had been focused on NVIDIA, the chipmaker that is at the forefront of AI data center build. Kostin detailed that the second phase was likely to be about companies building AI infrastructure. Some examples of this include semiconductor, data center, networking, cloud, and security industries, as well as utilities. So far this year, the returns of stocks working in these industries have dwarfed the returns of the benchmark indexes. The third phase, continued the analyst, would be about companies able to put AI in their products and boost sales in the process. Kostin cautioned that these firms had lost ground against AI stocks in recent months.\n\nThe analyst claimed that firms falling in the fourth phase of the AI boom, ones who would enjoy productivity gains after adopting AI, had been ignored by the majority of the market so far. Kostin maintained that it was unclear when these downstream AI stocks, some of which are discussed in detail below, would rally and expand their earnings multiples, but stressed that this would happen eventually. The industrial sector highlights the Goldman theory in action. Since the start of 2023, industrial stocks have jumped close to 30% in value. Of these, the firms that are directly exposed to AI verticals have more than doubled in value. In the fourth quarter of 2023, over 30% of industrial firms mentioned AI in their earnings reports, up from just 10% in the same period the preceding year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected non-tech AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA DOD assistant presenting a portfolio of products and solutions from the company, highlighting its expertise in the IT sector.\n\nScience Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\n\nScience Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC) provides technical, engineering, and enterprise information technology (IT) services primarily in the United States. The company recently posted earnings for the second quarter of 2024, reporting earnings per share of $2.05, beating market expectations by $0.20. The revenue over the period was $1.8 billion, up more than 2% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating analyst expectations by $30 million. The IT firm increased adjusted diluted EPS fiscal year 2025 guidance to $8.10 \u2013 $8.30, and reaffirmed all other financial guidance for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nScience Applications International Corporation (NASDAQ:SAIC) regularly does business with the US Army, specially in the IT domain. Recent news coming out from defense circles indicates that the US Army is planning to ask contractors to assist with the integration of artificial intelligence technology into its operations. As one of the biggest business partners of the US army, SAIC is in pole position to take advantage of such AI-related business contracts.\n\nOverall SAIC ranks 33rd on our list of not-tech AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of SAIC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SAIC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Here are the key moments of what's happened so far\n\n16th May: Giovanni Pernice sensationally quits Strictly Come Dancing after nine years on the show.\n\n17th May: Giovanni becomes the centre of an official investigation after three former partners \u2013 believed to be Amanda Abbington, Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh \u2013 make complaints to the BBC.\n\n16th June: Giovanni releases an official statement vowing to clear his name and denies any wrongdoing.\n\n8th July: Strictly confirms Aljaz Skorjanec will return to the series, replacing Giovanni, after initially quitting the show two years ago.\n\n10th July: Amanda Abbington launches fresh legal proceedings to get the rehearsal footage from her time with Giovanni, after allegedly he refused to release the videos.\n\n13th July: Graziano Di Prima is axed from Strictly for \"gross misconduct\" after footage of his treatment of Zara McDermott is brought to the attention of the BBC.\n\nGraziano quickly broke his silence, apologising for his behaviour in a statement and saying he \"deeply regrets it\", adding his \"intense passion and determination to win might have affected his training regime.\"\n\n15th July: Strictly bosses implement new duty of care protocols, including having a chaperone present throughout all rehearsals.\n\n16th July: Zara McDermott speaks out publicly for first time. She states while the production team were \"amazing to work with\", she found the rehearsal room \"completely different\", confirming there's footage of \"certain situations\".\n\n19th July: Anton Du Beke is put under the spotlight for his \"1970s attitude\" and treatment of female celeb stars, particularly after allegedly referring to 2009 partner Laila Rouass as a \"p***\" after getting a spray tan.\n\n21st July: Paralympian Will Bayley, who has limb condition arthrogryposis, revealed he was encouraged to leap from a table during a dance routine, despite fears. The stunt caused an injury that forced him to withdraw from the show.\n\n22nd July: MasterChef's Gregg Wallace admits he broke down in tears and got a nasty stress rash on his face during his time on Strictly in 2014.\n\n22nd July: Despite ongoing issues, the Strictly professional cast begin rehearsals for this year's series.\n\n23rd July: Celebrity agent Melanie Blake claims she was sexually assaulted by an unnamed pro dancer while backstage on the show, and claims she witnessed ageism, rudeness and a rough treatment to the point of injury.\n\n23rd July: Strictly is forced to beef up security after 'an intruder scales the wall of the rehearsal studio'.\n\n23rd July: BBC boss Tim Davie breaks his silence on the ongoing allegations against Strictly, saying he is 'deeply sorry', adding: \"Hundreds of people, be they pros, contestants or crew have been part of it and had a brilliant experience.\n\n\"At the same time if someone thinks there was something wrong or they want to talk about their experience then of course we want them to raise that with us. Be in no doubt we will take it seriously, listen and deal with it as appropriate.\"\n\n24th July: Strictly 2023 star Krishnan Guru-Murthy holds a bombshell interview with Amanda Abbington on Channel 4 news, where she claims she was bullied, with some of the 'humilation being of a sexual nature'.\n\n27th July: Laura Whitmore releases a statement regarding her Strictly experience, saying \"I thought my experience was specific to me but I\u2019ve since learned I was wrong\".\n\nShe adds she is not part of the official complaint, but has come forward to support Amanda with the BBC, alongside others.\n\n28th July: Laila Rouass speaks out against the accusations regarding Anton Du Beke, saying she \"never felt pressured\" by him and \"personally insisted on six to seven hours training a day\".\n\n10th August: Graziano breaks his silence on his Strictly axe, saying \"these vile, false allegations have ruined my life.\"\n\nHe also told of the \"shocking\" end to his friendship with Zara McDermott.\n\nWe also revealed that Amanda Abbington was also quizzed for a second time as Strictly execs recruited 15 new staff to monitor rehearsals.\n\n11th August: Just as the investigation was expected to conclude, Amanda made a dramatic intervention. Giovanni was on the brink of being cleared until Amanda handed in more text messages.\n\n24th August: Graziano Di Prima called in top lawyers to sue the BBC and to try to clear his name. He recruited big hitters Whitestone Chambers to fight his corner.\n\nA source said: \"They\u2019ve also looked at his BBC contract and believe there are grounds to sue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC also delayed releasing the findings of the probe into Giovanni Pernice. The Sun revealed that the results of the three-month investigation were unlikely to be announced in August."

        "article_content": "Nobel laureate Andre Konstantin Geim called on the next generation of scientists to resist the pull of routine and go beyond the confines of their job descriptions in order to make meaningful contributions to their fields.\n\n\u201cToo many brilliant minds have wasted their lives trapped in the comfort of routine. It is when we step outside our comfort zones and explore new ideas that we often find ourselves doing the most important things in our lives and careers,\u201d said Geim, Regius Professor and Royal Society Research Professor, University of Manchester, UK.\n\nProf Geim was in Chennai on Saturday, addressing the 15th Convocation of Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science (HITS).\n\nGeim highlighted the challenges and rewards of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. He urged the graduates to embrace both the challenges and opportunities ahead and to push beyond conventional limits in their pursuit of discovery.\n\nHe pointed out that his most impactful work emerged from simple, curiosity-driven projects he pursued outside of his official duties. \u201cA mere act of pouring water into an electromagnet led to the world\u2019s first demonstration of magnetic levitation. Similarly, an attempt to mimic how geckos climb walls resulted in the creation of a revolutionary dry adhesive, now a major research topic,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Geim, a Dutch-British physicist of Russian descent, is renowned for his pioneering work in condensed matter physics and material science. His most notable achievement is the discovery of graphene, which earned him the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside Konstantin Novoselov.\n\nNote on his discovery of graphene\n\nDelving into the details of his Nobel Prize-winning discovery of graphene, Geim highlighted how curiosity served as the driving force behind the breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019m not even a biologist! The experiment that earned me the Nobel Prize began with a simple question: What if we keep dividing graphite into smaller and smaller pieces until it can\u2019t be divided any further? This curiosity led to the discovery of graphene, the thinnest material in existence. It is through these moments of curiosity and daring to think beyond routine that we make our most significant breakthroughs, often the turning points of our careers,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian aerospace scientist and Padma Bhushan awardee Nambi Narayanan shared the challenging journey of ISRO scientists in developing a liquid-fueled rocket engine. This technology now powers many of the country\u2019s successful space missions and marks a pivotal moment in the nation\u2019s space exploration efforts.\n\nP Veeramuthuvel, Project Director at ISRO, also addressed the convocation, discussing the challenges faced during the Chandrayaan-3 mission. He stressed the importance of learning from failures, highlighting resilience, teamwork, and rigorous testing as crucial elements in overcoming obstacles and achieving success.\n\nAnand Jacob Verghese, Chancellor of HITS and Chairman of the Hindustan Group of Institutions, called on the new graduates to harness their knowledge and skills to make a meaningful impact on society. He urged them to work towards creating a brighter future for themselves and future generations"

I have three kids with my ex, and my parents were always there for me. After leaving my ex and moving back in with them, my mom took over the parenting responsibilities, which I reluctantly accepted.\n\nNow I have a baby with my fianc\u00e9, and I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom, but I feel stuck. My mom is controlling, often making me feel guilty that I\u2019m not doing things right as a mother.\n\nI want to get a degree and improve my life, but I don\u2019t know where to start. I\u2019m over 30 and feel stuck by fear and anxiety. How can I take control of my life when I feel like I have no support or direction? -- Regaining Control\n\nDear Regaining Control: Rome was not built in a day. Your mom is used to being the one who was in control while you were sick. Now that you are healthy and recovered, there will be a bit of a transition period for both of you to get used to. Be grateful for all the help she provided to your children while you were sick, and keep open lines of communication. Explain to her how much better you are doing and that you would like to make your own decisions regarding your children.\n\nDon\u2019t be a victim and say that you have no control over your life. You have lots of control over your life and should celebrate your victories. You left an abusive relationship and got clean and sober -- two things that are very difficult to do. Your desire to get a degree is great. By no means is 30, or any age for that matter, too old to better your education. Go for it, and let your mom be a support in your life so long as she doesn\u2019t criticize.\n\nView prior \u2018Dear Annie\u2019 columns\n\n\u201cHow Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?\u201d is out now!

Key to this transformation has been advances in financial software development as companies innovate, improve operational efficiencies and create better customer experiences. In response to these trends, an article has been developed to take a deep dive into the major breakthroughs defining financial software development and unearthing more upon highlights on how developments in this niche affects global industries.\n\nThe Rise of Fintech Solutions\n\nWith a machine-like version of human oversight, the financial services industry has been transformed by disruptive fintech (financial technology). Fintech companies are using very advanced tech-enabled tools to change the way banking and financial services work, with innovative products that meet consumer needs today.\n\nMobile Banking and Payments\n\nConsumers and businesses of all sizes can benefit, as mobile banking & payment solutions have changed the way people interact with financial services. Users can manage and control their finances, make payments & transfers if they need be and access traditional banking services on their cellphones via these applications.\n\nLately we\u2019re seeing all our favorite payment apps such as Venmo, PayPal and Cash App explode in popularity. Similarly, traditional banks have also gone mobile with apps like Chase Mobile or Bank of America Mobile Banking.\n\nDigital Wallets\n\nDigital wallets are one more sort of fintech that has in a lot of ways changed the economic landscape. They are secure wallets that store payment details and allow you to pay for stuff without cash or using your pocket card with a simple tap.\n\nOther than the fact they work, Apple Pay and Google Wallet are pretty pedestrian \u2013 just another digital wallet to use side-by-side with traditional payment methods.\n\n1) AI and ML\n\nIn financial app development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are acting as a spine. Initiatives are using these technologies to improve everything from customer service in financial services and insurtech, through to risk management.\n\nCustomer-Centric Engagement. Financial institutions can now capitalize on AI and ML to provide customers with bespoke experiences, by utilizing an abundance of data reservoirs that the solution solutions analyze, in order to understand individual liking or dislike patterns. This customization makes for happier and returning customers.\n\nArtificial Intelligence-Powered Chatbots for Instant Customer Support and Product Recommendations Credit unions, along with traditional banks and fintech companies deploy chatbots powered by AI to provide instant customer support and query responses; leverage data analytics capabilities using the user\u2019s financial history or behavioral analysis laying down personalized product recommendations.\n\nFraud Detection and Risk Management. Vendors are employing AI and ML for better fraud prevention and risk management as well. Real-time transaction pattern analysis- These technologies monitor transactions as they occur and detect any anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities.\n\nBy using machine learning algorithms, credit card companies better recognize unusual purchasing behavior and high probability fraud which could help to prevent unwanted transactions protecting the general public.\n\n2) Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\n\nIn financial software development, both blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have paved the way for new trends. This will bring novel options in transaction execution, value storage and financial operation security/ transparency.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks. DeFi platforms allow for users to lend, borrow, trade and invest in a decentralized fashion.\n\nAs a result, platforms like Uniswap, Compound and Aave have gained popularity allowing users to perform financial activities without need for traditional middlemen. Using smart contracts for securing and executing transactions across various platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies and Digital Assets\n\nCryptocurrencies and digital assets are going more mainstream every year as they get increasingly adopted by financial institutions (now including PayPal), consumers, and even institutional investors. More recently, fintech development concentrates on building products with cryptocurrency support and secure storage to help things like crypto transactions.\n\nThere are many excellent places where you can buy and sell bitcoin, but Coinbase or Binance offer a fast way to get started compared to other options. Families of traditional financial institutions are also checking out the water in a splash, matured enough over blockchain technology space to innovate their workflow and onboard new products.\n\n3) Cloud computing\n\nCloud computing and API integration are the key trends driving modern software for financial services. They help financial institutions to streamline their operations, as well as secure and provide services with the latest technologies.\n\nFinancial companies can greatly benefit from cloud computing, since with the help of easily deployable and scalable hybrid, public or private cloud applications their business will be more competitive. Cloud-based solutions also mean easy to update and maintain, so that financial software solutions always remain secure and current.\n\nOne trend that we are witnessing is banks & financial institutions moving their core banking systems to the cloud and accessing services such as AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure for bolstering IT infrastructure of these enterprises.\n\n4) API Integration\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of accessible requests that all software systems can use to communicate and work together. Among other use cases in financial services, APIs facilitate the integration of different applications and enable access to external third-party solutions or features.\n\nThe API for open banking allows third party developers to create applications and services around the financial institution. This enables innovation and greater consumer choice, leading to more competition in financial products.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial software development landscape emerging rapidly, the financial development environment is being elastically conformed over several innovations in fintech, advancements of AI and ML technology blocks like blockchain tech notably also driving adoption side-by-side with cloud technologies empowering these API-first approaches. Technologies needed to realize these trends are changing the dynamics of financial services making room for new businesses and experiences. After all, financial institutions that side with these trends will be able to compete effectively and keep pace with evolving consumer expectations in the new digital era. With the industry continuously changing, businesses that stay agile with these trends will perform better on this fast-paced financial landscape."

        "article_content": "Last week, I was in Berlin with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold at the very start of my review period, and I wanted to write something about the camera ahead of it. I decided to do so by indulging in a photographic hobby of mine.\n\nWhen I travel, I like to take photos of cars, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was going to be my companion. It had better be up to the task, as other phones were waiting in the wings if it let me down.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCar-spotting in Berlin\n\nDespite the Pixel 9 Pro Fold having Pro in its name, it does not have the same camera as the Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 9. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5MP wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera for a 5x optical zoom. It\u2019s essentially the same as the Google Pixel Fold\u2019s camera setup, and on a technical level, it\u2019s not as impressive as the far less expensive (but much less foldy) Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nBut would it do what I wanted while in Berlin? I was in the city for the IFA 2024 technology trade show, and I stayed in close proximity to Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (or Ku\u2019damm for short), which is central, elegant, and packed with lovely places for coffee and food. It\u2019s also full of expensive designer stores, luxury watch brand boutiques, and all the cars accompanying those who shop there. Over the many years I\u2019ve stayed in this area, I\u2019ve always enjoyed some casual car-spotting, often to the chagrin of my colleagues.\n\nI\u2019m a car geek, so when I\u2019m in new places, I find it really enjoyable to spot cars I don\u2019t usually see at home. What makes Kurf\u00fcrstendamm enjoyable for me is the variety of cars you see cruising and parked up, ranging from supercars to modern classics in fantastic condition.\n\nA good car-spotting camera needs to take colorful, high-contrast, dynamic photos in all lighting conditions to highlight the metal. It really needs a telephoto camera, so you don\u2019t have to get right up close to the vehicle when taking a photo, keeping things more incognito. It also needs a robust editing suite and a big screen to make adjustments. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold should be a great choice, so how did it do?\n\nUsing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera\n\nOver the few days I was in Berlin, I took around 50 photos of different cars with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold \u2014 and I loved the results, regardless of whether I used the main, wide, 5x telephoto camera, or even the 2x non-optical zoom. I was consistently impressed with the speed of the camera, too, and although I didn\u2019t take many photos of cars on the move (more on that in a moment), I never missed a shot due to the camera or app being too slow.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I take photos of cars on the move? I had intended to try out Google\u2019s Action Pan mode, which adds a cool motion blur effect to moving objects, as I\u2019d enjoyed it on the Pixel 9 and Pixel 8. However, oddly, Action Pan is missing from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera app. Action Pan\u2019s sister mode, Long Exposure, is present though. There\u2019s no obvious technical reason why it\u2019s not included, and in this case, it was rather frustrating. Perhaps it\u2019ll turn up in a future software update.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes Maybach S680. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-AMG GT. Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz AMG G63. Wide-angle Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nWhat about the cars? It\u2019ll come as no surprise that two leading car brands dominate the Ku\u2019damm landscape: Mercedes Benz and Porsche. Porsches of all types are so prevalent that I stopped taking photos of 911s, as I\u2019d have spent most of my time capturing them if I hadn\u2019t done so.\n\nI didn\u2019t do the same with Mercedes as, despite seeing so many, the models were often highly unusual spots for me, as Ku\u2019dammers seem to love their high-performance Mercs. That said, on one day, the first five cars I considered photographing were all AMG GT models of various types, giving you an idea of how prevalent this particular car was in the area.\n\nThe cars and photos\n\nI didn\u2019t want to fixate on just supercars either, and I wanted to illustrate the variety of cars I saw, which I think speaks to the interesting car culture that I assume exists in Berlin and its surroundings. The convertible Mustang was a surprise, and although I didn\u2019t get photos as most were on the move when I saw them, the amount of Aston Martin and Jaguars, both new and old, illustrated that it wasn\u2019t solely about German cars either. Ferrari was notable in its absence, and the few I did see were easily outnumbered by Lamborghini and Bentley models. It was fantastic to see all these cars out and in use, particularly during the week.\n\nThe beautiful weather during my stay no doubt helped people bring out cars that may have otherwise been safely garaged, and it also helped out with my photos, as did the urban backdrop. I tried to incorporate Ku\u2019damm and its side streets into the photos, but there were times when a bit too much of it got in the way, and this is where the Pixel 9 Pro Fold became the ultimate companion for my car-spotting adventures on the move. For a start, opening the phone to view and then edit images on the large screen is amazing, and it simply can\u2019t be matched on a non-folding phone. Only editing on a laptop or tablet can compare, and I can carry neither in my pocket.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 6 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible.

Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz S Class. 2x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nOn the open screen I was able to make full use of Google Photos\u2019 Magic Editor mode, and wow, did it do some impressive things. My favorite is the wide-angle photo of the Mustang, which was interrupted by a street sign and some of the rental scooters that litter Berlin\u2019s streets when I took it.\n\nAmazingly, after a few careful swipes, Magic Editor took them all away without a trace. If I didn\u2019t point it out and show you the before image, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever realize. It also turned a photo I\u2019d have probably discarded into one I really like. I did the same with the background in the photo of the beautiful R129 SL, then removed the parked cars on either side of the white S Class, and was astonished by the clean, seamless result.\n\nNot a car-spotter?\n\nThis isn\u2019t our review of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or its camera, so all the photos you see here have been edited on the device using the tools found in Google Photos. Magic Editor has become incredibly adept at removing small distractions and re-creating backgrounds perfectly, and cleaning up the photos took just a few moments.\n\nBut I only wanted to edit the photos because they looked excellent to begin with, meaning I could tweak them to my taste rather than use the tools to try to reach an acceptable baseline. I\u2019ve managed to create a collection of photos I am really happy with that captures Berlin\u2019s obvious love of very powerful cars.\n\nWhen I came up with the idea of using car-spotting as the basis for my story on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold while in Berlin, it was with some trepidation. I take these photos for myself and fun, so I didn\u2019t want that to change. If the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a pain or didn\u2019t take the pictures I wanted, it would become an effort and effectively become work, with all the fun of car photography removed.\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen because the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a joy to hold and use. It\u2019s not annoyingly heavy, the software has been faultless, and I never wanted to reach for the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max I also had with me to take a photo. I enjoyed my occasional hobby of photographing cool cars I spot just as much, if not more than usual, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as my camera and Magic Editor at the ready.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a photo of a car and are wondering if all this is relevant to you, all the same principles and performance of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera and Google Photos apply to whatever you\u2019re photographing. I love the open screen when I want to see my photos after taking them, and the telephoto camera allows me to shoot my chosen subject in more visually exciting ways from a distance. The editing toolkit helped me easily create photos I wish had been possible in real life.\n\nRegardless of what you want to take photos of, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a great companion. My first few days with the phone and its camera have left me smitten, and it\u2019s looking like the start of a very positive review."
