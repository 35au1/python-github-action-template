Alas, I was sitting on my porch, enjoying my new pair of night vision binoculars, when I saw something moving in the dark. It was too fast for it to be a plane.\n\nI can see over 1,300 feet away with these bad boys, and, boy, I saw something alright. A flying saucer\u2014or a UAP as the kids call it these days. Better yet? My binoculars have a built-in camera and I started recording. Can you believe they were only $84.97 (reg. $169.99)?\n\nSeeing is believing, and you need these to see\n\nWanna know how I know that UFO was real? My footage didn\u2019t save. The binoculars work; I have dozens of 36MP photos and 4K videos of tweety birds from my backyard. But those aliens? They wiped my darn UAP pictures. Those suckers. This is all I\u2019ve got:\n\nAt least I got to see them in the flesh. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t wipe my memory (yet). The cool thing about these binoculars, compared to night vision goggles, is that I don\u2019t have to squint through uncomfortable eyepieces to get a glimpse at some aliens\u2014just look through the 4.5-inch LCD screen. I can also use it to play videos back.\n\nThe only slightly annoying thing is that they have to be charged, which is obvious since they\u2019re digital. But a 4,000mAh rechargeable battery lasts me quite a few nights of bird-watching and now UFO hunting. I\u2019ll be waiting for my visitors to return.\n\nGrab yourself a pair of these digital binoculars with night vision and recording capabilities for only $84.97 (reg. $169.99) and save 50 percent.

But this is an iconic piece of Scottish history which rightly deserves it place in a museum.\u201d\n\nMr Robinson said he has taken the trousers on exhibition tours and claimed to have turned down cash offers for them.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI\u2019ve been offered thousands of pounds by an American businessman but I have refused.\n\n\u201cI wanted to donate these trousers to the National Museums of Scotland. Sadly, they refused. I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d\n\nBob said officials had apologised via email and said they \u201calready had similar material\u201d.\n\nA National Museums Scotland spokesman last night said this was a mistake but explained: \u201cWe are offered objects as donations to the National Collection all the time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have space or capacity to accept them all.\u201d\n\n6 National Museums Scotland said they don't want the trousers\n\n6 Mr Robinson is determined to preserve them for future generations."

            "article_content": "UV Graphic Technologies saw strong growth in 2024, leading India\u2019s flexo printing market. In this interview, Abhay Datta, director, explores trends in flexo and digital printing, sustainability, and innovation, with an optimistic outlook for 2025.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a quick update on the state of the industry. How has your company (installation numbers) and your customers fared throughout 2024? What is your outlook for 2025?\n\n2024 has been a busy and exciting year for UV Graphics, with sales exceeding 40% of the previous year\u2019s figures. With several new launches, we now hold over 60% of the Indian market share for flexographic film and label printing machines, as well as ancillary equipment for finishing and embellishment.\n\nWhich has been your most popular press (most sold/ordered in the last 12 months), and why is it popular?\n\nOur most popular press is the Ultraflex UFO and UFO AI film and label printing presses, available in sizes ranging from 370 mm to 720 mm with multiple features. In this fiscal year, we expect to sell over 40 presses.\n\nAre volumes up? How do you see the overall demand for print?\n\nVolumes are increasing significantly due to the growing acceptance of flexographic printing in the flexible packaging segment. More converters are transitioning from rotogravure to mid-web flexographic printing due to shorter turnaround times, faster make-ready processes, and reduced waste.\n\nThe printing industry is witnessing a significant shift towards digital printing technologies. How is your company adapting to this trend, and what steps are being taken to ensure the continued relevance of offset printing?\n\nAt UV Graphics Technologies, we fully understand the importance of digital printing and have invested in bringing this technology to the Indian market. Our collaboration with global leader Domino has seen tremendous success at PrintPack 2023 and Label Expo 2024, where we demonstrated the latest digital printing technologies combined with digital embellishment and finishing. UV Graphics is also the only manufacturer in India capable of producing digital and hybrid combination presses that integrate almost every known printing process.\n\nAccording to one research report, the global offset printing press market is projected to reach approximately USD 2.94 billion by 2030, with a modest growth rate of 1.8%.\n\nOn the other hand, the digital print industry is projected to experience significant growth, with output expected to increase by 65% over the next decade, reaching $230 billion by 2029. Is the growth rate similar in the Indian market? Is that growth rate a good number, or is there scope for improvement?\n\nIndia is experiencing substantial growth in the digital segment, though not as rapidly as in the Western world. With an increasing number of digital press manufacturers, the technology is becoming more economical and accessible, which will further drive growth in this segment.\n\nAs demand grows for shorter print runs and personalisation, digital printing offers distinct advantages. How is your company innovating to meet these changing demands while maintaining the strengths of flexo technology?\n\nWe have consistently demonstrated that even short runs can be printed economically on flexo presses manufactured by us. Our flexo presses outperform digital presses in terms of setup time and waste reduction, even for short runs.\n\nSustainability is increasingly important across industries. How is your company integrating sustainable practices into manufacturing, and what steps are being taken to minimise the environmental impact of offset printing?\n\nOur company designs presses with the lowest power consumption in the market, utilising advanced electronics, LED UV curing systems, and zero-waste setups. The fastest make-ready times in the industry also contribute to sustainability.\n\nThe decline in traditional print media, such as newspapers and magazines, has impacted the industry. How has this shift impacted your business, and what strategies have you adopted to navigate these changes?\n\nThis shift does not significantly affect our business, as we primarily focus on label and flexible packaging.\n\nCollaboration and partnerships often drive innovation. Can you share any recent collaborations or initiatives your company has undertaken to enhance your product offerings or explore new markets?\n\nOur collaborations with leading international players like Domino, Kurz, Fujifilm, Siegwerk, Uflex, Creative Graphics, and HPE-Italy have helped modernise our equipment and showcase the latest capabilities of our presses.\n\nAdvancements in technology are transforming manufacturing processes. How is your company leveraging emerging technologies, such as automation and AI, to improve efficiency and product quality?\n\nWe were the first to launch AI technology at Label Expo India in November 2024, demonstrating significant advantages of the AI platform. UV Graphics has also integrated the latest automation technologies into our manufacturing facility, including robotic assembly of print units to enhance speed and consistency.\n\nCustomer expectations are evolving, particularly regarding faster turnaround times and higher-quality outputs. Nowadays, when one talks to third or fourth-generation CEOs, they know how to optimise the production cycle and improve plant efficiency. Most are certified for the latest ISO 9001, BRC, FSSC, PS9000, SEDEX, and others as per client demand. What are your views? Have you observed this trend? What has brought about this change? And how is your company responding to these demands, and what measures are in place to ensure customer satisfaction?\n\nUV Graphics has designed equipment with the fastest make-ready times in the flexographic printing industry, along with zero-waste setups. Our customers can process nearly 20 different jobs daily with minimal waste and rapid turnaround times.\n\nOffset packaging has presented a steep learning curve, especially in areas like tobacco and food packaging. Specialised printing techniques, such as tactile varnish finishes achieved through innovative ink applications, are increasingly being adopted. What are some of the latest advancements in flexo technology that are shaping the packaging segment? Additionally, what developments is your company spearheading that flexo printers should consider adopting to stay ahead?\n\nUV Graphics has already supplied several machines for food and tobacco packaging, featuring in-line hot/cold foil stamping, special effect coatings, and in-line rotogravure and silk screen printing combined with flexo.\n\nIn the last three years or so, we have seen a number of acquisitions and mergers. The recent one being Canpac\u2019s acquisition of Saptagiri. Are we going to see more acquisitions and mergers? What is your view?\n\nIndia is one of the largest grey economies, and many international companies are eager to invest and benefit from existing players in the market. We foresee significant investment and acquisition opportunities in the coming years.\n\nWe are also seeing leading paper packaging players diversify into new areas of packaging business. What are your views on big companies diversifying into new areas and expanding their portfolios?\n\nDiversification allows companies to explore new growth avenues and mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations. It is a strategic move that can enhance competitiveness and market reach.\n\nLooking to the future, what do you see as the key challenges and opportunities for the flexo/digital printing industry in the next five years? How is your company preparing to address these challenges and seize these opportunities?\n\nWe do not foresee major challenges but rather a market full of opportunities in the coming years. UV Graphics is fully prepared to meet the demands and expectations of both Indian and international converters."

The \"large language model\" (LLM) that powers the app has reasoning capabilities that are comparable to US models such as OpenAI's o1, but reportedly requires a fraction of the cost to train and run.\n\nAnalysis Dr Andrew Duncan is the director of science and innovation fundamental AI at the Alan Turing Institute in London, UK.\n\nDeepSeek claims to have achieved this by deploying several technical strategies that reduced both the amount of computation time required to train its model (called R1) and the amount of memory needed to store it. The reduction of these overheads resulted in a dramatic cutting of cost, says DeepSeek. R1's base model V3 reportedly required 2.788 million hours to train (running across many graphical processing units \u2013 GPUs \u2013 at the same time), at an estimated cost of under $6m (\u00a34.8m), compared to the more than $100m (\u00a380m) that OpenAI boss Sam Altman says was required to train GPT-4.\n\nDespite the hit taken to Nvidia's market value, the DeepSeek models were trained on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to one research paper released by the company. These chips are a modified version of the widely used H100 chip, built to comply with export rules to China. These were likely stockpiled before restrictions were further tightened by the Biden administration in October 2023, which effectively banned Nvidia from exporting the H800s to China. It is likely that, working within these constraints, DeepSeek has been forced to find innovative ways to make the most effective use of the resources it has at its disposal.\n\nReducing the computational cost of training and running models may also address concerns about the environmental impacts of AI. The data centres they run on have huge electricity and water demands, largely to keep the servers from overheating. While most technology companies do not disclose the carbon footprint involved in operating their models, a recent estimate puts ChatGPT's monthly carbon dioxide emissions at over 260 tonnes per month \u2013 that's the equivalent of 260 flights from London to New York. So, increasing the efficiency of AI models would be a positive direction for the industry from an environmental point of view.\n\nWatch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China\n\nOf course, whether DeepSeek's models do deliver real-world savings in energy remains to be seen, and it's also unclear if cheaper, more efficient AI could lead to more people using the model, and so an increase in overall energy consumption.\n\nIf nothing else, it could help to push sustainable AI up the agenda at the upcoming Paris AI Action Summit so that AI tools we use in the future are also kinder to the planet.\n\nWhat has surprised many people is how quickly DeepSeek appeared on the scene with such a competitive large language model \u2013 the company was only founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, who is now being hailed in China as something of an \"AI hero\".\n\nThe model is constructed from a group of much smaller models, each having expertise in specific domains\n\nThe latest DeepSeek model also stands out because its \"weights\" \u2013 the numerical parameters of the model obtained from the training process \u2013 have been openly released, along with a technical paper describing the model's development process. This enables other groups to run the model on their own equipment and adapt it to other tasks.\n\nThis relative openness also means that researchers around the world are now able to peer beneath the model's bonnet to find out what makes it tick, unlike OpenAI's o1 and o3 which are effectively black boxes. But there are still some details missing, such as the datasets and code used to train the models, so groups of researchers are now trying to piece these together.\n\nNot all of DeepSeek's cost-cutting techniques are new either \u2013 some have been used in other LLMs. In 2023, Mistral AI openly released its Mixtral 8x7B model which was on par with the advanced models of the time. Mixtral and the DeepSeek models both leverage the \"mixture of experts\" technique, where the model is constructed from a group of much smaller models, each having expertise in specific domains. Given a task, the mixture model assigns it to the most qualified \"expert\".\n\nDeepSeek has even revealed its unsuccessful attempts at improving LLM reasoning through other technical approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search, an approach long touted as a potential strategy to guide the reasoning process of an LLM. Researchers will be using this information to investigate how the model's already impressive problem-solving capabilities can be even further enhanced \u2013 improvements that are likely to end up in the next generation of AI models.\n\nGetty Images Modified versions of Nvidia's H100 GPUs were used by DeepSeek to train its LLM (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSo what does this all mean for the future of the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek is potentially demonstrating that you don't need vast resources to build sophisticated AI models. My guess is that we'll start to see highly capable AI models being developed with ever fewer resources, as companies figure out ways to make model training and operation more efficient.\n\nUp until now, the AI landscape has been dominated by \"Big Tech\" companies in the US \u2013 Donald Trump has called the rise of DeepSeek \"a wake-up call\" for the US tech industry. But this development may not necessarily be bad news for the likes of Nvidia in the long term: as the financial and time cost of developing AI products reduces, businesses and governments will be able to adopt this technology more easily. That will in turn drive demand for new products, and the chips that power them \u2013 and so the cycle continues.\n\nIt seems likely that smaller companies such as DeepSeek will have a growing role to play in creating AI tools that have the potential to make our lives easier. It would be a mistake to underestimate that.\n\n--\n\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek has made Indian companies rethink AI model development, shifting focus from just applications to potential foundational models.\n\nDeepSeek has earned recognition from major tech companies, and even US President Donald Trump described China\u2019s achievement as a \u201cpositive\u201d development and a wake-up call for the American AI industry.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing it has done is just change the belief that foundational models are only for large tech companies. DeepSeek has shattered that feeling,\u201d said Sandeep Dutta, Chief Practice Officer\u2013Asia-Pacific & Middle East region, Fractal.\n\nIn a related development, Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Thursday that the government has created a framework calling for proposals to develop the country\u2019s own foundational AI model. He also stated that at least six developers, startups, and teams would be building a foundational model within 4-10 months.\n\nLLM race\n\nExperts are debating whether India needs its own large language model (LLM), given that China has firmly entered the global AI race and is challenging the dominant US players.\n\nIndian startups like Sarvam and Krutrim are making significant strides in the development of LLMs tailored to the local market and diverse languages.\n\nAI startup Sarvam, which raised around $41 million in 2023, focuses on building language models that can understand and generate in multiple Indian languages.\n\nBhavish Aggarwal-led Krutrim is working on region-specific AI models that can enable businesses to interact with customers in their native language, integrating contextual and cultural understanding.\n\nTailored applications\n\n\u201cThe DeepSeek moment is a reminder that accepting the status quo is a wrong strategy,\u201d said Narendra Bhandari, General Partner, Seafund. He emphasised that AI should be seen as a solution rather than just software, and that India\u2019s investment in massive Nvidia GPU purchases is a necessary first step.\n\nBruce Keith, Co-Founder and CEO of InvestorAi, said that innovations like DeepSeek are shifting the focus from processing power to data and application-specific models. \u201cDeepSeek has proven that game-changing innovations don\u2019t need billion-dollar investments. This democratises AI and offers countries like India an opportunity to leap ahead without extensive infrastructure,\u201d Keith explained.\n\nDutta pointed out that India\u2019s strength lies in creating applications suited to local needs, such as in agriculture, healthcare, and finance. \u201cInstead of focusing on a single, large foundational model, India can develop smaller, domain-specific models tailored for key sectors,\u201d he said. This approach could make India a global leader in AI applications.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s strength is not necessarily in building foundational models but in creating applications. People don\u2019t buy models, they buy applications,\u201d said Jaspreet Bindra, managing director of Tech Whisperer.\n\nStartup ecosystem\n\nReferring to how DeepSeek\u2019s lower cost of building models offers startups in India a unique advantage, Anil Kumar, CTO of Exotel, said, \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical moment. The AI landscape is shifting, and models are becoming cheaper to build and run. Now, the value is in building real-world applications rather than just focusing on hardware.\u201d This shift is giving rise to a new wave of AI application-first startups, he added.\n\nOn the ahead , Bindra pointed to the lack of patient capital in India\u2019s venture capital ecosystem, which traditionally expects quick returns. \u201cAI models require long-term investments. In India, we need to rethink our funding strategies to foster innovation.\u201d\n\nHe noted that India would have to focus on research as well as foster an ecosystem for deeptech startups, including funding for the sector.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "Uncanny (4x60) is made by BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions, the award-winning department behind RTS Award winning Fight The Power, Grierson and Broadcast Award winning Inside Our Autistic Minds with Chris Packham, Freedom: 50 Years of Pride, and Lucy Worsley Investigates. It was commissioned by Jack Bootle, Head of Commissioning, Specialist Factual. The Executive Producer for BBC Studios is Alan Holland. Rhian Roberts is the Commissioning Editor for the Uncanny podcast.\n\nDanny Robins is the host and writer of hit BBC Sounds / Radio 4 podcast Uncanny. He\u2019s also the creator of BBC Sounds podcasts The Battersea Poltergeist and The Witch Farm, and the writer of the award-winning West End play 2:22 \u2013 A Ghost Story. Assisting Danny in his investigations are sceptic Dr Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Keeffe and parapsychologist Evelyn Hollow, who pick apart the details of each case to work out what might have happened. Danny also invites viewers to get in touch with their own explanations, and he provides case updates which explore viewers\u2019 theories on the stories.\n\nWere three generations of a farming family in rural Lancashire all terrorised by the presence of a small child? Did a group of charity shop workers all witness the same paranormal figure? Were a teenager and his friends preyed upon by a towering malign presence in the 90s? And was a young girl physically pushed down the stairs by a supernatural force in the early 2000s?\n\nDo ghosts exist? Are you Team Believer or Team Sceptic? Danny Robins investigates real-life stories of seemingly paranormal encounters. In the second season of the hit TV series, based on the successful BBC Sounds / BBC Radio 4 podcast, Uncanny is back on BBC Two and iPlayer. Featuring a brand new crop of terrifying real-life stories of potentially supernatural encounters told by the people they happened to - experiences that seem to defy logical explanation. Or do they? In each of the four episodes, Danny Robins investigates a different case and tries to help those involved understand what happened to them. Can their experiences be explained \u2013 or are they really evidence of something supernatural?\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Uncanny?\n\nThis series is bigger, bolder, scarier, and more intriguing than ever before. The cases we feature scare me, so they will definitely scare you! They are really unsettling with bizarre frightening moments that happen in the most ordinary, normal settings. It's truly chilling because if these experiences can happen to ordinary people like those we feature, then it can happen to anyone!\n\nThe first case takes place in a classic ghost story setting on a farm in the middle of nowhere, with a very normal, sensible and rational scientific guy, Liam, who is too frightened to go upstairs in his parents\u2019 home because of what he experienced there. We find out that his mum and his dad have also experienced really strange, frightening things in that same house and it's just so intriguing!\n\nWe have also got a case set in a shop with a bunch of colleagues who don\u2019t know each other very well but are all experiencing genuinely terrifying, potential poltergeist activity and apparitions. Another episode features Julian, who to this day is still frightened by what happened to him, and there's an uncertainty in his case about whether he is making contact with someone he lost or something malicious that is out to do him harm. Our final case features a very normal family who have very abnormal things happen in their home; it's a case that takes us into a level of threat that is almost higher than anything else we've experienced on Uncanny.\n\nUncanny is unique and different to traditional paranormal shows. I think it is probably the first time that sceptics and believers have come together and enjoyed these kinds of cases in their own way. If you're a sceptic it's a \u2018howdunit\u2019, and if you're a believer it's a \u2018whodunit\u2019. You can get together and enjoy the story on your own terms and talk to your friends about it; discussing that biggest of all questions: Do ghosts exist?\n\nWhat is new and different about this series?\n\nWe have a very different spread of people in this series; different ages, personality types and very different locations as well. We've got homes, we've got workplaces, we've got people who experience things in childhood, people who experience things as adults, families that experience it together and people who experience it with mates or colleagues, so it's a real spread! It really dispels the idea that there is a certain type of person that sees a ghost or a certain type of place where you're likely to see a ghost. These stories can happen to anybody!\n\nWe've got some brilliant experiments featuring in the series too, for example sending me into a wind tunnel at 90 miles an hour to test a theory about whether convection currents - drafts in houses - can cause poltergeist activity. I had things flying towards my head at 90 miles an hour so that was quite something! We also go to Hampton Court Palace and I go around testing whether electromagnetic frequencies could explain the hauntings there. We also have me in a graveyard, checking whether people might hallucinate spectres by a sudden coming together of fog and lights. So it\u2019s quite an unusual show from that point of view. I don't think there's anything else quite like Uncanny on television. You've got all the excitement and adrenaline-fuelled thrills and scares of the ghost story but you've also got the journalistic rigour and scientific integrity of stress testing the theories.\n\nWhat reaction did you get following the success of the last series?\n\nAfter last series I did a tour around the country and so many people came up to me and said, \"Thank you for talking about this subject\u201d and \u201cWhy haven't we talked about this subject more before?\" For a long time the topic of the paranormal was treated as slightly pantomime entertainment, but the idea of really properly looking at this subject and trying to work out if it's real, what is really going on, hasn\u2019t really been done before. A lot of people have felt compelled to come forward and tell their stories, they feel Uncanny has created a safe space to talk about this subject. People who have never told their friends, never even told their partner, feel it's okay to talk to us about this and put themselves out there. I love that aspect of it.\n\nThe Uncanny fan base has also grown so much and now encompasses everyone from seven-year-olds to people in their 90s. I know families that sit down and watch Uncanny together, and that\u2019s wonderful. The Uncanny community of people who go off and do their own research, do their digging between episodes and send us their questions and theories is such a huge part of the show.\n\nWhat volume of stories get sent to you and how do you decide which ones to choose?\n\nIt\u2019s got to the point where it\u2019s gone kind of bonkers and there are thousands of stories coming in! I feel deeply privileged to receive each one, as they are all an amazing slice of someone's life. I love that people trust me with their stories.\n\nIt is very instinctive as to which stories we decide to tell; if I read a story and it makes me scared, and if it sends a shiver down my spine. I still think of myself as a sceptic who wants to believe but the thing that pushes me closest to \u2018belief\u2019 is sitting opposite somebody and hearing the tremble in their voice, seeing that look in their eyes and realizing they're still scared. It's often those stories that begin with \u201cI don't believe in ghosts, but I think I might have seen a ghost\u201d. I love that complete discombobulating life-changing confusion that something that you do not believe in, that you fundamentally don't want to accept, may have happened to you.\n\nHas your stance on being a sceptic or a believer changed at all since the last series or are you still \u2018a sceptic that wants to believe\u2019?\n\nI think I am still \u2018a sceptic who wants to believe\u2019. I've been on a journey, if you listen to the early podcasts you hear a more sceptic me, but I've not yet had that experience that pushes me over the edge. I feel like I live vicariously through the people who tell me their stories. I'd love to see a ghost, but I also feel very scared by that idea, and I think be careful what you wish for. I don't know if I'm brave enough to go through what these people have gone through.\n\nI also think it's important to keep a foot in both camps. I think Uncanny would be very different if I was a fully signed up card-carrying believer. I enjoy being torn. I love hearing our sceptic expert Ciaran\u2019s explanations and I think many of them are very convincing, and I also love Evelyn pulling me in the direction of belief. I view them as a little angel and devil on my shoulder, pushing and pulling me in different directions and hopefully the audience feel like that as well.\n\nI think if there's one message that Uncanny puts out there, it's that it\u2019s okay to not be sure; you can change your mind, or you can keep an open mind. We're encouraged all the time these days, particularly on social media, to stick to one opinion and to hate anybody who doesn't agree with you, but it\u2019s great that we can agree to disagree in this programme. We've got people who are incredibly polarised in their opinions coming together and enjoying it in their own way, agreeing to disagree and maybe changing their mind, or maybe not. I just think that's such an important thing, the idea that you can listen without judgment, respect somebody for their experiences and take home from it what you want; view it in your own way and treat it as a detective story on your own terms.\n\nIs winter the perfect time of year for ghost stories?\n\nThe winter has always been a time associated with ghost stories. The idea of telling stories around a campfire and that little thrill of the shiver down your spine that you feel at this coldest time of year. I think we are going to be delivering some truly chilling stories at this most chilling time of year. I just think there's no better time to listen to a ghost story than when you are curled up in your house, it's dark outside, there's a little chill in the air and you start to imagine it could all feel more real. There's a little bit more darkness, there's a few more shadows in the corner of your house!\n\nInterview with Dr Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe, Team Sceptic"

But this is an iconic piece of Scottish history which rightly deserves it place in a museum.\u201d\n\nMr Robinson said he has taken the trousers on exhibition tours and claimed to have turned down cash offers for them.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI\u2019ve been offered thousands of pounds by an American businessman but I have refused.\n\n\u201cI wanted to donate these trousers to the National Museums of Scotland. Sadly, they refused. I\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d\n\nBob said officials had apologised via email and said they \u201calready had similar material\u201d.\n\nA National Museums Scotland spokesman last night said this was a mistake but explained: \u201cWe are offered objects as donations to the National Collection all the time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have space or capacity to accept them all.\u201d\n\n6 National Museums Scotland said they don't want the trousers\n\n6 Mr Robinson is determined to preserve them for future generations."

            "article_content": "Penguins aren't the paragons of everlasting love that we often paint them out to be. In a megacolony of Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor), researchers in Australia have calculated a 'divorce' rate that is much higher than in humans.\n\nWhile many penguin species are considered socially monogamous, the idea that they choose mates for life and never even bat an eyelash at another is a common misconception.\n\nIt's true that Little Penguins on Phillip Island in Australia often find the same breeding partner from one year to the next. Yet even still, experts think divorce rates among bonded pairs can sometimes reach up to 50 percent.\n\nOver the course of 12 breeding seasons, scientists at Monash University counted nearly 250 'divorces' among a cohort of nearly one thousand paired penguins. That's roughly 21 break-ups a year between 2000 and 2013.\n\nTo put that in perspective, annual human divorce rates in the United States are about 2.4 marriages per thousand, which is nearly 10 times lower than in this species of penguin.\n\nThe whole megacolony on Phillip Island includes more than 37,000 Little Penguins, but researchers say their sample size is a good indication of what's going on more broadly.\n\nA penguin divorce was counted by researchers when a tagged penguin from the prior year's breeding season reappeared in the colony with a new mate.\n\nSimilar to our own species, a penguin's choice to leave or stay in a pair bond was often based on offspring.\n\n\"In good times, they largely stick with their partners, although there's often a bit of hanky-panky happening on the side,\" explains ecophysiologist Richard Reina from Monash, who has studied the island colony for 20 years.\n\n\"However, after a poor reproductive season they may try to find a new partner for the next season to increase their breeding success.\"\n\nLittle Penguins, as it turns out, aren't very faithful, and they aren't the only species destroying human illusions of unconditional 'love' in nature.\n\nWhile it's true that during breeding season, most penguin species pair up with the same mate as the year before, those bonds don't always last for life.\n\nEmperor penguins and Ad\u00e9lie penguins, for instance, often partake in 'extracurricular activities' even when they are paired, which means they aren't really sexually monogamous.\n\nOne study from 1999 found only 15 percent of Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) stay with the same partner for consecutive breeding seasons. Other penguin species have higher rates of social monogamy, reaching nearly 90 percent.\n\nLoyalty, it would seem, is a fickle beast that can change from species to species, year to year, and habitat to habitat.\n\nLast year, Monash University marine scientist Andre Chiaradia told the ABC that because climate change had the Little Penguins on Phillip Island breeding earlier, there was more time for infidelity.\n\n\"They finish earlier and think, 'Oh, I can have a second go',\" he said.\n\n\"Behind the scenes, they can have four to five partners in one night.\"\n\nChiaradia is an author on the newest paper, which finds that divorce rates among Little Penguins is the single most consistent factor for predicting the colony's reproductive success.\n\nIf the divorce rate stays low, at a baseline of about 18 percent, the breeding season is more likely to be successful.\n\nBut while divorce might be a sign of hard times, it's not always a bad choice in and of itself. In some cases, separation becomes a necessary risk, especially after a failed breeding season.\n\n\"Little penguins and other seabirds that prolong their pair bond over multiple seasons experience increased reproductive success over time,\" explains the research team from Monash.\n\n\"However, divorce may also be an adaptive tactic to increase longer-term reproductive success, especially when the previous breeding success was low, a higher-quality mate becomes available or usurps a lower-quality individual, or environmental events prevent or delay re-pairing.\"\n\nIt's all about weighing the short-term risks against the long-term benefits. Researchers at Monash say their findings show how important it is to consider social dynamics when it comes to animal conservation.\n\nThe study has been published in Ecology and Evolution."

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

Screenshot: ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI has released a new AI model called o3-mini, now available for use in ChatGPT with a new 'Reason' button. DeepSeek's AI chatbot has a similar button, accessible through the 'DeepThink (R1)' feature.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, this model, first previewed in December 2024, is designed to be fast, cost-efficient, and highly skilled in STEM tasks like science, maths, and coding. It also aims to deliver better performance while keeping costs low and response times quick, says the company.\n\nAs per an official blog post by OpenAI, the o3-mini model comes with several features that make it useful for developers. It supports advanced tools like function calling, structured outputs, and developer messages, which can help developers integrate the model into their projects more easily. It also offers three levels of reasoning effort\u2014low, medium, and high\u2014so users can choose between faster responses or more detailed answers depending on their needs. Like previous models, the o3-mini supports streaming, allowing for real-time interactions.\n\nFor ChatGPT users, o3-mini is now available to Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers, with Enterprise access set to arrive in February, says OpenAI. Free users can also try the model by selecting the 'Reason' option in the message composer. On the developer side, o3-mini is being rolled out to select users in API tiers 3-5, with support for the Chat Completions API, Assistants API, and Batch API.\n\nIn terms of performance, OpenAI says that the o3-mini is faster and more accurate than its predecessor, the o1-mini. It delivers responses 24% quicker, with an average response time of 7.7 seconds, states an official post. OpenAI also says that expert external testers found that o3-mini produces clearer and more accurate answers, with 39% fewer major errors on difficult questions. The model apparently shines in STEM tasks, matching or even outperforming OpenAI's larger o1 model in areas like maths, coding, and science.\n\nOpenAI says they have also prioritised safety with o3-mini. The model uses a technique called deliberative alignment, where it reasons about safety guidelines before responding to user prompts. The company also says it has conducted thorough safety evaluations, similar to those used for its previous models, to ensure the model is safe and reliable.\n\nWith this release, o3-mini replaces o1-mini in the ChatGPT model picker, offering higher rate limits and lower latency. For example, ChatGPT Plus and Team users will see their daily message limit increase from 50 to 150. OpenAI is also working on integrating search capabilities across its reasoning models, with o3-mini already supporting early prototypes of web-based search, states the official blog.\n\nWhile o3-mini is optimised for STEM tasks, OpenAI's broader general knowledge model, o1, remains available for users who need more versatile capabilities, further adds OpenAI."

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOpenAI rushed to defend its market position Friday with the release of o3-mini, a direct response to Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 model that sent shockwaves through the AI industry by matching top-tier performance at a fraction of the computational cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re releasing OpenAI o3-mini, the newest, most cost-efficient model in our reasoning series, available in both ChatGPT and the API today\u201d OpenAI said in an official blog post. \"Previewed in December 2024\u2060, this powerful and fast model advances the boundaries of what small models can achieve (...) all while maintaining the low cost and reduced latency of OpenAI o1-mini.\u201d\n\nOpenAI also made reasoning capabilities available for free to users for the first time while tripling daily message limits for paying customers, from 50 to 150, to boost the usage of the new family of reasoning models.\n\nUnlike GPT-4o and the GPT family of models, the \u201co\u201d family of AI models is focused on reasoning tasks. They're less creative, but have embedded chain of thought reasoning that makes them more capable of solving complex problems, backtracking on wrong analyses, and building better structure code.\n\nAt the highest level, OpenAI has two main families of AI models: Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and \u201cOmni\u201d (o).\n\nGPT is like the family\u2019s artist: A right-brain type, it\u2019s good for role-playing, conversation, creative writing, summarizing, explanation, brainstorming, chatting, etc.\n\nO is the family\u2019s nerd. It sucks at telling stories, but is great at coding, solving math equations, analyzing complex problems, planning its reasoning process step-by-step, comparing research papers, etc.\n\nThe new o3 mini comes in three versions\u2014low, medium, or high. These subcategories will provide users with better answers in exchange for more \u201cinference\u201d (which is more expensive for developers who need to pay per token).\n\nOpenAI o3-mini, aimed at efficiency, is worse than OpenAI o1-mini in general knowledge and multilingual chain of thought, however, it scores better at other tasks like coding or factuality. All the other models (o3-mini medium and o3-mini high) do beat OpenAI o1-mini in every single benchmark.\n\nImage: OpenAI\n\nDeepSeek's breakthrough, which delivered better results than OpenAI's flagship model while using just a fraction of the computing power, triggered a massive tech selloff that wiped nearly $1 trillion from U.S. markets. Nvidia alone shed $600 billion in market value as investors questioned the future demand for its expensive AI chips.\n\nThe efficiency gap stemmed from DeepSeek's novel approach to model architecture.\n\nWhile American companies focused on throwing more computing power at AI development, DeepSeek's team found ways to streamline how models process information, making them more efficient. The competitive pressure intensified when Chinese tech giant Alibaba released Qwen2.5 Max, an even more capable model than the one DeepSeek used as its foundation, opening the path to what could be a new wave of Chinese AI innovation.\n\nOpenAI o3-mini attempts to increase that gap once again. The new model runs 24% faster than its predecessor, and matches or beats older models on key benchmarks while costing less to operate.\n\nIts pricing is also more competitive. OpenAI o3-mini's rates\u2014$0.55 per million input tokens and $4.40 per million output tokens\u2014are a lot higher than DeepSeek's R1 pricing of $0.14 and $2.19 for the same volumes, however, they decrease the gap between OpenAI and DeepSeek, and represent a major cut when compared to the prices charged to run OpenAI o1.\n\nImage: OpenAI\n\nAnd that might be key to its success. OpenAI o3-mini is closed-source, unlike DeepSeek R1 which is available for free\u2014but for those willing to pay for use on hosted servers, the appeal will increase depending on the intended use.\n\nOpenAI o3 mini-medium scores 79.6 on the AIME benchmark of math problems. DeepSeek R1 scores 79.8, a score that is only beaten by the most powerful model in the family, OpenAI mini-o3 high, which scores 87.3 points.\n\nThe same pattern can be seen in other benchmarks: The GPQA marks, which measure proficiency in different scientific disciplines, are 71.5 for DeepSeek R1, 70.6 for o3-mini low, and 79.7 for o3-mini high. R1 is at the 96.3rd percentile in Codeforces, a benchmark for coding tasks, whereas o3-mini low is at the 93rd percentile and o3-mini high is at the 97th percentile.\n\nSo the differences exist, but in terms of benchmarks, they may be negligible depending on the model chosen for executing a task.\n\nTesting OpenAI o3-mini against DeepSeek R1\n\nWe tried the model with a few tasks to see how it performed against DeepSeek R1.\n\nThe first task was a spy game to test how good it was at multi-step reasoning. We choose the same sample from the BIG-bench dataset on Github that we used to evaluate DeepSeek R1. (The full story is available here and involves a school trip to a remote, snowy location, where students and teachers face a series of strange disappearances; the model must find out who the stalker was.)\n\nOpenAI o3-mini didn\u2019t do well and reached the wrong conclusions in the story. According to the answer provided by the test, the stalker\u2019s name is Leo. DeepSeek R1 got it right, whereas OpenAI o3-mini got it wrong, saying the stalker\u2019s name was Eric. (Fun fact, we cannot share the link to the conversation because it was marked as unsafe by OpenAI).\n\nThe model is reasonably good at logical language-related tasks that don't involve math. For example, we asked the model to write five sentences that end in a specific word, and it was capable of understanding the task, evaluating results, before providing the final answer. It thought about its reply for four seconds, corrected one wrong answer, and provided a reply that was fully correct.\n\nIt is also very good at math, proving capable of solving problems that are deemed as extremely difficult in some benchmarks. The same complex problem that took DeepSeek R1 275 seconds to solve was completed by OpenAI o3-mini in just 33 seconds.\n\nSo a pretty good effort, OpenAI. Your move DeepSeek.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

            "article_content": "Minnesota's household wealth \u2014 mirroring national trends \u2014 has become more concentrated over the past six decades, a new database of household wealth.\n\nIn 1960, for instance, the bottom 50% of families owned about 10% of the state\u2019s total wealth, while the richest 1% had about 17%, according to data collected by Geowealth US.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut by 2010, the share of wealth owned by the bottom 50% fell by roughly half, while the wealth of the richest 1% more than doubled. Those shares changed little from 2010 to 2020.\n\nData by GEOWEALTH-US. Minnesota Reformer Graphic\n\nThe estimates in the database are based the federal Survey of Consumer Finances , which asks respondents about their assets and debts, as well as the Census\u2019 American Community Survey , which measures demographics, income and home ownership.\n\nBehind the numbers\n\nThe rise in wealth inequality is driven by many factors, including the loss of high-paying blue collar jobs; the growing concentration of white-collar jobs in coastal metropolitan areas and big advanced economies like the Twin Cities; and changes to the tax code favoring the already-wealthy.\n\nWealth inequality in the United States is greater than in most other democracies . Racial wealth disparities , driven in part by decades of discriminatory policymaking, are often staggering.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s racial disparities are among the worst in the nation , partly due to the state\u2019s long history of redlining , or denying mortgages and other financial services to non-white people. Those century-old policies reverberate in maps of neighborhood inequality made today.\n\nThe richest and poorest Minnesota communities are all concentrated in the Twin Cities metro.\n\nThe wealthiest communities in the Twin Cities are roughly 10 times richer than the poorest ones, according to the data.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis map by Geowealth US shows the approximate median household income across Minnesota. The map divided into Public Use Microdata Areas, which are census divisions containing at least 100,000 people. Researchers often analyze data at this geographic level in order to see variation within densely populated counties. Minnesota Reformer\n\nMedian households in parts of the west metro \u2014 including Lake Minnetonka, Plymouth and Maple Grove \u2014 have a net worth well over $400,000. Those in parts of south Minneapolis and the western part of St. Paul have closer to $40,000.\n\nIn the richest areas of the country, like Palo Alto or the New York City suburbs, the typical family is worth well over $1 million. In the poorest communities, which are in New York, Houston and Milwaukee, the typical family has only $18,000 in assets.\n\n\u201cPeople who grow up in wealthier places can reap benefits that span generations,\u201d Tom Kemeny, one of the database\u2019s compilers, explained in a recent commentary . \u201cAs a result of property taxes and philanthropy, wealthier communities have greater resources for schools, health care, transportation and other infrastructure.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was originally published on MinnesotaReformer.com."

            "article_content": "Tyler Shepherd\n\nContributor\n\nAs global supply chains grow increasingly complex, innovative solutions are becoming essential for resilience and efficiency. Jan Balatka, Managing Director of Semantic Visions, brings nearly two decades of experience in consulting and AI leadership to this challenge. His expertise shapes the company\u2019s efforts to use advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and data-driven tools to help businesses tackle these issues head-on.\n\nUnderstanding Today\u2019s Challenges\n\nModern supply chains are under pressure from increasing regulations, globalization, and rapid technological change. \u201cThese challenges are creating difficulties not just for manufacturers but for every layer of the supply chain,\u201d says Balatka. Drawing from his years working with global businesses, he understands the critical need for solutions that provide visibility and control across supply networks. Semantic Visions addresses this by offering AI-powered tools that monitor risks and identify opportunities, even within often-overlooked lower tiers of the supply chain.\n\nHow Technology is Driving Change\n\nSemantic Visions employs a range of technologies to transform supply chain management:\n\nAI and Automation: Advanced AI models analyze structured and unstructured data, providing faster and more accurate decision-making. Balatka\u2019s background in AI leadership ensures these models meet the diverse needs of supply chain operations.\n\nGlobal Monitoring: Their system tracks over 13 million companies worldwide, scanning information in 12 languages to detect potential disruptions like financial instability or delays at ports.\n\nSeamless Integration: Using low-code/no-code platforms, Semantic Visions helps businesses connect legacy systems to modern tools, reducing inefficiencies\u2014a challenge Balatka frequently encountered in his consulting career.\n\nRemoving Barriers to Transformation\n\nDespite the benefits of digital tools, many businesses face challenges like limited IT resources and fragmented systems. \u201cSupply chain teams often have to compete with other departments for IT support,\u201d Balatka notes. His experience in working with resource-constrained organizations informs Semantic Visions\u2019 approach: start small by focusing on areas with the most significant impact and gradually expand efforts. Outsourcing IT resources or using AI tools to bridge language and time zone gaps can also help.\n\nThe Future of Supply Chains\n\nBalatka predicts that automation and the use of both software and hardware robots will play a key role in addressing labor shortages and improving efficiency. For companies just starting their digital transformation journey, he advises focusing on critical pain points and adopting widely used platforms for smoother transitions.\n\nA Practical Lesson in Supply Chain Management\n\nBalatka\u2019s experience in consulting often revealed how small oversights could have significant impacts. In one case, a client\u2019s packaging strategy led to inefficiencies, with single pens being shipped in oversized boxes\u2014wasting resources and driving up costs. By combining open-source intelligence (OSINT) data with AI, Semantic Visions enables companies to uncover similar inefficiencies that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, their AI-driven tools can detect subtle supply chain disruptions, such as delays caused by specific suppliers or inefficient processes, by analyzing unstructured data from global sources. This ability to pinpoint overlooked details helps businesses refine their operations and avoid costly mistakes, ensuring greater efficiency throughout the supply chain.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSemantic Visions aims to expand its reach and provide greater visibility into multi-tiered supply chains. \u201cOur goal is to help businesses understand their supply chains beyond the first tier,\u201d Balatka explains. By integrating his deep industry knowledge into Semantic Visions\u2019 strategy, Balatka is positioning the company to lead the digital transformation of supply chains worldwide.\n\nAs digital transformation accelerates, leaders like Balatka with Semantic Visions are paving the way for a more resilient and efficient supply chain industry."

            "article_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nOne of the great anomalies of American politics is that Donald Trump, who has been elected to the presidency twice and came very close to victory a third time, has been pretty regularly unpopular since he first came down that New York escalator in 2015. The day he was elected in 2016, his personal net favorability ratio per FiveThirtyEight was minus 24 percent, lower than any major-party presidential nominee dating back at least to the 1970s. For a moment during his first term as president, he had a positive job-approval ratio, but it went south by February 3, 2017, and never recovered. On Election Day 2020, his job-approval numbers were 44.6 percent positive, 52.6 percent negative. And he left office after the January 6 Capitol Riot with a 38.6 percent/57.9 percent ratio.\n\nDuring his comeback effort, Trump\u2019s favorability ratio was never positive. His favorability number peaked at 44 percent on February 28, 2024, and luckily for him, it was still at 43.6 percent \u2014 not good, but not disastrous \u2014 on Election Day.\n\nAll of this makes the 47th president\u2019s current standing look pretty good. His current job-approval average is 49.1 percent positive and 43.9 percent negative, down very slightly from where he was on Inauguration Day. But individual polls can give you a different impression of where he stands. Gallup\u2019s January 2025 job-approval poll shows Trump at 47 percent positive, 48 percent negative, so unsurprisingly, its current take is that the glass is half-empty:\n\nAt 47%, President Donald Trump\u2019s initial job approval rating for his second term is similar to the inaugural 45% reading during his first term, again placing him below all other elected presidents dating back to 1953. Trump remains the only elected president with sub-50% initial approval ratings.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting as well that Trump\u2019s personal favorability, despite the inaugural \u201choneymoon\u201d he is supposedly experiencing, remains meh at best: he\u2019s at 46.4 favorable, 48.0 unfavorable, per FiveThirtyEight.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty clear that Trump is not as popular as Joe Biden was at this point in the 46th presidency: On January 31, 2021, Biden\u2019s job-approval average was 53.8 percent positive and 33.4 percent negative. His approval ratio eventually turned negative in September 2021 and remained underwater until he left office.\n\nAll this is relevant background for what we might expect now that Trump 2.0 is entering its first serious rough patch, with a significant public backlash against a poorly executed and almost immediately suspended federal funding freeze. Upcoming fights over congressional budget decisions (which could make the funding-freeze furor seem like a low-pressure dress rehearsal), the messy details of mass deportation, and Trump\u2019s own tendency to overreach could all drive his popularity down to where it has been for most of his public career. The question then remains: In his last term in office, does he really care?"

            "article_content": "Chris Gallagher\n\nContributor\n\nAny quality research churns out huge amounts of data. This data needs to be analyzed and depending on the amount of information waiting for processing, you may be in it for a while. But that won't be the case if you have excellent research software for data analysis. This software comes with plenty of benefits that make it a worthy partner in your research process.\n\nHere are the benefits you can gain when you pick the right system for your research.\n\nIncreased Efficiency and Timesaving\n\nSay you're working on a large dataset. Maybe it\u2019s survey responses from hundreds\u2014or even thousands\u2014of people. Now, analyzing that data manually could take days. You\u2019d need to sift through entries, remove duplicates, and standardize formats like dates and numbers. Tedious, isn\u2019t it?\n\nReputable research software like ATLAS.ti or any others you're well-versed with can significantly help here. These tools can streamline data management and improve analytical accuracy, which can accelerate the research process while ensuring comprehensive and insightful analysis.\n\nAlso, many of these tools come with AI-powered features, which can help improve productivity almost 5 times over. Instead of struggling with repetitive tasks, you can focus on more exciting things like analyzing trends, drawing conclusions, or preparing that killer presentation.\n\nImproved Accuracy and Reduced Errors\n\nEven with your most careful efforts, you can still enter a number incorrectly or miss a detail when calculating averages. And when you\u2019re working with a lot of data, those small errors can snowball into major problems. Research software helps eliminate this risk.\n\nMost of these tools come programmed to follow strict rules, ensuring consistent and accurate results. However, this level of accuracy is contingent on you finding the best software to handle the type of data you're analyzing. If you're curious about what to go for, read more here or in any other guide to be well-informed.\n\nHaving the right tool for the job can allow you to replicate calculations easily. Also, if you need to double-check or share your work, you won\u2019t have to start from scratch. This accuracy boosts confidence, whether you\u2019re presenting findings to stakeholders or publishing your research.\n\nAdvanced Analytical Capabilities\n\nSometimes, basic calculations or charts just don\u2019t cut it. Say you\u2019re a social scientist trying to predict trends in public opinion. Or maybe you\u2019re a business analyst looking for hidden patterns in customer purchase behavior. Manually spotting these trends is nearly impossible, especially with large datasets.\n\nResearch software opens up a world of advanced analytics. These tools can handle qualitative data, like open-ended survey responses or interview transcripts. It helps you identify recurring themes without the headache of manually combing through piles of text.\n\nThis software also lets you run complex statistical tests. For example, you could compare how two groups respond to a new product or predict future sales using regression models. The good thing about many of these tools is that they come with user-friendly interfaces or tutorials. So, even if you\u2019re not a data scientist, you can perform high-level analyses with a bit of practice.\n\nEnhanced Data Visualization\n\nYou\u2019ve just finished analyzing your data, and the results are groundbreaking. But when you present it, your audience just stares at a table filled with rows of numbers. The message gets lost, and your hard work feels wasted.\n\nWith the proper research software, this may not be the case, as they often come with data visualization tools. These tools can transform raw numbers into stunning visuals that tell a story. You can use them to create bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, and even interactive dashboards.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re presenting sales performance to your team, a heatmap can highlight top-performing regions at a glance. Or, if you\u2019re a health researcher, a line graph could show the rise and fall of disease cases over time.\n\nYour audience can drill down into the data themselves. They can click on a chart to see more details or filter data by categories that interest them. Strong visuals don\u2019t just make your work look professional. They help you communicate findings more effectively.\n\nCollaboration and Accessibility\n\nIn some cases, you might be working on a research project with a team scattered across different cities\u2014or even continents. If so, then sharing files back and forth through email becomes chaotic. Files get lost, versions get mixed up, and you waste precious time trying to sort it all out.\n\nResearch software can solve this headache. Many tools are cloud-based, meaning your entire team can access the same data and work in real time. This is a big deal, given that data analytics takes the biggest bite of the apple when it comes to cloud usage, at 86%, followed by software engineering at 83%.\n\nThese tools can go a long way when it comes to collaboration. One person can clean the data while another creates visuals\u2014all at the same time. These tools also track changes. So, if someone edits a dataset or adjusts a chart, you can easily see who did what and when. This transparency reduces misunderstandings and ensures accountability.\n\nPlus, the accessibility factor is unbeatable. Whether you\u2019re at home, in the office, or on the go, you can log in and pick up right where you left off. That kind of flexibility is a game-changer for teamwork and productivity.\n\nScalability for Large Datasets\n\nSay you\u2019re a small business owner today, working with customer data from a few hundred people. But what happens when your business grows? Suddenly, you\u2019re dealing with thousands\u2014or even millions\u2014of entries. Handling that kind of scale manually is impossible.\n\nResearch software is designed to grow with you. These tools can process massive datasets as they\u2019re built for speed and efficiency, even when the numbers are in the millions. Another benefit is that these tools don\u2019t just handle the data\u2014they make it easy to securely store and access. So, even if your data keeps growing, you\u2019ll never run out of space.\n\nThe best part? Many of these tools are modular. You can start small and upgrade features as your needs expand. This scalability makes research software a long-term investment, saving you time, money, and stress as your data needs evolve.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nResearch software is a tool that can 100% turn your data analysis around. This guide has introduced you to the benefits that come with having one on board. If indeed it's the path you want to take, take your time, do your research and settle for the right fit for your project."

            "article_content": "A program designed to improve health care through artificial intelligence, AI, wants to extend its reach to Guam to be able to better address the island\u2019s health care system.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Research Diversity, AIM-AHEAD, program held a community engagement and stakeholder workshop recently at the University of Guam.\n\nThe program, funded by the National Institutes of Health, seeks to reduce health disparities by ensuring underrepresented communities contribute to the development of AI and machine learning models.\n\nThrough this initiative, AIM-AHEAD aims to empower community organizations and researchers from diverse backgrounds to create equitable health care technologies, laying the foundation for a more inclusive future in health research and care.\n\nJamboor K. Vishwanatha, PhD, principal investigator of the AIM-AHEAD Coordinating Center, said the program\u2019s mission is to tackle health inequities through collaboration between AI experts, health care professionals, and community organizations.\n\nVishwanatha pointed at the challenges these organizations face in securing federal funding for initiatives focused on health disparities.\n\n\u201cMany awards and all, it is extremely, very difficult for community organizations to actually compete for federal grants. So to overcome these challenges, what NIH did is to start a program for enabling a new mechanism. It is called another transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that way, we cut down all of the pain, red tape, and we cut down all the procedures that we have.\u201d\n\nCollaboration is key for the program to not only work but prosper.\n\nThe program\u2019s strength, he said, lies in uniting stakeholders from cancer registries, health care centers, and academic departments to find innovative solutions.\n\nAIM-AHEAD has two primary goals: advancing health equity and increasing researcher diversity in AI and machine learning development.\n\nLack of diversity in data\n\nThe initiative emerged in response to concerns raised about the rapid development of AI, particularly regarding the lack of diversity in the data used.\n\nVishwanatha said much of today\u2019s health data, which comes from large hospitals\u2019 electronic health records, does not reflect the diversity of the U.S. population.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t address that, we don\u2019t address the biases in data. Any resulting model that comes out of there, which is applied in a clinic, will actually result in more health disparities, will result in more inequity,\u201d Vishwanatha said.\n\nHe pointed to an example of how AI could unintentionally perpetuate inequality.\n\n\u201cIf you call a clinic to set an appointment...A lot of times they use algorithms to tell you whether this patient actually needs a really quick appointment or can be scheduled later but the algorithm doesn\u2019t know whether this person is a single mother who doesn\u2019t have transportation and has to drop her kid at school,\u201d Vishwanatha said.\n\nTo counter this, Vishwanatha emphasized the need to include social determinants of health\u2014such as income, education, and environment\u2014into AI and machine learning models to ensure they are more inclusive and reflective of the challenges people face.\n\nAs AIM-AHEAD advances its efforts to create more inclusive AI applications, Vishwanatha pointed out the field\u2019s lack of diversity, particularly along the U.S. coasts.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not at the table, then you\u2019re not contributing your ideas,\u201d he said. He stressed the importance of including voices from underrepresented communities in AI development.\n\nReal-world impact\n\nDuring the workshop, Vishwanatha shared examples of AIM-AHEAD\u2019s impact on underserved communities.\n\nOne example involved a community organization in Honolulu that had collected valuable social determinants data but didn\u2019t know how to use it. AIM-AHEAD helped transform that data into machine learning-ready information, enabling community health workers to develop an AI tool to better address local health needs.\n\nVishwanatha also highlighted a project in which AI improved breast cancer imaging. Initially, the model showed significant biases when tested on Black and Hispanic populations. Through AIM-AHEAD\u2019s intervention, the algorithm was retrained with more diverse data, improving its accuracy to over 99%.\n\nOther projects include a machine learning model to predict colorectal cancer in American Samoa, where limited resources make regular screenings difficult. AIM-AHEAD provided funding and technical support to help local hospitals leverage existing data for better cancer detection.\n\nVishwanatha said Guam\u2019s health discrepancies, including cancers, obesity, and hypertension mirror those seen in other ethnic and racial groups in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe AIM-AHEAD program is addressing these disparities through community engagement, research, and workforce development programs,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the program\u2019s plans for Guam, Vishwanatha called attention to the importance of developing collaborations between local groups and organizations to better tailor the program to the island\u2019s specific health care needs.\n\n\u201cDeveloping collaborations between different stakeholder groups in Guam is an important goal of AIM-AHEAD,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are particularly interested in promoting programs for community engagement, capacity building, and workforce development.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Drone strikes, severely hit infrastructure, widespread starvation, thousands dead and millions displaced - the toll of the civil war in Sudan continues to mount with each passing day, pegging it as a dire humanitarian crisis. The latest among a series of attacks was artillery shelling and air strikes in capital Khartoum on Saturday that killed at least 56 people.\n\nGenesis Of Conflict\n\nSudan has witnessed violence and displacement since the 2003 Darfur ethnic cleansing crisis, and has the second-highest refugee population in Africa. After Authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir was deposed as President in 2019, Sudan began a journey of reforms as it transitioned to a new government. This included reforms in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) .\n\nThe RSF is an independent paramilitary force, and used to fight on behalf of the Sudanese government. The RSF was founded by over 20 years ago to quash rebellions in Darfur, where they carried out a campaign of ethnic violence against Masalit communities. Reforms that would impact the RSF and SAF sparked tensions between the two factions. This also resulted in tension between Bashir and General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who has been Sudan's de facto leader since 2019.\n\nBashir's removal in 2019 had sparked hope for civilian rule in Sudan. Two years later, al-Burhan and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, who leads the RSF and is also known as Hemedti, united to seize power in a military coup, but the two soon fell out. Diplomats, including those from United States, attempted to broker peace, but confusion prevailed over RSF's absorption into the army. This plunged the country into political and economic turmoil.\n\nThe conflict in Sudan began when violent clashes erupted between SAF and RSF erupted in the capital Khartoum in April 2023. The unrest soon spread to areas like Darfur, North Kordofan and Gezira state.\n\nMillions Displaced\n\nBetween April 15, 2023, and October 25, 2024, the warring sides exchanged a total of 8,942 attacks, averaging 16 a day, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a crisis mapping organisation.\n\nThe conflict resulted in over 11 million people being displaced, including internally displaced people (IDPs), asylum seekers and refugees. A large chunk of Sudan's population now faces extreme shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel.\n\nNearly three quarters of health facilities are out of service and diseases including cholera, measles and malaria are spreading at a time when two thirds of the population lack access to health care.\n\nEgypt is hosting the most Sudanese refugees (1.2 million), followed by Chad (712,288), South Sudan (190,280), Libya (180,000), Uganda (60,808) and Ethiopia (39,984). In South Sudan, most of those arriving are returning nationals (650,000) who had been living in Sudan as refugees.\n\nImpact On Women And Children\n\nAs per estimates by the United Nations, over 3 million women and girls were at risk of gender-based violence. The civil war only compounded it. Reports of rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence emerged only days after the conflict began. Attacks on healthcare facilities, equipment and workers are further depriving women and girls of lifesaving care, with pregnant women hardest hit, according to the World Health Organization and UNFPA.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, Sudan is witnessing the world's largest child displacement crisis. The conflict has deprived millions of Sudanese children of an education, with more than 90 per cent of the country's 19 million school-age children having no access to formal education.\n\nAid Delivery Restricted\n\nDespite the catastrophic threats of famine, both the SAF and RSF are actively restricting aid delivery across Sudan. International organisations like the World Food Programme said that they cannot access 90 per cent of the people facing emergency levels of hunger.\n\nAt a high-level donor conference in Paris in April, international donors pledged more than two billion euros (or over $2.1 billion) in aid for Sudan. But by June, the United Nations said, it had raised only $430 million of the $2.7 billion it needs for Sudan.\n\nWhat Is The Current Situation?\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces dominate much of Khartoum and Darfur, while Wad Madani was captured in December. Later, however, the SAF recaptured Omdurman. The military also controls most of northern and eastern Sudan, including Port Sudan on the Red Sea. The paramilitary group also surrounded El Fasher, the last city in Darfur still held by the army.\n\nOther Disasters Exacerbate Suffering\n\nThe civil war continues amid sever droughts to floods to even a famine in some parts of the country. The conflict also exacerbated many of Sudan's existing challenges, including ongoing conflicts, disease outbreaks, and economic and political instability.\n\nWhy Is The World Invested In The Conflict?\n\nThe third-largest African country Sudan is one of the largest gold producers of the continent and its position on River Nile gives it agricultural potential. It is also situated on the coast of the Red Sea, a busy shipping route, for about 500 miles.\n\nRussia's Wagner mercenaries also backed the RSF with weapons in the early months of the war, UN and Sudanese officials said, as per New York Times. The country is also receiving armed drones from Iran."

            "article_content": "The conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo risks escalating into a broader regional war, Burundi's president said Saturday, as Africa's top health agency warned the fighting could spark new outbreaks of serious diseases.\n\nThe Rwanda-backed armed group M23 has vowed to march on the capital Kinshasa after capturing eastern DRC's biggest city of Goma earlier this week.\n\nThe lightning offensive is the latest to scar the mineral-rich region, which has seen relentless conflict involving dozens of armed groups kill an estimated six million people over three decades.\n\nThe fall of Goma has rattled the continent, prompting international condemnation and fears of a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"If it continues like this, war risks becoming widespread in the region,\" Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye said.\n\n\"It is not only Burundi, it is Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya -- it is the whole region, it is a threat,\" he said in an official video posted to YouTube.\n\nHis comments echoed similar remarks by UN chief Antonio Guterres on Thursday.\n\nIllustrating the complicated nature of the conflict, Burundi itself has at least 10,000 soldiers in the east of the DRC, a Burundian military source told AFP.\n\nRwanda accused Burundian troops of actively engaging in fighting against the M23.\n\nRwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said on X that Burundian forces had been \"more engaged in open fighting against the M23\" since October 2023.\n\nMany of the Burundian troops, who are there under a previous military agreement with Kinshasa, have been redeployed to the South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu.\n\nLocals at the market there expressed their concerns Saturday.\n\n\"The M23 says that after having taken Goma, they are coming here to our home in South Kivu,\" said Henriette Butuna, a seller at Bukavu market. \"That's why we are scared, because we don't know either the day or the hour\" they could arrive.\n\n\"We are buying to stock up at home,\" said Josee Zabibu, one customer.\n\nUganda's army meanwhile said Friday it would adopt a \"forward defensive posture\" in eastern DRC.\n\nA UN expert report last July said Rwanda had around 4,000 troops in the east of Democratic Republic of Congo, accusing Kigali of having \"de facto\" control over the M23.\n\nRwanda denies any military involvement, maintaining its goal in eastern DRC is to eradicate a Hutu-led armed group formed in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\nBut the DRC accuses Rwanda of seeking to profit from the region's rare minerals, which are used in technology such as smartphones across the world -- a claim Kigali also denies.\n\nSince M23 and Rwandan troops entered North Kivu province's capital Goma last Sunday, at least 700 people have been killed and another 2,800 wounded in intense clashes, says the United Nations.\n\nThe M23 have outmatched the ill-equipped and poorly paid Congolese forces, who have resorted to hastily recruiting volunteers to fight back.\n\nIn recent days, M23 fighters have advanced into the neighbouring South Kivu province towards the town of Kavumu and its strategic military airport. This is where the Congolese forces have set their main line of defence.\n\nThe fighting in Goma has sparked a \"full-scale public health emergency\", warned the African Union's public health agency.\n\nEven before the latest violence, \"extreme conditions, combined with insecurity and mass displacement have fuelled the mutation of the mpox virus,\" said Africa CDC head Jean Kaseya. \"If decisive action is not taken, it will not be bullets alone that claim lives -- it will be the unchecked spread of major outbreaks and potential pandemics,\" Kaseya added."

            "article_content": "Economic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.\n\nDamage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It\u2019s also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.\n\nInsured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022.\n\nHurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\u201d said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \u201cWhen those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\u201d\n\nAt least two other hurricanes, several severe \u201cconvective\u201d storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.\n\nIn addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That\u2019s a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start.\n\nThe devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.\n\nIn a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history."

            "article_content": "Are IAM Innovations the Future of Cybersecurity?\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) has become instrumental in maintaining an effective cybersecurity strategy. As the digital sphere continues to expand, fostering innovations in IAM is crucial to ensuring robust access security. The management of Non-Human Identities (NHIs) and Secrets security is spearheading this evolution, but how exactly do they contribute to improved security measures?\n\nThe Strategic Role of NHIs and Secrets in Access Security\n\nNHIs are machine identities utilized in cybersecurity. They\u2019re generated by fusing a \u201cSecret\u201d (an encrypted password, token, or key similar to a passport) and the permissions provided to that Secret by a server (much like a visa granted based on your passport). Essentially, managing NHIs and their secrets includes securing both the identities (the \u201ctourist\u201d) and their access credentials (the \u201cpassport\u201d) while concurrently monitoring their behaviors within the system.\n\nComprehensive management of NHIs ascertains the protection of machine identities and secrets at every stage of their lifecycle, from discovery and classification to threat detection and remediation. This robust approach is a step up from solutions like secret scanners which offer limited protection. NHI management platforms provide insights into ownership, permissions, usage patterns, and potential vulnerabilities, enabling contextual security.\n\nBenefits of NHI Management\n\nEffective management of NHIs delivers several benefits, including:\n\nReduced Risk: Proactively identifying and mitigating security risks helps in reducing the chances of breaches and data leaks.\n\nProactively identifying and mitigating security risks helps in reducing the chances of breaches and data leaks. Improved Compliance: NHI management aids in meeting regulatory requirements through policy enforcement and audit trails.\n\nNHI management aids in meeting regulatory requirements through policy enforcement and audit trails. Increased Efficiency: Automation of NHIs and secrets management allows security teams to focus on strategic initiatives.\n\nAutomation of NHIs and secrets management allows security teams to focus on strategic initiatives. Enhanced Visibility and Control: It offers a centralized view for access management and governance.\n\nIt offers a centralized view for access management and governance. Cost Savings: It decreases operational costs by automating secrets rotation and NHIs decommissioning.\n\nThese benefits underline the importance of incorporating NHI management into cybersecurity strategies for holistic security.\n\nSecurity and Innovation: Walking Hand-In-Hand\n\nWhile organizations across financial services, healthcare, travel, DevOps, and SOC teams accustom themselves to operating in the cloud, the need for innovative solutions for identity and access management becomes paramount. This need is met by the evolving principles of NHI and Secret management.\n\nGroundbreaking solutions are necessitating a shift in orientation to think beyond the scope of conventional IAM practices. The introduction of machine identities is a testament to innovation. The management of NHIs aids in addressing security gaps that result from the disconnect between security and R&D teams by creating a secure cloud environment. The security of machine identities and their secrets can significantly decrease the risk of breaches and data leaks, making cybersecurity more effective and efficient. Hence, the success of cybersecurity measures resides not just in their application but also in their evolution.\n\nPaving the Way for a Secure Digital Future\n\nThe importance of IAM innovations for bolstering access security cannot be overstated. Cybersecurity is no longer just about securing systems and networks; it\u2019s also about managing and protecting identities. The management of NHIs and secrets is a stepping stone towards a more secure digital future. While machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to revolutionize how we approach cybersecurity, the strategic management of NHIs sets the foundation for this transformation.\n\nInnovations in Identity and Access Management, especially through the strategic management of NHIs and secrets, will play an increasingly vital role in ensuring robust access security. As cyber threats evolve, so must our defense mechanisms. To stay one step ahead, we must continue to innovate, adapt, and evolve. With the right tools and strategies, organizations can navigate the digital age securely and confidently, championing cybersecurity innovations to protect not only their systems but their identities as well.\n\nFor more insights about our market, follow these useful resources:\n\ncybersecurity predictions,\n\nremediation in cloud environments,\n\npreparation for 2025.\n\nAs we move ahead\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to stay informed and abreast of emerging trends and practices. IAM innovations, especially the management of NHIs and secrets, represent a significant shift in how we approach and manage cybersecurity. Accommodating these changes is essential for organizations striving to secure their digital identities and operations.\n\nUnderstanding the Implications of Managing NHIs for Cybersecurity\n\nAs access management increasingly plays an instrumental role in cybersecurity strategies, breakthroughs in the management of Non-Human Identities (NHIs) and Secrets are leading the way. An understanding of how these mechanisms contribute to fortified security measures is paramount for technologists, CISOs, and organizations alike. Data-driven insights offer a more comprehensive perspective on the transformative role of NHIs and secrets management.\n\nUnpacking the Lifecycle of NHIs\n\nSuccessfully utilizing NHIs involves managing code identities or apps throughout their lifespan, including both their active and inactive stages. This comprehensive life cycle from creation to deactivation encapsulates various stages including provision, use, rotation, and decommission. End-to-end NHI lifecycle management ensures improved visibility and oversight, resulting in effective risk mitigation.\n\nEach stage within the lifecycle of an NHI presents unique challenges and opportunities for security enhancement. Proactively deploying access control measures and monitoring access behaviors at each stage allows organizations to pre-emptively address potential vulnerabilities. Data-backed insights have shown us that approximately 30% of corporate software vulnerabilities stem from the misuse or mismanagement of NHIs, underscoring the crucial role of comprehensive management strategies.\n\nShift from Reactive to Proactive Security Paradigms\n\nTraditionally, cybersecurity measures often operate on the principle of reaction, responding to threats as they arise. With the widespread adoption and implementation of NHI and secrets management, the paradigm is shifting towards proactive defense mechanisms. These innovative approaches pre-emptively identify and mitigate potential security risks, reducing the risk of security breaches and data leaks.\n\nEffective NHI management, therefore, structures an inherent resilience to threats into the cybersecurity architecture of an organization.\n\nHow Data-Powered Insights Influence Change\n\nComplimenting this strategic stance, leveraging data insights can drastically improve risk mitigation. Security teams equipped with comprehensive insights and metrics are more adept at identifying risk factors and making informed decisions. These include, but are not limited to, understanding ownership, permissions, usage patterns, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nData-driven security models offer organized real-time visibility and analytics to reduce blind spots. A cybersecurity strategy is significantly more impactful when guided by accurate, actionable intelligence provided by these insights, helping organizations stay ahead of potential threats.\n\nTransitioning Gatekeepers: From Humans to Machines\n\nWhere data is the new currency, data gatekeepers have transformed. What was once the sole responsibility of human operators has progressively shifted to machines or Non-Human Identities (NHIs). These NHIs, coupled with their access credentials or \u201cSecrets\u201d, are now responsible for accessing, processing, and managing vast pools of data within organizations.\n\nThis transformation cautions us to shift the epicenter of our security focus from traditional IAM models to innovative and encompassing NHI management. After all, NHIs today constitute approximately 80% of all organizational identities, a significant rise from just a decade ago.\n\nCollaborative Approach Towards Enhanced Cybersecurity\n\nThe future of cybersecurity lies in collective coexistence. By amalgamating the principles of traditional IAM practices with the innovative approaches of NHI and secrets management, organizations can bolster their cybersecurity architecture for improved resilience against threats.\n\nThe constant collaboration between identity and access management and rapidly evolving NHIs is the key to remaining robust and dynamic security challenges.\n\nMoving Toward a Secure Future\n\nBy focusing on strategic management of NHIs and secrets, organizations can adopt an effectively future-forward approach. As technology continues to leap with advancements in AIM and machine identities, it\u2019s important to remain agile and adaptive. Here\u2019s to realizing the potential of NHI management and innovating toward more secure, resilient, and robust cybersecurity ecosystems.\n\nThe post Innovations in Identity and Access Management appeared first on Entro.\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Entro authored by Amy Cohn.

They also have guesthouses, mountain huts and hotels that feel like what the Alps were like 30-plus years ago, all owned by local families and run in a traditional way very authentic to the place and culture.\"\n\nCan't-miss: Hiking in Valbona Valley National Park\n\nBest time to go: June to September\n\nAverage flight price: $926 to Tirana, Albania\n\nEcuadorian cloud forest\n\nGerard Puigmal | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Allie Almario, South America and Galapagos expert at Premier Tours\n\nWhy to visit: \"Most people think of Costa Rica when they think of cloud forest, but Ecuador also has the lure of the Galapagos Islands, so it's a terrific combination. About three hours from the capital city of Quito, Ecuador, the cloud forest feels primeval and otherworldly.\n\n\"I love the Mashpi Eco Lodge, which is on the cusp of the rain and cloud forest in a private sanctuary. You've got incredibly rich biodiversity in this remote area \u2014 so remote the silence is almost deafening.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"Mashpi Lodge offers an activity called the Dragon Fly \u2014 it is up to an hour ride in an open air cable car (seating only for four guests at a time and a naturalist) where you soar over the tree canopy. You hear nothing but the wind and bird calls and the distant crash of waterfalls 500 feet below you. The butterflies are like confetti.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"Temperatures are pretty consistent throughout the year, but the main difference is rainy vs. dry season. Be prepared and either way, hiking in the cloud and rain forest will always be an adventure.\"\n\nAverage flight price: $588 to Quito, Ecuador\n\nHamburg, Germany\n\nInigo Cia | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Kareem George, CEO of Culture Traveler\n\nWhy to visit: \"This ultra chic city is beautiful, sophisticated and extremely fun, with a variety of attractions for diverse ages and interests. The setting of the city is quite picturesque, nestled between the Elbe River and Alster Lake with many canals in between. It is an extremely walkable city with many historic attractions in the city center \u2014 such as the Rathaus (City Hall) and St. Nikolai Church \u2014 flanked by very cool neighborhoods such as the Speicherstadt (Warehouse) District, raucous St. Pauli and the quirky Schanzenviertel.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"Two of the many must-see attractions are the iconic Elbphilharmonie and the unique Miniatur Wunderland. Advance tickets are highly recommended for both.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"Hamburg is truly a destination for all seasons, however I particularly enjoyed a recent visit in the fall. The weather was perfect and it was wonderful to stroll along the lake, canals and to explore several neighborhoods on foot.\"\n\nAverage flight price: $1,090\n\nKyushu, Japan\n\nBohistock | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Kristin Braswell, founder of CrushGlobal Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"Brimming with natural beauty at every corner, the southern island of Japan's Kyushu may be overlooked for its popular northern neighbors like Tokyo and Kyoto, but it's just as thrilling. Teeming with active volcanoes, palm-forested coastlines and bubbling onsens [hot springs] to retreat in, you will be enamored at every turn by the great, wide outdoors here. I highly recommend visiting the electric metropolis, Fukuoka, and Beppu, a mountainside jewel that is home to the most spring waters in the country.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"Visiting the famous onsens, particularly the Jigoku Circuit, which are all grouped and within walking distance. They are a sight to see.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"In spring, during cherry-blossom season and when the weather is pleasantly warm, or the fall, as the foliage begins to change with the seasons.\"\n\nAverage flight price: Top three airports in Kyushu, by popularity from U.S. cities based on search demand:\n\nFukuoka: $1,326\n\nNagasaki: $1,617\n\nKumamoto: $1,594\n\nLen\u00e7\u00f3is Maranhenses National Park, Brazil\n\nIgnacio Palacios | Stone | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: John Lansdell, planner at Trufflepig Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"Remote and staggeringly beautiful, this park of sand dunes, mangroves and freshwater lagoons is prime for both relaxing in and exploring \u2014 swimming, dune walks and quad tours, birding, etc.\"\n\nCan't-miss: Swimming in the lagoons.\n\nBest time to go: \"When to visit is subjective, but high season is July and August: Full lagoons; warm, not too hot; rains have passed, but the gateway towns are busy. Either side of these months may be the best bet, although the park itself, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is vast and won't feel overly busy in high season.\"\n\nAverage flight price: $1,069 to Sao Luis, Brazil\n\nThe Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway)\n\nLeonardo Patrizi | E+ | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Melissa Wu, founder of Woodlyn Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"The Nordics offer a great variety of destinations and activities, from the bustling nightlife and modern hotels of the cities, to rural pastimes like dog sledding and gazing up at the amazing northern lights. Classic Nordic activities like saunas and cold plunges share the stage with farm-to-table culinary extravaganzas.

The ABBA museum is a must-see for music lovers, while the Viking Museum and Vasa Museum, which houses a salvaged 17th century ship, pay tribute to Sweden's history. And no visit would be complete without a stop at the Spiritmuseum, which celebrates Sweden's drinking culture.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"The Nordics offer something unique no matter what time of year you visit. Long summer days give way to amazing fall foliage, followed by Christmas markets and ice hotels during the wintertime, and lovely island-hopping adventures in spring. Stockholm's cherry-blossom trees bloom in mid- to late-April, with a gorgeous display that rivals more well-known (and crowded) spots like Washington, D.C. and Kyoto.\"\n\nAverage flight price:\n\nCopenhagen: $769\n\nHelsinki: $890\n\nOslo: $826\n\nStockholm: $801\n\nThe Philippines\n\nTravelstoxphoto | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Tesa Totengco, founder and CEO of Travels with Tesa\n\nWhy to visit: \"Although it is very much a part of Southeast Asia, the Philippines is off to the side from the rest of its neighbors. I suggest devoting your entire trip to the country and island-hopping.\n\n\"It has some of the most beautiful white powdery sand beaches (Palawan, Boracay, Bohol). There is a thriving contemporary art scene (Art Fair in Manila, held in February), and galleries supporting local artists (Silverlens, Artinformal, Gravity Art Space, Orange Project). In the capital, you can tour Old Manila and learn of the past from the 16th century Spanish colonialization right up to the American War liberating the country from Japanese occupation. There are pop-up shops throughout the year that celebrate Filipino design, and celebrated chefs with their own restaurants celebrating Filipino cuisine. It's a predominantly English-speaking country, so the traveler will never feel lost.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"This country is made up of over 7,000 islands, each unique in culture, history and flavor. It's best to make a 'halo-halo' (meaning 'mixed') experience: Not just beach, for which the country is most famous.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"It's a tropical country, so the Philippines is hot and humid year round. Avoid the rainy season from June to October and come from December to February when the country is at its coolest.\"\n\nAverage flight price:\n\nManila: $1,296\n\nCebu City: $1,446\n\nAngeles City: $1,461\n\nTunisia\n\nMax Shen | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Sofia Markovich, owner of Sofia's Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"Tunisia is home to some of the world's most well-preserved Roman ruins, including the iconic El Jem Amphitheatre, a UNESCO World Heritage site that rivals Rome's Colosseum in grandeur. Carthage, once a powerful city-state, showcases the remnants of an ancient civilization that shaped Mediterranean history.\n\n\"From the rolling dunes of the Sahara Desert to the pristine beaches of Hammamet, Sussa and Djerba, the country offers a variety of settings for adventure and relaxation. Matmata's troglodyte homes, famously featured in Star Wars films, add a touch of cinematic wonder to the experience.\"\n\n\"Tunisia's cuisine is a highlight that captivates food lovers. With its bold flavors and Mediterranean influences, dishes like brik (a savory pastry), couscous and harissa-infused stews offer an authentic taste of the region.

Once the heart of the Silk Road, the architecture doesn't look like anything else you've ever seen.

The mosque of Samarkand is one of the most incredible architectural highlights you'll see in your life.\n\n\"Getting out of the cities, you can head into the mountains, which are essentially the back of the Himalayas, for incredible nature and green valleys outside of the stark, dramatic desert that you get for most of the rest of the country.\"\n\nMlenny | E+ | Getty Images\n\nCan't-miss: \"Samarkand.

But I have always been a huge fan of Western Australia. It is incredibly diverse, and the landscapes are truly magnificent.\n\n\"Perth is your starting point and known as one of the most isolated cities in the world. There is world-class wine further south in Margaret River. The coast is filled with some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, such as Monkey Mia and Ningaloo Reef, which also are teeming with amazing marine life. The Kimberleys are wild, rugged and unique.\"\n\nMichael Runkel | Imagebroker | Getty Images\n\nCan't-miss: \"Ningaloo Reef. Forget the crowds of the Great Barrier Reef out of Cairns \u2014 imagine a pristine reef with no crowds. You can also swim with whale sharks here March to August. The luxury glamping experience at Sal Salis is a unique experience.\"\n\nWhen to go: \"April to September. This is the sweet spot, their 'winter.' The temperatures are mild, however still much warmer than our northern hemisphere winter.

So, I kicked like a wee black tray off the top of it and then that\u2019s when I seen, like a foot.\n\n\u201cAnd then when I looked in further, you could see the back of the skull up the other end.\n\n\u201cIt was when I noticed, like, the mummified skin on the back of the neck.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter realising that he had found a body, he called the police.\n\nBarnes was apprehended for the crime and given a life sentence with a minimum term of 23 years at the High Court in Edinburgh.\n\nDuring the trial, the court heard how Barnes withdrew the victim's money from his bank, and used it to buy \u2018goods and services\u2019.\n\nHe also lied to neighbours and friends that Coutts was alive, and devastatingly, he later pretended to be Coutts when contacting his family on the day of his daughter's wedding.\n\nBarnes stood trial on a total of 36 charges, including theft and fraud, but those charges were dropped and he was instead convicted of murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.\n\nWhen he was being sentenced Lord Mulholland told Barnes: \"You thought you would get away with these appalling crimes.\n\n\"You lied about Ean Coutts' whereabouts, pretending he was on an extended holiday in Morocco or with his sister in England.\n\n\"You even contacted his family on his daughter's wedding day pretending to be him and looking for money.\n\n\"It was an act of deception and arrogance.\n\n\"The finding of the body by the urban explorer resulted in the unravelling of your lies exposing your crimes and, you, as a murderer.\"\n\nYou can watch Murder Trial: Body in the Warehouse on BBC iPlayer now."

            "article_content": "In a networked society, secure communication is essential. Quantum physics delivers the necessary foundation by allowing practicable technologies such as quantum key distribution. With the new fiber optic test facility at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), which opened on January 22, 2025, researchers aim to transmit, test and refine quantum keys. They also plan to set up a quantum network to link quantum computers.\n\n\n\nTo generate and transmit the quantum keys, the researchers will use cutting-edge technologies such as ultra-coherent lasers with the new fiber optic test facility. Quantum keys are crucial for secure communication because they are based on physical laws instead of the mathematical assumptions underlying earlier encryption keys, which future quantum computers will be able to break.\n\n\n\nSpanning 20 kilometers, the quantum-optical transmission line connects laboratories specially equipped with complex lasers and cryostats on KIT\u2019s Campus South and Campus North. The light-guiding core of a fiber optic cable is only about 9 micrometers in diameter. For comparison, the thickness of a human hair is about 60 micrometers.\n\n\n\nImportant Quantum Research Platform\n\n\u201cQuantum communication is a strategically important field for KIT, so I\u2019m especially pleased that with the finished test facility, KIT is providing its researchers with important infrastructure for investigating the opportunities offered by quantum physics,\u201d said Oliver Kraft, Vice President for Research at KIT. \u201cWith this facility, we\u2019re making an important contribution to the advancement of research and development in quantum network technology, with an eye to practical applications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the fiber-optic test facility, we have a platform for improving quantum key distribution, investigating its basic properties, and integrating it in classical communication,\u201d said Professor David Hunger of the Physikalisches Institut at KIT, who heads the project. Based on this work, the scientists aim to develop new transmission protocols for the keys. \u201cWith the new methods we develop, we want to make quantum cryptography more efficient and practical. We\u2019re working on this e.g. with KEEQuant, a quantum communication start-up,\u201d added Hunger. \u201cFurthermore, using novel materials such as molecular quantum emitters, we want to generate ultrapure quantum light \u2013 individual photons \u2013 to increase transmission rates.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuilding a Quantum Network\n\nThe researchers will also be progressively building a quantum network to investigate the quantum internet of the future. Their work focuses on two crucial steps: storing quantum information in special quantum memories, and quantum entanglement of the memories. This will make it possible to implement quantum repeaters for the transmission of quantum information over long distances. Since entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum computers, such computers can be connected with one another in a quantum internet via optical transmission of the entanglement.\n\n\n\nTest Facility Part of Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence Initiative\n\nThe project is a key part of the infrastructure for the Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence initiative, in which researchers from KIT, Ulm University and the University of Stuttgart will design materials for future quantum technologies and focus on molecular quantum systems, a new field of quantum technology. In addition, the project plays an important role in the quantum repeater research conducted in the Quantenrepeater.Net (QR.N) joint project of Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and in the QuantumBW Innovation Campus.\n\n\n\nMore information\n\nDetailed caption: Opening of the fiber optic test facility at KIT: (from left to right) Prof. Sebastian Randel (KIT), Prof. Marc Weber (Head of Division B V, KIT), Prof. Oliver Kraft (Vice President Research, KIT), Prof. Mario Ruben (KIT), Prof. David Hunger (KIT) (Photo: Daryoush Djavadi)\n\n\n\nBeing \u201cThe Research University in the Helmholtz Association\u201d, KIT creates and imparts knowledge for the society and the environment. It is the objective to make significant contributions to the global challenges in the fields of energy, mobility, and information. For this, about 10,000 employees cooperate in a broad range of disciplines in natural sciences, engineering sciences, economics, and the humanities and social sciences. KIT prepares its 22,800 students for responsible tasks in society, industry, and science by offering research-based study programs. Innovation efforts at KIT build a bridge between important scientific findings and their application for the benefit of society, economic prosperity, and the preservation of our natural basis of life. KIT is one of the German universities of excellence."
