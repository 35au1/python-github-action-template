            "article_content": "Nothing to worry about?\n\nNot according to a growing number of lawmakers and local officials who are becoming increasingly alarmed about the number of drone sightings reported near sensitive locations in New Jersey.\n\nOne candidate for governor says it might be time to declare a state of emergency while two congressmen have called for the drones to be shot down. One of those congressmen says evidence suggests that the sophisticated drones are tied to a foreign adversary, although the Department of Defense officials said there was no truth to that.\n\nDrones tied to Iran?\n\nU.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J. 2nd District, said \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d ties \u201cdrones could be the work of foreign adversaries, specifically Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we know that there are drones flying in from the direction of the ocean. We also know there is an Iranian drone mothership that is missing from port in Iran, with a timeline matching the emergence of these drones,\" Van Drew said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe time to act on this information is now before the threat escalates any further. These drones are intentionally flying in uncontrolled airspace, expertly navigating around areas with radar coverage,\u201d Van Drew said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pentagon, however, shot down that theory, telling the Wall Street Journal that the drones were not tied to any foreign adversary.\n\nVan Drew said the drones should be shot down in order to assess the threat.\n\n\u201cWe should have already taken action by imposing flight restrictions to regain our control. Whether this is a foreign adversary or even just a group of drone hobbyists, we cannot allow unidentified drones to operate freely in our airspace with no consequences and it is time we eliminate the threat they pose and shoot them down.\u201d\n\nDrone over Ocean County Drone over Ocean County (Ocean County Sheriff's Office) loading...\n\nTime for a state of emergency?\n\nState Sen. Jon Bramnick, R-Union, a candidate for governor, said a state of emergency should be declared to \u201cshut down the airspace to drones and allow the Department of Defense to investigate.\n\nOn Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group Robert Wheeler testified in the House of Representatives that no evidence indicates the drones are threat, but added that \"we just don't know. And that's the concerning part.\"\n\nState homeland security officials met behind closed doors Wednesday morning with mayors from across the state.\n\nDrone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 Drone over Mount Laurel 12/5/24 (Alette Knoblauch via Facebook) loading...\n\nWhat are people seeing? Army of drones\n\nPolice have been receiving reports about drones since Thanksgiving. The drones, some as large as cars, have been spotted near President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s properties, power lines, a reservoir, police stations and military installations.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said he saw police footage that recorded more than 50 drones coming from the ocean, with more than a dozen trailing a Coast Guard vessel. Coast Guard officials said they did not know their origin.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy, who last week first acknowledged the reports, says they do not appear to be a threat. But those statements do little to allay fears because Murphy and federal officials have also said that they do not know who is operating the unmanned aircraft.\n\nMurphy said the drones go dark after they are spotted, hampering efforts at investigating them.\n\nSome reports have been false, with people mistaking planes or helicopters for drones.\n\nOn Tuesday, police in Parsippany-Troy Hills refuted rumors on the Ring app community claiming that a drone had downed power lines in a fiery crash. Instead, a car crash had toppled a utility pole."

            "article_content": "I've used many VR and AR headsets and had a lot of experiences. But I've never worn one with an all-seeing, all-listening AI companion by my side until this week when I got my first taste at Google's headquarters in New York City.\n\nAndroid XR, which is available in early form for developers now and will fully launch in 2025, promises a whole OS for headsets and glasses of all types and is a bridge to Android phones. But its killer app, the one Google is clearly banking on, is its AI, Gemini. From what I've seen, it's a heck of a sign of how much headsets and glasses will be changing in the next few years\u2026 but I still have a lot of questions about how it'll fit into everyday life.\n\nWhat I remember most clearly afterward, my head buzzing with an hour's worth of demo memories in headset and glasses, is wandering through worlds with the persistence of an AI companion. For instance, I was standing on a 3D map of my own neighborhood, my home below me. I pinched and zoomed, hovering over my roof, until I could see the horizon and some buildings a few streets away. I pointed to them.\n\n\"What's that building over there?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's the high school,\" Gemini said, identifying my town's school name.\n\nI get closer and ask about the municipal building next door too. We explored my town together, Gemini and I, in a new Samsung mixed-reality headset that feels a lot like Apple's Vision Pro headset. But as I asked Gemini to take me to other places -- beyond Maps to Chrome or YouTube, where it helped me recognize things in videos, or narrated scenes on the fly -- or even pointed out and searched for things in the real world in a constructed living room space at Google's New York headquarters -- I started to lose track of what app I was in. Gemini was always with me, though. And after a few demos, Gemini even told me what I'd done and jogged my memory in case I forgot.\n\nA lot of it starts to feel like those dreams of sci-fi assistants, and that's not accidental. Google's President of Android Ecosystem, Sameer Samat, equates multimodal AI to a \"Tony Stark\" moment: \"What these [AI] models can do using the cameras on the phone as a way of interacting with the world, it was truly blowing us away. Wouldn't this be perfect for a pair of glasses?\"\n\nDuring a long exclusive conversation with Samat, it became clear that AI has motivated Google to rewrite its future AR/VR plans and re-enter a space it walked away from years ago after ending support for the Google Daydream.\n\nAnd yes, Google and Samsung have a lot of AR/VR plans for 2025: Android XR will launch then, and so will Samsung's headset. But Android XR will also work with Android phones and other headsets and glasses ranging from VR to AR to Meta Ray-Ban-like smart glasses. Glasses are very much on Google's roadmap. I also got multiple demos of display-enabled, Gemini-equipped smart glasses from others, each with floating head-up displays. These glasses, part of Google's AI initiative code-named Project Astra, are part of what's coming next.\n\nIt's a lot to take in. But it's all a massive taste of what will probably be a big shift to AI living on XR very soon. It's fascinating stuff and also a lot to digest.\n\nA bridge to phones, an ecosystem for all sorts of hardware\n\nI've said it for years: the big missing piece in VR and AR has been our phones. To this point, iOS and Android haven't been deeply connected with VR and AR headsets and glasses. But Android XR, a new platform launching in 2025 that was announced for developers Thursday, will open that all up. Starting with Samsung's Vision Pro-like mixed reality headset, Google aims to create a universe of glasses, goggles and headsets to interconnect with Google Play, run multiple 2D apps at once and use Gemini AI.\n\nGoogle's making AI a big part of the reason for Android XR, and its biggest feature. In that sense, it's already different from Meta and Apple, which have slow-played AI in VR and AR so far. Apple Intelligence still hasn't emerged on Vision Pro yet, but is likely to arrive next year. While Meta has generative AI already running on its Ray-Ban smart glasses, the Meta Quest VR headsets don't have a lot of AI tools baked in yet.\n\nAndroid XR is only in its early stages, a preview form for early partners to start getting used to. Google is working with Samsung first as its starting hardware partner, with the mixed reality headset I got to briefly try being the first product next year. Samsung is also making glasses, which we don't know much about yet\u2026 in the meantime, Google also has its own in-house smart glasses called Project Astra (I got to try those too).\n\nThere will be other partners and other products: Xreal, which already has a wide range of display glasses and a new set of AI-ready Xreal One glasses, is one of them. But for the year to come, it'll mostly be about Google and Samsung, with hardware using chipsets made by Qualcomm.\n\nEven though Android XR's starting point is a high-end VR headset, the endpoint is a whole range of products to come. \"This is not just about one product,\" says Kihwan Kim, executive VP of Immersive technologies and hardware at Samsung. Kim sees it as the foundation for what will be a range of devices, including glasses. \"This is more like the route to making this market,\" Kim says.\n\nMeta's Orion glasses, which I saw earlier in the fall, are years away from being a reality but show what AR glasses could be. No one is there yet, though, and Google, like everyone else, is splitting the difference to get there.\n\n\"We have this kind of parallel approach,\" Shahram Izadi, Google's VP and GM for XR, says about the headset/glasses strategy. \"One starts with a lot of capabilities, one starts with limited capabilities, but you're locking on form factor. Most people are attacking these two vectors to get to all-day wearable AR glasses.\"\n\nProject Moohan is a familiar-looking mixed reality-enabled VR headset. It'll be the first Android XR-enabled product next year. Samsung\n\nSamsung's Project Moohan is the first step\n\nI was one of only a few people to get an early hands-on with Samsung's Android XR headset and only got to wear it for a half hour or so. It's called Project Moohan, and Google didn't allow me to take any photos or videos of my demos or the mixed reality headset. The feel of the hardware is very familiar: It has the fit and feel of a Meta Quest Pro but the video quality of an Apple Vision Pro. The headset's clear lenses and visor-like design perch over my forehead, resting over my eyes without needing a face piece pressing in. The headband design tightens in the back, and it's lightweight, but there's also a tethered battery pack, much like the Vision Pro, which I tuck in my pocket.\n\nGoogle outfitted me with prescription lenses for my demos, which was a huge help since the headset doesn't seem made to fit over glasses. The hardware has both eye tracking and hand tracking, just like Vision Pro, and uses a color camera passthrough of the real world overlaid with what's shown in VR on the headset, creating mixed reality much like Meta's Quest 3 or Vision Pro.\n\nProject Moohan is what Google and Samsung started with awhile ago, before a rapid rise in generative AI interest and capabilities that, according to Samat, led the team to pivot toward an agent-based Gemini system that would work on both headsets and glasses. But Moohan is the starting point that Google feels can cover enough bases of interaction, Google Play app compatibility, AI and interface that it can fuel ideas in a wave of other, smaller glasses that may not have all these features eventually.\n\nThe windowed feel of Android XR looks a lot like Vision OS, but Gemini AI can also see what you're seeing. Google\n\nFamiliar, but with some AI Magic\n\nTapping on the side of the headband opens up a grid of Google Play apps, much like how Vision Pro (or my Meta Orion demo) worked. I can pinch open apps with my hand by casting a pointer in space, and app windows can be dragged around by the edges and expanded in size. A top button on the headset can bring me back to the home screen, which includes an immersive 3D landscape that, again, is very Vision Pro.\n\nGoogle's demos were all of Google apps, several of which aren't on other headsets yet, namely, Maps and YouTube. Google Maps starts in 2D but can launch a full 3D view that feels like the Google Earth experience I tried in VR years ago. Landscapes spread around magically, with searchable locations studded throughout. Google's also adding full 3D-scanned locations over time using a technique called Gaussian splatting, which knits 2D photos into realistic (but a bit hazy) walkable rooms. I popped into a scan of Scarpetta, a New York restaurant, and entered the dining rooms. I've seen these types of scans at Meta and via companies like Varjo and Niantic, but it's fun to see them knitted into Maps.\n\nYouTube feels like a standard viewer with pop-out panes for comments and metadata, but it can also play immersive 3D, 180- and 360-degree videos that have been on YouTube for years. There's another trick too: Google is using AI to convert 2D YouTube videos into 3D. It didn't look bad, and more impressively, it works with home videos in the Photos app, too, along with 2D-to-3D photo conversions. Apple already converts 2D photos to 3D in Vision Pro, but the video trick is a next-level move for immersive memories.\n\nAndroid XR can show photos, and videos, and convert them all into 3D. Google\n\nI also dragged my Chrome browser over to a table to demo how swapping to mouse and keyboard from hand tracking would work, and the transition was pretty seamless; the mouse cursor moved all around the room, not just in the browser window. When I lifted my hand off the mouse, hand tracking was instantly back in action. My demo didn't have eye tracking enabled (maybe because of my prescription inserts), but the headset and Android XR are made to adapt to whatever inputs are available: hands, eyes, voice or things like keyboards, mice or connected phones. (The headset does have automatic eye distance adjustment, by the way.)\n\nThere's no price or release date for Samsung's headset, or even an official name -- Moohan refers to \"infinity\" in Korean -- and it's available only for developers now. But it feels like a very real product, and it runs off Qualcomm's XR2 Plus Gen 2 chips announced back in January. But again, it's the Gemini AI that feels like the special ingredient right now. My demos were pretty contained in a pre-set space with preconfigured apps, but Gemini seemed like a pretty compelling magic trick. The magic continued on glasses in another room.\n\nGoogle's prototype smart glasses showing Project Astra look pretty normal, but have a display inside one lens. Google\n\nGlasses: All-seeing AI with a head-up display\n\nSamsung's next product will be smart glasses, with more details coming in 2025. But these glasses don't exist yet. Instead, Google is currently experimenting with its own in-house glasses, part of an AI initiative called Project Astra, which are being field-tested now to get feedback on how they work and feel in public. The second room I entered had a number of pairs of these glasses, one outfitted with a temporary pair of makeshift prescription inserts for me. The glasses look pretty normal, lightweight and wireless (like Meta's Ray-Bans), with a camera onboard and speakers and mics in the arms, along with a few input buttons.\n\nThese glasses have a single display in the right lens, projected in via a Micro LED chip on the arm onto etched waveguides on a small square patch on the lens glass. They feel like a modern riff on Google Glass, but with much better tech. The display mainly shows text: directional information or captions of whatever Gemini might be saying to me through the speakers.\n\nGoogle's representation of what heads-up displays in their smart glasses look like. My experience was pretty close to this, but I didn't set up a shelf. Google\n\nI wandered around the room, looking at books on the shelf and asking about them (Jeff Vandermeer's Absolution, for instance, which I asked about and whether I needed to read the other books first). I opened up a Yuval Noah Harari book and asked Gemini to summarize what was in front of me. I also had them translate a poster on the wall. Meta's Ray-Bans can already do this too, but Gemini, once invoked, stays active and doesn't need additional prompts. Instead of always re-activating, I keep it on\u2026 and pause it by tapping on the side of the glasses when I want an Assistant break.\n\nI also got to demo a live translation, where someone else in the room approached me to speak in English and then Spanish. Everything she said to me was auto-captioned in the head-up display, and it all kept being delivered in English even when she changed languages.\n\nThis representation of what Maps looks like on glasses was like what I experienced on dual-display prototypes, but in a contained demo space. Google\n\nAnother short demo showed where the tech aims to go next: A pair of glasses with dual displays gave me simulated map information, and when I looked down, I saw a 3D map appear to guide my orientation and show me what street I was facing. Looking up and spinning around, I saw a map appear when I was in motion, then fade away when I was still. I also saw a brief video clip to show the potential resolution of the display; the micro-LED color and pixel density looked really good, but the square field of view was pretty small. Google sees it expanding over time, but it was notably smaller than the Meta Orion prototype, Xreal's glasses and even Snap's developer Spectacles. Then again, right now, Google and its hardware partners like Samsung may be taking small steps for how much visual detail is even delivered on these glasses without feeling like an interruption or unsafe to use in public while walking around.\n\nMeta sees headsets and glasses as two parallel classes of products like PCs and phones, and Google feels the same way. \"You'll probably use the more immersive products akin to laptops. On the glasses side, these are more like smartphones of the future or wearable devices of the future like watches or buds. So you have to support both,\" Izadi says.\n\nA representation of what instant translation would look like. How will this feel in the outdoor everyday world? Google\n\nGemini as an always-ready agent: Am I ready for it?\n\nThrough all of these demos, Gemini's one-tap-away readiness was a constant. That's clearly Google's push here by design. But it's also the most eye-opening, surprising part of everything I experienced. AI, no matter what your concerns about it might be, can be extremely helpful in a headset or glasses where inputs like a keyboard or touchscreen are harder to access. I use Siri a lot more in Vision Pro or with AirPods. Meta's Ray-Bans use voice as a deeper way to control things too. However, current VR/AR devices have limits to how aware the AI feels. Gemini, because it can see everything you're seeing in real time, feels like it's a buddy\u2026 and maybe not one you'll always want.\n\nI found Gemini bubbly and friendly at first (it said \"Hi!\" and I awkwardly said \"hi\" back) but then settled into a listening mode where anything I said could be interpreted as instruction -- there's no \"hey Gemini\" prompt. That makes things helpful but also intrusive. The way to stop it is to pause it or turn it off again, which feels like the reverse of how AI assistants work now: Instead of tapping to invoke, you tap to stop it. No doubt, Gemini will have limits on how much it can run continuously on small glasses, just from a battery perspective. According to Google, in mixed reality VR like Project Moohan, Gemini works as a layer that uses casting to interpret everything it sees. It can even be used while playing games, though there might be a bit of a performance hit.\n\nThe advantages could be how it can continuously break the fourth wall of mixed reality, in a sense: I could \"circle to search\" things in Chrome and have responses pop up, or pull 3D objects into my world on command, or jump from app to app as I request a location or a video or ask to play music from an album I see in front of me (which happened during my demo). Samsung's Kim suggests I could get tutorials while playing games, for instance, if Gemini sees what I'm doing in the headset or even with glasses. And, of course, it can remember what I was doing, too, and when. Although, when I asked Gemini to recognize my colleague Lisa Eadicicco in the room with me, it said it couldn't be used to identify people (yet).\n\nGoogle's already laying out wide-sweeping plans for Gemini 2, just announced, to be an agent-like system that works across devices. Adding camera feeds into the AI input mix also means more data to collect and train with. It won't just be on headsets and glasses, and Google isn't the only company pursuing this vision. The implications are vast.\n\n\"The assistant is coming with you, whether it's your glasses, your headset, your phone, your watch,\" Izadi says.\n\nWould I want Gemini to see everything I'm doing? No, of course not. Microsoft experimented with an always-on Recall AI mode in Windows before delaying it after backlash. How Google will handle that dance between always-helpful and privacy-invasive is unclear, although Google promises that video feeds used for AI recognition are kept private and local.\n\nThe shape of future Android XR products remains unknown, but expect lots of glasses. Getty Images/CNET\n\nAndroid XR will open doors between phones, headsets and everything else\n\nOne big thing seems clear, though: With Android XR, all sorts of headsets and glasses will be able to bridge into phones more easily than before. That could allow a whole host of otherwise isolated products to feel more knitted together in a way that Apple and Meta haven't done yet (although the exact steps for how that happens aren't clear for Google, either). Google's Samat points to Samsung being the first partner to co-explore the software, but Qualcomm's existing Snapdragon Spaces software, which bridges phones to glasses already, will also be compatible and part of Android XR. Google's also enabling WebXR and Unity tools to work with Android XR, and existing 2D Google Play apps will all run in Android XR, as long as a developer agrees to opt in to listing them there.\n\nIndividual hardware makers should be able to customize their own software and tools and still connect to Google Play, but what about putting Google's already widespread services on other devices too? Right now, Google isn't offering any specifics there, but having XR Maps and YouTube -- and Gemini -- on Quest and Vision Pro headsets and elsewhere would be helpful.\n\nIt could also change the way developers envision future VR and AR apps. \"While we are looking to bring existing games like Demeo to Android XR, the platform also opens us up to develop entirely new ideas,\" Tommy Palm, head of Resolution Games, a developer that's made games for lots of existing VR/AR hardware, tells CNET. \"Android XR's open nature, developer-friendly approach and unique innovations make it not only viable but allow us to consider new and novel ways to use mixed reality for storytelling. For instance, the natural language interface of ChatBots could be a very potent extension for XR and games.\"\n\nThese moves are early, but they're also pointers to what's happening next. Apple and Meta will undoubtedly have more AI services in AR and VR in the years to come, and Apple will likely find ways to let Vision work with iPhones. Or they need to. Google's plans make a lot of sense, and they'll probably let headsets and glasses work as true peripherals to phones and, eventually, with watches too. With three partners in the equation -- Google, Samsung, and Qualcomm -- and other manufacturers too \u2013 it could get messy. But it's also the unifying progress that an already fragmented future landscape needs. We'll know more about what's really happening in 2025, which isn't very far away at all."

            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "In the face of piling controversy \u2014 and a second lawsuit concerning the welfare of children \u2014 Google has taken pains to downplay its relationship to the embattled AI chatbot startup Character.AI.\n\nAbout this time last year, though? Google was crowning Character.AI as Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app of the year.\n\n\"AI made a major splash in 2023 allowing people to harness the technology to build knowledge, improve expression, and much, much more,\" reads a Google post lauding the app. \"Enter Character.AI, an innovative new app that brings unique AI-powered characters to you, each with their own distinct personalities and perspectives.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A world of characters is now at your fingertips,\" the post adds. (OpenAI's ChatGPT is listed as the category's honorable mention.)\n\nEarlier today, two Texas families filed a lawsuit accusing the Character.AI platform of engaging in emotional and sexual abuse of their minor children, resulting in self-harm and physical violence. The complaint is the second in recent weeks concerning the welfare of child users of Character.AI \u2014 the first, filed in October in the state of Florida, argues that a 14-year-old's death by suicide was caused by his interactions with Character.AI \u2014 and argues that these disturbing incidents are the result of intentional design choices inherent to the platform's function.\n\nAccording to the suit, Character.AI and its cofounders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas, aren't the only parties at fault. It also targets Google, a significant financial backer of Character.AI and the provider of its AI computing infrastructure, alleging that the tech giant knew about the Character.AI platform's dangers and facilitated its operations anyway in a ploy to farm valuable troves of user data without accountability.\n\nIn a statement to Futurism, Google rejected the lawsuit's characterization of its relationship with Character.AI, claiming that \"Google and Character.AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"User safety is a top concern for us, which is why we've taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes,\" the company added.\n\nWhether Google intentionally used Character.AI as an unofficial AI testing facility remains to be proven in court.\n\nBut the two parties do clearly have deep ties: Shazeer and de Freitas, in fact, founded Character.AI in 2021 after departing Google over frustrations with corporate red tape. The Character.AI platform would make its way into consumers' hands in the fall of 2022, shortly before the AI race kicked off with the public release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnd in the heat of that industry-wide AI race \u2014 which caught Google on its back foot, as the New York Times reported at the time \u2014 Character.AI and Google seemingly held onto their close association. In May of 2023, for instance, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian bragged onstage at a developer conference that Google was providing Character.AI with the pricey computing infrastructure needed to power its AI platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We provide Character with the world's most performant and cost-efficient infrastructure for training and serving the models,\" said Kurian at the time, calling Character.AI a \"partner.\" \"By combining its own AI capabilities with those of Google Cloud, consumers can create their own deeply personalized characters and interact with them.\"\n\nLater year, in early November, Reuters reported that Google was weighing a high-dollar investment into Character.AI. By the end of that same month, the platform had been crowned Google Play's first-ever \"Best with AI\" app.\n\n\"We've been increasingly impressed by what AI can do,\" Google added in its announcement of the award, \"and we know you'll be impressed, too.\"\n\nGoogle's interest in Character.AI continued into August of 2024, when the search behemoth agreed to pay Character.AI $2.7 billion for access to its AI model in the form of a one-time licensing fee. As part of that deal, Shazeer and de Freitas rejoined Google's AI division and took 30 other Character.AI employees with them, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple Futurism reviews of Character.AI have revealed droves of alarming AI characters hosted by the platform, including chatbots explicitly dedicated to themes of suicide, pedophilia, pro-eating disorder content, and self-harm roleplay.\n\nThese disturbing chatbots were easy to find, accessible to Character.AI accounts listed as belonging to minors, and available for users to interact with well beyond Google's most recent August investment into the AI company \u2014 and, to that end, well after the platform's \"Best with AI\" crowning.\n\nCharacter.AI, for its part, has since removed a note about the Google Play award from its \"About\" page.\n\nMore on Character.AI and Google: Google-Backed AI Startup Tested Dangerous Chatbots on Children, Lawsuit Alleges"

The year had something for everybody, including slashers, creature features, paranormal sagas, original IPs, potentially new franchises, long-awaited sequels, and a few unneeded but surprisingly solid prequels.\n\nThough several of these movies captivated the masses from beginning to end, one or two moments did something truly special, allowing them to leave a lasting impression. Sure, these entries contained hard-hitting stories and thought-provoking characters, but it's those jaw-dropping twists, creative deaths, nightmarish jump-scares, and WTF endings that stand the test of time.\n\nWhether these moments lasted an entire scene or less than a second, none of them will be forgotten anytime soon."

            "article_content": "Dandadan is the latest anime to make waves in the West, yet everyone who\u2019s tuned in to watch it agrees that one episode stands head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never watched the show (why are you reading this?), allow me to explain the premise briefly. Two high schoolers, Momo Ayase and Okarun, become unlikely friends after discovering that ghosts and aliens are real, and they team up to keep the world safe from paranormal threats.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nExcept that\u2019s only half the story. The real driving force in Dandadan is Okarun\u2019s quest to get his testicles back, which were stolen from him by the Yokai Turbo Granny. Yes, you read that right, Dandadan spends a lot of time focused on a teen boy\u2019s nutsack.\n\nAs you can probably imagine then, this is a show that doesn\u2019t take itself very seriously, and as you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s very funny and full of action. It\u2019s classic shonen stuff, really. Yet every now and again, Dandadan will blindside you with an episode that\u2019s so heartbreaking you\u2019ll be left an emotional wreck by the time it ends.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nAcrobatic Silky\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nIn fact, one episode in particular is so good that fans have already labeled it the best in the series. I\u2019m talking, of course, about Episode 7, titled \u2018To A Kinder World\u2019. This genuinely harrowing chapter sees Momo and Okarun battle the terrifying Acrobatic Silky, a powerful Yokai with designs on their school friend, Aira Shiratori.\n\nYet the episode takes a tragic turn when, during the battle, Aira dies, and Acrobatic Silky decides to sacrifice her own aura to the teenager to save her life. During the transfer, the audience gets to see a flashback to Acrobatic Silky\u2019s human life and what drove her to become a vengeful spirit in the afterlife.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nSilky, it turns out, was a poor single mom struggling to keep her head above water. To provide for her daughter, she turned to prostitution and loan sharks, which allowed her to give her child a happy life. One day, however, rather than paying the loan sharks back, she bought her daughter a pretty dress, and let\u2019s just say the criminals who lent her the money weren\u2019t pleased with her.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIn one of the most triggering scenes I\u2019ve ever watched, the loan sharks beat Silky half to death and kidnap her daughter. Silky gave chase, but she was so grievously wounded that she died (or took her own life, it\u2019s a bit unclear), never finding out what happened to her beloved little girl.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nFor years, she wandered Tokyo as a ghost until a fateful encounter with Aira transformed her into the fearsome Yokai we know and love.\n\nMummy?\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nAs the transfer finishes, Silky starts to break apart, dying once again. This time, however, there will be no afterlife; if a ghost dies without completing its unfinished business, it simply ceases to be. However, before Silky goes into the void, Aira steps up and hugs the Yokai, thanking her and calling her mommy.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThis brief act of kindness convinces Silky she is a good mother after all, and it counts as her completing her unfinished business so she can go to a kinder world. It\u2019s heart-wrenching stuff and on a level with some of the saddest scenes ever seen on TV.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising then that fans love it, and a quick search of Episode 7 will bring up countless posts and comments lauding the episode for its gorgeous animation, beautiful storytelling, and heart-rending final moments.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThis isn\u2019t just Redditor group think either; on IMDb, it\u2019s Dandadan\u2019s highest-rated episode with a score of 9.7, the same score as all-time classics like The Soprano\u2019s \u2018Pine Barrens\u2019 and \u2018The One Where Everyone Finds Out\u2019 from Friends.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not checked out Dandadan, maybe do yourself a favor and just get up to Episode 7 \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed.

So far we haven\u2019t heard any specific details about an ETA for a return to normal operation, but we\u2019ll update you as news comes in.\n\nUpdate, December 11, 2024 (07:26 PM ET): OpenAI has posted a status update on this evening\u2019s outage:\n\nChatGPT, Sora, and the API remain down. We have identified the issue and are rolling out a remediation. We are working as fast as we can to return service to normal and apologize for the downtime.\n\nUpdate, December 11, 2024 (09:33 PM ET): We\u2019re getting there, but not quite all the way back to regular operation just yet. OpenAI\u2019s latest update reads:\n\nAPI and ChatGPT traffic is partially recovered. Sora remains down.\n\nUpdate, December 12, 2024 (10:28 AM ET): As of Thursday morning, OpenAI reports that all its systems are once again fully operational."

            "article_content": "Harvard University announced Thursday it\u2019s releasing a high-quality dataset of nearly 1 million public-domain books that could be used by anyone to train large language models and other AI tools. The dataset was created by Harvard\u2019s newly formed Institutional Data Initiative with funding from both Microsoft and OpenAI. It contains books scanned as part of the Google Books project that are no longer protected by copyright.\n\nAround five times the size of the notorious Books3 dataset that was used to train AI models like Meta\u2019s Llama, the Institutional Data Initiative's database spans genres, decades, and languages, with classics from Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, and Dante included alongside obscure Czech math textbooks and Welsh pocket dictionaries. Greg Leppert, executive director of the Institutional Data Initiative, says the project is an attempt to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by giving the general public, including small players in the AI industry and individual researchers, access to the sort of highly-refined and curated content repositories that normally only established tech giants have the resources to assemble. \u201cIt's gone through rigorous review,\u201d he says.\n\nLeppert believes the new public domain database could be used in conjunction with other licensed materials to build artificial intelligence models. \u201cI think about it a bit like the way that Linux has become a foundational operating system for so much of the world,\u201d he says, noting that companies would still need to use additional training data to differentiate their models from those of their competitors.\n\nBurton Davis, Microsoft\u2019s vice president and deputy general counsel for intellectual property, emphasized that the company\u2019s support for the project was in line with its broader beliefs about the value of creating \u201cpools of accessible data\u201d for AI startups to use that are \u201cmanaged in the public\u2019s interest.\u201d In other words, Microsoft isn\u2019t necessarily planning to swap out all of the AI training data it has used in its own models with public domain alternatives like the books in the new Harvard database. \u201cWe use publicly available data for the purposes of training our models,\u201d Davis says.\n\nTom Rubin, OpenAI's chief of intellectual property and content, described the company as \u201cdelighted\u201d to support the project in a statement.\n\nAs dozens of lawsuits filed over the use of copyrighted data for training AI wind their way through the courts, the future of how artificial intelligence tools are built hangs in the balance. If AI companies win their cases, they\u2019ll be able to keep scraping the internet without needing to enter into licensing agreements with copyright holders. But if they lose, AI companies could be forced to overhaul how their models get made. A wave of projects like the Harvard database are plowing forward under the assumption that\u2014no matter what happens\u2014there will be an appetite for public domain datasets."

            "article_content": "Astronomers have discovered another mysterious and massive circle of radio light in space. The strange and vast circle of light is an example of an ORC (Odd Radio Circle), the origins of which are currently unknown.\n\nORCS, first discovered in 2019, are so vast they can be 10 times the width of the Milky Way, thus encompassing entire galaxies.\n\nThe newly found ORC, designated ORC J0219\u20130505, was discovered in data from the MIGHTEE survey conducted by the MeerKAT radio telescope located in the Meerkat National Park in the Northern Cape of South Africa. The 371,600 light-year-wide ORC seems to be associated with the elliptical galaxy WISEA J021912.43\u2013050501.8. It has features that seem to set it apart from other ORCs, including the fact that it appears fainter and that details of its structure reveal it leans to one side.\n\n\"Odd Radio Circles: Circles of radio emission found around distant galaxies that we still don't understand,\" lead researcher and Western Sydney University astronomer Ray Norris told Space.com. \"It's a completely unexpected discovery, not predicted by the physics we already know, and therefore revealing a gap in our knowledge.\n\n\"So we hope these will tell us something new about how galaxies form and interact.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, ORC J0219\u20130505 seems to differ from other previously discovered ORCs, which has at least answered one question about this strange astronomical phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\"All the ORCS we had previously discovered were very similar. We weren't sure whether this was because all ORCS really are similar or whether it was a selection bias in our detection methods,\" Norris said. \"This new ORC tells us it was indeed a selection effect.\"\n\nThe astronomer added that the faintness of this ORC is consistent with ORCS coming in a range of sizes and brightnesses. He compares this to the variations seen in radio galaxies, which have giant radio emission regions that extend well beyond their visible structure.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nORC birth controversy\n\nUnsurprisingly, for a mysterious newly discovered astronomical phenomenon, scientists have a few different ideas of how ORCs are formed.\n\nNorris explained that one thing that is almost certain is the fact that the radio emission behind ORCs is the emission of so-called \"synchrotron radiation.\"\n\nThis arises from electrons that have been accelerated to high energies and high speeds by a shock wave. The debate around ORCs concerns the source of these powerful shockwaves.\n\n\"There are two main schools of thought as to what causes this,\" Norris explained. \"One is that the circles of ORCs are caused by spheres of shocked gas surrounding a galaxy.\"\n\nThe astronomer said that in this case, the ring we see representing an ORC is actually just the cross-section of an expanding sphere caused by a shock wave.\n\nThis shock wave could be the result of a cosmic collision, either two galaxies colliding and merging or even two supermassive black holes merging.\n\nTwo supermassive black holes collide and merge. Is this the source of the shockwaves that create ORCs? (Image credit: NASA)\n\nAlternatively, Norris said that the rings could be caused by a plane shock wave from another source crossing a dead radio lobe from a supermassive black hole.\n\n\n\nThese lobes emerge from each side of feeding supermassive black holes and spread out to incredible distances.\n\nIn this case, Norris said that as the plane shock wave intersects the roughly spherical outer edge of the remnant lobe, it creates a ring of accelerated electrons that generate synchrotron radiation.\n\nThis multiwavelength image of the Cloverleaf ORC (odd radio circle) (Image credit: X. Zhang and M. Kluge (MPE), B. Koribalski (CSIRO))\n\nThe fact that ORC J0219\u20130505 differs from previously discovered ORCs could hint at which of these creation models is the accurate one.\n\n\"The offset between the center of the ring and the host galaxy isn\u2019t easy to explain in the merging supermassive black hole model,\" Norris explained. \"That was my favorite model, so I\u2019m not very happy about this!\"\n\nNorris pointed out that the discovery of ORC J0219\u20130505 shows there is \"still a fair way to go\" before scientists understand ORCs.\n\nThe astronomer said that in addition to investigating WISEA J021912.43\u2013050501.8, this ORC's galactic home, further with a large optical telescope, the team will also hunt for more ORCs as they attempt to solve this cosmic curiosity.\n\nThe team's research is reported in preprint form on the repository site arXiv."

            "article_content": "Check out Sequentum Cloud today and sign up for a free trial.\n\nData is an increasingly valuable commodity in today's digital world. Whether in finance, real estate, e-commerce or healthcare, the ability to extract, analyze and leverage data can provide a competitive edge for businesses across a wide range of industries. However, to fully harness the power of data, it is crucial to use a tool that can deliver reliability, precision and customizability.\n\nCustom web-scraping company Sequentum recently announced the launch of its cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, Sequentum Cloud. The company says this cutting-edge platform is the ultimate web scraping tool, allowing users of all sizes to access high-quality, trusted, auditable, custom web data on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\nWhy Low-Code Is Better Than No-Code\n\nWhen it comes to web scraping, many platforms aim to provide a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that forgoes the need for traditional hand coding. So-called no-code tools may offer simplicity, but with the evolving nature of the internet, they lack the customizability required to handle ever-changing data extraction needs.\n\nSequentum Cloud is a low-code solution, aiming to strike the perfect balance between usability and customizability. Like no-code platforms, Sequentum offers a point-and-click interface for easy agent creation. The company says that around 95% of tasks can be achieved with reusable, composable assets, thereby saving time and allowing you to scale easily.\n\nHowever, for the remaining 5% of tasks, Sequentum Cloud supports custom coding in JavaScript, Python, C# and Regular Expression, giving you the flexibility to handle any data from any data source, in any data structure, to any destination.\n\nHarness The Sequentum Agent Human-Friendly Text Format To Build Trust And Train Your AI To Interact In Complex Ways With The Web\n\nOne of the advantages of Sequentum Cloud is its new and innovative nested, human-readable, text format of the agent you create. With all the data extraction process logic presented in this way, all stakeholders can understand the data and the extraction process, helping to promote trust and transparency in the process and the resulting data.\n\nFurthermore, non-technical staff will be able to review your data collection process by seeing all the steps laid out in a human-readable format and easily read every step that is being followed to obtain the data and ensure compliance with guidelines. For example, some companies might restrict their staff from using web scraping bots to automatically bypass CAPTCHA tests. With human-readable results, compliance teams can more easily verify that restricted activities such as CAPTCHA automation are not happening in their data collection.\n\nSimilarly, the human-friendly agent text format is a turnkey way to train AI to make use of websites and mobile apps no matter how complex the interaction needs to be.\n\nTrust, Transparency And Ethical Compliance\n\nData trustworthiness, transparency and regulatory compliance are of the utmost importance for companies. Sequentum Cloud aims to address this by ensuring that users can see exactly where their data originates from and every step of the collection process, all auditable with full documentation.\n\nSequentum argues that this not only mitigates legal risks, such as those relating to privacy and security, but also makes sure that data aligns with ethical standards. This is crucial when it comes to monetizing data assets since documenting full lineage on all data from how data is sourced and processed will not only enable dataset creators to demonstrate where they added value but will also point to the web sources that contributed to that value.\n\nThis is particularly important for AI, analytics and data-driven decision-making, as a lack of data transparency could mean risking future monetization opportunities or compliance failures as new regulations are adopted. By being proactive and applying transparent data practices today, companies can avoid losing out on all the value they've added once the laws catch up to the way people are working today.\n\nGet Started Today\n\nIn today's competitive environment, trust, precision and transparency are essential if you want to gain an edge. In November, CIOReview named Sequentum as the Enterprise Data Delivery Platform of the Year for 2024. Sequentum Cloud seems poised to be the ultimate web scraper for the most precise and trusted data, combining a low-code platform and point-and-click interface with the power of customization and human-readable nested text format of the agent you create.\n\nSign up for a free trial today and experience the Sequentum Edge.\n\nFeatured photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash.\n\nThis post contains sponsored content.

            "article_content": "00:00\n\nHi everybody, welcome to DEMO, the show where companies come in and they show us their latest products and platforms. Today, I'm joined by Neil Miller, he is the Director of Product Marketing at Kissflow. Welcome to the show, Neil. So tell us a little bit about what Kissflow is, and then what are you going to show us here today?\n\n\n\n00:14\n\nSo Kissflow is a no-code, low-code, application platform that really spreads the power of application development across the enterprise.\n\n\n\n00:21\n\nGenerally, who is this designed for? Is it designed for product developers, or is it other people within the company that might not be a developer?\n\n\n\n00:30\n\nYes, so Kissflow is a unique product in that it's really built for both groups, so it can handle the people that like the high-powered, low-code developers who really want to build a lot of things out -- they don't need a lot of certifications or anything. It's a platform they can get on to build things very quickly and easily. But then the other side, you also have junior developers, business analysts and specifically process owners, who want to build their own thing themselves. The platform is easy enough for them to use that they can build their own applications too.\n\n\n\n00:56\n\nDo you subscribe to the whole citizen developer movement that we're seeing in the space, because of skill shortages and things like that?\n\n\n\n01:04\n\nAbsolutely. Citizen development is one of the main themes we like to play into. Now our platform is very governed, so IT admins have the ability to govern the entire platform and know what's going on in there. But at the same time, we believe that people who actually run these processes probably know best what's there. So as long as you give them the right tools, and you give them enough training, they're able to build what they need.\n\n\n\n01:25\n\nBecause I guess if I was in IT, the biggest fear would be like, \u201cWait, you're we're giving power to who?\u201d Because the last thing you want is me programming something, with very little design or development skills. So why should companies care about Kissflow versus maybe some of the other platforms out there, or some of the other processes that go on.\n\n\n\n01:42\n\nLike I said, Kissflow\u2019s unique thing is that one, it\u2019s just super easy to use. You're going to see it in the demo here a second. The layout, the feel of it, is just really geared towards someone who knows what they want but maybe doesn't have the development skills about it. There's a lot of things we won't show today that show the power of the low-code side of it as well, so that even a higher-powered developer can come in and really do what they want to do, but that's one thing that really makes it easy, is just the ease of use and be able to generate things quickly. So even somebody who's in the IT department that just wants to build a lot of apps very quickly to get things out of their backlog, they can really easily build dozens of apps on this.\n\n\n\n02:16\n\nIf companies didn't have this, would they just be relying on developers to do a lot of the requests that are coming in? Does this offload some of those processes to people that usually don't have those skills?\n\n\n\n02:26\n\nSo a few different things. One is that they would either just be custom developing things. Second is they might be using a different low-code platform, but typically, you're only going to be building two or three applications a year on those really big platforms that are out there. Kissflow is more like, \u201cHey, give us a few dozen that we're going to get done in a year.\u201d Then the citizen developers, the other thing they would be using would just be spreadsheets, Excel or something like that, to build what they need. So this is their option to actually get something that's an improvement on Excel.\n\n\n\n02:53\n\nSo let's go into the demo. Tell us what you're going to show us.\n\n\n\n03:00\n\nWhat you see here is the basics of a process. So we have a few different modules in Kissflow, but the process builder is one of the easiest to understand, and the one that generates the most interest for most people. So we start off with a form, which is a little bit interesting. Most people are going to say, OK, build us a data table or something like that. But we actually want to start with a form, because that's where the process owner is usually going to start. They know what they want to do. In this situation, we're looking at asset disposal requests. So this is, again, something maybe your admin team is going to use, or maybe somebody else in the IT department is going to use, but it's really something that the person who is building this knows what they need, and they just want to be able to bring that in.\n\n\n\nSo the form is very, very simple. It's all drag and drop. We have tons of form fields that are available here on the left, all sorts of things, from very simple things to very complicated. We also have some AI features here. So if you want to, just based on the name asset disposal request, you're going to be able to generate types of fields you might need to know. So if somebody's building it for the first time, they're going to be able to bring those in. They can do anything here, building out sections, you're also able to refer back to fields. We have remote lookup, so you can go to databases outside of Kissflow and bring those things in. Every field has the ability to change the settings, to add validations, add visibility requirements, stylize it the way you want, and even add these custom events, which is more the low-code part of what's going on. So the field, the form is one of the things that is most fun to use, I feel like to build in, but then you want to take that form and drive it through a workflow. So that's where we go to the second phase. So here again, this is one of the powers of Kissflow, is just being able to see how simple it is to build things out. Again, we have these AI features where they will suggest steps for you based on the name of the platform. Here I have a few that are already added in. It's as easy as adding in new steps. Adding in you can do something like a parallel branch where two different things may be happening at the same time. Or you want to create conditions based on how things happen. So all these things are available to just make it easy.\n\n\n\nOne of the best things about it is how you assign things. A lot of these features, a lot of other platforms, don't have so easily to do in terms of if you're going to assign it to a group of people, if you're going to assign it to everyone, if everyone needs to approve it before it goes forward, if only a few people need to approve it. If you want to assign things to one person based on the region that they're in, but a different region needs to go to somebody else, that's really easy to do in Kissflow. If you're trying to hand-code a lot of the things, it becomes very difficult to do. You can also build in these conditions. You can look at different SLAs, actions, deadlines, field permissions that are available at different steps. That's really one of the great, but I'm able to create services requests. I'm able to create product marketing requests based on these workflows and just set up the way I want to do it.\n\n\n\n05:46\n\nDo you find that when you're doing the application itself, does it get sent to approval from the IT department to make sure that you're not missing anything? Or does another developer check your work before it gets deployed? Or because, if it's internal, maybe you don't have to do that?\n\n\n\n06:02\n\nSo within the citizen development framework, which we also try to align ourselves a lot, you kind of have these zonings of applications, they're based on the risk and based on the complexity. So a lot of risk that's involved and a lot of complexity, you really want your IT team to be hands-on doing those things. Maybe you're going to let a citizen developer work on a form or something like that. Then you have things that are less risk, but maybe with a little bit of complexity. That's where someone just needs a mentor to be able to come along and make sure, \u201cHey, you did it right, you didn't screw up anything.\u201d Then you have this other area where it's like, it's low risk, it's low complexity, and pretty much you're just letting those people just build whatever they want, because they're not going to mess up too much.\n\n\n\nSo this particular one, asset disposal, there may be some concerns about some risks that are around there, but not too much. This would be an example of one that would probably be fine for a citizen developer just to build on their own, and just for the data governance platform, just to know that it\u2019s there. But other apps you're going to want to have people more involved in it.\n\n\n\nAfter you build out all the steps that you want, and again, this can get as complex as you want. We've seen many very big workflows that go on, then you go on to permissions. So here, at each step in the process, you're able to figure out if fields should be editable, if they're read-only, or if they're hidden. You can set these rules across steps or just for individual ones. It's really just a way to make sure to ensure some privacy issues, or ensure some scalability issues, as you're building these out to make sure that each step is what it needs to be.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite features within this particular function in Kissflow is the simulate button. So here, instead of having to go live with something and then test it out and figure it out, this is really a way to just test it on the back end really quickly. Here I can simulate it as myself, or as lots of other people, and see what it would be like. I can see, these fields are obviously like a read-only field, but this one is something that I can use. And if I say, \u201cOkay, well, I didn't want that to be like that,\u201d I can just go back into the process and figure that out.\n\n\n\nWith each step I can see things. I can mark it, and I can submit it as done, and see what it looks like in the next section. You can also see what it looks like on a mobile app. So this is really the fun side of Kissflow, I would say, in order to be able to see what's going on and be able to build it. In this particular process builder, deploying an app is just as simple as clicking this button to go live. Now it's live. So now at this point, this is more like the runtime. So in here, a new person would be able to get in. They're going to click this New Item button. They're going to see all the same fields that you had with Kissflow, with our process builder. You're going to see exactly when something was started, when the next step was done. So these are going to have times if they had SLAs attached to them. The SLA is going to be there to know if it was handled appropriately or not. You can also add comments for people that are involved in the workflow. So if there's some extra things that need to be added into all these things, so you get this big data trail as well. So a lot of this use of Kissflow, with an approval management cycle, you're going to be able to get all the things you need, as opposed to just trying to handle something on either a simple workflow builder, on Excel or something.\n\n\n\n09:01\n\nYou were talking to me before the show that you've got some integrations that you wanted to show off?\n\n\n\n09:06\n\nSo this part of Kissflow is about approvals. So you're talking about mostly human-based ones, but also you can build a lot of really intense integrations as well. So here, this is an integration we built for another process was about scheduling interviews with customers. This is pretty easy, and again, you're going to see a similar workflow builder here, but here we're not talking about human elements. Now we don't have approvers. Now we are just going into different systems. So here, when a status of an item is updated, we're going to make sure certain data sets match and then send an email. Those are easy to do, but again, you can see lots of different connections we have here, lots of things within Kissflow. But then also outside of Kissflow, as well, other tools that if you want to go into one of your CMS or your ERP system and make a connection, those are very easy to do. Again, this is still no code. We're still talking about people like you and me that aren't technically minded, that can just go in and make what they need to do. Maybe I get into a little bit of trouble. I need to ask somebody, Hey, what I do here, and that's very easy, just to go and then you feel really empowered as a system developer.\n\n\n\n10:05\n\nYou've got a lot of features other than the stuff that you just showed me. But do you offer a free trial? Is it? Or how do you get set up on this?\n\n\n\n10:12\n\nYeah, free trials are available. As long as you go to our website, request a meeting with our sales team, they'll kind of get a figure for how you want to use it. One of our big things is that we like to see companies with a long list of backlogged apps. If you have five to 25 apps that you're like, \u201cMan, I wish somebody would take these off our plate,\u201d that's our kind of customer. So if you're in that that zone and you really want to see it, or you want to try out citizen development as well, unleashing something for the rest of the organization, then come in, we'll figure out if it's right for you, and make sure you get set up.\n\n\n\n10:43\n\nAnd it looks simple to operate, so I'm also assuming it's going to be simple to install. You're not talking like a three-month long install process.\n\n\n\n10:49\n\nAbsolutely not. We like to see people get up and going as soon as possible. We don't have any long certification courses. You get in, you learn the platform, and then again, depending on if you want to turn this over to people, citizen developers, or IT departments. IT departments are going to be very fast with this, and like, within a week, they're going to be up and building MVPs, and things much more complicated. What I was showing you before was our standard runtime that you can see with a certain process, but we have a page builder, you can build a custom UI, so you can have everything unique. You can build your own dashboards or your own reports. This is just like one small, easy part of Kissflow, but it can really be very powerful.\n\n\n\n11:27\n\nAll right, give me the website again.\n\n\n\n11:29\n\nKissflow.com.\n\n\n\n11:30\n\nNeil Miller, thanks again for joining us on the show.

But in a way those were quite predictable \u2013 Enzo Maresca hinted heavily at appearances for both in his press conferences.\n\nA more surprising name starting his first game of the season is Carney Chukwuemeka, a member of the \u201cbomb squad\u201d in the summer who the club tried and failed to get rid of. After signing from Aston Villa for \u20ac18m, the midfielder has never really been given the opportunities his talent deserve.\n\nThis is not only Chukwuemeka\u2019s first start of the season \u2013 it\u2019s his first start since August last year. In that fateful game against West Ham, the midfielder was given the nod from the start by Mauricio Pochettino and did really well, before suffering a serious knee injury towards the end.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the great \u201csliding doors\u201d moments in recent Chelsea history. We\u2019re convinced that without that injury he would have stayed in the starting XI ( that seems likely given he scored a great goal earlier in the game), and from there, who knows where his Chelsea career might have gone?\n\nCarney Chukwuemeka in training.\n\nCarney gets unexpected chance for what could be his final Chelsea start\n\nRumours have it that the club are keen to move Chukwuemeka on in January \u2013 on loan or permanently. Either way, we don\u2019t expect to see many more appearances in Blue from the youngster. There\u2019s interest from AC Milan, and we\u2019re sure Premier League clubs will be sniffing around him too.\n\nWe\u2019re just glad we get to see one more Carney start before he goes."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Specs Pricing tiers Features Support Privacy and security Which data recovery app is right for you?\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed the best data recovery software you can buy, which often require a costly subscription. However, there are some very good free apps that can help restore your missing files or photos.\n\nCCleaner\u2019s Recuva and DMDE are among the best free data recovery apps that let you preview and restore a wide variety of files at no cost. I\u2019ll focus on the free versions, but also cover the more powerful paid apps.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSpecs\n\nRecuva DMDE Platforms Windows Windows, macOS, Linux Devices unlimited (Free), 3 (Professional) unlimited (Free), 1 (Express, Standard), plus 5 monthly (Professional) Support Email Email Free version? Yes Yes\n\nPricing tiers\n\nRecuva is a full-featured free data recovery app with only minor limitations. There\u2019s no customer service for free users. The app can\u2019t read virtual drives and you have to check for updates manually.\n\nBeyond that, you can use Recuva for free for as long as you like on any Windows computer. There\u2019s not a macOS or Linux version of Recuva and it doesn\u2019t work on mobile devices.\n\nLeading solutions like Stellar Data Recovery restrict free file restoration to 1 GB, which might be enough for lots of documents and several photos. However, the free version might not retrieve all your photos and videos since they take up more space.\n\nFor $25 annually, you can install Recuva Professional on up to three computers and contact support for technical assistance. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with data recovery software and drive technology and formats, technical support could be very important.\n\nDMDE also has a free version that\u2019s just as powerful as the paid app. However, it does have some restrictions. You can restore one folder and 4,000 files at a time.\n\nUnless you dump all you photos and videos in a single folder or store a huge number of files in one place, you\u2019ll need the paid version. Since only one folder can be restored with the free app, you\u2019ll probably need multiple scans to get back missing files.\n\nAn annual subscription to DMDE Express costs $20. There\u2019s also a lifetime plan call DMDE Standard that costs just $48. If you subscribe to DMDE Express for more than two years, DMDE Standard is a better bargain.\n\nDMDE also has professional plans, starting at $95, that let you install the app on more computers.\n\nFeatures\n\nRecuva has a wizard to guide you through data recovery. You select the type of files to restore, but the option of all files seems to make the most sense. Then you get to choose the drive or let the app scan all drives. That can take a long time, so it\u2019s best to select the drive you suspect has missing files.\n\nWhen you start a scan, the app immediately starts listing files that Windows File Explorer won\u2019t show. As the scan continues, more details appear including filename, the folder it\u2019s in, the modification date, size, and more.\n\nRecuva also estimates the recoverability of each file and optionally shows a preview. Those are the most valuable details. If image previews look correct and files are rated with excellent recoverability, the app should be able to restore them.\n\nIn my review of Recuva Professional, I found it to be useful in recovering data from my external hard disk drive (HDD) and my thumb drive. It found 158 of 163 files in the HDD test, which is good, but not great.\n\nDMDE is easy to get started with, but some features can be a little confusing. It\u2019s a much more technical app with powerful and dangerous features like disk editing. It\u2019s wise to make sure you understand what will happen before making a change.\n\nBasic operation is straightforward. You select a drive, start a scan, and watch the file list appear. DMDE shows the folders in a left sidebar and files to the right. It fills in the filename, size, modification date, and shows an optional preview.\n\nThe preview is important since DMDE doesn\u2019t give a recoverability estimate. In my review, DMDE Free restored all 55 files in my folder, but none of the images in subfolders. I\u2019d need the paid version to get everything in one pass.\n\nAs a workaround, I switched to raw recovery, which ignores my folder structure and groups restored files by type. With this trick, I got 162 of 165 files, but with randomly generated numeric filenames.\n\nThe paid version of DMDE managed to restore all my HDD files, but the first letter of each folder was replaced with an underscore \u201c_\u201d symbol.\n\nSolid-state drive (SSD) recovery is almost impossible and neither app could restore a single file in these tests. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro is only app I\u2019ve tested that has successfully undeleted SSD files, which might have been due to lucky timing.\n\nSupport\n\nRecuva has a very limited help center and only offers email support to subscribers. The app has been around for decades, so your best bet is a web search if you need help with the free version.\n\nDMDE doesn\u2019t restrict help to paying customers, giving it an edge against Recuva. Support is via email, so it could take up to 24 hours to get a reply. DMDE\u2019s resource center features tutorials, a manual, and an FAQ so you can get answers faster.\n\nPopular data recovery apps like Disk Drill Pro offer live chat support, but cost more.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nThere\u2019s no need to upload data to recover files, so your files will remain private. However, if you email support or subscribe, your email address and financial information will be on record. That means cybersecurity is worth considering.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of a data breach at DMDE, but the developer of Recuva, CCleaner has had some issues. CCleaner has been hit by three major data breaches, one as recent as 2023.\n\nWhich data recovery app is right for you?\n\nThe free versions of Recuva and DMDE are both effective with HDD file recovery. While DMDE restored more data in my tests, it requires multiple passes to get back folders. Recuva is easier to use, but couldn\u2019t find as many missing files.\n\nWhile you could download and run both, HDD scans can be time-consuming, so it\u2019s better to pick one. If you absolutely can\u2019t pay to restore missing files, Recuva has the better free app.\n\nHowever, DMDE\u2019s $20 and Recuva\u2019s $25 annual subscription prices are incredibly affordable. If you\u2019re going to the trouble of scanning and restoring files, it\u2019s worth saving yourself time and effort at such a low cost.\n\nIf your photos, videos, documents, and other files are worth $20, I\u2019d recommend DMDE Express over Recuva Professional. If you anticipate needing to recover files in the future, a one-time purchase of DMDE Standard costs just $48 to use it on your Windows PC, Mac, or Linux computer forever.\n\nThat\u2019s why DMDE is high on our list of the best data recovery software.

            "article_content": "The major tech companies have had a fraught relationship with federal regulators in recent years, with politicians from both parties finding different reasons to try and loosen their power and influence. Google is currently fighting against a recent court ruling that found it has an illegal monopoly on search and must divest its Chrome browser. The search giant has been defending itself aggressively in the case, arguing it has plenty of competition in the industry from the likes of OpenAI.\n\nBut a funny thing is that the same companies are happy to cry to the regulators about concerns of unfair or anti-competitive behavior when it\u2019s to their benefit. Case in point, Google has reportedly approached the FTC and asked the agency to end Microsoft\u2019s exclusive deal with OpenAI to provide cloud hosting for ChatGPT. It argues the deal limits competition and potentially could impose higher costs on developers seeking to use ChatGPT APIs in their products. Apparently, tech companies believe anti-competitive behavior does exist in the industry, it\u2019s just not them doing it.\n\nThe Information first reported on the news.\n\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion into OpenAI and in return has gained access to the company\u2019s cutting-edge models as well as served as its exclusive cloud provider through Azure. These types of deals have been referred to as \u201cround-tripping,\u201d as Microsoft is giving OpenAI money that will ultimately go back into its own coffers. On top of the exclusive hosting agreement, Microsoft is also entitled to receive 75% of OpenAI\u2019s profits until it recoups its investment and afterward will still hold its equity in the company.\n\nThe FTC is already investigating Microsoft over its cloud hosting contracts. The regulatory agency is looking into allegations that Microsoft charges customers more to use its suite of services, like Office 365, if they use a different hosting provider, like Google Cloud. Of course, Microsoft software is ubiquitous in the enterprise world. If developers have to use Microsoft Azure in order to access ChatGPT, that would only make it that much harder to use other hosting providers. Google, of course, would likely welcome the opportunity to host ChatGPT, or at least put in a bid to do so.\n\nIn general, the United States prohibits any behavior intended to create a monopoly and harm competition and consumer welfare. The Clayton Act of 1914 in particular prohibits tying arrangements in which exclusive contracts force customers to buy one product in order to get another if those contracts lessen competition.\n\nIn recent years, however, tech companies have been able to argue against breakups by pointing to the fact that many of their services are offered for free or at the greatest convenience to consumers and therefore consumer welfare hasn\u2019t been harmed. The administration under Biden has taken a much different stance on the issue. In the case of Amazon, FTC chairwoman Lina Khan has argued that even though Amazon has historically kept prices low, it has done so in ways that pushed out competitors, such as requiring sellers on its platform to offer it the best price.\n\nGoogle itself has faced intense scrutiny over a\u2014yes\u2014exclusive arrangement with Apple in which it pays tens of billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine in Safari. Smaller competitors like DuckDuckGo have said that makes it nearly impossible to compete, as changing the default search engine is difficult and cumbersome for everyday people. The irony is not hard to notice.\n\nThere\u2019s optimism in Silicon Valley that the new administration will take a more laissez-faire approach to tech, especially as President-elect Trump is filling his cabinet with leaders from Silicon Valley. But it\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll intervene in cases like the one against Google. Republicans still rail against the company\u2014and Big Tech writ large\u2014and believe it has been biased against conservatives. And the original antitrust lawsuit against Google was filed by the Department of Justice under Trump\u2019s first administration."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nFunMap has high functional relevance, deep proteome coverage and a scale-free, modular and small-world network topology. Credit: Nature Cancer (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s43018-024-00869-z\n\nLarge-scale protein and gene profiling have massively expanded the landscape of cancer-associated proteins and gene mutations, but it has been difficult to discern whether they play an active role in the disease or are innocent bystanders.\n\nIn a study published in Nature Cancer, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine revealed a powerful and unbiased machine learning-based approach called FunMap for assessing the role of cancer-associated mutations and understudied proteins, with broad implications for advancing cancer biology and informing therapeutic strategies.\n\n\"Gaining functional information on the genes and proteins associated with cancer is an important step toward better understanding the disease and identifying potential therapeutic targets,\" said corresponding author Dr. Bing Zhang, professor of molecular and human genetics and part of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor.\n\n\"Our approach to gain functional insights into these genes and proteins involved using machine learning to develop a network mapping their functional relationships,\" said Zhang, a member of Baylor's Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center and a McNair Scholar.\n\n\"It's like, I may not know anything about you, but if I know your LinkedIn connections, I can infer what you do.\"\n\nThe team developed FunMap, a functional network of 10,525 genes constructed using a supervised machine learning method that integrates protein datasets and RNA sequencing data from 11 cancer types recently harmonized by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) pan-cancer working group.\n\n\"With FunMap, we found 196,800 associations among 10,525 proteins\u2014a comprehensive and unbiased proteomic coverage and a high level of functional relevance,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Two key differences between our approach and previous gene co-expression network studies are first, the integration of cancer protein data with mRNA expression data and second, the application of supervised machine learning to synergize all datasets to maximize the predictive power. Unexpectedly, our approach outperformed protein\u2013protein interaction networks in discriminating between functionally relevant and irrelevant gene pairs.\"\n\nThrough network analysis, FunMap uncovers protein modules and a hierarchical modular organization linked to cancer hallmarks and clinical characteristics, predicts the functions of understudied cancer proteins, offers deeper insights into established cancer drivers and identifies drivers with low mutation frequency.\n\n\"More than 200 genes are highly overexpressed or under-expressed in cancer, but we know very little about their specific roles in the disease,\" Zhang said. \"When we mapped these genes in our network, we were able to look at the neighborhood and make a prediction about their function.\"\n\nFor example, the expression of the understudied gene MAB21L4 is significantly below normal in three types of cancer tumors. FunMap showed that this gene's network neighborhood is enriched for genes associated with epithelial cell differentiation, the suppression of which plays a critical role in tumor progression.\n\nClinical tumor grading data, together with a recent study showing that loss of MAB21L4 blocks differentiation to drive the development of squamous cell carcinoma, provide strong evidence to support a tumor suppressor role of MAB21L4.\n\nMoreover, leveraging cutting edge deep learning methods with FunMap uncovered numerous previously unrecognized cancer drivers with low mutation frequencies, including a novel tumor suppressor role for LGI3, supported by gene knockout experimental data.\n\nThis study highlights the great potential of integrating machine learning and proteogenomic profiling to gain a deeper understanding of complex cancer systems. By generating a comprehensive functional network, this approach provides a robust framework for cancer functional genomics research, offering valuable insights into mutations and cancer-associated proteins.\n\n\"These findings can greatly aid in prioritizing targets for clinical translation, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective cancer therapies,\" Zhang said.\n\nMore information: Mapping the functional network of human cancer through machine learning and pan-cancer proteogenomics, Nature Cancer (2024).

We\u2019re just escalating this war and making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done.\u201d\n\nMr Biden, the outgoing president, took the decision last month on the use of Atacms rockets within Russia by Ukrainian forces.\n\nDonald Trump is Time\u2019s person of the year for a second time\n\nKyiv had begged Washington for months for permission for such long-range strikes but was repeatedly rebuffed because of fears over escalation.\n\nThe White House eventually agreed to the long-running request in response to North Korean soldiers being deployed on the battlefield by Moscow.\n\nIt also prompted Britain and France to drop restrictions on the use of their Storm Shadow and Scalp-eg cruise missiles on military targets inside Russia.\n\nAlmost immediately after the first strikes occurred on Russian soil, Vladimir Putin threatened the use of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile against Ukraine in a retaliatory strike.\n\nThe Russian president eventually made a televised address to announce that the Oreshnik missile had been used for the first time in an attack on a weapons production plant in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.\n\nUS officials on Wednesday warned that Russia could be preparing to fire another hypersonic ballistic missile at Ukrainian territory.\n\nTrump plans to end war\n\nThe ongoing jousting between Ukraine and Russia, which invaded its neighbour almost three years ago, has shown no signs of slowing down, despite a pledge by Mr Trump to negotiate an end to the fighting before he takes office on January 21.\n\n\u201cThe level, the number of people dying is number one, not sustainable, and I\u2019m talking on both sides. It\u2019s really an advantage to both sides to get this thing done,\u201d the Republican said in the interview.\n\nMr Trump has repeatedly claimed he would stop the war through diplomatic negotiations with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin.\n\nHe has not yet revealed how he plans to bring the warring capitals to the table, but has appointed a peace envoy who once proposed curbing weapons deliveries to Kyiv as leverage.\n\nThere have also been reports that suggest Mr Trump will demand a European peacekeeping force, made up of British, French, German and Polish soldiers, to be used to police an 800-mile buffer zone as part of a ceasefire deal.\n\nMr Zelensky on Wednesday rejected the idea of a Christmas truce with Russia after it was proposed by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, who is close to Putin.\n\nThe Ukrainian last week travelled to Paris, where he met with Mr Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron to discuss potential solutions to end the war.\n\nTrump pledges not to \u2018abandon\u2019 Ukraine\n\nSince Mr Trump\u2019s election victory in November, Mr Zelensky has been on the charm offensive, doing all he can to play to the president-elect\u2019s ego.\n\nThis included him praising Mr Trump as one of the only leaders feared by Putin, in an online criticism of Mr Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nMr Macron subsequently travelled to Poland on Thursday to reportedly discuss plans to send European soldiers to Ukraine after the end of the war with prime minister Donald Tusk.\n\nIt is understood Mr Trump sees no role for American troops in any peacekeeping force, as part of his campaign to force Europe to do more to defend itself.\n\nHowever, he pledged not to \u201cabandon\u201d Ukraine in his planned negotiations with Putin amid fears he could force Kyiv into a sub-optimal peace deal.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t reach an agreement if you abandon, in my opinion,\u201d the president-elect said.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou know, this is a war that\u2019s been \u2014 this is a tragedy. This is death that\u2019s far greater than anyone knows.

            "article_content": "The world saw a staggering surge in conflicts over the past year. At least 233,000 people were estimated to be killed in conflicts in 2024, according to new data released Thursday by a prominent nonprofit analysis and crisis mapping project. The data, released today by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), shows in raw numbers how the level of conflicts around the world have doubled over the past five years, amid wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Myanmar and elsewhere.\n\nAmong the data for this year, ACLED found that the number of people killed in conflicts in 2024 had grown by 30 percent since the preceding year, from 179,099 deaths in 2023 to 233,597 in 2024.\n\nThe war in Ukraine was the deadliest in 2024, with 67,000 reported deaths, while 35,000 deaths were reported in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the end of the year, the number of acts of violence recorded by ACLED is projected to reach almost 200,000, a quarter higher than last year and double what it was five years ago, with sharp increases found in Lebanon (958 percent), as Israel staged a large-scale military intervention, and Russia (349 percent), which has seen more attacks amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe violence has remarkable reach. One in 8 people worldwide were exposed to conflict in 2024, ACLED found. Those living within five kilometers or less of conflict count as exposed. Palestinians face the highest level of violence in the world, according to the data, with 81 percent of the population exposed to conflict.\n\nThe peak may still be ahead. Clionadh Raleigh, a professor of political geography and conflict at the University of Sussex and founder of ACLED, said that she expected global conflict to continue its rise, pointing to \u201cpossible violent surges\u201d in Iran, Chad, Ecuador and Pakistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world may be entering a \u201cnew normal\u201d of conflict, said Paul Poast, a professor at the University of Chicago who tracks global violence and was not involved in drafting the ACLED report.\n\nThat would have political implications in the United States, where President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to \u201cstop war.\u201d Trump \u201cclaimed that he is going to solve all of these conflicts as soon as he enters office (if not before),\u201d Poast said. \u201cIndeed, it stood out to me that during his victory speech on election night, the first thing he mentioned was ending all of the world\u2019s conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe data over the past few years paints an unsettling picture: Few regions saw a decline in conflict, while both Europe and the Middle East saw major escalations. Research by other groups describes the same trend. This summer, a report put out by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace identified 56 active conflicts taking place at that time, which it said was the most since the end of World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe founding hope of the United Nations, international peace is an increasingly distant prospect, as the trend builds over consecutive years.\n\nHigh levels of conflict worldwide have multiple and complex causes, including choices made by world leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. But there have also been global shifts in the way that conflicts are fought, according to the data collected by ACLED.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, conflict became more urbanized and concentrated, and the same places and communities have been attacked several times over,\u201d Raleigh said, adding that the world had seen a 300 percent increase in the use of bombing over the past five years.\n\nThe widespread use of missiles, drones and explosives by governments has added further to the levels of conflict, Raleigh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome conflicts appeared to be tied to electoral politics, according to the ACLED data, with countries that held elections seeing a more significant rise in violence. Roughly 80 countries, together holding more than half of the world\u2019s population, held national elections in 2024.\n\nThe conflict data tracks incidents of what the authors call political violence \u2014 defined to including battles, bombings and other violent acts \u2014 and excludes nonviolent protest. ACLED notes it also recorded more than 143,000 protests in 2024.\n\nThe ongoing breakdown in global order and rising multipolarity, a world system in which power is more widely distributed, with global bodies such as the United Nations Security Council paralyzed, has led to major powers \u201casserting their regional influence and undermining one another,\u201d Poast said. U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the state of affairs as a \u201cpurgatory of polarity,\u201d in an address to the General Assembly in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nACLED, which has operated for as a nonprofit for just over a decade, collects its data through media monitoring as well as partnerships with international and local organizations. It aims to give a big picture view of trends in armed conflict through the collection of granular, detailed data.\n\nIn the year ahead, some of the conflicts could ease \u2014 particularly the war in Ukraine and fighting across in the Middle East. Some countries, like Madagascar, have seen a prolonged decline in political violence over recent years, according to ACLED.\n\nBut ACLED is predicting a 20 percent increase in conflict next year amid numerous regions of concern, including Colombia and Mexico, along with several areas of Africa like the Sahal and the Great Lakes region. The Middle East remains in a period of great uncertainty, while the risk of new wars involving China or Russia cannot be ruled out."

            "article_content": "In August 2000, Intel briefly had a market value of $509 billion (more than $930 billion in 2024 dollars). It was the most valuable public company and the \u201cplatform leader\u201d in the personal computer industry along with Microsoft. At the start of December 2024, Intel\u2019s value stood at $104 billion (after falling under $100 billion), far below Microsoft ($3.1 trillion) and Apple ($3.6 trillion). Nvidia ($3.4 trillion) became the new leader in semiconductors, rivaling Apple in market value. Intel also had fallen behind long-time rival AMD ($222 billion) as well as Broadcom ($176 billion), Qualcomm ($174 billion), and ARM ($141 billion). Then we have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, valued at $958 billion. Intel microprocessors, also called central processing units (CPUs), have powered DOS-based and then Windows PCs since IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981. Intel later used this architecture to dominate datacenter servers. However, PC sales have matured, and datacenters are increasingly running generative AI software on Nvidia graphical processing units (GPUs). In October 2024, Intel announced huge restructuring charges and the largest quarterly loss in the company\u2019s history\u2014$16.6 billion\u2014as well as layoffs of 16,500 employees.11 Intel also canceled its dividend and fielded at least one acquisition offer.2 In November 2024, Nvidia replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Stock Index.5 How did Intel\u2019s \u201cfall from grace\u201d happen? What should managers learn from this story? I have followed Intel as well as Microsoft and Apple closely since the early 1990s. The business media and several former Intel directors also have weighed in on Intel\u2019s struggle and options.21 What happened to Intel falls into two \u201cbuckets.\u201d One involves the challenge of dominating a highly profitable market without having the foresight, ability, or flexibility to adapt to new technologies and customers (for example, mobile and AI) as they emerged. A second relates to the consequences of maintaining a strategic commitment (such as in-house manufacturing) that has become outdated. Intel\u2019s determination to keep making its own microprocessors had been an advantage, but it became a liability as advanced semiconductor manufacturing evolved into a highly specialized capability, separable from design.\n\nPlatform Leadership: The Blessing and the Curse Andy Grove, while Intel CEO from 1987 to 1998, laid out a platform strategy aimed at growing the entire PC ecosystem, with Intel\u2019s x86 microprocessors and Microsoft\u2019s operating systems at the center.13,14 Driving ecosystem growth was Moore\u2019s Law, which inspired the creation of Intel as well as Microsoft and Apple. In 1965, while working for Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore looked at several years of data. He observed that semiconductor devices were doubling in power (number of transistors on a silicon wafer) every year or so. Looking forward, he reasoned that computers would someday be cheap and ubiquitous. Moore and Bob Noyce\u2014coinventor of the integrated circuit\u2014founded Intel in 1968 with venture capitalist Arthur Rock precisely to keep pushing forward Moore\u2019s Law and master the mass production of increasingly powerful semiconductor devices. In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen came to the same conclusion that computers would someday be everywhere and established Microsoft to \u201cproductize\u201d (write once, sell a million times) the software programming languages and then other basic programs that all personal computers would need to be useful. In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak came to the same conclusion and co-founded Apple, convinced that, since computers were going to be everywhere, the user interface should be as easy to use as any consumer appliance. This conviction led to the Apple II (1977) and later the Macintosh (1984).6,22 Grove\u2019s intention was for Intel to develop and share technology for software applications such as telephony, faxing, videoconferencing, and multimedia processing on the PC that would keep generating demand for ever-more-powerful microprocessors. Intel also designed technologies such as universal serial bus (USB) to make it easier for manufacturers to connect their peripherals.13 These \u201ccomplementary innovations\u201d and some five million software applications by the mid-1990s entrenched Windows-Intel (\u201cWintel\u201d) as the dominant platform for desktop computing.7 Microsoft and Intel maintained 85% to 95% of this PC market for decades, and still claim over 70%. During 2005-2007, Intel also managed to convince Apple to switch from IBM\u2019s PowerPC to Intel chips, which improved the Macintosh\u2019s processing power as well as interoperability with Windows files. When growth in mobile devices started to take off in the 2000s, Microsoft and Intel were left behind. Windows required too large a screen interface and Intel microprocessors consumed too much power. Enter Steve Jobs! After having lost the PC platform battle, Apple revived its fortunes with the iPod and iTunes for Windows (2003) and then the iPhone (2006). Other firms such as ARM, Qualcomm, and Samsung came to dominate semiconductors for mobile platforms, while Google offered a free operating system, Android. Before AMD and ARM server designs ate into its market share, Intel provided as much as 90% of data-center CPUs and still accounted for over 75% of new shipments in 2024. However, Intel gradually fell behind in manufacturing technology, and this impacted performance of its core microprocessors. Most telling here is Apple\u2019s decision in 2019 to abandon Intel as a supplier for MacBook and desktop computers and, instead, shift to its own in-house chips. Apple chose the reduced instruction-set ARM architecture, which uses less battery power.1 Apple also boasted that its own chips, made by TSMC, had higher performance and quality than Intel\u2019s.12 Microsoft has fared much better than Intel. Both struggled with the transition to mobile devices and cloud computing, and Microsoft\u2019s stock price stagnated before Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014. Nonetheless, users still purchased computers bundled with Windows as well as Office, and the Azure cloud service gradually won over lucrative enterprise customers. And, unlike what Intel faced in manufacturing, the marginal cost of reproducing software and automated digital services is close to zero, even though datacenters are expensive. More recently, Microsoft has incorporated artificial intelligence and machine learning into its products and services, and since 2019 has invested an estimated $13 billion in OpenAI to bolster these capabilities.15 Intel purchased Israel\u2019s Habana Labs in 2019 for $2 billion to accelerate its own AI and GPU chip development, though this decision clashed with another acquisition made several years earlier.16 Most difficult for Intel (and other competitors) to overcome has been Nvidia\u2019s advantage in both hardware and software, like Intel and Microsoft combined have had for the PC platform. First, there is the proprietary Nvidia GPU architecture, which processes thousands of simple instructions in parallel, originally designed for graphics but perfect for running neural-network software. Second, there is Nvidia\u2019s huge investment in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming tools and libraries, which are free but work only with Nvidia GPUs. Both innovations date to 2006, giving Nvidia an enormous lead.8 In response, Intel and AMD have made their GPU SDKs open-source, but it will take years for them and the open source community to develop enough software assets to compete effectively with Nvidia.9"

If you want to write it out, it\u2019s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.\n\n\"This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.\"\n\nApparently, all these wires help to draw information from parallel universes (Google)\n\nAdvert\n\nProfessor Deutsch is a physicist at the University of Oxford, and is known for his work in quantum computing after putting in research during the 1990s, supporting Neven's claims.\n\nSkeptics cast doubts\n\nHowever, some doubters say that these claims about its performance are based on the company's own benchmark to measure quantum performance, and that it doesn't prove that people in parallel universes are getting our information for us.\n\nThe development of Willow and the scientific findings behind it have been published in the journal, Nature."

            "article_content": "Google captivated the tech world Monday with Willow, a new quantum chip that outperformed even the world\u2019s best supercomputer on an advanced test, and experts say this week\u2019s revelations are just the start of a new phase in cutting-edge computing.\n\nThe new chip, which wowed even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, can complete in five minutes a complex computation that would take the most powerful supercomputer 10 septillion years\u2014more than the estimated age of the universe, wrote Hartmut Neven, the founder and leader of Google Quantum AI, in a blog post.\n\nGoogle researchers were also able to prove for the first time that the chip\u2019s errors did not increase proportionately as the number of qubits, the basic information processing unit in a quantum computer, rises. The qubits in quantum computing are more prone to mistakes than a regular computer because they are highly sensitive to electromagnetic and other forms of interference and can only remain in a quantum state for very brief periods of time.\n\nBut in order for a quantum chip\u2019s calculations to make sense, it needs to have a very low error rate, Javad Shabani, a physics professor and director of the Center of Quantum Information Physics at New York University, told Fortune.\n\nGoogle\u2019s breakthrough is \u201cone of the highlights of the recent decade,\u201d he said, and could mean quantum computers are a step closer to being used for more practical purposes.\n\n\u201cClassical\u201d supercomputers, including the Frontier supercomputer, which is commonly recognized as among the most powerful, are used for advanced modeling and simulations. Yet, these supercomputers are more similar to the common laptop than you\u2019d think. They operate on the binary system of 0s and 1s that less powerful computers use, albeit at a much more advanced level. While supercomputers are undoubtedly powerful, they are huge pieces of machinery that use massive amounts of energy for cooling systems.\n\nQuantum chips like Willow operate on a much smaller scale. The qubits that make up these high-powered chips are roughly the size of an atom, and operate via the rules of quantum mechanics. The chips pack a computing punch at a minuscule level and with potentially better energy efficiency than supercomputers, but they\u2019re also limited in their uses.\n\nThe test Google ran on Willow is a \u201cbenchmark\u201d meant to show the quantum chip\u2019s capability relative to other systems, including the best existing supercomputers. Google in 2019 completed a benchmark test with its earlier Sycamore quantum chip and found at the time that the older chip could complete a calculation in 200 seconds that would take the best supercomputers thousands of years to complete, according to a blog post at the time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Willow chip has around double the qubits used to power its computing than that of the Sycamore chip, and exponentially more computing power than a supercomputer has for some uses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Willow findings show that quantum computers can perform much better than the best available supercomputers in certain cases, an assertion that just a few years ago was more widely doubted. It also possibly shifts the focus of future quantum chip development away from primarily trying to find a way to reduce errors to, instead, trying to increase the number of qubits that make up each chip, according to Rice University physics and astronomy professor and founder of the Rice Quantum Initiative Kaden Hazzard.\n\nGoogle\u2019s discovery is groundbreaking, but that doesn\u2019t mean your standard laptop will be replaced by a quantum computer anytime soon, Hazzard told Fortune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at least a few years away before we reach the kind of capabilities where the quantum computer can be used directly for things that have business applications, for example,\u201d Hazzard said.\n\nFears about Willow having the capacity to decrypt even the most advanced encryptions used in banking or tech are also overblown, Rice University assistant professor of computer science Tirthak Patel told Fortune. Solving such advanced cryptography would require a much more advanced chip than Willow, said Patel, and researchers are already finding ways to create quantum-proof encryptions.\n\nInstead, Willow is a stepping stone toward greater progress in quantum computing. Monday\u2019s findings confirmed it outperforms supercomputers in some cases and will do lots to convince naysayers of the potential quantum computing has to eventually help improve human lives, Patel said.\n\nStill, while it may be several years away, advanced quantum computing could be used to accurately simulate minuscule quantum systems like chemical reactions that could help discover new drugs, or solve quantum mechanical problems to build new types of materials or better catalysts for reactions, said Hazzard.\n\nPossibly sooner, the advanced computing ability of quantum chips could help improve weather predictions or streamline supply-chain efficiency, all while being potentially less energy-intensive than existing supercomputers, Patel said.\n\nBecause these types of applications can already run on quantum chips with fewer qubits and without the advanced error reduction that Google has shown is possible, better quantum chips could revolutionize these areas, said Patel.\n\n\u201cThe biggest task right now that most scientists and engineers working in the quantum computing field are concerned with is demonstrating the utility and practicality of quantum computing for different real-world applications,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhile this experiment hasn\u2019t done that just yet, it is a major milestone in that step.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
