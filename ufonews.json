            "article_content": "The rising panic over mystery drones swarming the skies of Mid-Atlantic states reminds us that, in the centuries-long hunt to identify UFOs, humans are usually the weakest link. America has real national security challenges in the new era of unmanned aerial vehicles in warfare. But an invasion of mystery drones over New Jersey isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAs it turns out, just as eyewitnesses often bungle the details of, say, a car accident on the corner, we are notoriously unreliable when it comes to identifying and reporting UFOs. A huge percentage of \u201csightings\u201d turn out, upon investigation, to be the planet Venus or other surprisingly bright astronomical phenomena; people on the ground regularly misjudge distances in the sky so that even objects miles away are perceived to be close by.\n\nThe UFO mistaken-identity problem is a big part of the reason that the military and scientists now refer to such sightings more precisely as UAP, or unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 a label meant to capture that many sightings might not be \u201cobjects\u201d at all but are more likely to be known, or as yet unknown, astronomical and atmospheric phenomena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven skilled aviators make mistakes. On Oct. 1, 1948, Lt. George Gorman, a World War II veteran and pilot in the North Dakota Air National Guard, gave chase in his P-51 fighter after spotting the bright light of a UFO race past him in the skies over Fargo. At speeds of over 400 mph, he engaged it in a dogfight for nearly 30 minutes, the ball-shaped UFO bobbing and weaving around him as it executed turns that he felt were aerodynamically impossible. He finally broke off the engagement, never identifying the bogey. \u201cJust when we were about to collide, I guess I got scared,\u201d he told investigators, adding later: \u201cIt is hard to believe your own eyes when something with no wings walks off and leaves you standing still.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later determined that Gorman had been chasing a weather balloon launched about 10 minutes before he spotted it. The balloon had simply been floating along in the night sky, and he\u2019d been diving and racing all around it.\n\nJ. Allen Hynek, the astronomer and godfather of \u201cufology,\u201d who spent a quarter-century working with the Air Force on its UFO studies and coined the phrase \u201cclose encounters of the third kind,\u201d told an interviewer late in his career, \u201cPilots have been known to swerve their planes violently when they suddenly encounter a very bright meteor they think is on a collision course, but which later proves to have been 50 to 100 miles away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people who are serious about studying UAP are trying to get humans out of the reporting loop: At a congressional hearing last summer, Ryan Graves \u2014 a former Navy aviator who had his own experiences encountering UAP and now leads an advocacy organization called Americans for Safe Aerospace \u2014 proposed a more reliable alternative to the grainy, black-and-white (but supposedly revealing) photos that dot the internet: sensors. Similarly, Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb, one of the leading voices in UAP studies, argues that we need to far better understand what a \u201cregular\u201d sky looks like before trying to determine what\u2019s \u201canomalous.\u201d As Loeb told me last year: \u201cTrust in data. People are a waste of time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the self-centered confidence that underlies so many UFO reports, that people\u2019s first instinct upon spotting a bright, moving light in the night sky is not to assume the obvious \u2014 say, a star, meteor, satellite or faraway jetliner \u2014 but instead to imagine that, after an alien craft journeyed thousands of light-years across interstellar space to visit Earth, the aliens would pick that moment on a random Tuesday night to reveal themselves to someone on a dark, rural road or in a suburban backyard. Occam\u2019s razor, the useful medieval theory that argues the simplest explanation is usually the best, would tell you that the sound of hoofbeats more likely means horses than zebras.\n\nPartly, that instinct stems from something fundamental. The question \u201cAre we alone?\u201d is one of the three most basic questions that have fascinated humans since the first caveman campfires, a question that ranks alongside \u201cWhat happens after death?\u201d and \u201cIs there a God?\u201d as the most profound and potentially life-altering mysteries we wrestle with. Who wouldn\u2019t want to knock out an answer to one of the Big Three while taking out the garbage late at night?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, our cultural fascination with UFOs stems from the fact that it is a rare area where we can all gaze upon the deepest frontier of knowledge. As an ordinary person, I can\u2019t add much to the already-advanced scientific and mathematical questions of our time: I\u2019m not liable to crack string theory wide open during a weekend barbecue, nor is my tinkering in the garage likely to deliver to humanity the secret to nuclear fusion."

AI matting uses trained models to find edges, which results in a better outcome due to the model \"understanding\" what shape a given object has.\n\nOnline background remover tools are often slow, reduce the quality of the original image, and result with a white background instead of a transparent background. Then you're back to square one in the editing process needing a new background provided by different design tools.\n\nSystem requirements for Mac\n\nAiarty Image Matting is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems.\n\nThe Mac minimum requirement for Intel models is macOS 10.15 and Apple Silicon is macOS 11.

We\u2019ve also recently discovered that the company is working on an AI-powered \u201cCall To-do List\u201d function. In its latest initiative, it looks like we could start seeing AI search suggestions in the Google app on iOS.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhile exploring the Google app on iOS, we noticed something interesting. Sitting neatly in the search box was a new pencil icon. Tapping on this icon opens up a new page with a text box and a few suggestions, as seen in the screenshots below.\n\nWhen you begin typing in this text box, you\u2019ll see the Gemini icon below along with text that reads \u201cGenerate AI suggestions.\u201d Once enough words are in the field, it automatically starts generating suggestions based on your query. You can then select these suggestions to narrow down your search, working like filters.\n\nYou can see an example in the video above where we asked for help buying a gift. The suggestions that were generated provided options for \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201cgift occasion,\u201d and \u201crelationship to recipient.\u201d So you could select \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201cunder $50,\u201d and \u201cbirthday\u201d to get search results for an affordable birthday gift for your friend.\n\nIt appears this feature is still in beta testing, however, as it doesn\u2019t work properly quite yet.

These words reportedly add more details and context to the query, and can act as a filter to show more targeted results. Notably, this feature is not available in either the global version of the app or its beta version, hinting that the company is still developing it.\n\nGoogle App for iOS Could Get a New AI Feature\n\nAccording to an Android Authority report, Google is testing a new AI suggestions feature for its iOS app. The publication found the feature during a teardown of the Google app. A new pencil icon was reportedly added next to the camera and microphone icon in the text field of the app.\n\nAI suggestions feature in Google app for iOS\n\nPhoto Credit: Android Authority\n\nThis pencil icon is said to open the AI suggestions interface for users. In a video recording, the publication showcased how the feature could work. On tapping the pencil icon, a larger full-screen interface with a larger text box opens. When a user begins typing their search query in it, the Gemini icon appears below with the text \u201cGenerate AI suggestions\u201d.\n\nAs per the publication's video, once enough words have been typed to let the AI understand the context, it begins showing related words in three rows (thematically separated) that users can select to filter their search results.\n\nFor instance, if a user types \u201cbuying a birthday gift\u201d, Gemini might generate suggestions where the first row will be words for different budgets, the second row could be words for occasions, and the third could be about the relationship with the person. So, users can select \u201cless than Rs. 5,000\u201d, \u201canniversary\u201d, and \u201cwife\u201d and see search results from websites that offer information on these specific keywords.\n\nAs mentioned above, the feature is reportedly under testing and the publication was not able to get it to work, likely due to the server side of the feature not being active. There is no word on when the feature might be released on iOS, and if an Android version is also in the works."

            "article_content": "If you haven\u2019t heard about the thousands of mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey in recent weeks, you might be living under a rock. Or are you living under \u2026 a drone? Or several of them? Some Maricopa residents believe so.\n\nIt\u2019s a bird! It\u2019s a drone! It\u2019s a cop? Seriously, what are these things?\n\nThe FBI, Department of Homeland Security, state police and other agencies have launched investigations into the recent torrent of inexplicable drone sightings.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said Monday that there has yet to be any public safety or national security risk identified in any of the drone sightings. He said that officials believe they were lawfully flown drones, planes or stars.\n\nBut that seemingly did little to abate UFO anxiety here on the opposite side of the country, where three reported sightings in Maricopa and Hidden Valley have been posted to the social networking site Nextdoor in as many days.\n\nRancho El Dorado resident Marcus Griffin posted Sunday about his own drone sighting.\n\n\u201cI will add to the HYPE: Has anyone ever paid attention to the DRONE activity around Maricopa at night?\u201d Griffin questioned. \u201cI live in the back of [Rancho El Dorado] adjacent to the farmer fields and I see large drones operating on a regular.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Nextdoor user Nevaeh P., who lives on the east side, posted a photo and video of \u201corbs\u201d she saw while on her way to Phoenix.\n\n\u201cI have seen lots of weird stuff in the sky but over the past few years it seems there\u2019s been more and more paranormal activity to the point where it\u2019s not ignorable anymore,\u201d Nevaeh said. \u201cA few hours [after] I recorded this, I went on TikTok, and my feed was overflowing with videos similar to mine. Of course, our phones listen to us, so maybe it was just feeding into my delusions but it\u2019s weird how everyone else in the world is seeing or experiencing the same things!\u201d\n\nThe most recent post came yesterday from a Hidden Valley user who said she had for weeks been hearing about a Standfield drone group flying for several hours at night with detailed sightings.\n\nThe user attached a screenshot sourced from the r/AskLEO (law enforcement officer) subreddit that she said might \u2018explain\u2019 the sightings.\n\n\u201cPinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Eloy Police Department have added drones to patrol and run surveillance for certain investigations,\u201d said the Reddit user u/Nervous_Comb_8047.\n\nInMaricopa contacted the Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office to see if this was accurate.\n\nPCSO spokeswoman Lauren Reimer said the sheriff\u2019s office uses drones for these specific purposes (neither surveillance nor patrol is one of them):\n\nScene documentation to record evidence from a crime scene or traffic accident from above.\n\nDuring active SWAT incidents to monitor suspect activity around and inside a home or building where a suspect is barricaded, as well as to clear the building before, during and/or after a high-risk arrest.\n\nAerial searches to follow or search for a wanted suspect when the perimeter is known, and air support (helicopter) may be far away or unavailable.\n\nSearch and rescue operations when searching for missing or injured hikers, etc.\n\n\u201cPCSO does not use drones for daily patrol operations,\u201d Reimer confirmed.\n\nSo, the next time you see a post about another drone or \u201corb\u201d sighting, or you see one yourself, keep in mind it might just be PCSO trying to keep people safe. Or, hey, it could be aliens."

            "article_content": "The hauntingly beautiful castle in Wales where a 'restless spirit still roams'\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ghosts in this building,\u201d says Dave Phillips, a volunteer tour guide at Margam Castle and part of the Friends of Margam Park.\n\nAnd he isn\u2019t wrong. Visitors to this 19th-century Gothic mansion in Neath Port Talbot have long shared eerie tales of spectral figures, unexplained laughter, and objects that seem to move of their own accord.\n\nFrom the vengeful ghost of a murdered gamekeeper to the echoes of Victorian children\u2019s laughter, Margam Castle has earned its reputation as one of the most haunted places in Britain.\n\nREAD MORE: Fire service issues update after massive blaze at industrial site in Pontardawe\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Boots shoppers snap up half price designer perfume that's 'sophistication in a bottle'\n\nBut the castle\u2019s haunting is just one layer of its story. As Dave explains, \u201cWe\u2019re on a historic site here at Margam, one that has been permanently occupied for at least 4,000 years.\u201d\n\nFrom the Bronze Age through to Roman times, and later the founding of the Cistercian Abbey in the 12th century, this site has seen centuries of human life\u2014and, perhaps, lingering spirits.\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park, a gorgeous 1,000-acre South Wales estate in the Neath Port Talbot region, also known as the 'Dramatic heart of Wales'.\n\nThe castle, built between 1830 and 1840 by architect Thomas Hopper for Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot, is a striking example of Tudor-Gothic architecture. \u201cIf you look up at the ceiling,\u201d Dave points out on tours, \u201cyou\u2019ll see the initials CRMT\u2014Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot\u2014very proud of his ancestry and heritage.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Talbot family owned the estate until 1942 when the castle fell into disrepair following a devastating fire in 1977.\n\nThe council owns the property today, and ongoing restoration work ensures its grandeur is preserved.\n\nDespite the fire\u2019s destruction, many original features remain, from the intricate stone carvings to the elegant stained glass windows, which, as Dave explains, \u201cdate back to when the house was built, almost 200 years ago.\u201d\n\nWhile the castle impresses with its architecture and history, its eerie ghost stories draw in thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.\n\nThe ghost of Robert Scott\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park -Credit:Robert Melen\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott, a gamekeeper who was murdered on the estate\u2014some say by a poacher, others by an escaped convict. His presence is said to rage through the castle and the estate to this day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nScott is frequently spotted making a determined ascent up the Gothic staircase that leads to the Castle. His presence is a recurring theme among psychic investigators, who all agree that his spirit seethes with fury, unable to rest after his untimely and unjust death.\n\nAfter nightfall, the castle\u2019s security guards report the unsettling sounds of hurried footsteps and low, chattering voices echoing through the empty halls\u2014though no trace of another soul is ever found.\n\nPsychic investigators have described his presence as one of anger, with inexplicable slamming doors and objects being hurled across rooms attributed to his spirit. Visitors who\u2019ve dared to investigate report an overwhelming sense of dread, as though Scott\u2019s rage still lingers.\n\nChildren\u2019s giggles and mischievous spirits\n\nAnother frequently reported occurrence is the sound of children\u2019s laughter echoing through the castle\u2019s long, empty corridors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVisitors claim to have seen ghostly figures of children in Victorian clothing flitting in and out of rooms, as though playing an eternal game of hide-and-seek. Others describe objects mysteriously moving or disappearing, believed to be the playful antics of these mischievous spirits.\n\nA shadowy blacksmith\n\nThe ghost of a blacksmith is another familiar figure at Margam, often spotted by the groundskeepers and gardeners who maintain the estate.\n\nAt night, security guards on patrol have reported unsettling sounds: hurried footsteps, murmuring voices, and shadows darting across the walls\u2014despite the castle being empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reputedly one of the most haunted places in the United Kingdom,\u201d Dave confirms. While he hasn\u2019t experienced anything personally, the sheer volume of stories visitors and staff share suggests otherwise.\n\nParanormal Activity at Margam Castle\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott -Credit:Getty Images\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe. Reports of cold spots, mysterious orbs of light, and sudden temperature drops are commonplace during overnight ghost vigils. Objects have been known to move independently, while unexplained noises chill even the bravest ghost hunters.\n\nThe spirit of Robert Scott remains the most active, with psychic investigators describing his presence as hostile and overwhelming. Rocks have been thrown during s\u00e9ances, and the sensation of being watched is unnervingly frequent in certain castle areas. For those who dare, Margam offers an experience unlike any other.\n\nGhost Zunters International at Margam Castle\n\nMargam's haunted history made waves across the Atlantic when Ghost Hunters International filmed an episode here for the SyFy Channel.\n\nThe investigation, broadcast to over a million viewers, shone a global spotlight on the site\u2019s paranormal activity, cementing its status as one of Britain\u2019s spookiest destinations.\n\nParanormal investigators used low lux cameras, full spectrum photography and super sensitive recording devices to capture \u201celectronic voice phenomena\u201d which is said to be spirit world voices.\n\nThe enthusiastic American team claimed to have captured on camera the floating figure of a monk wearing a white habit.\n\nAnd they also claimed to have \u201cspoken\u201d with a medieval monk called Brother Tom, seen a \u201cghost\u201d in shadow form of Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot \u2013 the man who commissioned the building of the castle \u2013 and heard the footsteps of Lady Emily Charlotte in the bedroom in which she died almost 100 years ago.\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:Lydia Royce\n\nAttend a ghost hunt\n\nFor those eager to experience the castle\u2019s ghostly atmosphere, Haunting Happenings offers overnight ghost hunts at Margam Castle\u2014a daunting but thrilling prospect.\n\nThese spooky events provide a unique opportunity to search for the spirits that roam the castle\u2019s many haunted rooms. Guests can expect strange light anomalies, loud footsteps echoing on the grand staircase, and sudden, extreme drops in temperature. Few are brave enough to spend time alone in the most active areas of the castle.\n\nThis popular overnight experience includes access to ghost hunting equipment such as EMF Meters and K2 Meters and interactive experiments like glass divination, table tipping, and Ouija boards.\n\nThe event features small group s\u00e9ances, ghost hunting vigils, and even free time to explore the castle\u2019s shadows alone. Teas and coffees are provided to keep spirits\u2014of the living variety\u2014high during the night.\n\nWhy visit Margam Castle?\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:South Wales Evening Post\n\nWhile the ghost stories are reason enough for many visitors, Margam Castle is also a gorgeous architectural gem surrounded by natural beauty. Dave Phillips says, \u201cThere\u2019s a story to be told here, from the stationing of American soldiers during World War II to visits from historical figures like Admiral Lord Nelson and General Dwight Eisenhower.\u201d\n\nMargam Country Park offers more than ghostly tales. From scenic walks and historic ruins to mountain biking trails and paddleboarding, there are plenty of activities for the whole family.\n\nFor those brave enough, ghost tours and overnight vigils provide the perfect opportunity to experience Margam\u2019s supernatural side firsthand.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re drawn by its history, beauty, or the chilling possibility of encountering one of its many spirits, Margam Castle is well worth a stop. But as the shadows lengthen and the night falls, keep your ears open\u2026 you might hear laughter where no one stands or footsteps where no one walks.\n\nNeed to know"

            "article_content": "Polygon readers enjoyed our list of last year\u2019s best anime openings so much, we\u2019re doing it again! So, with that in mind, we\u2019ve once again compiled a list of this year\u2019s best opening sequences, highlighting the most bop-worthy title tracks and the amazing artists who brought them to life on screen.\n\nDan Da Dan \u2014 \u2018Otonoke\u2019\n\nDirector: Abel G\u00f3ngora\n\nMusic by: Creepy Nuts\n\nDan Da Dan quickly asserted itself as one of this year\u2019s best anime when it premiered in theaters in September, followed by its television debut in October. Aside from its inherently zany premise of a misfit couple of high school classmates battling against an inexplicable deluge of paranormal and extraterrestrial adversaries, the anime also boasted one of this year\u2019s most striking opening sequences.\n\nAbel G\u00f3ngora, the Spanish animator and director known for his work on last year\u2019s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, the 2021 Star Wars: Visions short \u201cT0-B1,\u201d and the title sequence for 2020\u2019s Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!, delivers a visually bristling cinematic experience with Dan Da Dan\u2019s opening titles. Packed with extreme close-ups, psychedelic colors, and black silhouettes that pay homage to the opening of 1966\u2019s Ultraman, G\u00f3ngora is as bizarre and hard to forget as the anime itself. Combined with an infectiously hyperactive track by Japanese hip-hop duo Creepy Nuts, and you\u2019ve got an opening sequences for the ages.\n\nOne Piece \u2014 \u2018UUUUUS!\u2019\n\nDirector: Megumi Ishitani\n\nMusic by: Hiroshi Kitadai\n\nMegumi Ishitani is popularly considered by One Piece fans to be one of the best directors to ever work on the series. Known for her standout work as an episode director on episodes 957, 982, and 1,015 of the Wano Country Arc, as well as the \u201cOne Piece Fan Letter\u201d episode produced to celebrate the anime\u2019s 25th anniversary, Ishitani is recognized for her cinematic sensibilities when it comes to scale, pacing, and lighting.\n\nAll of those qualities are on full display in the series\u2019 26th opening sequence, which combines expressive \u201crubber hose animation,\u201d bright colors, and deft editing that complements the pacing of Hiroshi Kitadai\u2019s rousing track \u201cUUUUUS!\u201d Ishitani\u2019s opening is yet another stunning accomplishment in the director\u2019s nascent career, and a thrilling sequence that carries the torch of One Piece\u2019s legacy proudly forward.\n\nMashle: Magic and Muscles \u2014 \u2018Bling-Bang-Bang-Born\u2019\n\nDirector: Shun Enokido\n\nMusic by: Creepy Nuts\n\nCreepy Nuts were on a hot streak all throughout 2024. Before delivering the anime bop of the fall season with Dan Da Dan\u2019s aforementioned opening track \u201cOtonoke,\u201d Japanese hip-hop duo DJ Matsunaga and rapper-singer R-Shitei blew the door off the hinges with their track \u201cBling-Bang-Bang-Born\u201d for the second season of Mashle: Magic and Muscles.\n\nTo the tell the truth, Shun Enokido\u2019s opening animation is fine\u2026 but, well, just fine. It\u2019s obvious that Creepy Nuts\u2019 track is pulling most of the weight here, as the sequence itself is composed almost entirely of montage shots sharply contrasted with stark primary colors and split-screen transitions. The song really popped off on social media, with TikTok users creating mashups of the track and dancing in rhythm to the beat.\n\nMetallic Rouge \u2014 \u2018Rouge\u2019\n\nDirector: Motonobu Hori\n\nMusic by: Yu-ka\n\nOf all the anime openings to air in 2024, Metallic Rouge\u2019s took me by surprise. If I had a list of things I had expected to see and hear this year, an anime opening inspired by \u201980s new jack swing would not have been one of them. Nevertheless, Yu-ka\u2019s track \u201cRouge\u201d absolutely rocks. Series director Motonobu Hori combines sci-fi iconography and blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it foreshadowing to create an opening that\u2019s as evocative as it is entertaining to watch.\n\nDelicious in Dungeon \u2014 \u2018Sleep Walking Orchestra\u2019\n\nDirector: Yoshihiro Miyajima\n\nMusic by: Bump of Chicken\n\nEverything about Delicious in Dungeon\u2019s opening makes the audience feel like they\u2019re about to embark on an adventure. Bump of Chicken\u2019s \u201cSleep Walking Orchestra\u201d sets the tone perfectly, with a rousing melody played on a hammered dulcimer paired with Irish flute before transitioning into a thumping drum kick and whimsical rhythm guitar section. Yoshihiro Miyajima, the director of Delicious in Dungeon\u2019s first season, does an excellent job introducing viewers who aren\u2019t already familiar with Ryoko Kui\u2019s fantasy manga to its characters and universe. All in all, it\u2019s a lighthearted beat that beckons the audience to come along for the ride.\n\nThe Elusive Samurai \u2014 \u2018Plan A\u2019\n\nDirector: Miyuki Kuroki\n\nMusic by: DISH//"

Bones with slicing cuts, as if someone had butchered the skin around them.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the remains found in a shaft at the Charterhouse Warren Farm in southwest England have been a blip in British archaeological history. Discovered by cave explorers in 1970, the collection of mismatched bones seemed to be just another Bronze Age gravesite \u2014 a few victims scattered among sediment and animal skeletons.\n\nNow, a recent study published in the Cambridge University journal Antiquity suggests a stunningly grim saga played out at Charterhouse Warren, at far greater scale than previously thought: The bones belong to at least 37 men, women and children who were slaughtered and possibly eaten in a ceremonial feast after their massacre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us all aback. It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

There\u2019s pressure to get a deal done; reportedly, OpenAI must change its corporate structure within two years or the $6.6 billion the company recently raised will convert to debt.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a nonprofit and a for-profit in one corporate structure, and we\u2019re thinking about how to reconfigure that,\u201d OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor said at Axios\u2019 AI+ Summit in San Francisco on Tuesday.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman founded OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015 alongside several AI researchers and entrepreneurs. By 2018, struggling to raise enough capital to fuel their ambitions, some within the group agreed to a new corporate structure: a for-profit OpenAI able to take on investors while still answering to the nonprofit board."

The upgrade is one of a number of new features being rolled out to OpenAI's developer customers starting today.\n\nOpenAI announced during a livestream today that the new o1 model would bring back many of the \"core features you've been missing\" from the API during o1-preview. This includes the ability to use developer messages to help guide your particular chatbot (i.e. \"You are a helpful assistant for tax professionals.\") and access to a \"reasoning effort\" parameter that tells the API how long to think about specific queries, saving time and money on simple problems so they can be used on the tougher ones. API users can also use visual information like scans of documents as input.\n\nOpenAI also highlighted improvements to the new API's use of internal function calling, where the OpenAI model decides to call functions pre-written by outside developers to generate answers to certain queries, when appropriate. The new API is also more accurate in its use of structured outputs, which use a JSON schema to present information in a specific format outlined by the developer, OpenAI said.\n\nThe o1 model uses 60 percent fewer thinking tokens than o1-preview, OpenAI said, generating faster and cheaper results. But those results are also roughly 25 to 35 percentage points more accurate on benchmarks like LiveBench and the AIME, according to OpenAI.\n\nWhile o1 access will start rolling out to tier 5 development customers today, API access to the $200/month o1 Pro model is only promised to be \"coming soon.\""

            "article_content": "What\u2019s Ahead in Generative AI in 2025? (Part One)\n\nPredictions for AI in the coming year.\n\nThe generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom will continue unabated over the next several years. As 2025 approaches, I predict the following key trends in generative AI.\n\nPrediction #1: Expanding Generative AI Usage\n\nAdoption of generative AI will accelerate across business and consumer markets in 2025 and beyond. Already, generative AI features are becoming a key differentiator in enterprise applications in the form of conversational user interfaces, embedded digital assistants, natural-language chatbots, task-oriented copilots, and other large language model (LLM)-powered productivity augmentations.\n\nTDWI research shows that productization of generative AI is starting to gain traction in enterprises. A recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness showed that 30% of organizations have already deployed the technology or have expressed a significant interest in adopting it in the coming year. By the same token, 46% are discussing how generative AI could be useful in their businesses.\n\nPrediction #2: More Transformative Experiences\n\nGenerative AI will transform the experience of more devices, applications, and services in 2025. Already, voice chatbots powered by generative AI are becoming a popular choice for the self-service experience of every app, including no-code business analytics tools.\n\nTDWI research shows that generative AI is rapidly changing how enterprises get work done. A recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that 37% of organizations have already built or are planning to deploy generative AI chatbots for customer support applications, 28% for marketing content generation, 26% for onboarding new employees, and for many other use cases. Over the next several years, we predict that generative AI will democratize many professions as knowledge workers adopt tools that enable them to single-handedly produce sophisticated deliverables that once required highly skilled teams and expensive, time-consuming production processes.\n\nTDWI research also shows that the generative AI application experience will grow more multimodal. In 2025 and beyond, multimodal LLMs will proliferate as developers create more generative AI apps that work with text, image, video, audio, and other data modalities. In the recent TDWI survey on achieving success with modern analytics, 46% of enterprises report either using generative AI text prompting now to generate images and other modalities or plan to do so over the next few years.\n\nPrediction #3: More Sophisticated Platforms and Tools\n\nGenerative AI will be a principal driver in the evolution of enterprise data foundations in 2025.\n\nDemand for multimodal applications of generative AI will drive evolution of enterprise data lakes, data pipelines, data governance, and much more. Likewise, adoption of generative AI will bring such platforms and tools as vector databases, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation into the enterprise mainstream.\n\nIn the coming year, prompt engineering will continue its rapid maturation into a substantial body of proven practices for eliciting the correct output from LLMs and other foundation models.\n\nWithin generative AI development tool sets, embedding libraries will become an essential component for developers to build increasingly sophisticated similarity searches that span a diverse range of data modalities. The recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness shows that 28% of organizations already use or are deploying vector databases to store vector embeddings for use with AI models, while 32% plan to adopt those databases in the next few years.\n\nIn addition, generative AI developers in 2025 will have access to a growing range of tools for no-code development of \u201cagentic\u201d applications that provide autonomous LLM-driven copilot, chatbot, and other functionality and that can be orchestrated over more complex process environments. Agentic workflows, leveraging a new phenomenon known as a \u201clarge action model,\u201d will be a growing focus of intelligent process automation.\n\nPrediction #4: More Diverse Models and Data\n\nDevelopers will have access in 2025 to a growing range of sophisticated models and data for building, training, and optimizing generative AI applications\u2014including both commercial and open-source models.\n\nThe recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that around 25% of enterprises are experimenting with private or public generative AI models, while 17% are building generative AI apps that use company data with pretrained models. The survey also showed that 41% of enterprises are exploring how to use generative AI to build apps that use private data.\n\nOnline cloud marketplaces will become a favorite source of third-party training data for more enterprise AI developers. I also predict that enterprises will increasingly rely on synthetic data generation as an alternative for training generative AI in use cases where authentic source data is either too costly, restricted, or unavailable for their needs.\n\nRead more predictions about AI governance and ROI in Part Two of this article."

            "article_content": "Check Out the Key Software Development Trends That May Emerge in 2025\n\nThe world of software development is evolving at a pace we\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nEach year brings new breakthroughs, fresh approaches, and bold ideas that redefine how we build and interact with technology. By 2025, some trends will reshape the way developers and businesses operate, while others will open up new opportunities we might not even fully grasp yet.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what the future of software development might look like in 2025 and why these trends are worth paying attention to.\n\nGenerative AI: A New Coding Ally\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves all across industries, and in software development, it\u2019s become an essential tool. AI is no longer just an assistant; it\u2019s becoming an indispensable co-developer.\n\nIn 2025, AI-powered tools will:\n\nWrite code faster than ever, taking over repetitive tasks so developers can focus on solving real problems.\n\nDebug software more efficiently, spotting and fixing issues before they even cause disruptions.\n\nEmpower people who aren\u2019t traditional developers to build their own applications using natural language prompts.\n\nThink of AI as a partner that boosts creativity and efficiency for any software development company, and it can make software development not just faster but smarter.\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms: Breaking Down Barriers\n\nImagine a world where you don\u2019t need to know how to code to create software. That is the promise of low-code and no-code platforms, and by 2025, these tools will become even more powerful.\n\nFor businesses, this is a game-changer. They\u2019ll be able to:\n\nBuild complex applications with drag-and-drop simplicity.\n\nSave time and money by reducing reliance on traditional development teams.\n\nCustomize solutions without the usual trade-offs of flexibility versus speed.\n\nAs these platforms evolve, they\u2019ll bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams, making innovation accessible to everyone.\n\nCloud-Native Development Becomes the Norm\n\nThe cloud isn\u2019t just a buzzword anymore - it\u2019s the backbone of modern software. By 2025, cloud-native development will dominate how applications are built.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nServerless technology will take off, letting developers focus on building apps without worrying about managing servers.\n\nEdge computing will complement the cloud, processing data closer to users for lightning-fast performance.\n\nTools like Kubernetes will simplify scaling and managing applications, even for smaller teams.\n\nCloud-native isn\u2019t just about convenience; it\u2019s about delivering better software faster and at scale.\n\nSustainability Will Drive Software Decisions\n\nThe world is becoming more eco-conscious, and software developers are joining the movement. By 2025, sustainability won\u2019t just be an option - it\u2019ll be a priority.\n\nDevelopers and companies will focus on:\n\nWriting energy-efficient code that reduces the environmental impact of software.\n\nPartnering with cloud providers committed to renewable energy.\n\nBuilding tools that help businesses track and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nIn short, green software will be the next big thing, and those who embrace it will be in charge of a more sustainable future.\n\nSecurity as a Core Feature, Not an Afterthought\n\nWith data breaches and cyberattacks on the rise, security is becoming non-negotiable. By 2025, building secure software will be baked into every stage of development.\n\nHere\u2019s how this will look:\n\nDevelopers will adopt a \u201csecure by design\u201d approach, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed early.\n\nThe AI technology will play a bigger role in identifying threats and stopping them in real time.\n\nDevSecOps, which integrates security into development workflows, will become a standard practice.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t just to build software that works but to create systems that users can trust.\n\nQuantum Computing: Peeking into the Future\n\nQuantum computing feels like science fiction, but it\u2019s getting closer to reality. By 2025, we\u2019ll start to see its impact on software development, albeit in niche areas.\n\nFor example:\n\nQuantum algorithms will revolutionize industries like cryptography, logistics, and complex simulations.\n\nDevelopers will experiment with hybrid systems that combine classical and quantum computing.\n\nNew programming tools tailored for quantum systems will begin to gain traction.\n\nWhile still in its early stages, quantum computing offers a glimpse of what\u2019s possible when we push the boundaries of technology.\n\nHyper-Personalized Software Experiences\n\nWe all love it when apps and tools feel like they were made just for us. By 2025, hyper-personalization will be a must-have feature for software.\n\nExpect:\n\nApps that adapt in real time based on your behavior and preferences.\n\nSmarter AI systems that deliver relevant recommendations without feeling intrusive.\n\nA stronger emphasis on privacy, ensuring personalization doesn\u2019t come at the expense of user trust.\n\nThis shift isn\u2019t just about making software better; it\u2019s about making it truly human-centered.\n\nMulti-experience Development: Meeting Users Everywhere\n\nGone are the days when users stuck to one device. Today, people expect seamless experiences across smartphones, smartwatches, AR/VR headsets, and beyond.\n\nBy 2025, multi-experience development will focus on:\n\nDesigning software that works flawlessly on any device.\n\nIntegrating natural inputs like voice commands, gestures, and even biometric data.\n\nEnsure users can switch between devices without losing their place.\n\nThis trend is all about meeting users where they are - and delivering a great experience every time.\n\nEthics Will Take Center Stage\n\nAs technology becomes more powerful, developers are being asked tough questions: Is this ethical? Is it fair? Does it do more good than harm?\n\nBy 2025, we\u2019ll see a stronger push toward ethical software development, including:\n\nEfforts to eliminate bias in AI systems.\n\nTransparent policies on how user data is collected and used.\n\nGuidelines that prioritize inclusivity and fairness.\n\nEthics won\u2019t just be a box to check - it\u2019ll be a guiding principle for how software is built and deployed.\n\nAgile Practices Will Evolve\n\nAgile has been the go-to methodology for years, but it\u2019s constantly evolving. By 2025, it\u2019ll adapt to new challenges and opportunities, with trends like:\n\nBlending Agile with other methodologies like DevOps and Lean.\n\nUsing AI to streamline project management and decision-making.\n\nShifting the focus from delivering features to achieving measurable business outcomes.\n\nAgile\u2019s flexibility will keep it relevant, ensuring teams can adapt to whatever comes next.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe future of software development is exciting, challenging, and full of potential all at the same time. From leveraging the power of AI to building sustainable, secure, and ethical systems, the trends of 2025 promise to shape a smarter and more connected world. For businesses and developers alike, the key is to stay curious, embrace changes, and never stop innovating. The opportunities are endless. Are you ready to be part of the journey?"

Discovered by cave explorers in 1970, the collection of mismatched bones seemed to be just another Bronze Age gravesite \u2014 a few victims scattered among sediment and animal skeletons.\n\nNow, a recent study published in the Cambridge University journal Antiquity suggests a stunningly grim saga played out at Charterhouse Warren, at far greater scale than previously thought: The bones belong to at least 37 men, women and children who were slaughtered and possibly eaten in a ceremonial feast after their massacre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us all aback. It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA quantum circuit (left) is passed to an encoder (top) that creates a feature set for the ML model (right) based on the circuit and the quantum processor unit (QPU) targeted for execution. The executed noisy expectation values serve as the input to the model whose aim is to predict their noise-free value. To achieve this, the model is trained beforehand (bottom, blue highlighted path) against target values of example circuits. These are obtained either using noiseless simulations in the case of small-scale, tractable circuits or using the noisy QPU in conjunction with a conventional error mitigation strategy in the case of large-scale, intractable circuits. The trained model operates without the need for additional mitigation circuits, thus reducing runtime overheads. Credit: Liao et al. Execution and training for tractable and intractable circuits with ML-QEM\n\nQuantum computers have the potential of outperforming classical computers in some optimization and data processing tasks. However, quantum systems are also more sensitive to noise and thus prone to errors, due to the known physical challenges associated with reliably manipulating qubits, their underlying units of information.\n\nEngineers recently devised various methods to reduce the impact of these errors, which are known as quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques. While some of these techniques achieved promising results, executing them on real quantum computers is often too expensive or unfeasible.\n\nResearchers at IBM Quantum recently showed that simple and more accessible machine learning (ML) techniques could be used for QEM. Their paper, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, demonstrates that these techniques could achieve accuracies comparable to those of other QEM techniques, at a far lower cost.\n\n\"We started to think about how to depart from conventional physics-based QEM methods and whether ML techniques can help to reduce the cost of QEM so that more complex and larger-scale experiments could come within reach,\" Haoran Liao, co-first author of the paper, told Phys.org.\n\n\"However, there seemed to be a fundamental paradox: How can classical ML learn what noise is doing in a quantum calculation running on a quantum computer that is doing something beyond classical computers? After all, quantum computers are of interest for their ability to run problems beyond the power of classical computers.\"\n\nAs part of their study, the researchers carried out a series of tests, where they used state-of-the-art quantum computers and up to 100 qubits to complete different tasks. They focused on tasks that are impossible to complete via brute-force calculations performed on classical computers, but that could be tackled using more sophisticated computational methods running on powerful classical computers.\n\n\"This interesting 'paradox' is another motivation for us to think about whether careful designs can tailor ML models to find the complicated relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer to help quantum computations,\" said Liao.\n\nThe primary objective of the recent study by Liao and his colleagues was to accelerate QEM using widely used ML techniques, demonstrating the potential of these techniques in real-world experiments. The team first started experimenting with a complex graph neural network (GNN), which they used to encode the entire structure of a quantum circuit and its properties, yet they found that this model performed not very well.\n\n\"It surprised us to find that a simpler model, random forest, worked very well across different types of circuits and noise models,\" explained Liao.\n\n\"In our exploration of the ML techniques for QEM, we tried to shape and vary the noise to see how different techniques ML or conventional, perform in different scenarios, so we can better understand the capability of ML models in 'learning' the noise\u2013we are not passive bystanders, but active agents.\n\n\"We not only tried to benchmark but also demystify the 'black box' nature of the ML models in the context of learning relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a more powerful quantum computer. \"\n\nTop three panels: Average expectation values from 100-qubit Trotterized 1D TFIM circuits run on the ibm_brisbane QPU. Top panel corresponds to a Clifford circuit, whose ideal, noise-free expectation values are represented by the green dots. The random-forest-mimicking-ZNE (RF-ZNE) curve corresponds to training the random forest (RF) model on zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) and readout-error-mitigated hardware data. This approach enables efficient, low-overhead error mitigation in scenarios where ideal outcomes from classical simulation are infeasible. Bottom panel: The error between ZNE-mitigated and RF-ZNE mitigated expectation values. The approach achieves a 25% reduction in overall and 50% reduction in runtime deployment in terms of quantum resource overhead compared to ZNE, as shown in the inset. Credit: Liao et al.\n\nThe experiments carried out by Liao and his colleagues demonstrate that ML could help to accelerate physics-based QEM. Remarkably, the model that they found to be most promising, known as random forest, is also fairly simple and could thus be easy to implement on a large scale.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the future, they could help to enrich the present understanding of quantum errors, while also potentially improving the accessibility of QEM methods.\n\n\"Is the relationship between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer fundamentally unlearnable? We didn't know the answer,\" said Liao.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons why this would be impossible to determine. However, we showed this key relationship is in fact learnable by ML models in practice. We also showed that we are not passive bystanders, but we can shape the noise in the computation to improve the learnability further.\"\n\nLiao and his colleagues also successfully demonstrated that ML techniques for QEM are less costly, yet they can achieve accuracies comparable to those of alternative physics-based QEM techniques. Their experiments were the first to demonstrate the potential of machine learning algorithms for QEM at a utility scale.\n\n\"Even in the most conservative setting, ML-QEM demonstrates more than a 2-fold reduction in runtime overhead, addressing the primary bottleneck of error mitigation and a fundamentally challenging problem with a substantial leap in efficiency,\" said Liao.\n\n\"Most conservatively, this translates into at least halving experiment durations\u2014e.g., cutting an 80-hour experiment to just 40 hours\u2014drastically reducing operational costs and doubling the regime of accessible experiments.\"\n\nAfter gathering these promising results, Liao and his colleagues plan to continue exploring the potential of AI algorithms for simplifying and upscaling QEM. Their work could inspire other research groups to conduct similar studies, potentially contributing to the advancement and future deployment of quantum computers.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, and we're excited about the field of AI for quantum,\" added Liao. \"We would like to emphasize that at least in the context of QEM, ML is not to replace, but to facilitate physics-based methods, that they can build off each other.\n\n\"This opens the door for what's possible with ML in quantum and is an invitation to the community that ML can perhaps accelerate and improve many other aspects of quantum computations.\"\n\nMore information: Haoran Liao et al, Machine learning for practical quantum error mitigation, Nature Machine Intelligence (2024).

Ukrainian and American officials now say North Korean forces are actively engaged in fighting and taking casualties.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) this week reported at least 30 North Korean troops killed and wounded in Kursk.\n\nOn Tuesday, the GUR said North Korean forces were taking additional security measures to try to blunt the threat of drone strikes.\n\nThis file photo shows North Korean soldiers marching during a rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Sept. 9, 2018. Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"After serious losses, North Korean units began setting up additional observation posts to detect drones of the security and defense forces of Ukraine,\" the GUR wrote in a post to its official Telegram channel.\n\nThe directorate said North Korean troops gather in groups of between 20 and 30 soldiers before launching attacks, moving \"to the concentration area in small groups of up to six servicemen\" and using red tape for identification.\n\n\"The constant accumulation of assault groups by the personnel of the DPRK army in the Kursk region indicates that Moscow does not want to lose the pace of offensive actions,\" the GUR added, using an acronym for the country's official name of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, meanwhile, claimed on Tuesday to have intercepted a phone call between a nurse at a hospital near Moscow and her husband -- a soldier fighting at the front.\n\nIn two days, the nurse said, more than 200 wounded North Korean servicemen were brought to one of the Russian hospitals near Moscow.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier looks through the scope of a rifle on Sept. 11, 2024, in Sudzha, in the Kursk region of western Russia. Global Images Ukraine via Getty\n\n\"Are they elite, these Koreans?\" the nurse asked in the purported recording, which ABC News cannot independently verify. \"We are freeing up certain wards for them.\"\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told a Tuesday briefing that the U.S. assesses \"that North Korean soldiers have engaged in combat in Kursk alongside Russian forces.\"\n\n\"We do have indications that they have suffered casualties, both killed and wounded,\" he added, though declined to provide specific numbers.\n\n\"I would say certainly in the realm of dozens, several dozens,\" Kirby added when pressed. The North Korean forces are now also moving \"from the second line to the front line,\" Kirby said.\n\nAn unnamed senior U.S. official, meanwhile, told the Associated Press that a couple hundred North Korean troops had been killed or wounded while fighting in Kursk.\n\nThis picture taken on Nov. 29, 2024 and released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Nov. 30, 2024 shows North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol and Russia's Defense Minister Andrei Belousov at Pyongyang International Airport. Str/KCNA VIA KNS/AFP via Getty Image\n\nThe North Korean deployment followed more than two years of closer ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, a relationship that previously saw North Korean munitions sent westwards to support Russian operations in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's foreign partners have condemned what White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby called a \"dramatic move.\"\n\nBoth the U.S. and European Union this week introduced additional sanctions on individuals and entities they said are involved in North Korean military assistance to Russia."

Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed by an explosive device that appears to have been hidden in a parked scooter and set off by remote control, Russian state-affiliated media TASS reported. The explosion also killed an aide accompanying him.\n\nKirillov was the head of Russia's radiation, chemical and biological protection troops. Sources told ABC News that the Security Service of Ukraine was behind the killing. Kirillov is the most senior Russian military official assassinated by Ukraine.\n\nInvestigators work near a scooter at the place where Lt. General Igor Kirillov was killed in Moscow, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2024. AP\n\nThe suspect, whose name has not been released, had been recruited by Ukrainian intelligence officers, Russian police said as they announced the arrest.\n\n\"On their instructions, he arrived in Moscow and received an improvised explosive device,\" police said. \"He placed it on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance of the apartment building where Igor Kirillov lived.\"\n\nThe suspect had used a carshare to rent a car and installed a video camera in the vehicle, which was then parked near where the blast went off, police said.\n\nPeople walk outside an apartment building before a blast in which Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov was killed, in Moscow, Russia, in this still image obtained from a social media video on Dec. 17, 2024. Social Media via Reuters\n\n\"The footage from this camera was broadcast online to the organizers of the terrorist attack in the city of Dnipro,\" Russia's Investigative Committee said. \"After a video signal was received about the exit of the servicemen from the entrance, the explosive device was remotely activated by them.\"\n\nRussia's internal intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, or FSB, released a video of a man who they said was the suspect. In the footage, which aired on Russian state TV, the man appears to confess to the killing, saying he had been hired by Ukraine, according to the FSB.\n\nRussia claimed the suspect had been offered payment of $100,000, along with an agreement that he would be given a European passport.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin offered condolences on Wednesday for those who were killed, according to the Kremlin. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the country's law enforcement and intelligence services had been \"working effectively.\"\n\n\"It is once again confirmed that the Kyiv regime does not disdain terrorist methods of work,\" Peskov said. \"We clearly understand who our enemy is, what he is capable of, and this is once again proven by our actions during the special military operation.\"\n\nABC News' Joseph Simonetti, Helena Skinner, David Brennan and Patrick Reevell contributed to this report."

Too often, the most vulnerable\u2014children, the elderly, and the sick\u2014bear the heaviest burden.\n\nYet, this year also marked an important milestone: the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, a cornerstone of IHL that has safeguarded humanity in the face of war since 1949.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions remain as vital today as they were 75 years ago, setting rules that protect civilians, detainees, the wounded, and the sick. They are a testament to the world\u2019s collective determination to place limits on the devastation of war.\n\nThe ICRC's mission has remained steadfast: to protect those affected by conflict and armed violence, promote the rules of war, and ensure that essential services and rights are preserved. Humanity is at the heart of everything we do. In the face of conflict and adversity, we will not waver. In 2025 we will remain committed to standing with those most affected and strive for a world where humanity and compassion prevail, even in the darkest of times."

Dorian Thompson-Robinson has basically no floor except whatever we think the Bengals\u2019 defense provides (which could be somewhat high). Maybe Ford is 15th. My point is he\u2019s not an automatic start.\n\nKendre Miller has a brutal matchup against Green Bay, and we\u2019re not sure Alvin Kamara is even out. If Kamara plays, that\u2019s probably the worst-case scenario for managers of both players. Miller and Kamara will have to contribute mostly as receivers, and they won\u2019t do much in the passing game without Derek Carr as their QB.\n\nTyjae Spears is similarly rostered (45 percent), so he\u2019s another RB you can possibly get for nothing. Again, he\u2019s a low-end RB2 for me, though that goes up a little if Mason Rudolph plays (more expected passes/completions/first downs). Rudolph is likely starting (see below).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see people thinking Tyler Allgeier is in play. He typically gets 10 touches \u2026 maybe a TD. But the Falcons offense is completely broken due to Kirk Cousins being toast. I\u2019d rather play Emanuel Wilson, given the likelihood of a lot of rushes from the Packers\u2019 backup RB at home against the Saints on Monday night.\n\nChase Brown (No. 3) is an automatic starter, of course, and the Cleveland defense is not nearly as good as its reputation. More automatic starts: No. 6 Rico Dowdle and No. 18 Bucky Irving, who is enjoying a historically efficient rookie rushing season. I guess No. 19 Rachaad White, who keeps scoring TDs, has to be played, too.\n\nBreece Hall (No. 24) is fringy, given his knee injury. The same applies to the Chiefs RBs (No. 25 Kareem Hunt and No. 26 Isiah Pacheco). Giants Tyrone Tracy Jr. and Devin Singletary (No. 29 and No. 28, respectively) are in the same bucket of plausibility in Flex10 formats if you have elite receivers.\n\nReceiver Targets\n\nAs for receivers on waivers, generally, I\u2019d rank them Romeo Doubs, Jalen Coker, Rashod Bateman.\n\nThe matchup with the Steelers is the major problem for Bateman. The Ravens are likely to score one to two TDs.\n\nI like Doubs (No. 55) more than the market because the top three Green Bay WRs each have two-TD ceilings and no floor. They\u2019re exactly the same. So Doubs has a 20 to 33 percent chance of winning a playoff game for you, no different than Jayden Reed, even though Reed will be started in almost all deeper formats.\n\nCoker gets the Cardinals, a sort of a neutral matchup, in the Mayor of Munchkin City Bowl (winner gets to keep the ruby slippers).\n\nJerry Jeudy (No. 2) is someone you have to sweat about playing now that DTR is replacing Jameis Winston \u2014 which is likely horrible for Jeudy \u2026 even against Cincy.\n\nTerry McLaurin (No. 11) has 10 TDs, so he\u2019s an automatic start, right? Well, the Eagles are one of those rare pass defenses with a shutdown corner who shadows the No. 1 WR, forcing teams to make very unconventional decisions \u2014 or at least think about them. McLaurin had zero targets in 20 snaps against Quinyon Mitchell in their meeting in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people who have been benching Keenan Allen (No. 4) should start him this week. Given that Allen plays the Lions (there is no \u201cD\u201d in Detroit), I\u2019d definitely pick him over McLaurin.\n\nTrey McBride, at No. 12, was the top TE in market share. The narrative next year will be that too many of his points were derived from non-TD plays, and he\u2019s not getting that many catches again. Well, my narrative is there is no such thing as a non-TD TE, so he\u2019ll probably get 10 TDs next year. I will draft him like he had at least 30 more fantasy points in 2024.\n\nBrian Thomas Jr. was 14th, perfect for those with him on their teams.\n\nOur No. 1 waiver wire TE, Brenton Strange, was the fourth-highest-targeted TE. The Jaguars play the Raiders in \u201cLost Wages.\u201d Strange finished behind Chig Okonkwo, but I need the Titans to play Mason Rudolph and not Will Levis to pick up Okonkwo. We know this is at least planned.\n\nThe Tennessee #Titans are planning to make a switch at quarterback this week, source told ESPN. Mason Rudolph is the logical candidate to step in for starter Will Levis, who likely heads to the bench barring surprise. \u2014 Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) December 17, 2024\n\nIf he\u2019s starting again in Week 16, Stone Smartt (the last T stands for \u201cTargets,\u201d says my Yahoo colleague and podcast partner Scott Pianowski) is in the top 12 TE conversation \u2013 early game against the Broncos, who shut down WRs and don\u2019t care about tight ends.\n\n(Top photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)"

            "article_content": "Snow business\n\nYesterday: Where the money went, and why\n\nToday: Should a lack of snow be considered a federal disaster?\n\nTomorrow: Efforts to 'save winter' in a warming climate\n\nThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist , a nonprofit environmental media organization.\n\nThe slopes haven\u2019t opened yet at Mt. Holiday, a small ski hill in Traverse City. They\u2019re still building up the base of snow.\n\nJim Pearson, the executive director, has been coming to the slope since he was a teenager in the mid-1980s. And he hopes they\u2019ll have a decent season thanks to some cold nights that have made up for slightly warmer days, a big difference from last season \u2014 northern Michigan\u2019s hottest winter on record.\n\n\u201cAll of it would melt, because it was getting into the 60s, it was 40s at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's no way we can compete with that kind of weather.\u201d\n\nWith businesses like Mt. Holiday battered by months of warm weather, the federal government declared a drought in over 40 Michigan counties , including in Grand Traverse County, where the ski hill is located.\n\nThat allowed Pearson to apply for a federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA), and Mt. Holiday received $480,000 interest-free for a year. It helped meet the payroll and catch up on bills.\n\n\u201cEven if we're not making snow that lasts, we still have to make snow,\u201d he said. That made for expensive electricity bills. \u201cYou have 10 [snow] guns running all night long for two or three days. That's a lot of power and a lot of expense.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture determines which areas fall under droughts and are available for assistance. But relying on the drought declarations for loans meant some counties that were harmed by the warmer winter, but didn\u2019t have that designation, didn\u2019t qualify for help.\n\nNow, a group of senators from Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota want to expand the program to include a new category of economic disaster: a lack of snow.\n\nHow it would work\n\nThe bill, introduced this September in the U.S. Senate, is called the Winter Recreation Small Business Recovery Act . It would make a small tweak to the language of the existing program.\n\nElected officials have pushed for such steps before; last spring, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on the federal government to provide more options, saying businesses struggling with warm winters didn't have a good way to access federal relief.\n\nThe idea is to ensure that businesses harmed by winters like the last one are able to get help. Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, was not made available for an interview with IPR. In a news release, he said Michigan had \"lost millions of dollars in revenue,\" and that ski hills had lost around $41 million and laid off thousands of employees.\n\n\u201cNo one had really contemplated the fact that a lack of snow and ice was a different kind of drought,\u201d said Brad Garmon, the executive director of the state\u2019s Outdoor Recreation Industry Office within the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.\n\nThe existing drought declaration doesn't work for many businesses that rely on snow. And while organizations and governments need long-term strategies to deal with a changing climate, Garmon said expanding the loan program would help make distribution of these funds more equitable.\n\nThe program \u201cwas so unevenly accessible and we had businesses that could need it but couldn't get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is a fix to one particular tool. It's not the fix, necessarily, for everything that we're facing.\u201d\n\nA Mt. Holiday employee checks on equipment in December 2024. (Photo: Izzy Ross/IPR News)\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nClimate trends are pointing to warmer winters for places like northern Michigan.\n\nSteven Dundas, an environmental economist and associate professor at Oregon State University who studies the intersection of economy and climate, agreed that this kind of loan program helps in the short term, but said that with \u201cmost climate models predicting reduced snowpack moving forward, this, to me, seems like a short-run fix for a long-run problem.\u201d\n\nEstimating how climate change could reshape the recreation economy is difficult, Dundas said; the range of factors and potential outcomes makes it hard to draw neat conclusions. For instance, warmer springs and falls could allow for certain outdoor activities to rise in some areas.\n\nStill, the effects of unpredictable winters and low snow can be devastating. Dundas pointed to a 2022 study published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management that gathered national data from short-term rentals like AirBnBs near ski resorts and correlated it to snowpack.\n\n\u201cThey suggest ski areas could see visitation drops around 60% with billions of dollars in annual damages,\" he said, with the authors predicting declines of 40 - 60% by the end of the century. Much of that is concentrated in Utah and California, but while the results varied widely by state, the study found places like Michigan could lose tens of millions of dollars in revenue from recreation each year.\n\nDundas said expanding the SBA loan program would help prepare for unusual weather rather than long-term shifts in the climate.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill is perfect for a weather shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we anticipate that that weather shock is going to become more common as climate changes, that requires kind of a little bit more out of the box thinking about policies that can help incentivize adaptation and resilience in these communities, rather than a boom-and-bust climate cycle with snowpack.\"\n\nSome left behind, this time\n\nThe sauna at Ruth Lake Resort in March 2024. (Courtesy: Dax Richer)\n\nFor many who depend on winter weather for their livelihood, even a small fix can make a big difference.\n\nThe Senate bill is trying to reach people like Dax Richer, one of the new owners of Ruth Lake Resort, in the Upper Peninsula\u2019s Baraga County. That county was not under a drought declaration, even though they didn\u2019t get enough snow to bring in many visitors, so his resort was not eligible for those federal loans.\n\n\u201cWe had absolutely no one stay at the resort during the winter months during our first year of owning it,\u201d he said. Richer and his husband were expecting to make around $125,000 this year. They made less than half that, around $47,000. \u201cWe're completely confused why our county, in the middle of all these other counties that received support, was singled out to not receive it.\u201d\n\nAnd while summers are still busy, if tourism doesn\u2019t work out, he said, they might turn the resort into long-term housing.\n\nBack at Mt. Holiday, the fragrance of burning wood drifts from a sauna trailer whose owner rents space in the parking lot, just one of the changes they\u2019ve made in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be out here, hiking, biking. I want to do concerts, running events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're in partnership with East Bay Township to expand those trails. Hopefully that'll start this summer.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re looking at a new norm, Pearson said, so they\u2019re hedging their bets.\n\nIPR\u2019s Claire Keenan-Kurgan contributed to this report."

            "article_content": "The Teamgroup T-Force Cardea Z540 (starts at $149.99; $299.99 for 2TB as tested) is among the fastest solid-state drives (SSDs) we have tested, lagging behind only two other PCI Express (PCIe) 5.0 drives, the Editors' Choice-award-winning Crucial T705 and the Corsair MP700 Pro SE. The Z540 turned in good performance numbers on our benchmarks and is available in capacities up to 4TB. Teamgroup sells a nifty, heavy-duty fan-based heatsink that can be used with it, or you can use your motherboard's heatsink instead. However, be forewarned that the hardware requirements for running PCIe 5.0 SSDs are rather rigorous. You may have to buy a recent boutique desktop that supports this standard\u2014or build a PC yourself with the latest components\u2014to get PCIe 5.0's speed benefits and make purchasing such an SSD worthwhile. But if you're geared up for 5.0, it's a good pick.\n\nDesign: Standard Gen 5 Innards, Optional Heatsink\n\nThe Z540 is a four-lane solid-state drive running the NVMe 2.0 protocol over a PCIe 5.0 bus. This internal SSD comes in the standard M.2 Type-2280 (80mm-long) \"gumstick\" format. The drive uses Micron 232-layer 3D TLC NAND chips and Phison's new Gen 5-optimized PS5026-E26 controller. If these core specs seem familiar, it's because we have seen them in almost all of the other Gen 5 SSDs we have thus far reviewed: the Gigabyte Aorus 10000, the Crucial T705, the Corsair MP700, and the Seagate FireCuda 540. (Stymied by some of these terms? Check out our handy guide to SSD jargon.)\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe Z540 comes with its heat spreader\u2014which doubles as a label bearing the Z540 name\u2014unattached. This reveals the SSD's Phison controller and chips on the drive's circuit board. The heat spreader and label will adhere to the top of the drive.\n\nPCIe 5.0 SSDs\u2014even ones with considerably lower throughput speeds than the Z540\u2014promise a major boost in peak speeds over PCIe 4.0 drives, but you can take advantage of PCIe 5.0 only if you have recent hardware that supports the standard. Only the latest boutique desktops are likely to be PCIe 5.0-ready off the shelf, so you may have to build your own PC from the ground up or update an existing system to gain the required connectivity. The oldest Intel and AMD platforms that are liable to have PCIe 5.0 support are Intel 12th Gen Core CPUs with motherboards based on Intel's Z690 or Z790 chipset; or AMD Ryzen 7000 processors with an AM5 motherboard built around an X670, X670E, or B650E chipset.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nHowever, just because you have one of those chipsets or a newer one doesn't guarantee that the motherboard maker actually implemented a PCIe 5.0-capable M.2 SSD slot. That's up to the board maker, so check your system's or motherboard's specs and documentation to make sure you actually have such a slot before investing in one of these drives. Some boards have PCIe 5.0 expansion slots for graphics cards and other PCI Express cards, but you need one or more PCIe 5.0-capable M.2 slots, specifically.\n\nGen 5 SSDs like the Z540 are capable of prodigious speeds, which means lots of excess heat must be shed to avoid throttling or long-term degradation. (Throttling is a protection mechanism built into most SSDs that prevents sustained overheating but reduces performance.) The Z540 comes with a graphene heat spreader, which Teamgroup stresses is not enough in itself to keep the drive suitably cool. That leaves two alternatives: to rely on your desktop's motherboard's heatsink for cooling, or to use a powerful, heavy-duty heatsink. We got good results with both methods.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nAlong with the Z540, Teamgroup sent us its T-Force Dark AirFlow SSD Cooler ($26.99), an optional active cooling (fan-based) heatsink built to handle massive SSD heat dissipation, such as that needed for a Gen 5 drive. The cooler has a cord with an end connector that fits a motherboard's four-pin fan header for power and control.\n\nIn addition to running our usual benchmarks, with the Z540 cooled by our testbed motherboard's heatsink (which yielded our official results, as seen in the charts below), we ran the PCMark 10 Storage Overall and 3DMark Storage tests with the Z540 paired with the Dark AirFlow heatsink. In PCMark 10, their results were effectively identical, while in the gaming-centric 3DMark Storage, the Dark AirFlow score was better by just over 2%, right at the threshold at which we consider a score difference to be significant.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThat might be enough for an ardent gamer to spend the extra money to spring for this device in an effort to eke out whatever small advantage they can. Another reason to get the Dark AirFlow is simply that it looks cool. The aluminum-finned array with double copper heat pipe, all painted matte black, has a rather steampunk aesthetic. (Of course, you can only admire it if you have a see-through PC case.) That said, you should be fine using the Z540 plus its heat spreader with your motherboard's heatsink.\n\nOur only quibble with the Dark AirFlow is that Teamgroup doesn't offer a bundle of it and the Z540, as the heatsink seems a natural fit for this hyperfast SSD. The prices in the table below are Teamgroup's list prices for the drive alone, but note that the Z540 frequently sells through major retailers at a substantial discount, particularly for the 1TB and 2TB capacities.\n\nAs for durability, expressed as lifetime write capacity in total terabytes written (TBW), the Z540 matches the Crucial T705 in its various capacities. Its durability rating is a notch below the Corsair MP700 Pro, the ADATA Legend 970, and the Aorus 10000, which are rated at 700TBW for 1TB and 1,400TBW for 2TB. And the Seagate FireCuda 540 is the reigning Gen 5 durability champ, with ratings of 1,000TBW for the 1TB stick and 2,000TBW for 2TB.\n\nThe TBW spec is a manufacturer's estimate of how much data can be written to a drive before some cells begin to fail and get taken out of service. Teamgroup covers the Z540 with a warranty of five years or until you hit the rated TBW figure in data writes, whichever comes first. But the drive's durability rating is such that unless you're writing unusually large amounts of data to the SSD, it's a safe bet that the Z540 will last the full warranty period and well beyond.\n\nOne key note: The Z540 lacks the AES 256-bit hardware-based encryption found on Gen 5 SSDs from Crucial and Corsair.\n\nTesting the Teamgroup T-Force Cardea Z540: Speedy, Especially for Gaming\n\nIn benchmarking the Z540, we used our latest testbed PC, designed specifically for benchmarking PCIe 5.0 M.2 SSDs. It is built around an ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard with an AMD X670 chipset, 32GB of DDR5 memory, one PCIe 5.0 x4 M.2 slot (with lanes that have direct access to the CPU), and three PCIe 4.0 slots. The system sports an AMD Ryzen 9 7900 CPU using an AMD stock cooler; a GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics card with 8GB of GDDR6 SDRAM; and a Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 Snow 750-watt power supply. The boot drive is an ADATA Legend 850 PCIe 4.0 SSD. (The reviewed SSD is tested as a secondary data drive.)\n\nWe put the Teamgroup drive through our usual slate of internal solid-state drive benchmarks: Crystal DiskMark 6.0, UL's PCMark 10 Storage, and UL's 3DMark Storage benchmark. The last measures a drive's performance in a number of gaming-related load and launch tasks.\n\nCrystal DiskMark's sequential speed tests provide a traditional measure of drive throughput, simulating best-case, straight-line transfers of large files. We use this test largely to see if our tested speeds are in line with the manufacturer's rated speeds.\n\nThe Z540 effectively matched its rated speeds; both read and write scores were within a fraction of a percent of their ratings. Only the Crucial T705 and the Corsair MP700 Pro SE have had meaningfully higher sequential read and write scores among the SSDs we have tested.\n\nCrystal DiskMark also measures a drive's 4K (small-file) read and write speeds; while the Z540's 4K read speed was in the middle of the pack, its write score was the highest (by a hair) among our comparison group of Gen 5 drives. Good 4K write performance is especially important for an SSD used as a boot drive, though we test them as secondary drives.\n\nAs impressive as the blistering raw speed of the Z540 and other PCI Express 5.0 drives is, it's of little use if your SSD can't quickly perform the tasks you need it for. The PCMark 10 Storage Overall test measures a drive's speed in performing a variety of routine tasks such as launching Windows, loading games and creative apps, and copying both small and large files. The Z540's Overall score was toward the top of the pack.\n\nThe PCMark 10 Overall score is an aggregate of the results of individual tests, which consist of a variety of simulated system tasks. The Z540's scores were in the middle of the pack on most of these, including two of the game-launching tasks (Battlefield 5 and Call of Duty Black Ops 4). However, it managed to eke out the high score in Overwatch launching, beating out the Crucial T705 by a hair.\n\nThe 3DMark Storage benchmark tests an SSD's proficiency in performing a variety of gaming-related tasks. In it, the Z540 was in the thick of a close pack of four SSDs that trailed the T705 by a large margin.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nVerdict: A Fast and Worthy Gen 5 Stick\n\nThe Teamgroup T-Force Cardea Z540 is a fast, capable Gen 5 internal SSD that performed well on nearly all of our benchmarks. It is competitively priced and available in capacities up to 4TB. To dissipate the heat from its sizzling speed, you'll need a heavy-duty heatsink, either the one included with your motherboard or a fan-based model sold separately by Teamgroup. Although the Editors' Choice-winning Crucial T705 outperformed it on most of our benchmarks, the Z540 is a worthy alternative if the price difference is right. Just be forewarned that to get prodigious speeds out of it, you'll need a late-model rig that has the right kind of M.2 slot, like you would with any PCI 5.0 SSD."

            "article_content": "Scientists have been left with a shocking find after opening up one of the world\u2019s rarest whale.\n\nResearchers in New Zealand were delighted to acquire the rare Taoka whale, which is just one of six reported specimens.\n\nThe species was first discovered in 1874 and all that they had to go off was a lower jaw and two teeth collected from Pitt Island, R\u0113kohu.\n\nAdvert\n\nOnce skeletal remains of two other specimens were found, it allowed scientists to confirm a new species.\n\nThen, two more recent findings helped to allow researchers to describe the colour pattern of the species for the first time.\n\nSo, dissecting this one is a big deal.\n\nTaoka Whales are a rare find (DOC)\n\nAdvert\n\nBeautifully, the rare whale\u2019s name translates to treasure in the language of South Island M\u0101ori culture, and it\u2019s spade-teeth is a distinctive characteristic.\n\nIts official name is mesoplodon traversii, and it is the rarest species of beaked whale ever to be found.\n\nWhile no one has ever seen one alive, the corpse allows scientists to finally see what\u2019s so different about the whale.\n\nIt first washed ashore on Taieri Mouth on 4 July and was put into cold storage until officials knew what to do with the body.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe five-metre male, ended up allowing researchers to find something totally unexpected.\n\nThe Department of Conservation in New Zealand\u2019s Rachel Wesley of the R\u016bnanga Maori assembly shared that this was the first time scientists and natives worked together to gain a deeper understanding of the whale.\n\nTe R\u016bnanga \u014d \u014ctakou chair Nadia Wesley-Smith said the r\u016bnaka will partner with DOC to find out what to do with the body.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt is important to ensure appropriate respect for this taoka is shown through the shared journey of learning, applying m\u0101tauraka M\u0101ori as we discover more about this rare species.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Taoka isn't like regular whales (Getty Stock Images)\n\nWhat was found was weird and amazing.\n\nWhen they took a closer look, they found that the whales have tiny vestigial teeth in their upper jaw, which many whales tend to evolve out of as it\u2019s not necessary for survival today.\n\nThey also realised that the whales previously walked on land as well as living in the ocean as it had reduced hind limbs.\n\nAdvert\n\nScientists believe these limbs would have been legs around 50 million years ago, but now they\u2019re a tool for sex.\n\nYou read that right.\n\nScientists believe they help improve the thrust.\n\nAnother interesting thing to come from the autopsy was that the whale had a whopping nine chambers in the stomach.\n\nMarine Science Advisor and whale expert Anton van Helden said, as per the Daily Star: \"In some of those stomachs we found squid beaks and some lenses from the eyes of squid, a few parasitic worms, and maybe some other parts of organisms that we are not quite sure of.\n\n\u201cWe have a parasitologist who will study them to find out what they are.\n\nDOC Coastal Otago Operations Manager Gabe Davies said in a statement: \u201cSpade-toothed whales are one of the most poorly known large mammalian species of modern times. Since the 1800s, only 6 samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jeremiah and Laura Burke produced their documentary about Pastor David Platt, they never imagined it would reach a global audience. Released in fall 2023, the film has garnered more than 100,000 views on Conversations that Matter alone, with additional viewership across other platforms.\n\nAn earlier BNG article about the documentary \u2014 The Real David Platt: The Hijacking of McLean Bible Church \u2014 has drawn tens of thousands of readers.\n\nIt is unusual for a group of laypeople to lead such a public revolt against their own church and pastor as what has happened at McLean, a five-campus nondenominational megachurch in suburban Washington, D.C. It is more unusual for laity to take their own church to court. And it is unheard of to create a two-part documentary series outlining grievances against the pastor.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what has happened at McLean Bible Church, where the arrival of David Platt as pastor in 2017 set off a chain of events not unprecedented in American churches but absolutely unprecedented in the public nature of the dispute. The disaffected members have their own website to tell their story.\n\nOne reason for the public attention is that Platt came to the pastorate from the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention International Mission Board.\n\nSome longtime McLean members did not want anything to do with the SBC because they are proudly nondenominational.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Platt and other church leaders have denied any wrongdoing and have protrayed themselves as victims of a campaign by disgruntled church members.\n\nJeremiah and Laura Burke\n\nAmong those leading the charge against Platt are Jeremiah and Laura Burke. He is a self-described \u201ctypical layman\u201d who comes from a business background in wealth management.\n\n\u201cI was a member of McLean since 2005 \u2026 just a rank-and-file member. A Christian husband and father of four children, just a regular everyday guy, nothing unique,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who David Platt was until he started speaking at McLean and became the pastor of the church.\u201d\n\nHis awareness of church politics at McLean heightened only after Platt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cIt had come to my attention that he had written a couple of books because he spoke in the summer of 2015,\u201d Burke recalled. \u201cHe had come to the church and was a guest pastor for a weekend event, and that was my first exposure to David Platt. Then it wasn\u2019t again until 2016 or 2017, when the church started transitioning out of their prior senior pastor, that David\u2019s name started coming up as being the new pastor to replace long-time pastor Lon Solomon.\u201d\n\nWhile initially open to Platt\u2019s leadership despite his admiration for Solomon, Burke\u2019s perspective began to shift by 2020.\n\n\u201cThere was a series of issues that had come to light over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen David first came on, I guess there was a gloominess over the church in a sense, in that it didn\u2019t seem like everyone was aware of what was happening but you kind of just trust your leadership. It seemed like there were some things that were just not right in the whole transition process.\u201d\n\nBurke reflected on the sudden leadership change: \u201cFor the 10 years I was at McLean, you had a solid pastor. Lon Solomon was a stalwart leader and then all of a sudden, he was gone, David came in and Lon never came back. We had been in Israel on a trip with him, he does these tours to Israel. I remember him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die in the pulpit. I\u2019m not leaving this church.'\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by Baptist News Global, Solomon provided this statement: \u201cIf you have seen Part 2 of the video series, you will see that I was removed by the elders from all operational involvement at MBC early in 2017 as a part of my separation agreement. Also, as part of my separation agreement, I am not at liberty to comment on events at MBC or David Platt.\u201d\n\nThe summer of 2020\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked a turning point, as Platt addressed racial and social issues from the pulpit, following controversy from his 2019 prayer over former President Donald Trump. McLean historically had attracted political figures, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, but Burke perceived a shift in atmosphere: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to see famous political people there. David made a story out of it. I guess a lot of people interpreted it as an apology, and that kind of riled some people up.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further complicated matters.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when COVID came up, the shutting down the church was another huge exodus of people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was problematic because everybody started going to other churches. At McLean you had to register to attend, you had to let them know you were coming.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point for Burke came when he discovered the nondenominational church\u2019s connection to the SBC, which he believed violated church bylaws prohibiting denominational affiliation. His investigation revealed McLean\u2019s involvement with the SBC of Virginia and the North American Mission Board through church planting initiatives.\n\n\u201cI just started to research whether we were part of the SBC or not,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn December 2020, at the first congregational meeting they had in person, I remember a lady asking if we were part of the denomination and David said from the pulpit no. However, that\u2019s not what I discovered.\u201d\n\nSBC church planting partnerships\n\nNot only was Platt educated and ordained by Southern Baptists and served in Southern Baptist leadership, the Bible church got involved in church planting partnerships with the SBC North American Mission Board.\n\nChurch leaders contend this partnership with the SBC \u201cwas not a secret.\u201d The SBC connection predated Platt\u2019s tenure, coordinated primarily through Clint Clifton, who Burke identifies as \u201cseemingly the genesis of this SBC relationship.\u201d\n\nThe discovery left Burke feeling betrayed: \u201cI had no idea I was a Southern Baptist. I had no idea for years that I was a Southern Baptist.\u201d\n\nThe conflict escalated to the point where Burke and his family were charged with trespassing at their own church. Determined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nDetermined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nConflict remains, as does attention\n\n\u201cI feel like I have two jobs now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally grassroots, but the amount of people who have seen it is kind of mind boggling. It\u2019s all over the world at this point; people in Romania and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have seen it. There\u2019s a gentleman who reached out from Russia asking if he could have permission to translate it into Russian and distribute it through Russia. It\u2019s been overwhelming.\u201d\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nSeven years after Platt\u2019s arrival as pastor, the dispute is not resolved and Burke and other unhappy members and former members continue to press their case. Their next target is seeking to document where tens of thousands of dollars from NAMB went because they do not believe all the named church plants even exist.\n\nChurch leaders, meanwhile, released their own investigation that stated: \u201cAfter review of numerous financial transactions associated with this partnership, we are encouraged that no improper financial transactions were discovered either during annual external audits by an independent accounting firm or during the discovery process in the lawsuit. We can say, however, that the financial transactions for the church planting partnership were sometimes confusing.\u201d\n\nThat report also said: \u201cIt is unquestionably clear that MBC did not give up any independence or cede any authority over our local church to the SBC or any other denomination. We at MBC remain committed to maintaining our autonomy and independence as a local body of believers according to our understanding of what the Bible teaches about the authority of the local church, and we are grateful that we are moving closer and closer to a day when these kinds of legal updates will no longer be necessary.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nUnderstanding the David Platt story | Analysis by Maina Mwaura\n\nDavid Platt hopes for a biblical gospel instead of an American gospel\n\nFor now, David Platt has won the battle against internal critics at McLean Bible Church\n\nDavid Platt steps up schedule to step down at IMB"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA quantum circuit (left) is passed to an encoder (top) that creates a feature set for the ML model (right) based on the circuit and the quantum processor unit (QPU) targeted for execution. The executed noisy expectation values serve as the input to the model whose aim is to predict their noise-free value. To achieve this, the model is trained beforehand (bottom, blue highlighted path) against target values of example circuits. These are obtained either using noiseless simulations in the case of small-scale, tractable circuits or using the noisy QPU in conjunction with a conventional error mitigation strategy in the case of large-scale, intractable circuits. The trained model operates without the need for additional mitigation circuits, thus reducing runtime overheads. Credit: Liao et al. Execution and training for tractable and intractable circuits with ML-QEM\n\nQuantum computers have the potential of outperforming classical computers in some optimization and data processing tasks. However, quantum systems are also more sensitive to noise and thus prone to errors, due to the known physical challenges associated with reliably manipulating qubits, their underlying units of information.\n\nEngineers recently devised various methods to reduce the impact of these errors, which are known as quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques. While some of these techniques achieved promising results, executing them on real quantum computers is often too expensive or unfeasible.\n\nResearchers at IBM Quantum recently showed that simple and more accessible machine learning (ML) techniques could be used for QEM. Their paper, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, demonstrates that these techniques could achieve accuracies comparable to those of other QEM techniques, at a far lower cost.\n\n\"We started to think about how to depart from conventional physics-based QEM methods and whether ML techniques can help to reduce the cost of QEM so that more complex and larger-scale experiments could come within reach,\" Haoran Liao, co-first author of the paper, told Phys.org.\n\n\"However, there seemed to be a fundamental paradox: How can classical ML learn what noise is doing in a quantum calculation running on a quantum computer that is doing something beyond classical computers? After all, quantum computers are of interest for their ability to run problems beyond the power of classical computers.\"\n\nAs part of their study, the researchers carried out a series of tests, where they used state-of-the-art quantum computers and up to 100 qubits to complete different tasks. They focused on tasks that are impossible to complete via brute-force calculations performed on classical computers, but that could be tackled using more sophisticated computational methods running on powerful classical computers.\n\n\"This interesting 'paradox' is another motivation for us to think about whether careful designs can tailor ML models to find the complicated relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer to help quantum computations,\" said Liao.\n\nThe primary objective of the recent study by Liao and his colleagues was to accelerate QEM using widely used ML techniques, demonstrating the potential of these techniques in real-world experiments. The team first started experimenting with a complex graph neural network (GNN), which they used to encode the entire structure of a quantum circuit and its properties, yet they found that this model performed not very well.\n\n\"It surprised us to find that a simpler model, random forest, worked very well across different types of circuits and noise models,\" explained Liao.\n\n\"In our exploration of the ML techniques for QEM, we tried to shape and vary the noise to see how different techniques ML or conventional, perform in different scenarios, so we can better understand the capability of ML models in 'learning' the noise\u2013we are not passive bystanders, but active agents.\n\n\"We not only tried to benchmark but also demystify the 'black box' nature of the ML models in the context of learning relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a more powerful quantum computer. \"\n\nTop three panels: Average expectation values from 100-qubit Trotterized 1D TFIM circuits run on the ibm_brisbane QPU. Top panel corresponds to a Clifford circuit, whose ideal, noise-free expectation values are represented by the green dots. The random-forest-mimicking-ZNE (RF-ZNE) curve corresponds to training the random forest (RF) model on zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) and readout-error-mitigated hardware data. This approach enables efficient, low-overhead error mitigation in scenarios where ideal outcomes from classical simulation are infeasible. Bottom panel: The error between ZNE-mitigated and RF-ZNE mitigated expectation values. The approach achieves a 25% reduction in overall and 50% reduction in runtime deployment in terms of quantum resource overhead compared to ZNE, as shown in the inset. Credit: Liao et al.\n\nThe experiments carried out by Liao and his colleagues demonstrate that ML could help to accelerate physics-based QEM. Remarkably, the model that they found to be most promising, known as random forest, is also fairly simple and could thus be easy to implement on a large scale.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the future, they could help to enrich the present understanding of quantum errors, while also potentially improving the accessibility of QEM methods.\n\n\"Is the relationship between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer fundamentally unlearnable? We didn't know the answer,\" said Liao.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons why this would be impossible to determine. However, we showed this key relationship is in fact learnable by ML models in practice. We also showed that we are not passive bystanders, but we can shape the noise in the computation to improve the learnability further.\"\n\nLiao and his colleagues also successfully demonstrated that ML techniques for QEM are less costly, yet they can achieve accuracies comparable to those of alternative physics-based QEM techniques. Their experiments were the first to demonstrate the potential of machine learning algorithms for QEM at a utility scale.\n\n\"Even in the most conservative setting, ML-QEM demonstrates more than a 2-fold reduction in runtime overhead, addressing the primary bottleneck of error mitigation and a fundamentally challenging problem with a substantial leap in efficiency,\" said Liao.\n\n\"Most conservatively, this translates into at least halving experiment durations\u2014e.g., cutting an 80-hour experiment to just 40 hours\u2014drastically reducing operational costs and doubling the regime of accessible experiments.\"\n\nAfter gathering these promising results, Liao and his colleagues plan to continue exploring the potential of AI algorithms for simplifying and upscaling QEM. Their work could inspire other research groups to conduct similar studies, potentially contributing to the advancement and future deployment of quantum computers.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, and we're excited about the field of AI for quantum,\" added Liao. \"We would like to emphasize that at least in the context of QEM, ML is not to replace, but to facilitate physics-based methods, that they can build off each other.\n\n\"This opens the door for what's possible with ML in quantum and is an invitation to the community that ML can perhaps accelerate and improve many other aspects of quantum computations.\"\n\nMore information: Haoran Liao et al, Machine learning for practical quantum error mitigation, Nature Machine Intelligence (2024).

            "article_content": "Instead of issuing the permit as expected, the Trump administration was hitting the brakes to launch a broad study of the potential cumulative impacts of planned offshore wind projects. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting it,\u201d Theoharides said, remembering the day. \u201cEverything had looked really smooth up until that point.\u201d\n\nMomentum had been building for years, which was why it was surprising when Governor Charlie Baker pulled his new energy and environment secretary, Katie Theoharides, aside to deliver some bad news.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Massachusetts was poised for a big moment: Any day, the federal government would be issuing a final environmental permit for what was sure to be a game changer: the first industrial offshore wind project in the United States, Vineyard Wind.\n\nIt was the beginning of a \u201chinder and delay\u201d strategy that came to define the Trump administration\u2019s approach to offshore wind, said Jeremy McDiarmid, general counsel at the clean trade group Advanced Energy United.\n\nNow, people in the clean energy industry are bracing for a much more overt effort from the second Trump administration to slow or stop wind power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast go-around, the interruption seemed plausible; a cumulative impact study could be justified by some as a responsible step. Except, that\u2019s not been required of the oil and gas industry. \u201cIt seemed pretty clear that they were doing it just to derail this offshore wind train,\u201d said John Rogers, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nIt appeared a new double standard was being applied \u2014 one that would set back clean energy just as Massachusetts and other states were committing to slashing their greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis, relying heavily on offshore wind.\n\nVineyard Wind turbine size comparison to other buildings and landmarks. Ryan Huddle/Globe Staff\n\nAfter President Biden took office in 2021, permits got back on track, though projects were well behind. Vineyard Wind, for example, was initially scheduled to be completed in 2023; instead, it only began construction last year and has since been interrupted after a blade on one of the turbines broke this summer.\n\nNow, among the potential threats the industry is anticipating from Trump are new tariffs or shrinking tax incentives that could drive up the costs to unsustainable levels, or even a halt in permits or new leases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis regulatory uncertainty increases the cost of development, it increases financing costs, it probably reduces the number of investors that are interested in accepting this risk,\u201d said McDiarmid. \u201cThe offshore wind developers don\u2019t start to earn money until the electrons flow.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high: Wind farms provide a huge boost to the state reaching its clean energy goals. When Vineyard Wind 1 is fully online, for instance, it will provide enough electricity for more than 400,000 homes and meet 5.5 percent of the state\u2019s annual electricity demand. Another project, known as New England Wind 1, would have a similar effect.\n\nDevelopers lay out billions of dollars to bring an offshore wind project to fruition, and are ultimately paid back when they sell the electricity to utilities. Because offshore wind projects have lower operating costs relative to fossil fuels when completed, supporters say wind should eventually bring costs down for ratepayers.\n\nThere are some key differences between now and eight years ago, when Trump first entered office: The industry is far more developed, with multiple projects up and down the coast, projects being built, planned, or in various stages of permitting.\n\nWhile much of this is happening in coastal blue states, the industry is bringing an economic boom to red states too. Louisiana, for example, is a pivotal part of the supply chain, supplying the equipment and vessels used in building wind farms. Those jobs and contracts in Republican-held states might make it tougher to stop progress entirely.\n\nNonetheless, Trump these days is more vocal in his antipathy to wind turbines, claiming in May that \u201cthey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is.\u201d He has embraced discredited antiwind claims about how wind affects whales, birds, and the environment, and vowed on his first day in office to issue an executive order halting offshore wind projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere are other threats, too. Blades for the Vineyard Wind turbines, for instance, are manufactured in Canada, which Trump has threatened with a 25 percent tariff. Smaller parts of the offshore wind supply chain could also be affected by tariffs on China and Mexico, adding significant costs.\n\nA wind turbine with a broken blade at Vineyard Wind 1. Accidents involving blades made by GE Vernova have delayed projects off the coasts of Massachusetts and England. RANDI BAIRD/NYT\n\nIn addition, tax credits included in the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 which Trump has vowed to roll back \u2014 have helped support offshore wind supply manufacturers. JSW Steel, for instance, is expanding a plant in Mingo Junction, Ohio, to produce steel slabs for offshore wind pole towers, backed by $43.5 million in federal tax credits.\n\nManufacturers rely on those incentives, and Washington needs to keep them in place \u201cto ensure this industry thrives,\u201d said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president at Oceantic Network, a trade group for companies in the offshore wind business.\n\nThough some steps \u2014 namely tariffs \u2014 can be done via presidential executive order, it\u2019s not clear if Trump\u2019s other threats to offshore wind can be as easily realized.\n\nIndustry experts say Trump may not have the authority to revoke federal permits that are already issued. If so, then four permitted projects off the Massachusetts coastline \u2014 Vineyard Wind 1, Revolution Wind, and New England Wind 1 and 2 \u2014 should be safe. Of those, Vineyard Wind and Revolution Wind are already under construction. New England Wind 1 is further behind, having only recently been selected via a state procurement process, and New England Wind 2 has not been selected, but is available for future procurements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fate of other offshore wind projects planned for New England is less clear. SouthCoast Wind and Vineyard Wind 2 are on track for federal permits over the next two years. Another project, called Starboard Wind, also has not received all its federal permits.\n\n\u201cThese are the projects that I think face the biggest risks, because that creates the most latitude and areas for engagement with the federal government,\u201d said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.\n\nTogether, those three would produce a total of 3.67 gigawatts of clean energy, enough power for an estimated 1.8 million homes. Massachusetts has already contracted for 1.9 gigawatts from SouthCoast Wind and Vineyard Wind 2, and Rhode Island has contracted a small amount from SouthCoast Wind.\n\nIn Massachusetts, each project has an integral role in getting the state to its legally mandated target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nA view of Vineyard Wind's GE Haliade-X steel tower sections in New Bedford, June 14, 2023. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\n\nWhile offshore wind isn\u2019t the only way the state plans to convert from fossil fuels for electricity, it \u201cmoves the needle the most,\u201d said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Green Energy Consumers Alliance.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s very hard to get Massachusetts to net zero without offshore wind,\u201d said Theoharides, the former energy secretary who worked for the offshore wind industry for a year after leaving office.\n\nAny delays to the industry are coming at a particularly bad time, too. Demand for electricity in New England has been rising with the adoption of heat pumps and electric vehicles. At the same time, fossil fuel power plants are shutting down. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not sustainable to take capacity off without replacement in a rising demand environment,\u201d Dolan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, even if the industry hits major delays during the next four years of the Trump administration, \u201cit\u2019s not going to erase the offshore wind industry by any means,\u201d said McDiarmid. \u201cI think the industry is way too mature for that.\u201d\n\nSabrina Shankman can be reached at sabrina.shankman@globe.com.
