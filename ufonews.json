        "article_content": "A LEADING UFO campaigner has revealed whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will finally reveal America's alien secrets.\n\nVeteran extraterrestrial lobbyist Steve Bassett wants the government to come clean about extraterrestrials in what he calls \"full disclosure\".\n\n11 Trump spoke about UFOs while in office, though he has made it clear it is not his 'thing' Credit: Reuters\n\n11 Harris has not made it clear whether she would release information on aliens Credit: AFP\n\n11 The US Department of Defense released footage of one UFO caught by a aircraft Credit: AFP\n\n11 Chilling footage caught on UFO from a plane Credit: youtube/LUFOS\n\nThe November 5 vote is set to be a pivotal moment for many policy issues - including the possible revelation of aliens.\n\nA stripped back bill was passed in December, ordering some records to be released within 25 years.\n\nThose releases could include more video and photos of unidentified craft and secret records dating back decades held by intelligence agencies.\n\nCongress has also held high-profile hearings over the last few years - and some in the capitol are talking about stronger legislation.\n\nBut if Congress passed a bill, the commander-in-chief would still have the option to veto it - making the 2024 presidential election a pivotal moment in UFO history.\n\nBassett told The Sun he thinks Kamala Harris would be more likely to release the secret files to the public than Donald Trump.\n\nHe says that's because the Democrats have pushed harder on getting a bill through Congress - and Harris would follow her party's line.\n\nThe Democrats and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have backed legislation saying the government should be willing to be \"transparent\" over the issue.\n\nBut Bassett thinks either candidate would ultimately release files if they were elected president.\n\nVideos of two incidents were shown to Congress as part of a landmark committee in 2022.\n\nMy grandad was at the Roswell UFO crash & he told us ALIEN bodies were found\n\nAnd officials admitted there were 400 unexplained sightings by the US military.\n\nHe said: \"A President Harris might come forward a little sooner and by sooner I mean like the day after the hearing is over, because the world is going to be on fire.\"\n\nAny revelation would only get to the President's desk after passing through Congress like any other law.\n\nBassett said: \"It's not about who is going to veto the bill. That's not an issue.\n\n\"It's going to be which president is most likely to step forward and confirm the ET presence.\"\n\nAfter the bill is passed, the pressure from the public will be so great that a sitting president would have no choice but to allow disclosure, Bassett claimed.\n\nHe said: \"The sooner they get in front of the people the better.\n\n\"We're one play away from ending this truth embargo 77 years after the press release in Roswell announcing that the Army Air Force had a crashed flying saucer.\n\n\"Those who are frustrated and leave the field right now are not going to get to join us in the in the locker room, but that's how close we are.\"\n\nThe sooner they get in front of the people the better\n\nAnother way disclosure of alien life could come would be if a Senate hearing with experts testifying came during the lame duck period.\n\nInstead of waiting for a new president and Congress, the current one would step forward in November or December and reveal the information, Bassett said.\n\nHe added: \"That hearing which I've described in countless interviews that I've given, it'll be one of the most important hearings in history, watched by millions.\n\n\"That sets the stage for President Biden to come forward and be the disclosure President by confirming what this hearing is just demonstrated.\n\n\"In which case Joe Biden would be the disclosure president.\n\n\"It would be an extraordinary legacy for him, and he would go out the door at the peak of his service to the country.\"\n\n11 Former DoD UFO worker David Grusch testifies before a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing about UFOs Credit: EPA\n\n11 Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray plays a video of a UFO Credit: EPA\n\n11 Trump revealed aliens isn't 'his thing' in an interview with Joe Rogan Credit: Joe Rogan Experience\n\n11 Bassett said Joe Biden may also choose to release information during his lame duck period Credit: The Mega Agency\n\nTrump has spoken about aliens during the election campaign telling popular American podcaster Lex Fridman that he would \"surely\" make secret footage of alleged UFO sightings public.\n\nDuring the chat, Fridman asked Trump: \"Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?\"\n\nTo which Trump readily agreed and said: \"Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that.\"\n\nTrump also spoke about \"people coming from space\" with Joe Rogan in their three-hour interview.\n\nWhen Rogan asked Trump if he thought aliens were \"flying around\" he said there was \"no reason not to\".\n\nTrump said: \"There's no reason to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.\"\n\nWhen Rogan suggested that some of the more recent sightings could have been advanced drones, Trump repeatedly says: \"could be\".\n\nTrump said: \"I interviewed a few people, it's never been my thing to be honest, I have never been a believer.\n\n\"It's not a great interest for me, but it's still of a little interest.\n\n\"I interviewed jet pilots that were solid people, perfect, great pilot great everything, they said: 'We saw things, sir, that were very strange'.\"\n\nTrump has previously commented on UFOs while in office when the Pentagon released three infrared videos of flying objects in 2020.\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder if it\u2019s real... that\u2019s a hell of a video.\"\n\nIn 2019, he told George Stephanopoulos that \"we\u2019re watching\" for aliens, \"and you\u2019ll be the first to know.\"\n\nThe Trump and Harris campaigns have been contacted for comment.\n\n11 Mexican journalist and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan claims this specimen is not related to any known Earthly species Credit: Getty\n\n11 Steve Bassett is the only registered UFO lobbyist in Washington DC Credit: STEVE BASSETT"

Here\u2019s everything new in ChromeOS 130.\n\nWhat\u2019s New in ChromeOS 130?\n\nThe first major addition is the new Recorder app, which is rolling out to all Chromebooks. It looks quite similar to the one you find on Pixels with Material You theming and on-device transcription. On Chromebook Plus, you also get title suggestions and three-point summaries. The app seems to be rolling out to Chromebook Plus first, as we couldn\u2019t find it on our non-Plus unit.\n\nQuick Insert is another great feature rolling out in ChromeOS 130. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is the first Chromebook to get a dedicated Quick Insert key. With this, you can now use a keyboard shortcut Launcher + F to emulate the same key on other Chromebooks.\n\nSimilarly, Focus Mode turns on DND and integrates Google Tasks in the UI, allowing you to work efficiently and be more productive without distractions. I\u2019ve tried the new Focus Mode, and it has how it helped me get things done quickly. So, I\u2019m sure you all will like it too.\n\nWelcome Recap is also rolling out in ChromeOS 130, and it shows you the files and apps you were working on before you last shut down your Chromebook. You can restore all the apps in a jiffy, and it can also serve as a reminder if you usually forget what you were working on last night.\n\nBesides, there\u2019s now support for multiple calendars, and an option to adjust keyboard backlight brightness in Settings. There\u2019s a similar slider in display settings with Ambient brightness control, but we couldn\u2019t find it on our Chromebook.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nAs for the Chromebook Plus-specific new AI features, there are two new features \u2014 Studio-style mic and Help me Read. The Studio-style mic feature is pretty straightforward. It uses AI to enhance the input sound quality and processes it to give it a studio feel.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nThe Help me read feature, on the other hand, also uses AI to summarize websites and PDFs. Users will see a text field where they can ask questions about the documents or pages and get summaries for the same.\n\nThat\u2019s not it. There are some other notable additions that Google has shared in its Chromebook support thread like the ability to access Google Drive files from the shelf, privacy controls that are more accessible in Chrome, and suggestions in Tote.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on ChromeOS 130? Let us know in the comments below."

        "article_content": "Plaud NotePin MSRP $169.00 Score Details \u201cThe Plaud NotePin is the ideal companion for recording, transcribing and summarizing the important conversations in my life.\u201d Pros Great battery life and performance\n\nUseful accessory kit\n\nSimple, yet effective design\n\nChoice of multiple LLMs\n\nUseful AI transcription and summaries Cons Only 300 minutes of recording per month\n\nIt can be easy to forget something if you\u2019re a working professional, business owner, or parent juggling multiple responsibilities. Have you ever tried to recall the nuances of a meeting, a phone call, a doctor\u2019s visit, a parent-teacher meeting, or a work conference?\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nImagine if you had a personal secretary who recorded, transcribed, and alerted you to the important things \u2014 and it was doing that 24 hours a day. Meet the Plaud NotePin, the AI gadget that is aimed at being this for you. After using it for several weeks, I can safely say that it delivers on two of these fronts, and it\u2019s a handy gadget for specific types of people.\n\nPlaud NotePin specs\n\nSpecs Plaud NotePin Dimensions 51 x 21 x 11 mm Weight 25 grams Microphones 2MEMS Battery 270 mAh\n\n40 days standby\n\n20 hours of continuous recording Storage 64GB LLMs ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Languages Multiple speakers in 59 languages\n\nA simple design for a specific purpose\n\nThe Plaud NotePin is a pill-shaped version of the wallet-shaped Plaud Note, which uses MagSafe to attach to the back of your iPhone. The company\u2019s first AI product received mostly positive, but critical reviews. The NotePin is an excellent successor, bringing the best of the Note to a more accessible form factor in more ways than one.\n\nYou may be wondering why the Plaud NotePin exists. That\u2019s exactly what my initial reaction was. Why buy this when I have an excellent recording app on the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Apple Intelligence Summaries on the iPhone 16? It\u2019s the same reason other AI devices \u2014 like the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 \u2014 failed, but the NotePin is different for one key reason: it blends into the background and can transcribe your day.\n\nThe capsule features the main body and a small rear cover that magnetically attaches and covers the charging pins. These connect to a proprietary charging dock that charges the Plaud NotePin using a USB-C cable. There are also two holes for a lanyard or to connect the necklace that comes with the accessory kit.\n\nThe front of the capsule features a small LED and an invisible capacitive button. The LED is fairly bright, but it can be difficult to see under glare or at a glance while driving. The button is my chief complaint; it took several days for me to get used to it, and even now, I struggle to activate it correctly every time.\n\nAlthough Plaud plans to sell the NotePin on its own, it currently comes with an accessory kit by default. The kit allows you to wear the Plaud NotePin in different ways, including around your neck, lapel, or wrist. The magnetic cover on the rear of the Plaud NotePin also doubles as an easy way to attach it to your shirt.\n\nHowever, even when Plaud gets around to selling the NotePin without the accessory kit, I\u2019d still recommend buying it. The kit is a must if you plan to buy the NotePin, as it makes it easy to ensure you always have it on your person.\n\nAll-day battery life and near-flawless performance\n\nThe Plaud NotePin features a 290mAh battery that is rated as offering up to 40 days of standby or up to 20 hours of continuous recording. These numbers may seem high for such a small capacity, but the Plaud NotePin mostly delivers on these.\n\nCrucially, it achieves the key goal of allowing you to record for a full day. This makes it ideal for people who work long hours and want to record from morning to night. Alternatively, if you work a more traditional nine-to-five job, you can probably expect two days of recording off a single charge. It takes around two hours to charge the NotePin to complete, but even a quick 15-minute is enough to record for several hours.\n\nThe secret to the Plaud NotePin is its simplicity. It doesn\u2019t try to do 100 things; instead, it does a few things exceptionally well. Pressing the button is difficult, so it doesn\u2019t trigger accidentally during your day-to-day movements. The dual microphones pick up audio even in moderately loud environments, but likely won\u2019t work well when there\u2019s a lot of background noise, and it can sound quite muffled when wearing the wrist strap with long sleeves.\n\nThe Plaud NotePin has two transfer options to offload recordings to the app on your phone. For smaller files, it can transfer over Bluetooth at around 35Kbps to 45 Kbps, but for larger files, you can connect directly to the Plaud NotePin over Wi-Fi and transfer at around 10 times the speed.\n\nHarnessing the power of AI in multiple ways\n\nThe hardware on the Plaud NotePin is well-suited for its intended purpose, but does it live up to its AI goals? Is this an ideal use case for AI, and can the Plaud NotePin survive when others haven\u2019t? The answer to the latter question is still unknown, but it certainly lives up to its goals and is an ideal use case for AI for specific people.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve recorded something, the Plaud app allows you to generate a transcript, a summary, or a mind map of the recording. I recited the introduction to this review, which lasted a few minutes, and the summary and mind map feature didn\u2019t provide much additional value. However, this was due to the lack of length.\n\nI often forget to stop recording on the NotePin, so I end up with long recordings that span multiple topics. One of these recordings lasted 3 hours and 39 minutes and incorporated appointments with plumbers and electricians at my mother\u2019s home, which is currently being renovated, a visit to my barber, and a phone call with a partner for an upcoming event. The summary feature was particularly helpful for this, surfacing key action points, takeaways, and even checkboxes at the end, as well as AI-powered suggestions on things that still needed clarification.\n\nIt takes just a few seconds to transcribe short notes, and even the three-and-a-half-hour recording took just two-and-a-half minutes to upload, transcribe, and generate a full summary. Unfortunately, the Plaud NotePin only comes with 300 minutes per month of transcription, although the Pro version gives you 1,200 minutes per month and costs $79 per year. If you plan to record every part of your day, you\u2019ll run through this in just five hours, so you\u2019ll need to be more intentional about what you record and transcribe.\n\nFor some people, this won\u2019t be a problem. However, I can see companies running into limit issues almost immediately. That\u2019s a shame because the Plaud NotePin is ideal for some specific professions.\n\nImagine you\u2019re a salesperson: If you walk into a meeting, it is likely to be frowned upon to record the meeting on your phone. However, a simple gadget on your wrist that\u2019s easily mistaken for a fitness tracker is ideal. The same applies if you\u2019re a doctor and want to use the Plaud NotePin to assist with note-taking and recollection. Or a real estate agent who wants to engage with potential customers when showing a home, but be able to recall the finer details at a later date.\n\nThe Plaud NotePin is the ideal driving companion.\n\nThese are just some of the use cases for Plaud\u2019s professional templates. It\u2019s questionable how useful they are as templates, but they highlight some of the use cases where the Plaud NotePin is the ideal AI gadget. Combined with the choice of two large language models (LLMs) \u2014 ChatGPT4o and Claude 3.5 beta \u2014 plus more in the future, it\u2019s also future-proofed for an ever-changing AI future.\n\nI\u2019ve got one more use case to add to Plaud\u2019s list: in the car. When you have a quick thought while driving \u2014 which happens to me a lot \u2014 you can\u2019t just pick up your phone and start recording. Sure, you can rely on your memory, or you can press a button on the Plaud NotePin and record away. I\u2019ve increasingly found myself doing that, as the Plaud NotePin is the ideal driving companion.\n\nPlaud NotePin price and availability\n\nThe Plaud NotePin is available to preorder for $169 as part of an early-bird bundle that also includes the accessory kit, unlimited cloud storage, and access to certain AI features.\n\nThe Plaud NotePin comes with 300 minutes of monthly transcription and a host of other features as standard. If you subscribe to the Pro plan for $79 per year, you\u2019ll get 1,200 minutes of transcription per month and access to the full suite of 20-plus professional summary templates.\n\nThe Plaud NotePin is available in three colors: Lunar Silver, Cosmic Gray (featured in the photos in this review), and my favorite, Sunset Purple. The accessory kit, which is valued at $45 but can\u2019t be purchased separately, comes in one color, with the wrist strap in white.\n\nShould you buy the Plaud NotePin?\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss the Plaud NotePin as just another AI gadget, but to do so would be to do it an injustice. Unlike other AI gadgets, the Plaud NotePin has a clear purpose and delivers precisely what it sets out to do.\n\nFor me, buying the Plaud NotePin for $169 is a no-brainer.\n\nWhere things get murkier is deciding if you should buy the Plaud NotePin. If you don\u2019t take many meetings or have a strong memory, you likely won\u2019t find as much value in it. However, if you often forget conversations that you wish you could recall, or if you work in one of the professions mentioned or have a similar job, it is an excellent companion device.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m planning to use it extensively during my house renovations and as a fixture during trade shows and events. It\u2019s a great way to record everything that matters, especially conversations about potential partnerships and briefings about devices. For me, buying the Plaud NotePin for $169 is a no-brainer."

        "article_content": "Evolution has always been seen as a complex, random, and unpredictable process, shaping life on Earth in ways we could hardly anticipate.\n\nBut what if there\u2019s more order to it than chaos? That\u2019s exactly what a team of scientists is suggesting in a new study.\n\nThis research, led by Professor James McInerney and Dr. Alan Beavan from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham, hints that evolution might not be as random as we\u2019ve long thought.\n\nTheir research could have big implications for tackling issues like antibiotic resistance, diseases, and even climate change.\n\nEvolution, genes, and the pangenome\n\nSo, what\u2019s this all about? The team analyzed the pangenome \u2014 the complete set of genes within a species \u2014 to see if evolution follows any predictable paths.\n\nThey wanted to know: Is evolution just a series of accidents, or is there a pattern influenced by a genome\u2019s history?\n\nWhat is the pangenome?\n\nIn simple terms, the pangenome is the complete set of all genes found within a species.\n\nIt includes every gene present in all the different strains or individuals, covering both the common genes shared by everyone (the core genome) and the unique ones found only in some (the accessory genome).\n\nSo even though individual members might have different genetic makeups, the pangenome represents the full genetic diversity that the species has.\n\nAnalyzing the pangenome allows researchers to identify which genes are essential for survival and which ones offer specific advantages, opening up possibilities for new medical and environmental applications.\n\nBig computing power required\n\nThe team used a machine learning approach called Random Forest to sift through a massive dataset of 2,500 complete genomes from a single bacterial species.\n\nMachine learning algorithms like this are great at finding patterns that might be too complex or subtle for humans to detect on their own.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a quick job \u2014 it took several hundred thousand hours of computer processing.\n\nEvolution and \u201cgene families\u201d\n\nFirst up, they created \u201cgene families\u201d from each gene in every genome. \u201cIn this way, we could compare like-with-like across the genomes,\u201d explained Dr. Maria Rosa Domingo-Sananes from Nottingham Trent University.\n\nOnce they had these families sorted out, they focused on the genes and gene families inside the genomes.\n\n\u201cWe found that some gene families never turned up in a genome when a particular other gene family was already there,\u201d said Dr. Domingo-Sananes.\n\n\u201cAnd on other occasions, some genes were very much dependent on a different gene family being present.\u201d\n\nHidden gene ecosystem driving evolution\n\nIn other words, they discovered an invisible ecosystem where genes either get along or clash with each other, making evolution unpredictable.\n\n\u201cThese interactions between genes make aspects of evolution somewhat predictable and furthermore, we now have a tool that allows us to make those predictions,\u201d added Dr. Domingo-Sananes.\n\nA paradigm shift\n\nProfessor McInerney, the lead author of the study, is excited about the possibilities, to say the least.\n\n\u201cThe implications of this research are nothing short of revolutionary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy demonstrating that evolution is not as random as we once thought, we\u2019ve opened the door to an array of possibilities in synthetic biology, medicine, and environmental science.\u201d\n\nReal-world applications\n\nThis research isn\u2019t just about understanding evolution for curiosity\u2019s sake. It has real-world implications that could affect our lives in significant ways.\n\nBut how could this affect us in practical terms?\n\n\u201cFrom this work, we can begin to explore which genes \u2018support\u2019 an antibiotic resistance gene, for example,\u201d Dr. Beaven explained.\n\n\u201cTherefore, if we are trying to eliminate antibiotic resistance, we can target not just the focal gene, but we can also target its supporting genes.\u201d\n\nFighting antibiotic resistance\n\nThis approach could be a game-changer in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nBy understanding the network of genes that work together, scientists could develop more effective treatments.\n\n\u201cWe can use this approach to synthesize new kinds of genetic constructs that could be used to develop new drugs or vaccines,\u201d Dr. Beavan continued.\n\n\u201cKnowing what we now know has opened the door to a whole host of other discoveries.\u201d\n\nImplications for climate change\n\nThe study\u2019s insights might also help in the fight against climate change.\n\nBy engineering microorganisms that can capture carbon or break down pollutants, we could develop new tools to reduce our environmental footprint.\n\nAdvancing personalized medicine\n\nThe predictability of gene interactions could also revolutionize personalized medicine.\n\nImagine doctors being able to predict how a disease might progress in your body based on your genetic makeup, or which treatments would be most effective for you.\n\nThis research could bring us one step closer to that reality.\n\nEvolution, gene manipulation, and the future\n\nTo sum it all up, this new research is shaking up how we think about evolution. Instead of seeing it as a series of random events, the study suggests there\u2019s a level of predictability influenced by gene families and genetic history.\n\nThis is obviously a very big deal for many other reasons besides the fact that it upends everything we thought we knew about evolution since Charles Darwin burst onto the scene.\n\nThis discovery means that we might be able to anticipate and even guide evolutionary changes in ways we never thought possible.\n\nThe practical applications are vast. From developing new strategies to combat antibiotic resistance to engineering organisms that can help fight climate change, the possibilities are exciting.\n\nThe idea that we can target not just harmful genes but also their \u201csupporting cast\u201d opens up new avenues in medicine and environmental science.\n\nOverall, this study invites us to rethink some fundamental assumptions about life and evolution. It\u2019s not just about chance anymore; there\u2019s a pattern and order we can tap into.\n\nAs we learn more, who knows what other doors might open? It\u2019s an exciting time to be alive, and an exciting time to be a scientist.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

        "date": "23h",
        "source": "TechRepublic",
        "article_content": "Generative AI is as trendy as it has ever been.\n\nThis year, research into AI was awarded Nobel Prizes, and the largest tech companies in the world pumped AI into as many products as possible. The U.S. government promoted AI as a driver in creating a clean-energy economy and a strategic pillar for federal spending. But what\u2019s next for 2025?\n\nThe trend of generative AI in the last few months of 2024 points to a greater push for adoption from tech companies. Meanwhile, the results as to whether AI products and processes see ROI for enterprise software buyers are mixed. While it\u2019s difficult to foresee how AI will continue to shape the tech industry, experts have offered predictions based on current trends.\n\nRespondents to an IEEE study in September rated AI as one of the top three areas of technology that will be most critical in 2025 in 58% of cases. Conversely, nearly all respondents (91%) agree that 2025 will see \u201ca generative AI reckoning\u201d regarding what the technology can or should do. Expectations for generative AI are high, but the success of projects leveraging it remains uncertain.\n\n1. AI agents will be the next buzzword\n\nBased on my research and observations, the use of AI agents will surge in 2025.\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads. As with generative AI, the definition of an agent\u2019s capabilities is unclear. IBM defines it as an AI that can reason through complex problems, such as OpenAI o1. However, not all products billed as AI agents can reason that way.\n\nRegardless of their capabilities, AI agents and their use cases will likely be at the forefront of generative AI marketing in 2025. AI \u201cagents\u201d could be the next stage of evolution for this year\u2019s AI \u201ccopilots.\u201d AI agents could spend time working through multi-stage jobs independently while their human counterpart handles another task.\n\n2. AI will both help and hurt security teams\n\nBoth cybersecurity attackers and defenders will continue to take advantage of AI in 2025. 2024 has already seen the proliferation of generative AI security products. These products can write code, detect threats, answer thorny questions, or serve as a \u201crubber duck\u201d for brainstorming.\n\nBut generative AI may present information that is inaccurate. Security professionals may spend as much time double-checking the output as they would if they had performed the work themselves. Failing to review such information can lead to broken code and even more security issues.\n\n\u201cAs AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini become deeply integrated into business operations, the risk of accidental data exposure skyrockets with new data privacy challenges,\u201d Jeremy Fuchs, cyber security evangelist at Check Point Software Technologies, said in an email to TechRepublic. \u201cIn 2025, organizations must move swiftly to implement strict controls and governance over AI usage, ensuring the benefits of these technologies don\u2019t come at the cost of data privacy and security.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI models are susceptible to malicious actors like any other software, particularly via jailbreak attacks.\n\n\u201cAI\u2019s growing role in cyber crime is undeniable,\u201d Fuchs explained. \u201cBy 2025, AI will not only enhance the scale of attacks but also their sophistication. Phishing attacks will be harder to detect, with AI continuously learning and adapting.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI can make conventional methods of identifying phishing emails \u2014 poor grammar or out-of-the-blue messages \u2014 obsolete. Disinformation security will become more important as AI-generated videos, audio, and text proliferate. As a result, security teams must adapt to both using and defending against generative AI \u2014 just as they have adapted to other significant changes in business technology, such as the large-scale migration to the cloud.\n\n3. Businesses will evaluate whether AI delivers ROI\n\n\u201cThe pendulum has swung from \u2018new AI innovation at any cost\u2019 to a resounding imperative to prove ROI in board rooms across the world,\u201d Uzi Dvir, global CIO at digital adoption platform company WalkMe, said in an email. \u201cSimilarly, employees are asking themselves if it\u2019s worth the time and effort to figure out how to use these new technologies for their specific roles.\u201d\n\nOrganizations struggle to determine whether generative AI adds value and to what use cases it can make the most difference. Organizations that adopt AI often face high costs and unclear goals. It can be difficult to quantify the benefits of generative AI use, where those benefits manifest, and what to compare them to.\n\nThis challenge is a side effect of the integration of generative AI into many other applications. It makes some decision-makers wonder whether generative AI add-ons truly boost the value of those applications. AI tiers can be costly, and over the next year, more companies are expected to rigorously test \u2014 and sometimes discard \u2014 the features that don\u2019t deliver results.\n\nMany companies that are incorporating generative AI at a large scale are seeing success. At its Q3 earnings call, Google attributed this result to its AI infrastructure and products such as AI Overviews. However, Meta reported that AI may significantly increase capital expenditures, even as user numbers decline.\n\nSEE: Google Cloud is previewing its sixth generation of the AI accelerator Trillium.\n\n4. AI will make a major impact on scientific research\n\nAlong with impacting enterprise productivity, contemporary AI has seen significant movement in science.\n\nFour of 2024\u2019s Nobel Prize winners used AI:\n\nDemis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for predicting the structure of proteins with AlphaFold2.\n\nJohn J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the Nobel Prize for Physics for their decades-spanning work developing neural networks.\n\nThe White House held a summit on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 about the use of AI in life sciences, highlighting how AI enables solutions to complex challenges in ways that impact the world. This trend is likely to continue into next year as generative AI models grow and mature.\n\n5. The environmental tools made with AI won\u2019t offset its energy toll\n\nEnergy efficiency is another buzzword in AI.\n\nBut for every use case in which AI can help predict weather patterns or optimize energy use, there is another story about the environmental cost of building the data centers needed to run generative AI. Such construction requires massive amounts of electricity and water \u2014 and rising global temperatures only compound the problem. It\u2019s unlikely an equilibrium will be reached in this large-scale problem.\n\nFor businesses, though, expect to see companies touting dubious and genuine claims of energy savings and environmental friendliness around AI. Consider the resource use attached to your organization\u2019s AI strategy.\n\nWhat are the most popular generative AI products?\n\nThe most well-known generative AI products are:\n\nChatGPT, the OpenAI chatbot\n\nGoogle Gemini\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nGPT-4, the large language model behind ChatGPT\n\nDALL-E 3, an image generator\n\nWhat is the most advanced generative AI?\n\nVarious tests have been proposed as potential criteria for determining the most advanced generative AI. Some organizations rate their models on human educational benchmarks, such as the International Mathematics Olympiad or Codeforce competitions.\n\nOther evaluations, such as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding, were explicitly created for generative AI. Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra, China Mobile\u2019s Jiutian, and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o sit at the top of the MMLU leaderboard today."
