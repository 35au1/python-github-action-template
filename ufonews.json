        "article_content": "UFO 50 has taken over my life these past few days. When I'm not glued on the simple Windjammers-esque pleasures of Bushido Ball, I'm throwing my great big walrus body around perfect blue skies in Waldorf's Journey. I don't think I'll be able to ever stop playing it. In her review Kerry called it a \" superb retro-style smorgasbord \".\n\nIn addition to hosting 50 8-bit style console games belonging to a fictional 1980s studio, UFO 50 is really dedicated to the fiction of its games' provenance: each has a precise little history, and running through the whole collection are references to other games in the collection. It also has a terminal accessible in the main menu which allows players to enter eight figure codes.\n\n[Word of warning: If you'd prefer to discover all this yourself, be aware that potentially huge spoilers follow.]\n\nWell, players are discovering codes at a rapid rate, both on the Steam community forums and Reddit. Some are merely functional: the prefix EXEC- followed by the relevant four-figure game code will load that game. For example, EXEC-GOLF loads Golfaria. Similarly, the prefix HELP- will bring up a list of commands for the game. You can access GOLF's placement in the full list of games with the LIST-GOLF. If I enter LIST-GOLF, I see this:\n\n(Image credit: Mossmouth)\n\nNote that it only shows 17 entries at a time. If I enter the last game in that list with LIST-OVER, I see all the way up to 50. But what if I try to see beyond 50? Well, there's apparently a 51st game with the codename MIAS.\n\n(Image credit: Mossmouth)\n\nThis isn't the only way to discover the 51st game by the way. One Reddit user found the code in Barbuta, which is the first game in the UFO 50 menu and, if you don't mind me saying so, a huge glorious pain in my arse. There's also this Reddit thread with a bizarrely elaborate chain of events leading up to the discovery of EXEC-MIAS and beyond that I haven't followed myself, though suffice to say, there are other related codes that aren't just shortcuts.\n\nWhat is the 51st UFO 50 game? Well, it starts in a basement. The player character is a confused-looking humanoid frog, and after a bit of prodding around they discover they've been locked in the basement. It has a slightly eerie found footage vibe about it, despite sharing the same 8-bit pixel art as the rest of the games in the collection. After a few interactions you'll be able to access a computer in the basement which provides access to what seems to be a prototype version of Paint Chase.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

How deep does it go, how many prototypes can I access, and what the heck else is UFO 50 hiding? Needless to say, I'm as obsessed as I was when Spelunky HD still had hidden secrets."

Kristen Gillibrand, who chairs the subcommittee on emerging threats and capabilities and who helped establish the Pentagon's UFO-hunting office, told the website that the hearing would likely be held in November.\n\nWhen it comes to his own beliefs about or experiences with extraterrestrials, the one-time contender for Kamala Harris' running mate fell short of answering definitively.\n\n\"I get these questions all the time,\" Kelly said. \"People think as I've been to space, maybe I have this special insight, or maybe I've seen something.\"\n\n\"While I've spent time orbiting the Earth,\" he continued, \"I haven't.\"\n\nIt's far from a smoking gun, but a senator and former astronaut saying the US should be paying closer attention to UFOs almost certainly carries more credibility than an ex-military official who claims the Department of Defense is hoarding alien tech.\n\nMore on UFOs: Government Whistleblower Says There Was a Secret Pentagon Program to \"Trap\" UFOs"

        "article_content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly transitioned from science fiction to reality, reshaping industries, enhancing productivity, and creating novel opportunities for growth. In recent years, the development of intelligent applications powered by AI has become a focal point in technology. Businesses, governments, and individuals now rely on AI-based systems to solve complex problems, optimize operations, and even predict future trends.\n\nUnderstanding Artificial Intelligence Development\n\nArtificial Intelligence is a broad field encompassing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and more. At its core, AI development involves building systems that can process data, learn from it, and then use that information to make intelligent decisions. While many are familiar with AI as a technology, the process of developing intelligent applications is both fascinating and intricate. It requires a deep understanding of algorithms, data science, and how machines can simulate human reasoning.\n\nKey Components of AI Development\n\nThe creation of AI-based applications is a step-by-step process that includes several essential elements. Each component plays a crucial role in determining the success of the application. Let\u2019s break down the key components that contribute to AI development:\n\nData Collection and Processing\n\nAI systems need data to learn. This data can come from various sources, including databases, sensors, or even social media. The quality of data is crucial because any bias or inaccuracy can lead to poor AI performance. After collecting the data, it must be processed, cleaned, and normalized. This ensures the data is in a format that the AI algorithms can understand.\n\nAlgorithm Selection\n\nAlgorithms are the foundation of AI systems. These mathematical models allow machines to learn patterns from data. Choosing the right algorithm depends on the type of problem the AI application is meant to solve. For instance, deep learning algorithms are suitable for tasks like image recognition, while reinforcement learning is ideal for training models in decision-making scenarios.\n\nTraining the Model\n\nOnce the data is collected and the algorithm is selected, the next step is training the model. Training involves feeding the data into the algorithm and allowing it to learn from the patterns. During this phase, the model makes predictions and compares them to actual outcomes. Adjustments are made continuously until the model can accurately predict results.\n\nEvaluation and Testing\n\nAfter training, the model needs to be tested for accuracy and reliability. Various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, are used to assess the model\u2019s performance. Developers may also use test data sets to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure the model performs well under different conditions.\n\nDeployment\n\nThe final stage of AI development is deploying the trained model into a real-world environment. This could be a mobile application, website, or even an embedded system. The AI model must be scalable and capable of handling large amounts of data in real-time.\n\nCreating Intelligent Applications: A Step-by-Step Process\n\nBuilding intelligent applications that utilize AI technology is not as simple as writing a few lines of code. It involves a thorough understanding of AI principles and a well-thought-out development strategy. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to creating intelligent applications:\n\nStep 1: Define the Problem and Use Case\n\nThe first step in developing an AI application is defining the problem you aim to solve. Intelligent applications are purpose-driven, meaning they are designed to address specific needs or improve processes. This step involves identifying the pain points, understanding user requirements, and outlining the potential impact of the AI solution.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re developing an AI-based customer support chatbot, your goal might be to reduce customer wait times and improve response accuracy. By clearly defining the use\n\n-case, you create a focused development path for your AI project.\n\nStep 2: Gather and Analyze Data\n\nData is the lifeblood of AI applications. After identifying the problem, the next step is gathering relevant data. This data can be historical, real-time, structured, or unstructured, depending on the nature of the application. For instance, if you\u2019re building a recommendation system, you\u2019ll need user behavior data such as purchase history, search patterns, and demographics.\n\nData analysis follows data collection. It involves identifying trends, patterns, and outliers that might influence how the AI model is trained. Data scientists and AI engineers often use statistical techniques and visualization tools to better understand the dataset. Data analysis not only improves model training but also highlights potential issues, such as data bias or missing values.\n\nStep 3: Choose the Right Technology Stack\n\nChoosing the right technology stack is crucial for AI development. The stack typically includes programming languages, frameworks, and platforms that support the development of AI models and applications. Popular programming languages for AI development include Python, R, and Java due to their extensive libraries and ease of use.\n\nFor machine learning models, frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn are widely used. Meanwhile, cloud platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud provide powerful infrastructure to scale AI applications. The choice of the technology stack depends on factors like the complexity of the AI task, budget, and the expertise of the development team.\n\nStep 4: Develop the AI Model\n\nThe next step is developing the AI model itself. This begins with selecting the appropriate algorithm based on the problem at hand. Common AI models include decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors, among others. Some models, like neural networks, are suited for tasks requiring high levels of abstraction, such as image recognition or natural language processing.\n\nDevelopers will often experiment with multiple models and tune their parameters to find the best fit. The goal here is to optimize the model\u2019s performance on training data while avoiding overfitting\u2014a situation where the model becomes too tailored to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n\nStep 5: Train and Validate the Model\n\nTraining the AI model is an iterative process. The selected data is fed into the model, and through learning algorithms, the model begins to recognize patterns. Depending on the type of AI being developed (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning), the model adjusts its predictions and refines its internal parameters.\n\nAfter training, validation is conducted using a separate dataset. This step is critical because it ensures that the model can generalize well to new data. It helps developers fine-tune the model\u2019s hyperparameters and minimize errors, thus improving accuracy.\n\nStep 6: Integration with the Application\n\nOnce the AI model is trained and validated, it\u2019s integrated into the main application. The integration phase involves connecting the AI model to the user interface (UI) and ensuring that it functions seamlessly with other application components, such as databases, APIs, and external systems.\n\nFor example, an AI-based recommendation engine in an e-commerce platform would need to fetch real-time data from user accounts, match it against product catalogs, and then deliver personalized recommendations through the UI. Ensuring smooth integration across different platforms is critical for user satisfaction and application performance.\n\nStep 7: Testing and Iteration\n\nTesting is a crucial step in AI development. Once the AI model is integrated into the application, rigorous testing must be performed. Testing AI systems is different from traditional software because AI models evolve and learn from data, meaning their behavior can change over time.\n\nDevelopers conduct both functional and non-functional testing. Functional testing ensures the AI application meets its objectives and produces expected outputs. Non-functional testing evaluates performance aspects like speed, scalability, and security. This is followed by iterations where adjustments are made based on feedback and testing results.\n\nStep 8: Monitoring and Continuous Learning\n\nAI applications demand continuous monitoring and updates. Once developers deploy the model, they should regularly monitor it for accuracy, efficiency, and relevance. In many cases, retraining AI systems with new data becomes necessary as it becomes available. Continuous learning plays a crucial role in AI development because the real-world environment constantly evolves.\n\nFor instance, a chatbot must learn new conversational patterns or phrases over time to remain relevant and improve user interactions. Developers must ensure they regularly update the application to maintain optimal functionality.\n\nChallenges in AI Development\n\nAI development, though promising, is not without its challenges. Some common hurdles include:\n\nData Quality Issues:\n\nAI systems are only as good as the data they\u2019re trained on. Poor-quality data leads to inaccurate predictions or biased models, making data collection and processing a critical task.\n\nComplexity in Model Building: Developing AI models that generalize well across diverse datasets can be challenging. Overfitting, underfitting, and tuning hyperparameters are some of the difficulties developers encounter.\n\nComputational Costs:\n\nAI models, especially those based on deep learning, require significant computational resources. This can be costly, particularly for startups or smaller organizations. Cloud-based solutions have mitigated this to an extent, but large-scale AI applications still demand considerable infrastructure.\n\nEthical and Privacy Concerns:\n\nAs AI systems become more integrated into daily life, ethical considerations such as data privacy, job displacement, and bias in AI algorithms are growing concerns. Developers need to ensure that AI systems are transparent, fair, and respect user privacy.\n\nThe Future of AI in Intelligent Applications\n\nArtificial Intelligence is continually evolving, and its role in intelligent applications will only grow more significant. As AI technologies like natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision advance, the possibilities for AI-driven applications expand. From healthcare to finance to customer service, AI is reshaping how we approach problem-solving.\n\nLooking ahead, we can expect further innovations such as more advanced conversational AI systems, autonomous vehicles, and AI-powered solutions that will continue to redefine industries. With the combination of faster computing power, enhanced algorithms, and vast amounts of data, the future of intelligent applications is bright.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe development of intelligent applications using AI is a multi-faceted process requiring careful planning, skilled execution, and continuous learning. From defining the problem and gathering data to deploying the final model, AI development encompasses numerous stages that determine the success of the application. While challenges exist, the potential of AI to transform industries is undeniable. As AI technologies mature, intelligent applications will play an even more vital role in our day-to-day lives, offering smarter, more efficient solutions to complex problems."

        "source": "The Hans India",
        "article_content": "The majority of horror shows often focus on sensationalized fear. Ugly and unsettling visuals and intense traumatic scenarios take center stage, making emotional storytelling an actual fear taking over viewers. Breaking away from this typical trend, MTV Dark Scroll- Muqabla Anjaan Se, India\u2019s premier paranormal reality show, seeks to redefine the genre by offering an authentic and chilling experience. Hosted by Amit Sadh, the show features nine seekers exploring seven haunted locations in Uttarakhand, guided by renowned paranormal expert Sarbajeet Mohanty and psychic Pooja Vijay.\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with The Hans India, Amit Sadh speaks about MTV Dark Scroll, a first-of-its-kind show in India, redefining the very definition of fear. He also shares insights from his personal journey on the show.\n\nQ1: What inspired you to host MTV Dark Scroll, India\u2019s first paranormal reality show?\n\nWhen the team from MTV approached me about hosting \u2018Dark Scroll\u2019, I was initially surprised. I had never hosted before in my life. However, the concept of exploring the unknown and engaging with viewers on topics that push boundaries really resonated with me. Also, the fact that it\u2019s a premier paranormal reality show added an exciting layer, offering a chance to present something both innovative and impactful. Further, the team\u2019s scientific and practical approach to the subject was something that really drew me in.\n\nQ2: How did the presence of paranormal research experts Sarbajeet Mohanty and Pooja Vijay shape the overall direction of the show?\n\nSarbajeet and Pooja brought incredible expertise to the show. Their knowledge of paranormal phenomena added depth to our investigations. They guided our seekers with advanced techniques and equipment, which helped us approach each location with a serious and respectful mindset. Their insights shaped not just the direction of the show but also my understanding of the paranormal.\n\nQ3: What factors influenced the decision to choose Uttarakhand as a primary location for the show\u2019s explorations?\n\nI've always believed that the mountains possess a unique magnetism and energy, which makes them a powerful backdrop for paranormal activity. The old saying \u2018the hills have eyes\u2019 truly resonates with me; there's something about the vastness and mystery of the mountains that seems to draw entities to manifest themselves. Each site we visited had a unique story. The mountains not only provide a stunning visual landscape but also enhance the emotional and spiritual weight of our investigations, making Uttarakhand an ideal setting for the first season of \u2018Dark Scroll\u2019.\n\nQ4: While filming Dark Scroll did you ever feel a shift in your perception of reality, even momentarily? How did you regain your sense of normalcy?\n\nI mean, when you're surrounded by the haunting echoes of the past and the palpable energy of the mountains, it\u2019s hard not to feel a shift in awareness. But here's the thing: I was more focused on the seekers and their journeys than on my own sense of normalcy. After all, in the face of the paranormal, it\u2019s the seekers who need the guidance, and I\u2019m just here to help them navigate through the shadows.\n\nQ5: Recently, one of the seekers experienced something unexplainable. How do you and the team handle such situations?\n\nWhen something unexplainable happens, we approach it with both curiosity and caution. We discuss the experience as a team, analyzing what occurred and how we can understand it better. It's important to keep an open mind while also grounding ourselves in research and rationality. And most importantly we have to be humane - I also feel deeply protective of the seekers and I understand this is a show but I want to ensure they all go back unharmed. I also want to compliment the seekers here because even when things got really tough for them they helped each other out as well.\n\nQ6: Can you share a specific moment or encounter from the show that genuinely unsettled you?\n\nThere were several moments where we felt the presence of the paranormal, but one that stands out was during an investigation at the haunted tea estate. It was not just me, even the crew could feel something was amiss. So on most locations I had to do a photoshoot for marketing and I was fine going into almost each location but here - at the tea estate - I didn\u2019t go inside, the vibe of the place was very off.\n\nQ7: How do you think Dark Scroll, as a pioneering reality TV show, is redefining the portrayal of fear, an element used to engage audiences in the paranormal genre?\n\nYes, it is remarkably redefining fear by focusing on genuine investigations rather than sensationalism. We aim to engage audiences by encouraging them to explore their fears and the unknown thoughtfully. By presenting real experiences and expert insights, we hope to foster a deeper understanding of fear and what it means to confront the unknown."

This newly identified species, scientifically named Sueviota aethon , measures less than 2 centimetres long and has been aptly dubbed the \u2018 grumpy dwarfgoby .\u2019 Found among coral reefs, the fish makes its home in small holes and crevices.The discovery was led by Dr.Viktor Nunes Peinemann during a diving expedition to explore the biodiversity of coral reef fishes. The first specimens were found in Saudi Arabia \u2019s Farasan Banks and near Thuwal in the Red Sea.The discovery of this species highlights the vast amount of marine biodiversity still awaiting exploration, emphasising the importance of conservation efforts to protect these delicate ecosystems.Despite its small stature, the grumpy dwarfgoby makes a bold impression. With pronounced canines and a fierce demeanour, it seems to project an air of defiance. Luc\u00eda Pombo-Ayora, who helped name the species, described the fish as \"a fearsome predator in its own tiny world.\u201d Its formidable appearance is amplified by its large canines, which are used to prey on tiny invertebrates.The grumpy dwarfgoby\u2019s vibrant red colour stands out to human eyes but serves as excellent camouflage in its natural habitat. It inhabits sections of coral reefs covered in red coralline algae, where it moves between small crevices and holes for cover. This coloration strategy helps the fish blend seamlessly into its surroundings, providing both protection and a tactical advantage in hunting.Dr. Viktor Nunes Peinemann spearheaded the discovery of this new species during a diving expedition aimed at exploring coral reef diversity. The first specimens were identified in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Farasan Banks, followed by another find near Thuwal in the Red Sea.Initially, the researchers thought they had rediscovered the fiery dwarfgoby (Sueviota pyrios), known from a solitary specimen collected in 1972. However, further analysis revealed that they had stumbled upon an entirely new species.According to Earth.com, Dr. Peinemann emphasises the urgency of these conservation efforts, implying that the ongoing discovery of distinctive new species like this speaks volume on how much biodiversity remains undiscovered in the Red Sea. However, he also noted that recent environmental changes threaten to extinct some species before their discovery.This unique environment is under severe threat from climate change, leading to widespread coral bleaching and ecological disruption. The continued discovery of new species underscores the critical need for ongoing research and conservation efforts to protect these delicate ecosystems.Protecting the grumpy dwarfgoby involves more than safeguarding its immediate habitat. Broader reef ecosystems must be preserved through measures such as establishing marine protected areas, regulating fishing activities, and promoting responsible tourism. Advancing scientific research and fostering public education on marine biodiversity are also crucial for galvanising support for conservation.The identification of the grumpy dwarfgoby opens exciting avenues for marine exploration and biodiversity research. The Red Sea, despite being well-studied, still holds numerous secrets that could transform our understanding of marine life and conservation strategies."
