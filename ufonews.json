            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "He has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansjurgen Kohler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (Cenap), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says Kohler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office Cenap.\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" Kohler says.\n\nAccording to its director, Cenap has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, Kohler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines). Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa\n\nConspiracy theorists\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, Kohler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

In his article \u201cThings we learned about LLMs in 2024,\u201d he simultaneously susses out how much happened in 2024 and why it\u2019s confusing. For example, we\u2019re all told to aggressively use genAI or risk falling behind, but we\u2019re awash in AI-generated \u201cslop\u201d that no one really wants to read. He also points out that LLMs, although marketed as the easy path to AI riches for all who master them, are actually \u201cchainsaws disguised as kitchen knives.\u201d He explains that \u201cthey look deceptively simple to use \u2026 but in reality you need a huge depth of both understanding and experience to make the most of them and avoid their many pitfalls.\u201d\n\nIf anything, this quagmire got worse in 2024. Incredibly smart people are building incredibly sophisticated systems that leave most developers incredibly frustrated by how to use them effectively. \u201cThe default LLM chat UI is like taking brand-new computer users,\u201d Willison argues, \u201cdropping them into a Linux terminal and expecting them to figure it all out.\u201d It\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s getting worse, not better.\n\nSmall wonder that the biggest AI flops of 2024, as captured by MIT Technology Review, largely relate to our collective inability to turn AI into applications that normal people want to use. Even basic things, like Apple\u2019s attempt to summarize my incoming text messages, are more confusing than useful. Some of this stems from the inability to trust AI to deliver consistent results, but much of it derives from the fact that we keep loading developers up with AI primitives (similar to cloud primitives like storage, networking, and compute) that force them to do the heavy lifting of turning those foundational building blocks into applications."

            "article_content": "AI\u2019s double-edged sword for job seekers\n\nFor job seekers, AI tools have significantly altered how they approach applications, from crafting CVs to interview preparation. With platforms like GPT-4 maker OpenAI offering polished text at the click of a button, the application process has become faster and more accessible.\n\nYet, these same advancements have also heightened competition, creating a new challenge: how to stand out amid a growing \u2018sea of sameness\u2019 in AI-generated applications.\n\nAI tools are undeniably effective at helping candidates get the basics right. A tailored CV can pass through an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that companies use to streamline the recruitment process by automatically screening job applications and resumes. Additionally, auto-generated cover letters can be crafted to align perfectly with job descriptions.\n\nThese tools are particularly beneficial for candidates at the beginning of their careers or those unfamiliar with the conventions of job applications. However, over-reliance on AI often creates generic and impersonal submissions. Hiring managers regularly tell us that such applications are polished but ultimately lack the individuality and personality that make a candidate memorable. Job applicants must ensure that their CV not only passes ATS scanning but also stands out to human reviewers, especially as many applications tend to look alike.\n\nThe efficiency of AI has also lowered the barrier to entry for job applications, enabling people to apply for jobs with minimal effort, leading to a major surge in application volumes, especially at the lower rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\nIn the UK, employers received an average of 140 applications per role for graduate training schemes in 2024 \u2013 a staggering 59% jump from 2023, according to the Institute of Student Employers.\n\nHowever, this ease of application has paradoxically created a more challenging environment for candidates. With employers now inundated with hundreds \u2013 sometimes thousands \u2013 of applications per position, simply meeting basic criteria is no longer enough.\n\nAnother concern is the risk of misrepresentation. Some candidates lean too heavily on AI, exaggerating qualifications or presenting an overly polished image. This can lead to uncomfortable mismatches later in the hiring process, especially during interviews, where authenticity and depth of experience become critical."

            "article_content": "Sonic the Hedgehog 3 hit theaters late last month and has already grossed more than $300 million worldwide, pushing the film series based on Sega\u2019s popular video games past the one-billion mark and making it one of Paramount\u2019s biggest ongoing franchises.\n\nOn January 5, Paramount Pictures put out a press release confirming that the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog film franchise has now made over $1 billion at the box office. That means it\u2019s made more than Halloween, Paranormal Activity, and A Quiet Place.\n\nFor Paramount, Sonic has become a very important franchise at a time when the studio has struggled to squeeze massive blockbusters out of past winners, like Transformers and Star Trek. So it\u2019s not shocking that as Sonic crosses the 1-billion-dollar mark, Paramount is already working on a sequel. The next movie is reportedly arriving in 2027.\n\n\u201cThe Sonic the Hedgehog franchise has become an unstoppable cultural force with limitless potential,\u201d said Paramount Pictures President & CEO Brian Robbins. \u201cCongratulations to our partners at SEGA, our filmmaking team...who have revolutionized the heights that Sonic can reach, and the legions of loyal and devoted fans who have helped guide us every step of the way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt feels like a lifetime ago when the first Sonic the Hedgehog film teaser hit the web and we all got to see that original, ugly CG Sonic that was so monstrous, fans backlashed hard enough to force Paramount and Sega to change the character\u2019s look into something less awful. That first film ended up making $319 million at the box office.\n\nIn 2022, Sonic 2 hit theaters, receiving better reviews and making over $400 million. There was a Knuckles spin-off TV show in early 2024, but nobody talks about that. Then finally, in December, Paramount released Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is one of the highest-rated video game movies in history and has already made more money than the first film in just about two weeks. Pretty good for a hedgehog that runs really fast.\n\n.\n\n\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

            "article_content": "After finding a Ouija board in her new home, a woman has been experiencing strange happenings for the past three months.\n\nIn a five-minute video posted to social media, mother-of-two Brandi Nettleton claims to have \u201cfinally\u201d caught her suspicions on camera. She filmed the seemingly paranormal activity that she has been experiencing ever since she moved into her sister\u2019s house.\n\nFilming herself walking around her new place, Brandi tells viewers she's home alone with her daughter, while her son, who lives in the upstairs part of the house, has left to go to a party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a mimic here for a couple of weeks. When my daughter\u2019s not at home I hear her say my name and she\u2019s not there\u201d, she explains. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s at home but my son is not, and my son is the only one who lives upstairs. All night since he\u2019s been gone I keep hearing the door close but there\u2019s nobody up there.\u201d\n\nImage: Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Image: Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003)\n\nShe then reveals her plan to try and catch the sound on video, and sits in silence, still filming. She begins to talk about how she\u2019s been upstairs to check whenever similar things happen, when her dog begins to bark, which prompts her to slowly walk to the stairs leading up to her son\u2019s bedroom, with the camera facing the ceiling.\n\nViewers can then hear a loud and repetitive clicking sound, followed by a thud. Brandi reacts by walking up the stairs and showing the audience: \u201cLook, nobody\u2019s up here. Oh my god look, his door is closed.\u201d\n\nThe door to her son\u2019s bedroom then clicks open, untouched, and Brandi runs downstairs to tell her daughter what just happened. \u201cIt sounds like somebody\u2019s in your brother's room. I went up there to show that his door was closed. Tell me why his door opened when I went up there. I swear I ran down here by myself, I\u2019m recording it\u201d, she says.\n\nBoth of them then go upstairs to show, with a flashlight, that the upstairs bedroom is empty. Just as they are back on the stairs, the door clicks open again, making mother and daughter scream in horror.\n\nBrandi said she associates the strange occurrences to an Ouija board - an instrument some use to try to call spirits forward - she had found and thrown away upon moving in.\n\n\u201cI found out after my sister moved out that she had a Ouija board here and I found it when I was packing her stuff. I got rid of it right away. There are still things that go on almost every single night\u201d, she explained.\n\nBrandi\u2019s video was viewed by more than three million people across social media platforms, and part of the audience reacted by sharing advice, empathy for her situation, and similar situations they had been through.\n\n\u201cThis is the most in time realistic non staged video I think I\u2019ve seen\u201d, one commented. Another advised: \u201cRemember if you are scared they tend to react more\u201d.\n\nOne user shared: \u201cI lived in a home with three roommates. We all experienced it. The day we all decided to move out was when we heard it repeat. 'HELLO' four or five times as well as children giggling.\u201d\n\nA commenter joked that the \u201cmimic\u201d - believed by some to be a spiritual entity with the ability to imitate its surroundings or other creatures - would be happy with the family\u2019s scared reactions. Brandi then responded: \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t doubt it and what sucks is I respond to it because it\u2019s my daughter\u2019s voice and it\u2019s just an automatic response. I don\u2019t know how not to.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Aaron Taylor-Johnson in \"28 Years Later\" and M3gan in \"M3GAN 2.0.\" Sony Pictures Releasing/Universal Pictures\n\nBuzzy horror movies coming this year include sequels like \"M3GAN 2.0\" and \"28 Years Later.\"\n\nThere are also originals like \"Sinners\" and \"The Monkey.\"\n\nTwo separate Frankenstein adaptations are also in the works.\n\n2024 was a great year for horror movies, and 2025 is shaping up to be a solid one too.\n\nLast year, several of the best new horror movies were among the top 50 highest-grossing films of the year in the US. That included long-running franchise titles like \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" and \"Alien: Romulus,\" buzzy sequels like \"Smile 2\" and \"Terrifier 3,\" and surprise original hits like \"Longlegs.\"\n\nThis year, it appears that IP is king once again. \"Saw XI\" and a long-gestating sequel to the 1997 slasher \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" are on the docket, while James Wan's hit \"Conjuring\" franchise is set to take its final bow.\n\nThere's also a new film adaptation of a Stephen King story from \"Longlegs\" director Osgood Perkins, plus two different \"Frankenstein\" adaptations.\n\nBelow, Business Insider reporters Eammon Jacobs and Caralynn Matassa break down their most anticipated horror movies of 2025.\n\n\"Wolf Man\"\n\nJulia Garner as Charlotte and Christopher Abbott as Blake in \"Wolf Man.\" Universal Pictures\n\nRelease date: January 17, 2025\n\nUniversal is continuing to reinvent its vault of classic horror monsters with the \"Wolf Man\" remake.\n\nThe first trailer for the film sees Blake (Christopher Abbott) move his family to his childhood home after his father's disappearance.\n\nOnce they arrive, the family locks themselves inside the home after Blake gets attacked by a creature outside. He then begins to change into \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a werewolf.\n\nIt sounds pretty predictable, but director Leigh Whannell managed to weave a haunting level of relevance into \"The Invisible Man\" back in 2020, so we'll see if he has something special up his sleeve for \"Wolf Man.\"\n\n\"Companion\"\n\nSophie Thatcher stars in \"Companion.\" Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nRelease date: January 31, 2025\n\nThe trailer for \"Companion\" is creepy and vague, giving virtually no indication of what the movie is about (other than a promise that it's \"a new kind of love story\"). That secrecy has certainly piqued interest in it.\n\nOn top of the minimal plot details (a tactic that worked incredibly well for \"Longlegs\" at the box office), the pedigree behind this title is a big draw. It was produced by the filmmakers behind the buzzy 2022 horror hit \"Barbarian,\" including director Zach Cregger, and stars \"Yellowjackets\" breakout Sophie Thatcher (also known for her horror roles in \"The Boogeyman\" and \"Heretic\") and \"The Boys\" actor Jack Quaid.\n\n\"The Monkey\"\n\nTheo James plays twin brothers in \"The Monkey.\" Neon\n\nRelease date: February 21, 2025\n\nAfter the unexpected success of \"Longlegs\" at the box office, fans don't have to wait very long for director Osgood Perkins' follow-up. He's re-teaming with again Neon (who snagged the film in a reportedly competitive deal) on \"The Monkey,\" about twin brothers Hal and Bill (Theo James in dual roles) who are terrorized by their father's old toy monkey after finding it in the attic.\n\nAs if the excitement over Perkins as a rising horror icon isn't enough, the movie is also an adaptation of a Stephen King story.\n\n\"Sinners\"\n\nMichael B. Jordan and Miles Caton in \"Sinners.\" Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nRelease Date: March 7, 2025\n\nMichael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler's names alone should be enough to get anyone excited for \"Sinners.\"\n\nThrow in the creepy trailer set in a small, seemingly post-WWII town beset by an evil force, plus Jordan playing a pair of twin brothers next to Hailee Steinfeld and Wunmi Mosaku, and the film easily earns its place on this list.\n\nIt's rumored to be a vampire movie, but the footage cleverly hides its fangs if that's the case. \"Sinners\" seems to be a mystery box of sorts, considering that at the end of the trailer, a DJ and a boom-box can be seen in the crowd \u2014 which obviously don't match the rest of the old-timey setting.\n\n\"28 Years Later\"\n\nAaron Taylor Johnson and Alfie Williams in \"28 Years Later.\" Sony Pictures Releasing\n\nRelease date: June 20, 2025\n\nAs the title might suggest, \"28 Years Later\" takes place several decades after Danny Boyle's game-changing \"28 Days Later,\" which delivered a pulse-pounding vision of a modern zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe haunting first trailer showed a rural community that survived the virus by living on an isolated British island. Two of those survivors are played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and teenage star Alfie Williams.\n\nIn October, actor Ralph Fiennes teased that the film follows a young boy in northern England who goes looking for a doctor who can help his dying mother.\n\n\"M3GAN 2.0\"\n\nM3GAN in \"M3GAN 2.0.\" Geoffrey Short/Universal Pictures\n\nRelease date: June 27, 2025\n\nGet ready for more viral dances and brutal violence, because everyone's favorite killer robot toy is back in \"M3GAN 2.0.\"\n\nPlot details are scarce, but Allison Williams and Violet McGraw are reprising their roles as Gemma and Cady, the aunt and niece who faced off with the malevolent doll in the first movie.\n\nPresumably, it'll involve M3GAN trying to replace Gemma as Cady's guardian following the violent ending to the first film. Regardless, Amie Donald is also returning to physically play the android, and Jenna Davis is voicing her again.\n\n\"I Never Forget What You Did Last Summer\" (rumored title)\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt in \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\" Columbia Pictures\n\nRelease date: July 18, 2025\n\n\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" is getting a follow-up nearly 30 years after its release.\n\nThe 1997 slasher followed four teens (played by '90s icons Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr.) who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer a year after they seemingly killed a man in a hit-and-run accident.\n\nThe not-good sequel released a year later (\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\") took the murder-y action to the Bahamas. It was later followed by the (also not good) direct-to-video \"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer\" in 2006, which had nothing to do with the previous two movies. Neither indicated a promising future for the franchise.\n\nThe upcoming movie, expected to be a direct follow-up to \"I Still Know\u2026,\" has had an interesting journey. Mike Flanagan was originally set to reboot the first movie, but those plans were eventually canned. After years of languishing in development hell, the fourth film directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson was officially announced.\n\nThere are no plot details yet, but original stars Hewitt and Prinze Jr. are both set to reprise their roles. Chase Sui Wonders, Madelyn Cline, Sarah Pidgeon, Tyriq Withers, and Jonah Hauer-King also star, according to Deadline.\n\n\"The Conjuring: Last Rites\"\n\nPatrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in \"The Conjuring.\" Warner Bros.\n\nRelease date: September 5, 2025\n\nThe highest-grossing horror movie franchise of all time is back for one final face-off with the forces of darkness.\n\nThe franchise, which kicked off in 2013 with the first film directed by James Wan, stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, famed paranormal investigators. Each film took its inspiration from a real-life case the Warrens were involved in. Its success even spawned multiple other offshoot series within the shared \"Conjuring Universe,\" including the \"Annabelle\" and \"The Nun\" movies.\n\nPlot details are scarce, but it's being billed as a finale of sorts, meaning Ed and Lorraine's story is likely to come to an end. Whether that means one or both of them die in the process remains to be seen.\n\n\"The Bride!\"\n\nJessie Buckley as the Bride in \"The Bride!\" Nico Tavernise/Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nRelease date: September 26, 2025\n\nThe first of the two \"Frankenstein\" movies on this list is Maggie Gyllenhaal's \"The Bride!\" This one isn't a direct adaptation, though \u2014 it's a horror musical set in 1930s Chicago and stars Christian Bale as Frankenstein's monster and Jessie Buckley as the bride of Frankenstein's monster.\n\nYes, that's right: a horror musical.\n\nPenelope Cruz, Jake Gyllenhaal, Annette Bening, Peter Sarsgaard, and John Magaro also star.\n\n\"Saw XI\"\n\nTobin Bell as John Kramer aka the Jigsaw Killer. Lionsgate\n\nRelease Date: September 27, 2025\n\nLove them or hate them, it's hard to deny that any new \"Saw\" movie is an interesting idea purely because it's hard to imagine how someone will be able to top the previous chapter.\n\n\"Saw XI\" will be directed by Kevin Greutert. Greutert previously helmed the 2023 prequel \"Saw X,\" which followed John Kramer (Tobin Bell) as he tortured a group that cons cancer patients.\n\nProducer Oren Koules told GamesRadar+ that \"Saw XI\" might be a direct sequel to \"Saw X.\"\n\n\"Cecilia is still alive and Tobin and Shawnee are in a foreign country still,\" he said. \"So that, to me, would be the natural place to take at least the next one.\"\n\n\"The Black Phone 2\"\n\nEthan Hawke in \"The Black Phone.\" Universal\n\nRelease Date: October 25, 2025\n\nScott Derrickson is calling up some scares again with \"The Black Phone 2.\" It's a direct sequel to the 2021 movie, which starred Mason Thames as a young boy who gets kidnapped by The Grabber (Ethan Hawke) and finds that the ghosts of the serial killer's past victims are trying to help him escape.\n\nHawke's terrifying performance (and that incredibly creepy mask) make the idea of a sequel very tantalizing.\n\nDerrickson and his co-writer, C. Robert Cargill, have yet to reveal what will bring The Grabber back to the big screen, but both Hawke and Thames will reprise their roles.\n\n\"Five Nights at Freddy's 2\"\n\nFoxy, Chica, Freddy Fazbear, and Bonnie in \"Five Nights at Freddy's.\" Patti Perret/Universal Pictures\n\nRelease date: December 5, 2025\n\nThe \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" follow-up might be one of Blumhouse's biggest hits of the year, if the success of the first film is any indication.\n\nThe first movie, an adaptation of the popular video game franchise of the same name, was a surprise hit at the box office when it was released in 2023. It focused on Mike (Josh Hutcherson), a security guard with a dark past who ends up facing off with animatronics possessed by dead kids (and William Afton, the serial killer who murdered them) at a Chuck E. Cheese-like pizza restaurant.\n\nHutcherson and Matthew Lillard, who played Afton, are both set to return for the sequel.\n\n\"Frankenstein\"\n\nA photo of Oscar Isaac in \"Frankenstein\" via Vanity Fair. Ken Woroner/Netflix/Vanity Fair\n\nRelease date: TBD 2025\n\nA Guillermo del Toro horror movie is always something of an event. (See: \"Blade II,\" \"Hellboy,\" \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" and \"Crimson Peak,\" for example.) In 2025, he'll deliver his version of \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix, featuring a monstrously talented cast.\n\nMost importantly, \"Dune\" star Oscar Isaac will play Victor Frankenstein opposite \"Euphoria\" actor Jacob Elordi as Frankenstein's monster.\n\nThey're joined by Christoph Waltz, Mia Goth, Ralph Ineson, Lars Mikkelsen, and David Bradley.\n\nGiven the director's love of practical effects and creature design, this take on the well-trodden \"Frankenstein\" could be something truly special.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jin Yi (Jeanie) Tan told the school children she was supervising for a science outreach programme \u2018you can collect anything you want\u2019, she didn\u2019t expect one to bring in goose droppings. She also wasn\u2019t expecting the programme to lead them to a new cytotoxic peptide.\n\nTan, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Brian Murphy\u2019s lab from the University of Illinois Chicago, US, leads a team of researchers in an outreach collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, one of the city\u2019s oldest youth development organisations. With 21 locations, and 20,000 young members, the clubs provide resources and support to aid members\u2019 personal and professional development. So far the team has worked with two local branches: the Bartlett J McCartin club and the James R Jordan club, the latter of which is named after Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan\u2019s late father.\n\nThe 14-week after-school programme, termed the Chicago antibiotic discovery lab, offers middle school students (aged 11\u201313 ) from underrepresented communities, a hands-on learning experience searching for potential antibiotics in their own neighbourhoods . Funded by the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant that Tan received for her PhD, the programme teaches the fundamentals of microbiology research, from sample collection to laboratory analysis. Students are also introduced to environmental issues, engineering, robotics and related careers. \u2018We\u2019ve done four different cohorts of this programme, constantly tweaking stuff to make things better,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018One of our strengths is that the programme is very small, allowing us to give one-to-one mentoring and tailor the work to the students\u2019 interests.\u2019\n\nSemi-automated\n\nTan\u2019s PhD project focusses on finding new antibiotics to combat multi-drug resistance by harnessing antimicrobial toxins secreted by other bacteria. She has developed a pipeline for screening bioactive compounds from the natural environment, \u2018integrating things like robotics, bioassays and bioinformatics to create a streamlined workflow\u2019, she explains. This approach simplifies the initial stages of microbial drug discovery by allowing steps to be carried out in a semi-automated manner, making it safe and accessible enough to be taught to middle school students. \u2018The researchers were very good at mentoring the students \u2026 [the students] were constantly supervised and because of the robotics, had no interaction with hazardous bacteria,\u2019 adds Jonathon Rodriguez, the technology program manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.\n\nThe mentor team encourages students to carry out each stage of the process autonomously \u2013 instilling a sense of ownership over their results. While some students collect samples from lake water or flowers, others get more creative, swabbing everything from air conditioning filters to playground slides. \u2018The kids are always collecting the weirdest stuff t hey can find,\u2019 says Tan.\n\nStudents then program a robot to isolate the bacterial colonies grown from their samples and test the ability of each one to prevent the growth of multi-drug resistant bacteria. \u2018At first when they look at the environmental bacteria plates, they are really grossed out,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018But after five minutes, they\u2019ll be looking really closely? Like \u201cwait, what\u2019s this one? Why is this one pink?\u201d It\u2019s exciting for them to be able to understand microbiology and that they can produce medicines.\u2019\n\nTan successfully isolated a new anti-bacterial compound from Pseudomonas idahonensis, a bacterium cultured from the goose dropping sample. It turned out to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that they named orfamide N . Using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis she elucidated the structure of the new bioactive molecule. It comprises 10 mixed D- and L-amino acids and a distinct lipid tail, which sets it apart from other known orfamides and is thought to contribute to its biological activity. While the peptide demonstrated minimal antibacterial activity, it showed cytotoxicity in bioassays against human cancer cell lines, warranting further investigation in its application for cancer therapy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really happy and grateful that I was able to merge two big interests of mine and showed that this can happen. Biomedical research and Stem outreach can lead to a publication ,\u2019 says Tan. The research, published in the journal ACS Omega, lists the the student who collected the goose dropping sample as a co-author, underscoring their integral role in this discovery. \u2018The student was really excited about it,\u2019 adds Rodriguez.\n\nAs the project continues into its third year, the team hopes its approach can serve as a model for university\u2013community partnerships elsewhere. \u2018There is often a disconnect between a university and the neighbouring communities it should serve,\u2019 says Murphy. \u2018Both teams are learning about one another and building trust, and that barrier that typically exists between university and community is being systematically broken down.\u2019"

            "article_content": "OpenAI has announced that its primary focus for the coming year will be on developing \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d according to a blog post from Sam Altman. This has been described as AI with greater-than-human capabilities.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s current suite of products has a vast array of capabilities, Altman said that superintelligence will enable users to perform \u201canything else.\u201d He highlights accelerating scientific discovery as the primary example, which, he believes, will lead to the betterment of society.\n\n\u201cThis sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. That\u2019s alright\u2014we\u2019ve been there before and we\u2019re OK with being there again,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe change of direction has been spurred by Altman\u2019s confidence in his company now knowing \u201chow to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is typically defined as a system that matches human capabilities, whereas superintelligence exceeds them.\n\nSEE: OpenAI\u2019s Sora: Everything You Need to Know\n\nAltman has eyed superintelligence for years \u2014 but concerns exist\n\nOpenAI has been referring to superintelligence for several years when discussing the risks of AI systems and aligning them with human values. In July 2023, OpenAI announced it was hiring researchers to work on containing superintelligent AI.\n\nThe team would reportedly devote 20% of OpenAI\u2019s total computing power to training what they call a human-level automated alignment researcher to keep future AI products in line. Concerns around superintelligent AI stem from how such a system could prove impossible to control and may not share human values.\n\n\u201cWe need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us,\u201d wrote OpenAI Head of Alignment Jan Leike and co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in a blog post at the time.\n\nSEE: OpenAI and Anthropic Sign Deals With U.S. AI Safety Institute\n\nBut, four months after creating the team, another company post revealed they \u201cstill (did) not know how to reliably steer and control superhuman AI systems\u201d and didn\u2019t have a way of \u201cpreventing (a superintelligent AI) from going rogue.\u201d\n\nIn May, OpenAI\u2019s superintelligence safety team was disbanded and several senior personnel left due to the concern that \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\u201d including Jan Leike and the team\u2019s co-lead Ilya Sutskever. The team\u2019s work was absorbed by OpenAI\u2019s other research efforts, according to Wired.\n\nDespite this, Altman highlighted the importance of safety to OpenAI in his blog post. \u201cWe continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications.\u201d\n\nThe path to superintelligence may still be years away\n\nThere is disagreement about how long it will be until superintelligence is achieved. The November 2023 blog post said it could develop within a decade. But nearly a year later, Altman said it could be \u201ca few thousand days away.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brent Smolinski, IBM VP and global head of Technology and Data Strategy, said this was \u201ctotally exaggerated,\u201d in a company post from September 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re even in the right zip code for getting to superintelligence,\u201d he said.\n\nAI still requires much more data than humans to learn a new capability, is limited in the scope of capabilities, and does not possess consciousness or self-awareness, which Smolinski views as a key indicator of superintelligence.\n\nHe also claims that quantum computing could be the only way we might unlock AI that surpasses human intelligence. At the start of the decade, IBM predicted that quantum would begin to solve real business problems before 2030.\n\nSEE: Breakthrough in Quantum Cloud Computing Ensures its Security and Privacy\n\nAltman predicts AI agents will join the workforce in 2025\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions or make decisions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads.\n\nTechRepublic predicted at the end of the year that the use of AI agents will surge in 2025. Altman echoes this in his blog post, saying \u201cwe may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies.\u201d\n\nSEE: IBM: Enterprise IT Facing Imminent AI Agent Revolution\n\nAccording to a research paper by Gartner, the first industry agents to dominate will be software development. \u201cExisting AI coding assistants gain maturity, and AI agents provide the next set of incremental benefits,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nBy 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, according to the Gartner paper. A fifth of online store interactions and at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be conducted by agents by that year.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important.\u201d"

When OpenAI achieves this, Microsoft will lose access to its technology, per an agreement between the two companies.\n\nSo which definition might Altman be referring to? He didn\u2019t specify, but the former seems likeliest. Altman wrote that he thinks AI agents \u2014 AI systems that can perform certain tasks autonomously \u2014 may \u201cjoin the workforce,\u201d in a manner of speaking, and \u201cmaterially change the output of companies\u201d this year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s also true that today\u2019s AI technology is significantly limited. It hallucinates, for one; it makes mistakes obvious to any human; and it can be very expensive.\n\nAltman seems confident all this can be overcome \u2014 and quickly. Still, if there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve learned about AI from the past few years, it\u2019s that timelines can shift.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cGiven the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company. How lucky and humbling it is to be able to play a role in this work.\u201d\n\nOne would hope that as OpenAI telegraphs its shift in focus to what it considers to be superintelligence, the company would devote sufficient resources to ensuring superintelligent systems behave safely.\n\nOpenAI has written several times about how successfully transitioning to a world with superintelligence is \u201cfar from guaranteed,\u201d and that it doesn\u2019t have all the answers. \u201c[W]e don\u2019t have a solution for steering or controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post dated July 2023. \u201c[H]umans won\u2019t be able to reliably supervise AI systems much smarter than us, and so our current alignment techniques will not scale to superintelligence.\u201d\n\nSince that post, however, OpenAI has disbanded teams that were focused on AI safety, including superintelligent systems safety, and seen several influential safety-focused researchers depart. Several of these staffers cited OpenAI\u2019s increasingly commercial ambitions as the reason for their departure. The company is currently undergoing a corporate restructuring to make it more attractive to outside investors.\n\nAsked in a recent interview about critics who say OpenAI isn\u2019t focused enough on safety, Altman responded, \u201cI\u2019d point to our track record.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Sunday said that the company is currently losing money on its $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan because people are using it more than the company expected.\n\n\u201cI personally chose the price,\u201d Altman wrote in a series of posts on X, \u201cand thought we would make some money.\u201d\n\nChatGPT Pro, launched late last year, grants access to an upgraded version of OpenAI\u2019s o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model, o1 pro mode, and lifts rate limits on several of the company\u2019s other tools, including its Sora video generator.\n\nChatGPT Pro\u2019s price point wasn\u2019t a slam dunk at launch. It\u2019s $2,400 per year, and the value proposition of o1 pro mode in particular remains murky. But judging by Altman\u2019s posts, it seems that users who have bitten the bullet are making the most of it \u2014 at OpenAI\u2019s expense.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time OpenAI has priced a product somewhat arbitrarily. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Altman said that the original premium plan for OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, didn\u2019t have a pricing study.\n\n\u201cI believe we tested two prices, $20 and $42,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cPeople thought $42 was a little too much. They were happy to pay $20. We picked $20. Probably it was late December of 2022 or early January. It was not a rigorous \u2018hire someone and do a pricing study\u2019 thing.\u201d\n\nOpenAI isn\u2019t profitable, despite having raised around $20 billion since its founding. The company reportedly expected losses of about $5 billion on revenue of $3.7 billion last year.\n\nExpenditures like staffing, office rent, and AI training infrastructure are to blame. ChatGPT was at one point costing OpenAI an estimated $700,000 per day.\n\nRecently, OpenAI admitted it needs \u201cmore capital than it imagined\u201d as it prepares to undergo a corporate restructuring to attract new investments. To reach profitability, OpenAI is said to be considering increasing the price of its various subscription tiers. Altman also hinted in the Bloomberg interview that OpenAI may explore usage-based pricing for certain services.\n\nOpenAI optimistically projects that its revenue will reach $11.6 billion this year and $100 billion in 2029, matching the current annual sales of Nestl\u00e9.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "The big picture: A debate surrounding Northeastern's computer science curriculum highlights the ongoing challenges in higher education about how to best prepare students for rapidly evolving technical fields. While Python is currently popular in the industry, the choice of programming language for teaching should be based on pedagogical merit rather than current trends, writes one student.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The Huntington News, Derek Kaplan, a fourth-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University, presented a compelling argument about the future of computer science education at his institution. The piece comes in response to Northeastern's announcement of a complete overhaul of its computer science curriculum.\n\nKaplan makes the case that the rapidly evolving nature of the tech industry requires a focus on timeless principles rather than current trends and that an effective curriculum should emphasize fundamental principles that are widely applicable, enabling students to easily adapt to new technologies in their future careers. \"A curriculum focused on current industry trends risks becoming obsolete before students even graduate,\" he noted.\n\nNortheastern's current curriculum, particularly the \"Fundies\" courses, focuses on systematic program design and problem-solving skills. These courses teach a design recipe that provides a consistent formula for tackling unfamiliar problems, training students to reason about code \"rather than to mindlessly write it,\" he said.\n\nThe \"point of Fundies is \u2026 to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language\u2026 A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language.\"\n\nHowever, the proposed changes to the curriculum have raised concerns. The plan is to phase out core courses like Fundies 1, Fundies 2, and Object-Oriented Design in favor of new courses primarily teaching Python, which Kaplan sees as potentially misguided.\n\nRacket, the language currently used in introductory courses, was chosen for its teaching-oriented features, which Python lacks. Kaplan also views as problematic the decision to allow students to place out of new courses with AP Computer Science credit, as AP courses do not teach the same systematic design skills as Northeastern's current introductory courses.\n\nThese changes suggest a shift away from systematic program design as a central aspect of the curriculum, which could leave students ill-prepared for advanced coursework and future careers. The Object-Oriented Design course, while challenging for many students, teaches essential skills such as working with code written by others and managing large software projects.\n\nKaplan also questions the motivations behind the curriculum change, suggesting that it may be driven by a desire to make the core curriculum easier and reduce the number of students withdrawing from certain courses.\n\n\"I know one professor who has been telling students that the college wants to reduce the number of students who withdraw from Fundies 2 and Object-Oriented Design. While this is an understandable sentiment, it would be a mistake to remove the most important parts of the curriculum to do so.\"\n\nFinally, he notes that experienced teaching assistants could provide valuable input into the curriculum revision process. Their unique perspective, having both taken the courses and helped other students succeed, could help ensure that core principles are not compromised while allowing for beneficial changes.\n\n\"As a former teaching assistant, or TA, for Object-Oriented Design, I have seen many students struggle through the class. But I have also seen those same students become better programmers because of what they learn in that class.\""

Excavating just one of the coffins in their way was no small feat, either. According to the England\u2019s National Highways department announcement on January 6th, the largely intact stone casket weighed as much as \u201can adult male polar bear.\u201d For those unsure about that exact unit of measurement, that puts the coffin at around 1,650 lbs.\n\n\u201cWhile our main focus has been on building a road to improve journeys for road users, it\u2019s been extremely satisfying to play a part in uncovering such an unusual archaeological find,\u201d said Chris Griffin, the National Highways east region program leader.\n\nThe coffin weighs roughly 1,650 lbs. Credit: National Highways\n\nWhile a sovereign state today, a large portion of the UK once composed the Roman territory of Britannia. Julius Caesar initially invaded the island in 55 and 54 BCE during the Gallic Wars, but it wasn\u2019t until Claudius\u2019 reign that a much larger campaign commenced. Rome officially annexed the province of Britannia in 43 CE before ruling over the region for roughly the next 400 years. This means that locals likely buried the large stone coffin towards the end of Roman occupation following almost a half-century of cultural exchange and improvements made to Britain\u2019s agriculture, architecture, urban planning, and industry. One of the most notable Roman additions to the area was a vast network of roads connecting much of the territory. Despite their immense influence, however, only an estimated 800 Latin words were ultimately incorporated into Common Brittonic by the time of Rome\u2019s withdrawal from the island. The vast majority of the proto-English language remained firmly intertwined with its Germanic origins.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to Archeology News, a team of 50 archeologists and 20 civil engineers spent seven months excavating 17 different sites along the roadway. Many of these discoveries will be showcased in the new season of Digging for Britain. The first episode\u2014which includes the polar bear-sized casket\u2014will premiere on BBC 2 on January 7th."

This enables users to utilize sophisticated investment tools without requiring intermediary participation or deep market expertise.\n\nThe platform\u2019s AI-driven Robo Advisor develops customized investment plans suited to personal financial objectives, adjusting portfolios instantly in response to market fluctuations.\n\nNonetheless, a significant innovation of RCO Finance is its capability to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). By transforming physical assets such as real estate and commodities into blockchain tokens, RCOF opens up access to markets that have typically been illiquid.\n\nThis implies that investors can obtain partial ownership in valuable assets without requiring large amounts of capital.\n\nIndustry forecasts indicate that the RWA sector might experience immense growth of as much as 50 times by 2030, with market valuations between $4 trillion and $30 trillion, allowing RCO Finance to benefit from this trend.\n\nAdditionally, RCO Finance provides access to a vast selection of more than 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 asset categories.\n\nThis varied selection features conventional investments such as stocks and bonds, along with digital assets and tokenized real-world assets.\n\nRCOF\u2019s No-Code Platform Promises 200% Surge\n\nThe RCOF token further acts as the main currency for transactions on the platform and as a way for users to accumulate rewards.\n\nActive participants in trading, staking, or providing liquidity are incentivized with RCOF tokens through various cashback and loyalty programs, fostering ongoing user engagement and loyalty.\n\nCurrently, RCO Finance has successfully raised over $10 million in its token presale, with nearly 54% of the RCOF tokens already sold to the public. Analysts predict that RCOF could surge from its current value of $0.077 to as much as $0.214, representing a nearly 200% increase before its official market debut.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs RCO Finance prepares to launch, it is positioning itself as a formidable competitor to established tokens like Shiba Inu. While SHIB continues to attract attention with its community-driven approach, RCOF offers a more sophisticated suite of investment tools aimed at both novice and seasoned investors.\n\nRCO Finance, poised to surpass conventional memecoins and emphasizing innovation, is ready to create a significant impact in the cryptocurrency scene.\n\nFor those seeking to seize the next major opportunity, RCOF offers an attractive choice that merges innovative technology with the potential for significant returns, positioning it as a project to monitor in the year ahead.\n\nFor more information about the RCO Finance Presale:\n\nVisit RCO Finance Presale\n\nJoin The RCO Finance Community"

            "article_content": "Crooks start most payments fraud by trying to figure out if the crime is actually worth the effort, sending small probes to see if there is enough money to steal. Stripe contends there is a way to gain the upper hand by leaning on machine learning.\n\nThe payments company says the technology has reduced a type of attack called \"card testing\" by 80% in the past two years. That has come as Stripe's yearly payment volume has grown from about $500 billion to more than $1 trillion during that time, a jump in payments activity that theoretically makes card testing easier.\n\nCrooks use card testing to measure how valuable a stolen card can be by making small phony payments, usually a couple of dollars or less, trying to bury a fraudulent transaction in a sea of legitimate payments, where it's less likely to be noticed.\n\nIf these payments go through without being flagged, the fraudsters then make incrementally larger purchases, relying on the initial \"test\" payments that have beaten a company's fraud guard to pave the way for larger theft.\n\n\"Card testing is where most fraud begins,\" said Emily Sands, head of information at Stripe, where she is responsible for leading a department that develops uses for data in decision-making and automation. \"Bad actors try to get to which cards can be used in the future.\"\n\n\n\nAdministering the exam\n\nCard testing is the most prevalent type of payment fraud, according to Chargebacks 911 .\n\nWhile the losses due to card testing alone are minimal, the technique is a gateway to $205 billion in e-commerce fraud in the first half of the 2020s, according to Juniper Research , which stresses the importance of determining the validity of a payment as key to halting deeper crime.\n\n\"It's a big threat and challenging to detect,\" Sands said. \"Crooks are clever. They hide attacks in businesses that make or receive lots of payments. The record of payments in this case may not look as spiky as for a business or small company. So there's not a sudden shift in the pace of transactions.\"\n\nThere are two major types of card tests. A verification attack involves a crook trying to make small purchases on stolen card accounts to see which ones have been canceled or expired. An enumeration attack, which is gaining steam as crooks use more sophisticated technology, involves \"guessing\" at card numbers in a rapid-fire manner to spot active cards and to circumvent the cards' blocking function.\n\nStripe uses machine learning, or a form of artificial intelligence, to estimate the overall prevalence of card testing on its platform, which enables the company to update its risk systems daily. The payment company additionally uses machine learning to estimate where card testing is likely to be taking place, such as businesses, issuers or a type of purchase or payment. This helps determine if a \"rush\" of transactions are card testing or a spike in payments due to a marketing campaign, for instance.\n\nOther tests include vetting individual transactions to spot signs of card testing. This technology enables Stripe to label breakthroughs, or \"successful\" card tests. That is combined with intelligence from new attack types, analyses that spot fraud patterns and manual reviews. This produces a set of transactions or transaction types that are labeled card-testing fraud, which is then fed into machine-learning models for rapid training using an engineering platform.\n\n\"Crooks are constantly changing methods,\" Sands said. \"Machine learning enables rapid retraining to spot new attack methods. \"This detection adds new features that get fed back into the AI model.\"\n\n\n\nRise of the machines\n\nWhile card testing has existed for years, it has increased over the past few years in concert with the economic crisis that accompanied the Covid-19 pandemic, which also catalyzed a rapid expansion in online payments. That has attracted payment and technology companies to develop products designed to halt the attacks. Verifi sells tools that help merchants adjust credit card authorization response messages, which can combat card testing. It also offers card verification value checks as well as geolocation and biometric analysis. Another Verifi product uses new 3D Secure protocols that are designed for digital commerce. JPMorgan Chase , Kount and Chargebacks 911 also offer services to mitigate card testing fraud.\n\nFirms are increasingly using large language models, or an advanced form of AI that's better at deciphering text, to detect similar intent, word usage and patterns in any textual fields of transactions such as disputes, chargebacks, etc. across different transactions, according to Andras Cser, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. The emerging technology also includes using machine learning and algorithms to parse large amounts of merchant and issuer data, he said.\n\n\"This is the motivation for Visa to acquire Featurespace ,\" Cser said.\n\nBattling card testing fraud is a great application for machine learning and advanced data management, according to David Mattei, strategic advisor for the fraud and anti-money-laundering practice at Datos Insights.\n\n\"The one thing in common I see with these newer card testing detection solutions is that they are coming from industry players considered to be at the network level,\" Mattei said, adding these firms view card authorization traffic across many merchants and financial institutions. Due to the nature of card testing, it is very helpful to have that 50,000 foot perspective to detect card testing attacks. Stripe is in a good position to offer this kind of solution.\"\n\n"

            "article_content": "Indian equity markets witnessed a sharp decline in Monday\u2019s afternoon trading session, with both benchmark indices falling over 1 per cent amid concerns over the detection of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases in India, marking a significant reversal from the day\u2019s opening levels.\n\nThe BSE Sensex plummeted 949.62 points or 1.20 per cent to 78,273.49, while the broader NSE Nifty dropped 318.95 points or 1.33 per cent to 23,685.80 at 12:07 PM, after opening higher at 79,281.65 and 24,045.80 respectively.\n\nThe selling pressure was widespread across sectors, with the Nifty Next 50 experiencing the steepest decline of 2.62 per cent to 67,380.55. The Nifty Midcap Select fell 2.00 per cent to 12,749.90, while the banking sector indices also faced significant losses with Nifty Bank down 1.61 per cent at 50,167.95 and Nifty Financial Services declining 1.35 per cent to 23,415.20.\n\nMarket breadth remained heavily negative with 3,223 stocks declining against 734 advances on the BSE. The number of stocks hitting lower circuit at 365 significantly outnumbered those touching upper circuit at 228. Despite the broad market weakness, 159 stocks managed to hit their 52-week highs, while 67 touched their 52-week lows.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals emerged as the top gainer on the NSE, rising 0.91 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank and Titan with modest gains of 0.15 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively. The major losers included Tata Steel (-4.18 per cent), BPCL (-3.46 per cent), Adani Enterprises (-3.22 per cent), Kotak Bank (-3.10 per cent), and Trent (-3.05 per cent).\n\nThe market sentiment was affected by news of two HMPV cases detected in Karnataka, both involving infants. The Union Health Ministry confirmed that the cases were identified through routine surveillance, with both patients admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, for bronchopneumonia. Neither patient had any international travel history.\n\nWhile the Health Ministry maintained that the HMPV strain is already in global circulation and that there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses, the news appeared to trigger concerns among investors, leading to broad-based selling across sectors.\n\nThe market reaction comes despite the Ministry\u2019s assurance of preparedness and ongoing monitoring through the ICMR and IDSP network, with support from the WHO in tracking the situation in China."

            "article_content": "Only 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n\u2013 To hear US President-elect Donald Trump tell it, he is about to take over a nation ravaged by crisis, a desolate hellscape of crime, chaos and economic hardship. \u201cOur country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the world!\u201d he declared on social media last week.\n\nBut by many traditional metrics, the America that Trump will inherit from President Joe Biden when he takes the oath for a second time, two weeks from Jan 6, is actually in better shape than that bequeathed to any newly elected president since Mr George W. Bush came into office in 2001.\n\nFor the first time since that transition 24 years ago, there will be no US troops at war overseas on Inauguration Day. New data reported in the past few days indicates that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been.\n\nThe manufacturing sector has more jobs than under any president since Mr Bush. Drug overdose deaths have fallen for the first time in years. Even inflation, the scourge of the Biden presidency, has returned closer to normal, although prices remain higher than they were four years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is inheriting an economy that is about as good as it ever gets,\u201d said Mr Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.\u201d\n\nThose positive trends were not enough to swing a sour electorate behind US Vice-President Kamala Harris in the November election, reflecting a substantial gap between what statistics say and what ordinary Americans appear to feel about the state of the country. And the US clearly faces some major challenges that will confront Trump as he retakes power.\n\nThe terrorist attack that killed 15 people in New Orleans early on New Year\u2019s Day, carried out by an American man who said he had joined the ISIS extremist group, served as a reminder that the group \u2013 which Trump likes to boast he defeated during his previous term \u2013 remains a threat and an inspiration to radicalised lone wolves. The wars in Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip are daunting challenges even without US troops engaged in combat there.\n\nThanks in part to Covid-19 relief spending by both Trump and Mr Biden, the national debt has ballooned so much that it now represents a larger share of the economy than it has in generations, other than during the pandemic itself. Families remain pressed by the cost of living, including housing, healthcare and college tuition. The cost of petrol , while down from its peak, is still about 70 US cents per gallon higher than when Mr Biden took office.\n\nMoreover, Americans remain as divided as they have been in many years \u2013 politically, ideologically, economically, racially and culturally. As healthy as the country may be economically and otherwise, a variety of scholars, surveys and other indicators suggest the US is struggling to come together behind a common view of its national identity, either at home or abroad.\n\nIndeed, many Americans do not perceive the country to be doing as well as the data suggests, either because they do not see it in their own lives, they do not trust the statistics or they accept the dystopian view promoted by Trump and amplified by a fragmented, choose-your-own-news media and online ecosphere.\n\nOnly 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. In another Gallup survey in September, 52 per cent of Americans said they and their own family were worse off than four years ago, a higher proportion than felt that way in the presidential election years of 1984, 1992, 2004, 2012 or 2020.\n\nIt was in Trump\u2019s political interest, of course, to encourage that sentiment and appeal to it during 2024 \u2019s campaign. He was hardly the first challenger to emphasise the negative to defeat an incumbent president.\n\nDwight Eisenhower disparaged the state of the country when he first ran for president in 1952, much to the irritation of president Harry S. Truman, only to have John F. Kennedy do the same to him when running in 1960.\n\nKennedy hammered away at a \u201cmissile gap\u201d with the Soviet Union that did not exist, then after winning declared that the US was in \u201cits hour of maximum danger\u201d, in contrast to Eisenhower\u2019s view of his security record.\n\n\u201cThis is a contrast you oftentimes find,\u201d said historian Michael Beschloss, who has written nine books on the American presidency. \u201cCandidates who are running against incumbent presidents or sitting governments make it sound much worse than it is.\u201d\n\nStill, few have been as extreme in their negative descriptions as Trump, or as resistant to fact-checking. He has suggested falsely that immigration, crime and inflation are out of control, attributed the New Orleans incident to lax border policies even though the attacker was an American born in Texas and as recently as Jan 4 called the country \u201ca total mess\u201d.\n\nYet Trump is moving back into the White House with an enviable hand to play, one that other presidents would have dearly loved on their opening day. President Ronald Reagan inherited double-digit inflation and an unemployment rate twice as high as today. President Barack Obama inherited two foreign wars and an epic financial crisis. Mr Biden inherited a devastating pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stepping into an improving situation,\u201d Dr William J. Antholis, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Centre of Public Affairs, which has studied presidential transitions, said of Trump.\n\nDr Antholis compared the situation with then President Bill Clinton\u2019s arrival in 1993, when he took over a growing economy and a new post-Cold War order. While the country had already begun recovering from recession during the 1992 election, many voters did not yet feel it and punished President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the economy had turned just before the election, and kept moving in the right direction when Clinton took over,\u201d Dr Antholis recalled.\n\nMuch as it did for the first Mr Bush\u2019s team, the disconnect between macro trends and individual perceptions proved enormously frustrating to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, who failed to persuade voters during the 2024 election that the country was doing better than commonly believed. Rattling off statistics and boasting about the success of \u201cBidenomics\u201d did not resonate with voters who did not see it the same way.\n\n\u201cOf course, not everyone is enjoying good economic times, as many low-middle income households are struggling financially, and the nation has mounting fiscal challenges,\u201d Mr Zandi said. \u201cBut taking the economy in its totality, it rarely performs better than it is now as President Trump takes office.\u201d\n\nMr Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the latest reports demonstrated that Mr Biden\u2019s policies are working and argued that Republicans should not seek to repeal them once they take control of the presidency and both houses of Congress.\n\n\u201cAfter inheriting an economy in free fall and skyrocketing violent crime, President Biden is proud to hand his successor the best-performing economy on earth, the lowest violent crime rates in over 50 years, and the lowest border crossings in over four years,\u201d Mr Bates said.\n\nMs Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump, responded by citing the election: \u201cAmericans delivered an overwhelming Election Day rebuke of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s abysmal track record: communities being overrun with millions of unvetted migrants who walked over Biden\u2019s open border, lower real wages, and declining trust in increasingly politicised law enforcement agencies that are unable to even publish accurate crime data.\u201d\n\nTrump does not have to share a positive view of the situation to benefit from it. When he takes office on Jan 20, absent the unexpected, he will not face the sort of major immediate action-forcing crisis that, say, Mr Obama did in needing to rescue the economy from the brink of another Great Depression.\n\nTrump instead will have more latitude to pursue favoured policies such as mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally or tariffs on foreign imported goods. And if past is prologue, he may eventually begin extolling the state of the economy to claim successes for his policies.\n\nHe has already taken credit for recent increases in stock prices even before assuming office. He has a demonstrated skill for self-promotion that eluded Mr Biden, enabling him to persuade many Americans that the economy during his first term was even better than it actually was.\n\nAt the same time, with unemployment, crime, border crossings and even inflation already pretty low, it may be difficult for Trump to improve on them significantly. Trump obliquely seemed to acknowledge as much when he noted in a post-election interview with Time magazine that he may not be able to live up to his campaign pledge to lower grocery prices. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Trump faces the risk that the economy goes in the other direction. Some specialists have warned that a tariff-driven trade war with major economic partners could, for instance, reignite inflation.\n\nDr N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard University and chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under the second Mr Bush, recalled that even his former boss faced significant challenges when he took office in 2001 as the economy was already heading into a relatively mild recession following the bust of the dot-com boom.\n\n\u201cThere are no similar storm clouds on the horizon right now,\u201d Dr Mankiw said. \u201cThat is certainly lucky for Trump. On the other hand, all presidents must deal with unexpected shocks to the economy. We just don\u2019t know yet what kind of shocks President Trump will have to handle.\u201d NYTIMES\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

            "article_content": "Transforming Enterprise Data Access: A Microsoft Success Story By Pattabi Rama Rao Thumati | File Photo\n\nIn the complex landscape of enterprise data management, the remarkable transformation of Microsoft's SAP Finance Master Data system stands as a compelling testament to innovative architecture and strategic technical leadership. Under the guidance of Lead Architect Pattabi Rama Rao Thumati, this mission-critical project revolutionized how partners access and consume financial data, setting new standards for system availability and real-time data processing in enterprise environments.\n\nThe project faced significant challenges from the outset. The existing system required regular maintenance windows that resulted in frequent downtimes, disrupting partner access to crucial financial data. With partners directly accessing SAP Finance Master Data, system maintenance windows on weekly, monthly, and quarterly bases had become a significant operational bottleneck, impacting business continuity and decision-making capabilities across the organization.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation was Pattabi's innovative approach to system architecture. Taking full responsibility for the technical solution, he designed and implemented a sophisticated architecture leveraging Cosmos DB and a custom SAP Master Data API. This strategic combination created a robust intermediary layer between external partners and SAP Finance Master Data, fundamentally transforming how financial data was accessed and consumed across the enterprise.\n\nThe impact of this architectural innovation was both immediate and far-reaching. The new system completely eliminated maintenance-related downtimes, achieving a remarkable 100% reduction in system interruptions. Access times to financial data improved by 60%, enabling partners to consume critical information in real-time \u2013 a significant advancement in enterprise data accessibility.\n\nData processing efficiency played a crucial role in the project's success. Through the integration of Azure Data Factory, Pattabi established an automated data pipeline from Cosmos DB to the Enterprise Data Lake (EDL). This automation reduced manual interventions by 75%, significantly improving data accuracy and reliability while enabling real-time analytics and reporting capabilities through Power BI.\n\nThe project's success demonstrated how effective technical architecture could transform enterprise data management. The seamless integration between Cosmos DB, Azure Data Factory, and Power BI established new benchmarks for system performance and data accessibility. This achievement has become a model for future enterprise-scale data integration initiatives, showcasing how strategic architecture and innovative solution design can deliver exceptional results across multiple performance indicators.\n\nFor Pattabi personally, the project represented a significant milestone in enterprise architecture, showcasing his ability to design complex solutions while managing substantial technical challenges and cross-functional teams. His expertise in leveraging cloud technologies and implementing robust data processing solutions proved instrumental in delivering a system that not only met but exceeded organizational requirements.\n\nThis success story illustrates how strategic technical leadership, when combined with innovative architecture, can transform enterprise data management. The implementation not only enhanced operational efficiency but also established new standards for system availability and data accessibility in large-scale enterprise environments. As organizations continue to prioritize data-driven decision making, this project serves as a compelling example of how focused technical leadership can drive exceptional results in enterprise-scale system implementation.\n\nLooking ahead, the implications of this project success extend beyond immediate achievements. It demonstrates how effective system architecture can overcome complex operational challenges while delivering tangible business value. As enterprise data management continues to evolve, Microsoft's SAP Finance Master Data transformation stands as a model for future implementations, showcasing the powerful combination of strategic technical leadership, architectural excellence, and innovative solution design in driving project success under Pattabi Rama Rao Thumati's capable leadership.\n\nAbout Pattabi Rama Rao Thumati\n\nA distinguished professional in enterprise system development and cloud architecture, Pattabi Rama Rao Thumati has established himself as a leading expert in complex technical implementations.

            "article_content": "Zscaler ThreatLabz research team has revealed critical insights and predictions on ransomware trends for 2025. The latest Ransomware Report uncovered a surge in sophisticated tactics and extortion attacks. As ransomware remains a key concern for CISOs and CIOs, the report sheds light on actionable strategies to mitigate risks.\n\n\n\nTop Ransomware Predictions for 2025:\n\n\u25cf AI-Powered Social Engineering: In 2025, GenAI will fuel voice phishing (vishing) attacks. With the proliferation of GenAI-based tooling, initial access broker groups will increasingly leverage AI-generated voices; which sound more and more realistic by adopting local accents and dialects to enhance credibility and success rates.\n\n\n\n\u25cf The Trifecta of Social Engineering Attacks: Vishing, Ransomware and Data Exfiltration. Additionally, sophisticated ransomware groups, like the Dark Angels, will continue the trend of low-volume, high-impact attacks; preferring to focus on an individual company, stealing vast amounts of data without encrypting files, and evading media and law enforcement scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Targeted Industries Under Siege: Manufacturing, healthcare, education, energy will remain primary targets, with no slowdown in attacks expected.\n\n\n\n\u25cf New SEC Regulations Drive Increased Transparency: 2025 will see an uptick in reported ransomware attacks and payouts due to new, tighter SEC requirements mandating that public companies report material incidents within four business days.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Ransomware Payouts Are on the Rise: In 2025 ransom demands will most likely increase due to an evolving ecosystem of cybercrime groups, specializing in designated attack tactics, and collaboration by these groups that have entered a sophisticated profit sharing model using Ransomware-as-a-Service.\n\n\n\nTo combat damaging ransomware attacks, Zscaler ThreatLabz recommends the following strategies.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Fighting AI with AI: As threat actors use AI to identify vulnerabilities, organizations must counter with AI-powered zero trust security systems that detect and mitigate new threats.\n\n\n\n\u25cf Advantages of adopting a Zero Trust architecture: A Zero Trust cloud security platform stops ransomware at every stage of the attack cycle:\n\n\u25cb Minimizing the attack surface: Replacing exploitable VPN and firewall architectures with a zero trust architecture hides users, applications, and devices behind a cloud proxy, making them invisible and undiscoverable from the threats on the internet.\n\n\n\n\u25cb Preventing compromise: TLS/SSL inspection, browser isolation, advanced sandboxing, and policy-driven access controls prevent access to malicious websites and detect unknown threats. This removes the possibility of accessing the corporate network, reducing the risk of initial compromise.\n\n\n\n\u25cb Eliminating lateral movement: Leveraging user-to-app (and app-to-app) segmentation, deception, and identity threat detection and response (ITDR), allows users to securely connect directly to applications, not the network, eliminating lateral movement risk.\n\n\n\n\u25cb Stopping Data Loss: Inline data loss prevention measures, combined with full inspection, thwart attempts at data theft.\n\nTo learn more about ransomware threats and download the Zscaler 2024 Ransomware Report please visit here."

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

It was one of the last refuges of the Anakim (literally, \u2018giants\u2019) in front of the conquering Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 11:22). Gath, a Philistine city, was either subdued during the days of the prophet Samuel, or by King David. The first book of Kings (2:39) states that in the time of King Solomon it was still ruled by a Philistine king named Achish (1 Samuel 27:1\u20137). The narrative in the first book of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 7:21) relates that Ezer and Elead, sons of Ephraim, were killed by men who were natives of Gath, because \u201cthey came down to take their livestock\u201d. In Hebrew, Kiryat Gat means \u201cthe place of the winepress\u201d.\n\nThe Israel Land Authority views this discovery as symbolic of the connection between past and future.\n\nDirector Yaacov Kvint commented: \"[the authority] invests tens of millions of shekels annually in salvage excavations for various projects across the country, aimed at uncovering and documenting the rich history and archaeology beneath the neighbourhoods of the future.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic floor will be relocated to an open area in the city and made accessible to the public.\n\n8 Included in these ten buildings is a monastery, which makes up a site which is thought to have functioned for 600 years Credit: Reuters\n\n8 A winepress was also discovered during the excavation Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

Excavating just one of the coffins in their way was no small feat, either. According to the England\u2019s National Highways department announcement on January 6th, the largely intact stone casket weighed as much as \u201can adult male polar bear.\u201d For those unsure about that exact unit of measurement, that puts the coffin at around 1,650 lbs.\n\n\u201cWhile our main focus has been on building a road to improve journeys for road users, it\u2019s been extremely satisfying to play a part in uncovering such an unusual archaeological find,\u201d said Chris Griffin, the National Highways east region program leader.\n\nThe coffin weighs roughly 1,650 lbs. Credit: National Highways\n\nWhile a sovereign state today, a large portion of the UK once composed the Roman territory of Britannia. Julius Caesar initially invaded the island in 55 and 54 BCE during the Gallic Wars, but it wasn\u2019t until Claudius\u2019 reign that a much larger campaign commenced. Rome officially annexed the province of Britannia in 43 CE before ruling over the region for roughly the next 400 years. This means that locals likely buried the large stone coffin towards the end of Roman occupation following almost a half-century of cultural exchange and improvements made to Britain\u2019s agriculture, architecture, urban planning, and industry. One of the most notable Roman additions to the area was a vast network of roads connecting much of the territory. Despite their immense influence, however, only an estimated 800 Latin words were ultimately incorporated into Common Brittonic by the time of Rome\u2019s withdrawal from the island. The vast majority of the proto-English language remained firmly intertwined with its Germanic origins.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Has solving a century-old paradox now undermined their existence?\n\n\u00a9 William Horton, William Horton Photography\n\nEvery now and then, it is worth pausing for a second and giving thanks to the many, ever so slightly different versions of you that exist in parallel realities. It is these alternative selves that help to keep these universes in balance.\n\nAt least, that is what\u2019s going on if you happen to subscribe to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. First proposed more than 65 years ago, the idea is that reality is constantly splitting off into parallel paths, due to subtle interactions at the level of quantum particles. Though it may boggle the mind, it also smooths over some devilishly tricky problems in physics and, for that reason, plenty of clear-eyed physicists believe it to be true.\n\nBut now this strange idea might be facing a huge challenge, thanks to physicists Sandu Popescu and Daniel Collins at the University of Bristol, UK. They initially set out to solve a 100-year-old puzzle in quantum theory, but ended up undermining the idea of parallel universes. \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially demolished one of the arguments for it,\u201d says Collins.\n\nIt might sound like a destabilising development, but it may actually prove to be a shot in the arm for quantum theory. Already, Popescu and Collins\u2019s work is helping to resolve other long-standing quantum paradoxes and, in the eyes of some theorists, it points to a fresh way of thinking about the cosmos as a singular quantum reality built from the inside out. \u201cThis is something deep and new.

            "article_content": "LI MIN/CHINA DAILY\n\nThe increase in agricultural productivity over the past century has enabled a five-fold increase in the human population and about a 50 percent increase in food per person.\n\nKnowledge, machinery and chemicals significantly replace land and labor in agricultural production. These achievements have also led to increased greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and biodiversity loss. China exemplifies both the achievements and challenges of this transition. It has performed outstandingly on the agricultural front, feeding 22 percent of the world's population with 9 percent of the world's arable land and an uneven distribution of water resources.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2009, China's agricultural labor decreased by 5 percent while agricultural productivity increased by 6.5 percent a year. However, agriculture accounts for 17 percent of China's greenhouse gas emissions and about 8 percent of the degradation of agricultural soil. China and the rest of humankind face the challenge of increasing agricultural production by 70 percent by 2050 while simultaneously reducing or eliminating the side effects of agriculture to make it sustainable.\n\nWe suggest that agriculture develop \"smart\" strategies to increase agricultural productivity while reducing resource load and eliminating environmental side effects. These strategies will take advantage of the capabilities of modern science and the development of enlightened policies and institutions.\n\n\"Smart agriculture\" should take advantage of modern scientific discoveries. First is the biotechnology revolution, starting with the discovery of DNA, which led to a better understanding of how genetics affects the performance of animals and plants. Biotechnology has become essential to modern medicine. The COVID-19 vaccine was developed using biotechnology tools.\n\nYet the adoption of agricultural biotechnology has been limited by regulation. All major national academies of sciences say that genetically modified crops are as safe as traditional crops. Still, regulations have limited the adoption of genetic engineering, mainly in producing fiber and animal feed. About three-fourths of the world's cotton and soybean and one-third of the corn are produced by genetically modified organisms. The adoption of GMOs has substantially increased the yield of these crops, reduced the use of toxic pesticides and increased the income of farmers.\n\nThe biotechnology revolution is only in its infancy. New biotechnology capabilities, such as gene editing, allow faster development of new varieties of crops in response to diseases and climate change. Modern biotechnology has immense potential to improve veterinary medicine and prevent billions of dollars in economic losses from animal diseases. The Beijing Institute of Genomics provides China with an excellent foundation for genetic engineering research and development. Hopefully, it will be used more intensively.\n\nThe \"Information Revolution\" is another contributor to \"smart agriculture\". Precision farming can monitor crop conditions and apply input wherever and in the specific amount needed. This increases yield, saves input use, and reduces the adverse side effects of overusing chemicals and water.\n\nPrecision agriculture, too, is under-adopted in China. Still, adoption rates can be improved by developing low-cost precision methods for small-scale farmers and providing financial incentives and technical support for adoption. Smart agricultural systems also include drip irrigation, which has increased crop yield by about 40 percent while reducing water and chemical use by up to 50 percent. And low- and no-tillage practices and cover cropping can lead to less carbon loss and greater productivity in the long run.\n\nScientific discoveries enable us to develop circular technologies to reuse agricultural residues as a source of value. The black soldier fly is an example of an insect that converts agricultural waste into proteins that can be used to feed livestock and support aquaculture. Its potential is apparent from its use in China. Crop and forest residues can be converted into biochar to enhance farm productivity and store carbon. In this regard, significant agricultural productivity differences exist among regions in China and the rest of the world.\n\nThus, the transfer of knowledge among regions and the adoption of \"smart agriculture\" have an immense potential to increase the productivity and sustainability of agriculture.\n\nPolicies can enhance the development of \"smart agriculture\". First is continued investment in life sciences and agricultural research and development and extension efforts to transfer the knowledge to practitioners. The rate of monetary return for agricultural research is much higher than market rates. And since climate change is a global challenge, it is crucial to drastically expand agricultural R&D in developing countries, enhancing their capacity to adapt and mitigate.\n\nSecond is regulatory reform, which introduces science-based regulation of technologies and activities, balancing benefits and risks. Extreme precaution leading to inaction is risky. But risk is part of life; we cannot avoid it but can control and mitigate it.\n\nThird is the introduction of pricing that considers the cost of environmental side effects from economic activities, thus providing the incentive for introducing clean technologies.\n\nFinally, it is essential to maintain a global exchange of knowledge and global trade in agricultural markets. We are stronger when cooperating against common challenges than when each country operates alone.\n\nThe author is a Wolf Prize Laureate, a member of US National Academy of Sciences, and a professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California.
