Alas, I was sitting on my porch, enjoying my new pair of night vision binoculars, when I saw something moving in the dark. It was too fast for it to be a plane.\n\nI can see over 1,300 feet away with these bad boys, and, boy, I saw something alright. A flying saucer\u2014or a UAP as the kids call it these days. Better yet? My binoculars have a built-in camera and I started recording. Can you believe they were only $84.97 (reg. $169.99)?\n\nSeeing is believing, and you need these to see\n\nWanna know how I know that UFO was real? My footage didn\u2019t save. The binoculars work; I have dozens of 36MP photos and 4K videos of tweety birds from my backyard. But those aliens? They wiped my darn UAP pictures. Those suckers. This is all I\u2019ve got:\n\nAt least I got to see them in the flesh. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t wipe my memory (yet). The cool thing about these binoculars, compared to night vision goggles, is that I don\u2019t have to squint through uncomfortable eyepieces to get a glimpse at some aliens\u2014just look through the 4.5-inch LCD screen. I can also use it to play videos back.\n\nThe only slightly annoying thing is that they have to be charged, which is obvious since they\u2019re digital. But a 4,000mAh rechargeable battery lasts me quite a few nights of bird-watching and now UFO hunting. I\u2019ll be waiting for my visitors to return.\n\nGrab yourself a pair of these digital binoculars with night vision and recording capabilities for only $84.97 (reg. $169.99) and save 50 percent.

            "article_content": "DeepSeek: What lies under the bonnet of the new AI chatbot?\n\n6 hours ago Andrew Duncan\n\nGetty Images\n\nTumbling stock market values and wild claims have accompanied the release of a new AI chatbot by a small Chinese company. What makes it so different?\n\nThe release of China's new DeepSeek AI-powered chatbot app has rocked the technology industry. It quickly overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free iOS app in the US, and caused chip-making company Nvidia to lose almost $600bn (\u00a3483bn) of its market value in one day \u2013 a new US stock market record.\n\nThe reason behind this tumult? The \"large language model\" (LLM) that powers the app has reasoning capabilities that are comparable to US models such as OpenAI's o1, but reportedly requires a fraction of the cost to train and run.\n\nAnalysis Dr Andrew Duncan is the director of science and innovation fundamental AI at the Alan Turing Institute in London, UK.\n\nDeepSeek claims to have achieved this by deploying several technical strategies that reduced both the amount of computation time required to train its model (called R1) and the amount of memory needed to store it. The reduction of these overheads resulted in a dramatic cutting of cost, says DeepSeek. R1's base model V3 reportedly required 2.788 million hours to train (running across many graphical processing units \u2013 GPUs \u2013 at the same time), at an estimated cost of under $6m (\u00a34.8m), compared to the more than $100m (\u00a380m) that OpenAI boss Sam Altman says was required to train GPT-4.\n\nDespite the hit taken to Nvidia's market value, the DeepSeek models were trained on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to one research paper released by the company. These chips are a modified version of the widely used H100 chip, built to comply with export rules to China. These were likely stockpiled before restrictions were further tightened by the Biden administration in October 2023, which effectively banned Nvidia from exporting the H800s to China. It is likely that, working within these constraints, DeepSeek has been forced to find innovative ways to make the most effective use of the resources it has at its disposal.\n\nReducing the computational cost of training and running models may also address concerns about the environmental impacts of AI. The data centres they run on have huge electricity and water demands, largely to keep the servers from overheating. While most technology companies do not disclose the carbon footprint involved in operating their models, a recent estimate puts ChatGPT's monthly carbon dioxide emissions at over 260 tonnes per month \u2013 that's the equivalent of 260 flights from London to New York. So, increasing the efficiency of AI models would be a positive direction for the industry from an environmental point of view.\n\nWatch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China\n\nOf course, whether DeepSeek's models do deliver real-world savings in energy remains to be seen, and it's also unclear if cheaper, more efficient AI could lead to more people using the model, and so an increase in overall energy consumption.\n\nIf nothing else, it could help to push sustainable AI up the agenda at the upcoming Paris AI Action Summit so that AI tools we use in the future are also kinder to the planet.\n\nWhat has surprised many people is how quickly DeepSeek appeared on the scene with such a competitive large language model \u2013 the company was only founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, who is now being hailed in China as something of an \"AI hero\".\n\nThe model is constructed from a group of much smaller models, each having expertise in specific domains\n\nThe latest DeepSeek model also stands out because its \"weights\" \u2013 the numerical parameters of the model obtained from the training process \u2013 have been openly released, along with a technical paper describing the model's development process. This enables other groups to run the model on their own equipment and adapt it to other tasks.\n\nThis relative openness also means that researchers around the world are now able to peer beneath the model's bonnet to find out what makes it tick, unlike OpenAI's o1 and o3 which are effectively black boxes. But there are still some details missing, such as the datasets and code used to train the models, so groups of researchers are now trying to piece these together.\n\nNot all of DeepSeek's cost-cutting techniques are new either \u2013 some have been used in other LLMs. In 2023, Mistral AI openly released its Mixtral 8x7B model which was on par with the advanced models of the time. Mixtral and the DeepSeek models both leverage the \"mixture of experts\" technique, where the model is constructed from a group of much smaller models, each having expertise in specific domains. Given a task, the mixture model assigns it to the most qualified \"expert\".\n\nDeepSeek has even revealed its unsuccessful attempts at improving LLM reasoning through other technical approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search, an approach long touted as a potential strategy to guide the reasoning process of an LLM. Researchers will be using this information to investigate how the model's already impressive problem-solving capabilities can be even further enhanced \u2013 improvements that are likely to end up in the next generation of AI models.\n\nGetty Images Modified versions of Nvidia's H100 GPUs were used by DeepSeek to train its LLM (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSo what does this all mean for the future of the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek is potentially demonstrating that you don't need vast resources to build sophisticated AI models. My guess is that we'll start to see highly capable AI models being developed with ever fewer resources, as companies figure out ways to make model training and operation more efficient.\n\nUp until now, the AI landscape has been dominated by \"Big Tech\" companies in the US \u2013 Donald Trump has called the rise of DeepSeek \"a wake-up call\" for the US tech industry. But this development may not necessarily be bad news for the likes of Nvidia in the long term: as the financial and time cost of developing AI products reduces, businesses and governments will be able to adopt this technology more easily. That will in turn drive demand for new products, and the chips that power them \u2013 and so the cycle continues.\n\nIt seems likely that smaller companies such as DeepSeek will have a growing role to play in creating AI tools that have the potential to make our lives easier. It would be a mistake to underestimate that.\n\n--\n\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week."

Also, yesterday, (January 31), Krutrim founder Bhavish Aggarwal announced that his AI unicorn has begun hosting DeepSeek\u2019s open source models on Indian servers.\n\n\u201cKrutrim has accelerated efforts to develop world class AI. As a first step, our cloud now has DeepSeek models live, hosted on Indian servers. Pricing lowest in the world,\u201d Aggarwal said in a post on X.\n\nKrutrim currently hosts five DeepSeek models, including its flagship DeepSeek R1 and four distilled versions. The pricing ranges from INR 10 per million tokens for the R1-Distill-Llama-8B model to INR 60 per million tokens for the most expensive variant.\n\nThis also comes close on the heels of India advancing its data localisation efforts. Recently, union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced that India would host DeepSeek on local servers to address privacy concerns regarding cross-border data transfer."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek has made Indian companies rethink AI model development, shifting focus from just applications to potential foundational models.\n\nDeepSeek has earned recognition from major tech companies, and even US President Donald Trump described China\u2019s achievement as a \u201cpositive\u201d development and a wake-up call for the American AI industry.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing it has done is just change the belief that foundational models are only for large tech companies. DeepSeek has shattered that feeling,\u201d said Sandeep Dutta, Chief Practice Officer\u2013Asia-Pacific & Middle East region, Fractal.\n\nIn a related development, Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Thursday that the government has created a framework calling for proposals to develop the country\u2019s own foundational AI model. He also stated that at least six developers, startups, and teams would be building a foundational model within 4-10 months.\n\nLLM race\n\nExperts are debating whether India needs its own large language model (LLM), given that China has firmly entered the global AI race and is challenging the dominant US players.\n\nIndian startups like Sarvam and Krutrim are making significant strides in the development of LLMs tailored to the local market and diverse languages.\n\nAI startup Sarvam, which raised around $41 million in 2023, focuses on building language models that can understand and generate in multiple Indian languages.\n\nBhavish Aggarwal-led Krutrim is working on region-specific AI models that can enable businesses to interact with customers in their native language, integrating contextual and cultural understanding.\n\nTailored applications\n\n\u201cThe DeepSeek moment is a reminder that accepting the status quo is a wrong strategy,\u201d said Narendra Bhandari, General Partner, Seafund. He emphasised that AI should be seen as a solution rather than just software, and that India\u2019s investment in massive Nvidia GPU purchases is a necessary first step.\n\nBruce Keith, Co-Founder and CEO of InvestorAi, said that innovations like DeepSeek are shifting the focus from processing power to data and application-specific models. \u201cDeepSeek has proven that game-changing innovations don\u2019t need billion-dollar investments. This democratises AI and offers countries like India an opportunity to leap ahead without extensive infrastructure,\u201d Keith explained.\n\nDutta pointed out that India\u2019s strength lies in creating applications suited to local needs, such as in agriculture, healthcare, and finance. \u201cInstead of focusing on a single, large foundational model, India can develop smaller, domain-specific models tailored for key sectors,\u201d he said. This approach could make India a global leader in AI applications.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s strength is not necessarily in building foundational models but in creating applications. People don\u2019t buy models, they buy applications,\u201d said Jaspreet Bindra, managing director of Tech Whisperer.\n\nStartup ecosystem\n\nReferring to how DeepSeek\u2019s lower cost of building models offers startups in India a unique advantage, Anil Kumar, CTO of Exotel, said, \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical moment. The AI landscape is shifting, and models are becoming cheaper to build and run. Now, the value is in building real-world applications rather than just focusing on hardware.\u201d This shift is giving rise to a new wave of AI application-first startups, he added.\n\nOn the ahead , Bindra pointed to the lack of patient capital in India\u2019s venture capital ecosystem, which traditionally expects quick returns. \u201cAI models require long-term investments. In India, we need to rethink our funding strategies to foster innovation.\u201d\n\nHe noted that India would have to focus on research as well as foster an ecosystem for deeptech startups, including funding for the sector.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "Uncanny (4x60) is made by BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions, the award-winning department behind RTS Award winning Fight The Power, Grierson and Broadcast Award winning Inside Our Autistic Minds with Chris Packham, Freedom: 50 Years of Pride, and Lucy Worsley Investigates. It was commissioned by Jack Bootle, Head of Commissioning, Specialist Factual. The Executive Producer for BBC Studios is Alan Holland. Rhian Roberts is the Commissioning Editor for the Uncanny podcast.\n\nDanny Robins is the host and writer of hit BBC Sounds / Radio 4 podcast Uncanny. He\u2019s also the creator of BBC Sounds podcasts The Battersea Poltergeist and The Witch Farm, and the writer of the award-winning West End play 2:22 \u2013 A Ghost Story. Assisting Danny in his investigations are sceptic Dr Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Keeffe and parapsychologist Evelyn Hollow, who pick apart the details of each case to work out what might have happened. Danny also invites viewers to get in touch with their own explanations, and he provides case updates which explore viewers\u2019 theories on the stories.\n\nWere three generations of a farming family in rural Lancashire all terrorised by the presence of a small child? Did a group of charity shop workers all witness the same paranormal figure? Were a teenager and his friends preyed upon by a towering malign presence in the 90s? And was a young girl physically pushed down the stairs by a supernatural force in the early 2000s?\n\nDo ghosts exist? Are you Team Believer or Team Sceptic? Danny Robins investigates real-life stories of seemingly paranormal encounters. In the second season of the hit TV series, based on the successful BBC Sounds / BBC Radio 4 podcast, Uncanny is back on BBC Two and iPlayer. Featuring a brand new crop of terrifying real-life stories of potentially supernatural encounters told by the people they happened to - experiences that seem to defy logical explanation. Or do they? In each of the four episodes, Danny Robins investigates a different case and tries to help those involved understand what happened to them. Can their experiences be explained \u2013 or are they really evidence of something supernatural?\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Uncanny?\n\nThis series is bigger, bolder, scarier, and more intriguing than ever before. The cases we feature scare me, so they will definitely scare you! They are really unsettling with bizarre frightening moments that happen in the most ordinary, normal settings. It's truly chilling because if these experiences can happen to ordinary people like those we feature, then it can happen to anyone!\n\nThe first case takes place in a classic ghost story setting on a farm in the middle of nowhere, with a very normal, sensible and rational scientific guy, Liam, who is too frightened to go upstairs in his parents\u2019 home because of what he experienced there. We find out that his mum and his dad have also experienced really strange, frightening things in that same house and it's just so intriguing!\n\nWe have also got a case set in a shop with a bunch of colleagues who don\u2019t know each other very well but are all experiencing genuinely terrifying, potential poltergeist activity and apparitions. Another episode features Julian, who to this day is still frightened by what happened to him, and there's an uncertainty in his case about whether he is making contact with someone he lost or something malicious that is out to do him harm. Our final case features a very normal family who have very abnormal things happen in their home; it's a case that takes us into a level of threat that is almost higher than anything else we've experienced on Uncanny.\n\nUncanny is unique and different to traditional paranormal shows. I think it is probably the first time that sceptics and believers have come together and enjoyed these kinds of cases in their own way. If you're a sceptic it's a \u2018howdunit\u2019, and if you're a believer it's a \u2018whodunit\u2019. You can get together and enjoy the story on your own terms and talk to your friends about it; discussing that biggest of all questions: Do ghosts exist?\n\nWhat is new and different about this series?\n\nWe have a very different spread of people in this series; different ages, personality types and very different locations as well. We've got homes, we've got workplaces, we've got people who experience things in childhood, people who experience things as adults, families that experience it together and people who experience it with mates or colleagues, so it's a real spread! It really dispels the idea that there is a certain type of person that sees a ghost or a certain type of place where you're likely to see a ghost. These stories can happen to anybody!\n\nWe've got some brilliant experiments featuring in the series too, for example sending me into a wind tunnel at 90 miles an hour to test a theory about whether convection currents - drafts in houses - can cause poltergeist activity. I had things flying towards my head at 90 miles an hour so that was quite something! We also go to Hampton Court Palace and I go around testing whether electromagnetic frequencies could explain the hauntings there. We also have me in a graveyard, checking whether people might hallucinate spectres by a sudden coming together of fog and lights. So it\u2019s quite an unusual show from that point of view. I don't think there's anything else quite like Uncanny on television. You've got all the excitement and adrenaline-fuelled thrills and scares of the ghost story but you've also got the journalistic rigour and scientific integrity of stress testing the theories.\n\nWhat reaction did you get following the success of the last series?\n\nAfter last series I did a tour around the country and so many people came up to me and said, \"Thank you for talking about this subject\u201d and \u201cWhy haven't we talked about this subject more before?\" For a long time the topic of the paranormal was treated as slightly pantomime entertainment, but the idea of really properly looking at this subject and trying to work out if it's real, what is really going on, hasn\u2019t really been done before. A lot of people have felt compelled to come forward and tell their stories, they feel Uncanny has created a safe space to talk about this subject. People who have never told their friends, never even told their partner, feel it's okay to talk to us about this and put themselves out there. I love that aspect of it.\n\nThe Uncanny fan base has also grown so much and now encompasses everyone from seven-year-olds to people in their 90s. I know families that sit down and watch Uncanny together, and that\u2019s wonderful. The Uncanny community of people who go off and do their own research, do their digging between episodes and send us their questions and theories is such a huge part of the show.\n\nWhat volume of stories get sent to you and how do you decide which ones to choose?\n\nIt\u2019s got to the point where it\u2019s gone kind of bonkers and there are thousands of stories coming in! I feel deeply privileged to receive each one, as they are all an amazing slice of someone's life. I love that people trust me with their stories.\n\nIt is very instinctive as to which stories we decide to tell; if I read a story and it makes me scared, and if it sends a shiver down my spine. I still think of myself as a sceptic who wants to believe but the thing that pushes me closest to \u2018belief\u2019 is sitting opposite somebody and hearing the tremble in their voice, seeing that look in their eyes and realizing they're still scared. It's often those stories that begin with \u201cI don't believe in ghosts, but I think I might have seen a ghost\u201d. I love that complete discombobulating life-changing confusion that something that you do not believe in, that you fundamentally don't want to accept, may have happened to you.\n\nHas your stance on being a sceptic or a believer changed at all since the last series or are you still \u2018a sceptic that wants to believe\u2019?\n\nI think I am still \u2018a sceptic who wants to believe\u2019. I've been on a journey, if you listen to the early podcasts you hear a more sceptic me, but I've not yet had that experience that pushes me over the edge. I feel like I live vicariously through the people who tell me their stories. I'd love to see a ghost, but I also feel very scared by that idea, and I think be careful what you wish for. I don't know if I'm brave enough to go through what these people have gone through.\n\nI also think it's important to keep a foot in both camps. I think Uncanny would be very different if I was a fully signed up card-carrying believer. I enjoy being torn. I love hearing our sceptic expert Ciaran\u2019s explanations and I think many of them are very convincing, and I also love Evelyn pulling me in the direction of belief. I view them as a little angel and devil on my shoulder, pushing and pulling me in different directions and hopefully the audience feel like that as well.\n\nI think if there's one message that Uncanny puts out there, it's that it\u2019s okay to not be sure; you can change your mind, or you can keep an open mind. We're encouraged all the time these days, particularly on social media, to stick to one opinion and to hate anybody who doesn't agree with you, but it\u2019s great that we can agree to disagree in this programme. We've got people who are incredibly polarised in their opinions coming together and enjoying it in their own way, agreeing to disagree and maybe changing their mind, or maybe not. I just think that's such an important thing, the idea that you can listen without judgment, respect somebody for their experiences and take home from it what you want; view it in your own way and treat it as a detective story on your own terms.\n\nIs winter the perfect time of year for ghost stories?\n\nThe winter has always been a time associated with ghost stories. The idea of telling stories around a campfire and that little thrill of the shiver down your spine that you feel at this coldest time of year. I think we are going to be delivering some truly chilling stories at this most chilling time of year. I just think there's no better time to listen to a ghost story than when you are curled up in your house, it's dark outside, there's a little chill in the air and you start to imagine it could all feel more real. There's a little bit more darkness, there's a few more shadows in the corner of your house!\n\nInterview with Dr Ciar\u00e1n O'Keeffe, Team Sceptic"

            "article_content": "The demise of Most Haunted was keenly felt by fans of woo-woo bonkers TV, but Uncanny (BBC Two) is a more than ample replacement. On the face of it, Uncanny \u2013 now in its second series \u2013 is a procession of forensic paranormal investigations, but that is just a front. In fact, Uncanny is a vehicle for presenter Danny Robins, a podcaster who mind-melds the talents of Professor Brian Cox, Alan Partridge and Alex from Blur to create an uproariously entertaining hour of television.\n\nThe format is the same as series one: Robins investigates real-life stories of seemingly paranormal encounters, with the emphasis on the \u201cseemingly\u201d. He divvies up his audience into Team Sceptic and Team Believer, placing himself precariously on the fence as he tries to make arguments and assemble evidence that will please both sides.\n\nTonight\u2019s case was called the Haunting of Hollymount Farm, and it centred on a long interview between Robins and a farmer\u2019s son from Bury called Liam. Liam was a big, sensible, no-nonsense former rugby player who looked like Ben Stokes \u2013 precisely the sort of chap who you\u2019d assume would have little time for ghost stories. And yet here he was, talking about how he\u2019d been scared witless as a child by a series of apparitions on the staircase in the family farmhouse.\n\nRobins set about debunking Liam\u2019s stories while at the same time drip-feeding more and more evidence that suggested he might be on to something. The sightings went back generations, it turned out, and there were some creepy historical and geographical details that emerged, mostly involving evil nuns, which is always bad. Thus, the pendulum swung between rational explanation and the weird stuff (or what Robins memorably called, \u201ca proper three-litre bottle of nightmare fuel\u201d)."

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

            "article_content": "Experts believe they have finally found the last Anglo-Saxon king's residence\n\nArchaeologists have made a stunning breakthrough after discovering an 11th Centry medieval toilet that has helped to unravel a 2,000-year-old mystery. Researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of Newcastle believe they have uncovered Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon king of England\u2019s long-lost residence. Experts had until now been unable to pinpoint the exact location of King Harold\u2019s residence in Bosham. Illustrations of the grand hall in his residence appear twice in an 11th-century embroidered work known as the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the 1066 Norman Conquest of England. The tapestry shows Harold feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France. While the church in Bosham still stands today, experts have been left baffled by the hall's exact location.\n\nA The tapestry shows Harold seen feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France.\n\nHowever, researchers' re-examining evidence found in 2006 by West Sussex Archaeology led to a stunning revelation. The initial 2006 investigation located two previously unidentified medieval structures at the site. One structure is built into a modern-day private residence, and the other was found in the property's garden. Dr. Duncan Wright, Senior Lecturer in Medieval Archaeology at Newcastle University and project leader, said a toilet from the period found in the building offered a vital clue. While having a toilet in your home is practically a given in every household today, they were typically only found in high-status and elite residences in England during the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A recent study reveals that PFAS, persistent chemical substances, contaminate nearly half of the drinking water supplies in the United States and could increase the risk of certain cancers.These substances, nicknamed \"forever chemicals\" due to their resistance to degradation, are ubiquitous in our environment. Used in many everyday products, they accumulate in soil, water, and even our bodies. A team of researchers has explored their impact on health, revealing concerning links with several types of cancer.PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are synthetic chemical compounds used for decades in industry. Their stability makes them extremely persistent in the environment, where they contaminate drinking water, soil, and food chains.Present in packaging, textiles, or household products, these pollutants infiltrate water supplies. In the United States, nearly 45% of drinking water sources contain them, exposing millions of people to health risks that are still poorly understood.The study, published in the, analyzed water contamination data and cancer rates between 2016 and 2021. The results show an increase of up to 33% in certain cancers in the most contaminated areas.Digestive, endocrine, and respiratory cancers are particularly affected. Men show an increased risk of urinary and brain cancers, while women are more affected by thyroid and soft tissue cancers.Researchers observed significant variations between men and women. In men, PFAS seem to promote brain and kidney cancers. In women, the risks of thyroid and soft tissue cancers are higher.These differences could be explained by distinct biological mechanisms related to hormonal disruptions caused by PFAS. However, further research is needed to confirm these hypotheses.Faced with these risks, U.S. authorities have announced measures to limit the presence of six types of PFAS in drinking water by 2029. However, scientists believe these actions remain too timid.They call for increased monitoring of less-studied PFAS and the adoption of stricter standards. Reducing exposure to these substances remains a priority to protect public health and prevent new cancer cases.Tap water, here singled out for its PFAS contamination, is not the only concern. Bottled water, perceived as a safer alternative, could also contain these \"forever chemicals.\" Recent studies have detected traces of PFAS in some brands of bottled water, although levels vary significantly.Regulations on PFAS in bottled water are less strict than for tap water. In the United States, for example, there is no specific federal standard for PFAS in bottled water. This means consumers cannot always be certain of the quality of the water they drink.While bottled water may seem purer, it is not without risks. PFAS can come from the water source itself or be introduced during the bottling process. Additionally, plastic bottles can release other contaminants, especially if exposed to heat.Finally, bottled water poses major environmental problems, including plastic waste production. Faced with these challenges, improving tap water quality and strengthening PFAS regulations appear to be more sustainable and effective solutions for protecting public health."

            "article_content": "These types of models are most effective at solving complex problems, so if you have any PhD-level math problems you\u2019re cracking away at, you can try them out. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve had issues with getting previous models to respond properly to your most advanced prompts, you may want to try out this new reasoning model on them. To try out o3-mini, simply select \u201cReason\u201d when you start a new prompt on ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough reasoning models possess new capabilities, they come at a cost. OpenAI\u2019s o1-mini is 20 times more expensive to run than its equivalent non-reasoning model, GPT-4o mini. The company says its new model, o3-mini, costs 63% less than o1-mini per input token However, at $1.10 per million input tokens, it is still about seven times more expensive to run than GPT-4o mini.\n\nThis new model is coming right after the DeepSeek release that shook the AI world less than two weeks ago. DeepSeek\u2019s new model performs just as well as top OpenAI models, but the Chinese company claims it cost roughly $6 million to train, as opposed to the estimated cost of over $100 million for training OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. (It\u2019s worth noting that a lot of people are interrogating this claim.)\n\nAdditionally, DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model costs $0.55 per million input tokens, half the price of o3-mini, so OpenAI still has a way to go to bring down its costs. It\u2019s estimated that reasoning models also have much higher energy costs than other types, given the larger number of computations they require to produce an answer.\n\nThis new wave of reasoning models present new safety challenges as well. OpenAI used a technique called deliberative alignment to train its o-series models, basically having them reference OpenAI\u2019s internal policies at each step of its reasoning to make sure they weren\u2019t ignoring any rules.\n\nBut the company has found that o3-mini, like the o1 model, is significantly better than non-reasoning models at jailbreaking and \u201cchallenging safety evaluations\u201d\u2014essentially, it\u2019s much harder to control a reasoning model given its advanced capabilities. o3-mini is the first model to score as \u201cmedium risk\u201d on model autonomy, a rating given because it\u2019s better than previous models at specific coding tasks\u2014indicating \u201cgreater potential for self-improvement and AI research acceleration,\u201d according to OpenAI. That said, the model is still bad at real-world research. If it were better at that, it would be rated as high risk, and OpenAI would restrict the model\u2019s release."

            "article_content": "January 31, 2025\u2014In a multicenter, retrospective review of patients admitted with intact and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs), and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), Conroy et al found that use of endovascular and complex endovascular techniques increased over the past 2 decades, surpassing open repair, and both intact AAA repairs and ruptured AAA admissions significantly decreased. Results were published online in Journal of Vascular Surgery.1\n\nKEY FINDINGS Over the past 2 decades, use of endovascular techniques for both intact and ruptured aortic aneurysms increased.\n\nEVAR and complex EVAR have surpassed open repair for all intact and ruptured AAAs and TAAAs.\n\nMortality rates after EVAR for AAAs have decreased, and mortality rates after complex EVAR have remained stable.\n\nDecreases were seen in ruptured AAA presentations, turndown rates for ruptured TAAA and TAA, and mortality after ruptured aortic aneurysms.\n\nInvestigators used diagnosis codes (ICD-9 and ICD-10) within the National Inpatient Sample to identify patients who were admitted for intact and ruptured AAAs, TAAs, and TAAAs between 2004 and 2019 and examined use of open repair, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), or complex EVAR (ie, branched, fenestrated, chimney/snorkel, physician-modified endografts) and subsequent in-hospital mortality. Turndown rates were collected for those presenting with ruptured aneurysms. A subanalysis of patients with TAA who presented after 2017 was performed, when the ICD-10 started to distinguish between ascending and arch TAA and descending TAA.\n\nFor AAA, 717,570 patients were identified (87% intact repairs, 13% ruptured admissions). The turndown rate for ruptured AAAs remained stable over the study period. Intact AAA repairs, ruptured AAA admissions, and ruptured AAA repairs significantly decreased (all P < .01). Open repair for intact AAA (55% to 11%) and ruptured AAA (90% to 32%) decreased, whereas use of EVAR increased (intact AAAs, 45% to 66%; ruptured AAAs, 10% to 55%). Use of complex EVAR increased significantly for both intact (0% to 23%; P < .01) and ruptured AAA repairs (0% to 14%; P < .01) during the study period.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2019, for intact AAAs, there was a 29% decrease in mortality after EVAR (0.73% to 0.52%; P < .01) and an increase of 16% after open repair (4.4% to 5.1%; P < .01).\n\nFor TAAAs, 27,443 patients were identified (80% intact, 20% ruptured). Over the study period, intact TAAA repairs increased, ruptured TAAA admissions decreased, and the turndown rate for ruptured TAAA decreased. Open repair for both intact and ruptured TAAA decreased from 96% and 97%, respectively, in 2004 to 28% and 58%, respectively, in 2019 (P < .01 and P = .01, respectively). Use of complex EVAR for both intact and ruptured TAAA increased from 3.8% and 2.6%, respectively, in 2004 to 72% and 42%, respectively, in 2019 (P < .01 and P = .01, respectively).\n\nFrom 2004 to 2019, mortality remained stable after both open repair and complex EVAR of intact and ruptured TAAAs (open repair: P = .99 and P = .95; complex EVAR: P = .74 and P = .56).\n\nFor TAAs, 141,651 patients were identified (90% intact, 10% ruptured). Both intact and ruptured TAA repairs increased during the study period, and the turndown rate decreased from 71% in 2004 to 48% in 2019 (P < .01). Use of open repair for intact TAA remained stable during the study period; however, a significant decrease was seen for ruptured TAAs from 100% in 2004 to 29% in 2019 (P < .01).\n\nMortality after open repair for intact TAA decreased, whereas it remained stable for ruptured TAA. Mortality after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of both intact and ruptured TAA remained stable over time.\n\nIn the subanalysis of TAA patients, TEVAR use was stable for all intact TAAs, increased for ruptured ascending or arch TAA, and remained stable for descending TAA. Mortality rates were unique to approach and thoracic aortic location: Increased mortality was seen for open repair of both intact and ruptured descending TAA, decreased mortality was seen for TEVAR of both intact and ruptured descending TAA, and decreased mortality was seen for both open repair or TEVAR of ascending or arch TAA.\n\nAs noted by the investigators, study limitations mainly stem from the use of the National Inpatient Sample database, including potential for coding and documentation errors, selection bias, and inability to detect readmissions, reinterventions, or late survival. The calculated turndown rates may also be overestimated, as patients may be transferred to other hospitals for management.\n\nThe investigators also note that these results show a discrepancy in in-hospital mortality regardless of approach, whether simple or complex, and this may encourage hospitals and practitioners to further analyze how they manage these patients. With the increasing adoption of endovascular interventions for aortic aneurysm patients, more studies are needed to compare long-term outcomes, concluded the investigators."

Those shares changed little from 2010 to 2020.\n\nData by GEOWEALTH-US. Minnesota Reformer Graphic\n\nThe estimates in the database are based the federal Survey of Consumer Finances , which asks respondents about their assets and debts, as well as the Census\u2019 American Community Survey , which measures demographics, income and home ownership.\n\nBehind the numbers\n\nThe rise in wealth inequality is driven by many factors, including the loss of high-paying blue collar jobs; the growing concentration of white-collar jobs in coastal metropolitan areas and big advanced economies like the Twin Cities; and changes to the tax code favoring the already-wealthy.\n\nWealth inequality in the United States is greater than in most other democracies . Racial wealth disparities , driven in part by decades of discriminatory policymaking, are often staggering.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s racial disparities are among the worst in the nation , partly due to the state\u2019s long history of redlining , or denying mortgages and other financial services to non-white people. Those century-old policies reverberate in maps of neighborhood inequality made today.\n\nThe richest and poorest Minnesota communities are all concentrated in the Twin Cities metro.\n\nThe wealthiest communities in the Twin Cities are roughly 10 times richer than the poorest ones, according to the data.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis map by Geowealth US shows the approximate median household income across Minnesota. The map divided into Public Use Microdata Areas, which are census divisions containing at least 100,000 people. Researchers often analyze data at this geographic level in order to see variation within densely populated counties. Minnesota Reformer\n\nMedian households in parts of the west metro \u2014 including Lake Minnetonka, Plymouth and Maple Grove \u2014 have a net worth well over $400,000. Those in parts of south Minneapolis and the western part of St. Paul have closer to $40,000.\n\nIn the richest areas of the country, like Palo Alto or the New York City suburbs, the typical family is worth well over $1 million. In the poorest communities, which are in New York, Houston and Milwaukee, the typical family has only $18,000 in assets.\n\n\u201cPeople who grow up in wealthier places can reap benefits that span generations,\u201d Tom Kemeny, one of the database\u2019s compilers, explained in a recent commentary . \u201cAs a result of property taxes and philanthropy, wealthier communities have greater resources for schools, health care, transportation and other infrastructure.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was originally published on MinnesotaReformer.com."

The same can be said even at the microscopic level of a \u201cnanoflower,\u201d compound combinations in chemistry that grow to form plantlike shapes. With this in mind, a research team based at Italy\u2019s University of Genoa have designed a novel nanostructure that relies on carnation-like nanoflowers containing enough surface area to host numerous wound-healing drug molecules.\n\nThe medical innovation is detailed in a study published in the journal ACS Applied Bio Materials. According to its creators, the bandage prototype uses two polyphenol-based materials\u2013copper phosphate and tannic acid. These reagents possess well-documented anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Once mixed and placed in a saline solution, the copper phosphate-tannic acid compounds begin to self-assemble and grow into recognizable, flower-like structures. From there, researchers then carefully attached these nanoflowers on small strips of electrospun nanofabric.\n\n\u201cPolyphenols, natural compounds abundant in phenolic structures, have received widespread attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer properties, making them valuable for biomedical applications,\u201d the team wrote in their study. \u201cHowever, the green synthesis of polyphenol-based materials with economical and environmentally friendly strategies is of great significance.\u201d\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to an accompanying announcement on January 31st, the nanoflower-covered fabrics not only \u201cinactivated\u201d the bacteria, but did so through the addition of antibiotic-resistant biofilms\u2014all while protecting lab-grown human cells.\n\nResearchers say their new, nanoflower based approach appears to be both cost-effective and extremely efficient, allowing for better means to speed up wound healing and fight infections. The possible benefits from nanoflowers aren\u2019t limited to medicine, either. Another study, published in October 2024 in Advanced Materials, points to uses across real-time imaging, wastewater purification, and even microrobotics."

            "article_content": "A bright fireball streaked across the sky above mountains, glaciers and spruce forest near the town of Revelstoke in British Columbia, Canada, on the evening of March 31, 1965. Fragments of this meteorite, discovered by beaver trappers, fell over a lake. A layer of ice saved them from the depths and allowed scientists a peek into the birth of the solar system.\n\nNearly 60 years later, NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission returned from space with a sample of an asteroid named Bennu, similar to the one that rained rocks over Revelstoke. Our research team has published a chemical analysis of those samples, providing insight into how some of the ingredients for life may have first arrived on Earth.\n\nWATCH: NASA scientists unveil first near-Earth asteroid sample returned to U.S.\n\nBorn in the years bracketing the Revelstoke meteorite\u2019s fall, the two of us have spent our careers in the meteorite collections of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and the Natural History Museum in London. We\u2019ve dreamed of studying samples from a Revelstoke-like asteroid collected by a spacecraft.\n\nThen, nearly two decades ago, we began turning those dreams into reality. We joined NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission team, which aimed to send a spacecraft to collect and return an asteroid sample to Earth. After those samples arrived on Sept. 24, 2023, we got to dive into a tale of rock, ice and water that hints at how life could have formed on Earth.\n\nThe CI chondrites and asteroid Bennu\n\nTo learn about an asteroid \u2013 a rocky or metallic object in orbit around the Sun \u2013 we started with a study of meteorites.\n\nAsteroids like Bennu are rocky or metallic objects in orbit around the Sun. Meteorites are the pieces of asteroids and other natural extraterrestrial objects that survive the fiery plunge to the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nWe really wanted to study an asteroid similar to a set of meteorites called chondrites, whose components formed in a cloud of gas and dust at the dawn of the solar system billions of years ago.\n\nThe Revelstoke meteorite is in a group called CI chondrites. Laboratory-measured compositions of CI chondrites are essentially identical, minus hydrogen and helium, to the composition of elements carried by convection from the interior of the Sun and measured in the outermost layer of the Sun. Since their components formed billions of years ago, they\u2019re like chemically unchanged time capsules for the early solar system.\n\nREAD MORE: What a NASA mission to study a metallic asteroid may teach us about Earth\u2019s core\n\nSo, geologists use the chemical compositions of CI chondrites as the ultimate reference standard for geochemistry. They can compare the compositions of everything from other chondrites to Earth rocks. Any differences from the CI chondrite composition would have happened through the same processes that formed asteroids and planets.\n\nCI chondrites are rich in clay and formed when ice melted in an ancient asteroid, altering the rock. They are also rich in prebiotic organic molecules. Some of these types of molecules are the building blocks for life.\n\nThis combination of rock, water and organics is one reason OSIRIS-REx chose to sample the organic-rich asteroid Bennu, where water and organic compounds essential to the origin of life could be found.\n\nEvaporites \u2212 the legacy of an ancient brine\n\nEver since the Bennu samples returned to Earth on Sept. 24, 2023, we and our colleagues on four continents have spent hundreds of hours studying them.\n\nThe instruments on the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft made observations of reflected light that revealed the most abundant minerals and organics when it was near asteroid Bennu. Our analyses in the laboratory found that the compositions of these samples lined up with those observations.\n\nThe samples are mostly water-rich clay, with sulfide, carbonate and iron oxide minerals. These are the same minerals found in CI chondrites like Revelstoke. The discovery of rare minerals within the Bennu samples, however, surprised both of us. Despite our decades of experience studying meteorites, we have never seen many of these minerals.\n\nWe found minerals dominated by sodium, including carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides, as well as potassium chloride and magnesium phosphate. These minerals don\u2019t form just when water and rock react. They form when water evaporates.\n\nWe\u2019ve never seen most of these sodium-rich minerals in meteorites, but they\u2019re sometimes found in dried-up lake beds on Earth, like Searles Lake in California.\n\nBennu\u2019s rocks formed 4.5 billion years ago on a larger parent asteroid. That asteroid was wet and muddy. Under the surface, pockets of water perhaps only a few feet across were evaporating, leaving the evaporite minerals we found in the sample. That same evaporation process also formed the ancient lake beds we\u2019ve seen these minerals in on Earth.\n\nWATCH: NASA releases first images from OSIRIS-REx touchdown on asteroid\n\nBennu\u2019s parent asteroid likely broke apart 1 to 2 billion years ago, and some of the fragments came together to form the rubble pile we know as Bennu.\n\nThese minerals are also found on icy bodies in the outer solar system. Bright deposits on the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest body in the asteroid belt, contain sodium carbonate. The Cassini mission measured the same mineral in plumes on Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus.\n\nWe also learned that these minerals, formed when water evaporates, disappear when exposed to water once again \u2013 even with the tiny amount of water found in air. After studying some of the Bennu samples and their minerals, researchers stored the samples in air. That\u2019s what we do with meteorites.\n\nUnfortunately, we lost these minerals as moisture in the air on Earth caused them to dissolve. But that explains why we can\u2019t find these minerals in meteorites that have been on Earth for decades to centuries.\n\nFortunately, most of the samples have been stored and transported in nitrogen, protected from traces of water in the air.\n\nUntil scientists were able to conduct a controlled sample return with a spacecraft and carefully curate and store the samples in nitrogen, we had never seen this set of minerals in a meteorite.\n\nAn unexpected discovery\n\nBefore returning the samples, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft spent over two years making observations around Bennu. From that two years of work, researchers learned that the surface of the asteroid is covered in rocky boulders.\n\nWe could see that the asteroid is rich in carbon and water-bearing clays, and we saw veins of white carbonate a few feet long deposited by ancient liquid water. But what we couldn\u2019t see from these observations were the rarer minerals.\n\nREAD MORE: NASA Dart spacecraft rams into an asteroid in defense test\n\nWe used an array of techniques to go through the returned sample one tiny grain at a time. These included CT scanning, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, each of which allowed us to look at the rock at a scale not possible on the asteroid.\n\nCooking up the ingredients for life\n\nFrom the salts we identified, we could infer the composition of the briny water from which they formed and see how it changed over time, becoming more sodium-rich.\n\nThis briny water would have been an ideal place for new chemical reactions to take place and for organic molecules to form.\n\nWhile our team characterized salts, our organic chemist colleagues were busy identifying the carbon-based molecules present in Bennu. They found unexpectedly high levels of ammonia, an essential building block of the amino acids that form proteins in living matter. They also found all five of the nucleobases that make up part of DNA and RNA.\n\nBased on these results, we\u2019d venture to guess that these briny pods of fluid would have been the perfect environments for increasingly complicated organic molecules to form, such as the kinds that make up life on Earth.\n\nREAD MORE: Out-of-this-world space missions to watch in 2025\n\nWhen asteroids like Bennu hit the young Earth, they could have provided a complete package of complex molecules and the ingredients essential to life, such as water, phosphate and ammonia. Together, these components could have seeded Earth\u2019s initially barren landscape to produce a habitable world.\n\nWithout this early bombardment, perhaps when the pieces of the Revelstoke meteorite landed several billion years later, these fragments from outer space would not have arrived into a landscape punctuated with glaciers and trees.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "Two Columbus School District educators are recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nSuzy Zietlow, a third-grade teacher at the Discovery Charter School, and Mark Bussian, the district\u2019s instructional coach, have received the nation\u2019s highest honor for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nThe two Columbus educators are among 336 educators around the country to receive the award.\n\nZietlow began her career at the Discovery Charter School in 2010.\n\n\u201cI started teaching second grade at Discovery Charter School and in 2012 I moved up to third grade,\u201d said Zietlow, who has a degree in microbiology and briefly did research before getting her teaching certificate from UW-Stevens Point.\n\nZietlow said she was nominated for the award by a friend who works for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction whom she had gone to conferences within the past.\n\n\u201cHe had seen what I did in my classroom and nominated me,\u201d Zietlow said, which started her on the application process in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn Discovery Charter School, we focus a lot on science and outdoor classroom work,\u201d Zietlow said. \u201cFor part of our culture, we have the regular math curriculum, and we follow a standards-based literacy curriculum, too, but whenever possible we are using science in those areas.\u201d\n\nStudents also are taken outside regularly to learn subjects with the help of their natural surroundings, Zietlow said.\n\nBussian has been the Columbus School District\u2019s instructional coach for the last year. He was the second-grade teacher at Token Springs Elementary School in Sun Prairie when he became a finalist for the award in 2022. Bussian said he was nominated by his principal there.\n\nBussian said he believes he was nominated for the award in part because of \u201cthe way I interact with students and look at different students\u2019 individual needs and the opportunities that I am able to give them instead of just a one size fits all approach. It is individualizing and personalizing and meeting them where they are at for their needs.\u201d\n\nHe focuses on helping all students to reflect on their learning and see where they are doing well, and where they need improvement, Bussian said.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I am able to coach them up rather than be the person who is always in front of the class,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cIt is more an opportunity for them to learn everything based on the standards and learn from that.\u201d\n\nIn his new position in Columbus, Bussian said he likes working with a variety of different grade levels.\n\n\u201cI work with 4K all the way to high school teachers, and I am able to help them to work on best practices and things along those lines,\u201d Bussian said. \u201cI always say the teachers that I work with are the experts in their content area, and I am the one who can serve as a thought partner or can help with assessments or resources. If they have questions on why certain students might not be understanding concepts, then I\u2019m a sound board but also an extra set of eyes. I work very close with the teachers and that gives me a chance to work with a variety of students, too.\u201d\n\nWith the award, the two educators will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, a certificate signed by the president and a trip to Washington, D.C. . While they are in Washington, they will participate in professional development activities and network with fellow STEM educators.\n\nBussian said they haven\u2019t been told a date yet for the trip to Washington.\n\nGALLERY: Columbus Fourth of July Parade fills the streets Columbus001.jpg Columbus002.jpg Columbus003.jpg Columbus004.jpg Columbus005.jpg Columbus006.jpg Columbus007.jpg Columbus008.jpg Columbus009.jpg Columbus010.jpg Columbus011.jpg Columbus012.jpg Columbus013.jpg Columbus014.jpg Columbus015.jpg Columbus016.jpg Columbus017.jpg Columbus018.jpg Columbus019.jpg Columbus020.jpg Columbus021.jpg Columbus022.jpg Columbus023.jpg Columbus024.jpg Columbus025.jpg Columbus026.jpg Columbus027.jpg Columbus028.jpg Columbus029.jpg Columbus030.jpg Columbus031.jpg Columbus032.jpg Columbus033.jpg Columbus034.jpg Columbus035.jpg Columbus036.jpg Columbus037.jpg Columbus038.jpg Columbus039.jpg Columbus040.jpg Columbus041.jpg Columbus042.jpg Columbus043.jpg Columbus044.jpg Columbus045.jpg Columbus046.jpg Columbus047.jpg Columbus048.jpg Columbus049.jpg Columbus050.jpg Columbus051.jpg Columbus052.jpg Columbus053.jpg Columbus054.jpg Columbus055.jpg Columbus056.jpg Columbus057.jpg Columbus058.jpg Columbus059.jpg Columbus060.jpg Columbus061.jpg Columbus062.jpg Columbus063.jpg Columbus064.jpg Columbus065.jpg Columbus066.jpg Columbus067.jpg Columbus068.jpg Columbus069.jpg Columbus070.jpg Columbus071.jpg Columbus072.jpg Columbus073.jpg Columbus074.jpg Columbus075.jpg Columbus076.jpg Columbus077.jpg Columbus078.jpg Columbus079.jpg Columbus080.jpg Columbus081.jpg Columbus082.jpg Columbus083.jpg Columbus084.jpg Columbus085.jpg Columbus086.jpg Columbus087.jpg Columbus088.jpg Columbus089.jpg Columbus090.jpg Columbus091.jpg Columbus092.jpg Columbus093.jpg Columbus094.jpg Columbus095.jpg Columbus096.jpg Columbus097.jpg Columbus098.jpg Columbus099.jpg Columbus100.jpg Columbus101.jpg Columbus102.jpg Columbus103.jpg Columbus104.jpg Columbus105.jpg Columbus106.jpg Columbus107.jpg Columbus108.jpg Columbus109.jpg Columbus110.jpg Columbus111.jpg Columbus112.jpg Columbus113.jpg Columbus114.jpg Columbus115.jpg Columbus116.jpg Columbus117.jpg Columbus118.jpg Columbus119.jpg Columbus120.jpg Columbus121.jpg Columbus122.jpg Columbus123.jpg Columbus124.jpg Columbus125.jpg Columbus126.jpg Columbus127.jpg Columbus128.jpg Columbus129.jpg Columbus130.jpg Columbus131.jpg Columbus132.jpg Columbus133.jpg Columbus134.jpg Columbus135.jpg Columbus136.jpg Columbus137.jpg Columbus138.jpg Columbus139.jpg Columbus140.jpg Columbus141.jpg Columbus142.jpg Columbus143.jpg Columbus144.jpg Columbus145.jpg Columbus146.jpg Columbus147.jpg Columbus148.jpg Columbus149.jpg Columbus150.jpg Columbus151.jpg Columbus152.jpg Columbus153.jpg Columbus154.jpg Columbus155.jpg Columbus156.jpg Columbus157.jpg Columbus158.jpg Columbus159.jpg Columbus160.jpg Columbus161.jpg Columbus162.jpg Columbus163.jpg Columbus164.jpg Columbus165.jpg Columbus166.jpg Columbus167.jpg Columbus168.jpg Columbus169.jpg Columbus170.jpg Columbus171.jpg Columbus172.jpg Columbus173.jpg Columbus174.jpg Columbus175.jpg Columbus176.jpg Columbus177.jpg Columbus178.jpg Columbus179.jpg Columbus180.jpg Columbus181.jpg Columbus182.jpg Columbus183.jpg Columbus184.jpg Columbus185.jpg Columbus186.jpg Columbus187.jpg Columbus188.jpg Columbus189.jpg"

            "article_content": "Tyler Shepherd\n\nContributor\n\nAs global supply chains grow increasingly complex, innovative solutions are becoming essential for resilience and efficiency. Jan Balatka, Managing Director of Semantic Visions, brings nearly two decades of experience in consulting and AI leadership to this challenge. His expertise shapes the company\u2019s efforts to use advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and data-driven tools to help businesses tackle these issues head-on.\n\nUnderstanding Today\u2019s Challenges\n\nModern supply chains are under pressure from increasing regulations, globalization, and rapid technological change. \u201cThese challenges are creating difficulties not just for manufacturers but for every layer of the supply chain,\u201d says Balatka. Drawing from his years working with global businesses, he understands the critical need for solutions that provide visibility and control across supply networks. Semantic Visions addresses this by offering AI-powered tools that monitor risks and identify opportunities, even within often-overlooked lower tiers of the supply chain.\n\nHow Technology is Driving Change\n\nSemantic Visions employs a range of technologies to transform supply chain management:\n\nAI and Automation: Advanced AI models analyze structured and unstructured data, providing faster and more accurate decision-making. Balatka\u2019s background in AI leadership ensures these models meet the diverse needs of supply chain operations.\n\nGlobal Monitoring: Their system tracks over 13 million companies worldwide, scanning information in 12 languages to detect potential disruptions like financial instability or delays at ports.\n\nSeamless Integration: Using low-code/no-code platforms, Semantic Visions helps businesses connect legacy systems to modern tools, reducing inefficiencies\u2014a challenge Balatka frequently encountered in his consulting career.\n\nRemoving Barriers to Transformation\n\nDespite the benefits of digital tools, many businesses face challenges like limited IT resources and fragmented systems. \u201cSupply chain teams often have to compete with other departments for IT support,\u201d Balatka notes. His experience in working with resource-constrained organizations informs Semantic Visions\u2019 approach: start small by focusing on areas with the most significant impact and gradually expand efforts. Outsourcing IT resources or using AI tools to bridge language and time zone gaps can also help.\n\nThe Future of Supply Chains\n\nBalatka predicts that automation and the use of both software and hardware robots will play a key role in addressing labor shortages and improving efficiency. For companies just starting their digital transformation journey, he advises focusing on critical pain points and adopting widely used platforms for smoother transitions.\n\nA Practical Lesson in Supply Chain Management\n\nBalatka\u2019s experience in consulting often revealed how small oversights could have significant impacts. In one case, a client\u2019s packaging strategy led to inefficiencies, with single pens being shipped in oversized boxes\u2014wasting resources and driving up costs. By combining open-source intelligence (OSINT) data with AI, Semantic Visions enables companies to uncover similar inefficiencies that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, their AI-driven tools can detect subtle supply chain disruptions, such as delays caused by specific suppliers or inefficient processes, by analyzing unstructured data from global sources. This ability to pinpoint overlooked details helps businesses refine their operations and avoid costly mistakes, ensuring greater efficiency throughout the supply chain.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSemantic Visions aims to expand its reach and provide greater visibility into multi-tiered supply chains. \u201cOur goal is to help businesses understand their supply chains beyond the first tier,\u201d Balatka explains. By integrating his deep industry knowledge into Semantic Visions\u2019 strategy, Balatka is positioning the company to lead the digital transformation of supply chains worldwide.\n\nAs digital transformation accelerates, leaders like Balatka with Semantic Visions are paving the way for a more resilient and efficient supply chain industry."

            "article_content": "Chris Gallagher\n\nContributor\n\nAny quality research churns out huge amounts of data. This data needs to be analyzed and depending on the amount of information waiting for processing, you may be in it for a while. But that won't be the case if you have excellent research software for data analysis. This software comes with plenty of benefits that make it a worthy partner in your research process.\n\nHere are the benefits you can gain when you pick the right system for your research.\n\nIncreased Efficiency and Timesaving\n\nSay you're working on a large dataset. Maybe it\u2019s survey responses from hundreds\u2014or even thousands\u2014of people. Now, analyzing that data manually could take days. You\u2019d need to sift through entries, remove duplicates, and standardize formats like dates and numbers. Tedious, isn\u2019t it?\n\nReputable research software like ATLAS.ti or any others you're well-versed with can significantly help here. These tools can streamline data management and improve analytical accuracy, which can accelerate the research process while ensuring comprehensive and insightful analysis.\n\nAlso, many of these tools come with AI-powered features, which can help improve productivity almost 5 times over. Instead of struggling with repetitive tasks, you can focus on more exciting things like analyzing trends, drawing conclusions, or preparing that killer presentation.\n\nImproved Accuracy and Reduced Errors\n\nEven with your most careful efforts, you can still enter a number incorrectly or miss a detail when calculating averages. And when you\u2019re working with a lot of data, those small errors can snowball into major problems. Research software helps eliminate this risk.\n\nMost of these tools come programmed to follow strict rules, ensuring consistent and accurate results. However, this level of accuracy is contingent on you finding the best software to handle the type of data you're analyzing. If you're curious about what to go for, read more here or in any other guide to be well-informed.\n\nHaving the right tool for the job can allow you to replicate calculations easily. Also, if you need to double-check or share your work, you won\u2019t have to start from scratch. This accuracy boosts confidence, whether you\u2019re presenting findings to stakeholders or publishing your research.\n\nAdvanced Analytical Capabilities\n\nSometimes, basic calculations or charts just don\u2019t cut it. Say you\u2019re a social scientist trying to predict trends in public opinion. Or maybe you\u2019re a business analyst looking for hidden patterns in customer purchase behavior. Manually spotting these trends is nearly impossible, especially with large datasets.\n\nResearch software opens up a world of advanced analytics. These tools can handle qualitative data, like open-ended survey responses or interview transcripts. It helps you identify recurring themes without the headache of manually combing through piles of text.\n\nThis software also lets you run complex statistical tests. For example, you could compare how two groups respond to a new product or predict future sales using regression models. The good thing about many of these tools is that they come with user-friendly interfaces or tutorials. So, even if you\u2019re not a data scientist, you can perform high-level analyses with a bit of practice.\n\nEnhanced Data Visualization\n\nYou\u2019ve just finished analyzing your data, and the results are groundbreaking. But when you present it, your audience just stares at a table filled with rows of numbers. The message gets lost, and your hard work feels wasted.\n\nWith the proper research software, this may not be the case, as they often come with data visualization tools. These tools can transform raw numbers into stunning visuals that tell a story. You can use them to create bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, and even interactive dashboards.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re presenting sales performance to your team, a heatmap can highlight top-performing regions at a glance. Or, if you\u2019re a health researcher, a line graph could show the rise and fall of disease cases over time.\n\nYour audience can drill down into the data themselves. They can click on a chart to see more details or filter data by categories that interest them. Strong visuals don\u2019t just make your work look professional. They help you communicate findings more effectively.\n\nCollaboration and Accessibility\n\nIn some cases, you might be working on a research project with a team scattered across different cities\u2014or even continents. If so, then sharing files back and forth through email becomes chaotic. Files get lost, versions get mixed up, and you waste precious time trying to sort it all out.\n\nResearch software can solve this headache. Many tools are cloud-based, meaning your entire team can access the same data and work in real time. This is a big deal, given that data analytics takes the biggest bite of the apple when it comes to cloud usage, at 86%, followed by software engineering at 83%.\n\nThese tools can go a long way when it comes to collaboration. One person can clean the data while another creates visuals\u2014all at the same time. These tools also track changes. So, if someone edits a dataset or adjusts a chart, you can easily see who did what and when. This transparency reduces misunderstandings and ensures accountability.\n\nPlus, the accessibility factor is unbeatable. Whether you\u2019re at home, in the office, or on the go, you can log in and pick up right where you left off. That kind of flexibility is a game-changer for teamwork and productivity.\n\nScalability for Large Datasets\n\nSay you\u2019re a small business owner today, working with customer data from a few hundred people. But what happens when your business grows? Suddenly, you\u2019re dealing with thousands\u2014or even millions\u2014of entries. Handling that kind of scale manually is impossible.\n\nResearch software is designed to grow with you. These tools can process massive datasets as they\u2019re built for speed and efficiency, even when the numbers are in the millions. Another benefit is that these tools don\u2019t just handle the data\u2014they make it easy to securely store and access. So, even if your data keeps growing, you\u2019ll never run out of space.\n\nThe best part? Many of these tools are modular. You can start small and upgrade features as your needs expand. This scalability makes research software a long-term investment, saving you time, money, and stress as your data needs evolve.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nResearch software is a tool that can 100% turn your data analysis around. This guide has introduced you to the benefits that come with having one on board. If indeed it's the path you want to take, take your time, do your research and settle for the right fit for your project."

It is unsurprising, therefore, that AI forms part of both the problem and the solution. Accompanied by a governance model that has a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d component, AI-enabled solutions can support more efficient and effective systems and controls for the prevention of financial crime risks. In this article we explore the current use of AI to combat financial crime and what lies ahead for firms using third parties to comply with their obligations in this area.\n\nAI-enabled financial crime compliance\n\nAI continues to dominate both professional and private conversation.The financial services sector have been early adopters to the technology, using AI widely, including within their risk and compliance functions.AI\u2019s role in fraud detection and prevention has developed rapidly: the Bank of England and FCA\u2019s third survey of AI and machine learning in UK financial services revealed that it is the third highest use case in financial services and is expected to increase in the next 3 years. Additionally, customer due diligence and transaction monitoring are two areas where AI can deliver significant operational efficiencies.\n\nWhat is driving this trend? Financial crime plainly remains one of the most significant risks facing financial services firms and remains firmly within the regulator\u2019s focus \u2013 tackling financial crime is one of the main objectives in the FCA\u2019s new 5-year strategy 2025-2030. Firms are significantly motivated to adopt more sophisticated and dynamic ways to protect against financial crime risks, which AI-enabled tools offer.\n\nRecent examples of the use of AI in this area are real success stories. AI-enabled tools have been used to:\n\nHowever, these AI-enabled tools are inherently complex, requiring considerable resource and extensive market data to develop and maintain. Third-party providers of AI enabled tools designed to detect and combat financial crime have emerged, raising important questions of governance, accountability, expertise and, ultimately, regulatory compliance.\n\nThe Reliance on Third Parties A third of all current AI use cases deployed by respondents to the regulators\u2019 AI survey are third-party implementations, up from 17% in the regulators\u2019 equivalent 2022 survey. Risk and compliance was the business area with the second highest percentage of third-party implementations (64%), narrowly behind usage in HR (65%). The regulators anticipate that the use of third-party implementations will increase as AI models become more complex and outsourcing costs decrease. Coupled with the likely increased reliance on third party providers in AI use, evidence suggests that firms have an inadequate understanding of how outsourced systems operate and are trained. For example, almost 50% of respondents in the Bank of England\u2019s survey reported having only a partial understanding of the AI technologies they use, admitting \u201ca lack of complete understanding\u201d where these technologies are developed by third parties rather than internally. This is problematic given the regulatory requirements governing the oversight of outsourced functions, which includes use of third party AI tools. Such oversight cannot be properly exercised where the host firm does not understand the system. Firms will need to consider how the fundamental differences in AI, compared with algorithmic models before it, impact the discharge of their responsibilities. Whist the typical safeguards contained in an outsourcing agreement, i.e. provisions that stipulate audit rights and business continuity arrangements, may mitigate emergent risks in the area, a new suite of protective solutions and governance arrangements will be required. This need is particularly apparent in respect of data. AI-enabled tools that rely on poor quality or incomplete data will, necessarily, produce poor quality outcomes. Data governance and standards have never been more important and will be a fast-developing field in the context of AI models. Similarly, firms will need to implement measures to protect against third party models generating biased results, a likely focus of regulatory concern. The FCA has cautioned that firms using AI-enabled tools should consider whether they may lead to worse outcomes for some groups of consumers, in breach of the Consumer Duty, due to these technologies embedding or amplifying bias. Bias can occur at any point from the creation of the algorithm to its deployment. Incorrect problem-framing or reliance on datasets that are not representative of the firms\u2019 customer demographic will result in an inherently biased learning process and discriminatory outputs. Use of third-party models that rely on market-wide transfer learning in risk detection (i.e. leveraging pre-existing models trained on large financial datasets) may exacerbate this problem. The use of third-party AI models may also present an accountability challenge, if not deficit, especially where the developers and providers are outside of the regulatory perimeter. Failures connected with the operation of financial crime systems and controls have already been a significant focus of regulatory enforcement action. The FCA\u2019s issuance of Final Notices to Metro Bank Plc and Starling Bank Ltd in late 2024 are stark examples. However, there have not been any related actions taken against Senior Managers, which may speak to the evidential challenges presented by such cases. Whilst, establishing individual accountability may become more difficult in respect of AI systems which have a significant third party component, regulators may closely scrutinise firms\u2019 standards of governance and oversight. Firms will need to have staff with the requisite expertise and training, to ensure that auditing and oversight of the models, and their development, can be monitored effectively. They will also need to assess the appropriate extent to which \u201chumans in the loop\u201d should be incorporated into the operation of the model, i.e. where does the appropriate balance between efficiency and protection lie? Should failings emerge, unravelling what went wrong and who was ultimately responsible will be challenging due to the complexity of the models and number of parties feeding into the systems. Firms will need to be able to explain, in a meaningful way, the machine learning model and any resulting decisions, especially if they lead to consumer harm. Firms need also to design and implement feedback mechanisms to detect and prevent model drift, and enable prompt reaction to bias or new threats. These are significant questions, which will require input at a Board level. Where an unacceptable accountability deficit emerges, the Regulator may shift its focus on the governance arrangements in firms, instead casting its perimeter wider, to include third party providers of AI financial crime systems within the regulatory fold. This has already been done in respect of critical third party providers, who supply material services to financial sector. That approach may be rolled out in other areas in which the industry\u2019s dependence on third party providers for complex AI systems becomes entrenched."

            "article_content": "On the night of February 3, 2023, the lives of the residents of East Palestine, Ohio were forever changed. Thirty-eight cars of a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed, erupting into a massive fire that released toxic chemicals into our air, water, and land, just a mile from my home. The sight of a huge fireball from my driveway felt like a scene from an apocalyptic movie. Little did I know, this was only the beginning.\n\nNorfolk Southern released and ignited 115,000 gallons of vinyl chloride, a lethal flammable gas used to make PVC plastic, along with a variety of other chemicals and petroleum products. The smoke wafted for miles, and we braved evacuation orders, health scares, a federal investigation, and a cleanup that is still ongoing. Nearly two years later, my community remains profoundly affected.\n\nEast Palestine and Norfolk Southern recently reached a $22 million settlement. And next week, Vice President JD Vance is expected to visit our town.\n\nA Norfolk Southern train passes through the center of town in East Palestine, May 16, 2023. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nAs we continue to navigate the aftermath of this disaster, now is the time for President Donald Trump and Vance to address the challenges we still face. Their presence in East Palestine, especially in the early days after the disaster, comforted many of us who felt abandoned by government and corporate entities. They gave us hope that even in times of partisan division, leaders could come together to support those in need.\n\nWhile we all felt the immediate effects of this disaster, it is the ongoing recovery that is truly testing our resilience. I am the Chair of the Community Advisory Board for the East Palestine Train Derailment Health Tracking Study spearheaded by Dr. Erin Haynes from the University of Kentucky. One third of study participants show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and these levels have continued to rise through our last reporting period. In addition, around half of the participants indicated they continue to experience upper airway symptoms and non-sinus headaches as well, highlighting the ongoing physical health issues that the community is facing. These findings underscore the severe and lasting impact of the disaster on the residents of East Palestine, emphasizing the urgent need for continued support and intervention.\n\nBoth Trump and Vance have criticized the federal response to the East Palestine disaster. \"We stand with you. We pray for you. And we will stand with you and your fight to help ensure the accountability that you deserve,\u201d said Trump in 2023. \u201cYou have a President going to Ukraine and you have people in Ohio that are in desperate need of help.\u201d\n\nJessica Conard addresses the media outside of the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio, June 14, 2023. Residents from East Palestine assembled to petition Governor DeWine to issue an emergency declaration. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\n\"Biden and FEMA said they would not send federal aid to East Palestine under any circumstance. They're not going to send aid,\" Trump also said. (The situation did not qualify for FEMA disaster relief, although the Environmental Protection Agency, National Transportation Safety Board, and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) all contributed resources in the aftermath of the crash.)\n\nAdditionally, Vance also strongly criticized the Biden Administration\u2019s response. \u201cThe Biden administration has ignored Ohio\u2019s pleas for help. This is inexcusable: a disaster declaration would guarantee the delivery of resources the community needs to save itself,\u201d Vance wrote in an August 2023 op-ed. \u201cCleanup efforts overseen by Joe Biden\u2019s environmental protection officials have also been woefully inadequate\u2026Despite the federal government\u2019s vast resources, it appears to be woefully incapable of monitoring the long-term health impacts of a chemical spill.\u201d\n\nNow in their roles as the President and Vice President of the United States, Trump and Vance can address the critiques they lobbed at the previous administration and directly make good on their promises.\n\nBeyond lip service, there are several concrete steps they must take in order to truly support East Palestine.\n\nContaminated soil is removed and loaded onto trucks at the site of the Norfolk Southern toxic train derailment, Oct. 16, 2023. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nProvide long-term healthcare\n\nImpacted residents are still experiencing health effects from chemical exposure and contamination lingering from the 2023 incident, and there is still no organized healthcare guidance nor a funding source for necessary care. It is critical that everyone can access the medical support they need. The President can enact an emergency declaration or urge the HHS to declare a public health emergency to ensure treatment for short- and long-term health impacts for anyone exposed to environmental health hazards from the train derailment and its aftermath.\n\nIn 2023, both Vance and his fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, supported an emergency declaration to activate provisions under Section 1881A of the Social Security Act which allows for emergency funding to be distributed to communities affected by disasters. These funds would be a lifeline for many families here who are still grappling with health concerns, economic hardship, and ongoing cleanup efforts. Now as Vice President, Vance needs to ensure federal funds are expediently and strategically allocated to ensure the healthcare needs of our impacted community are safeguarded both in the short term and long term.\n\nMisti Allison instructs East Palestine residents on how to monitor their indoor air quality using a mobile app, Aug. 18, 2023. After a private donor donated 70 indoor air monitors in Aug. 2023, Allison volunteered to design an indoor air quality study. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nIncrease funding for health research\n\nFamilies in East Palestine deserve to understand the long-term health implications of the Norfolk Southern train derailment. Trusted and respected research institutions that were awarded six National Institutes of Health grants to study the short- and long-term impacts of what happened in East Palestine need prolonged funding to help us understand and address the potential health risks faced by our community. Without prolonged funding, these research studies will expire at the end of the year.\n\nMisti Allison and Robin Seman, along with three of Seman\u2019s children, meet with the EPA local response coordinator Mark Durno, Sept. 19, 2023. Rebecca Kiger for TIME\n\nSafeguard environmental monitoring and testing\n\nThe cleanup, monitoring, and testing efforts of our town must continue for decades to ensure that our environment remains safe and habitable. Ongoing support for these efforts is crucial to the health and well-being of our community. This support should include comprehensive environmental testing of our water, land, and air. Additionally, it is essential to regularly test private wells, as they could become contaminated years from now, posing long-term health risks to residents.\n\nTwo years ago, Trump promised our community that he would do everything in his power to ensure our safety and well-being, and that he would not rest until the truth was uncovered. And Vance has repeatedly assured us of his unwavering commitment to working with organizations to ensure East Palestine gets the help it desperately needs and that those responsible are held accountable. Their efforts have given us a glimmer of hope that meaningful change can arise from this disaster.\n\nHowever, we have not yet seen Trump and Vance\u2019s promises turn into action. And we still face a daunting journey ahead in terms of public health, economic recovery, and environmental cleanup. But with the right federal support, I am confident we can implement a comprehensive plan to protect those affected.\n\nOur community demands answers and results, not more excuses. President Trump and Vice President Vance must step up and get East Palestine back on track and set a precedent for how the federal government should support an American community."

This target implies a potential upside of 24% from the current levels.Inox Wind shares rallied 11.93% to hit an intra-day high of188.45.The brokerage also said Inox Wind is one of only two wind-EPC suppliers in India, riding tailwinds of RTC, FDRE and C&I demand.Nuvama said that Inox Wind's revenue per MW was subdued at Rs 4.5 crore per MW due to low EPC sales, which was offset by higher operating profit margin at 22.7% against an estimate of 17% on product heavy mix.Its profit exceeded expectations of 27%, adjusted for exceptional items (higher other income offset by one-off tax charge).Order inflow was soft at 231 MW, taking order book to 3.3 GW with a large order pipeline.\"Guidance was retained at FY25/26 execution of 800MW/1200MW and 17%-plus OPMs,\" Nuvama said.Inox Wind remains a key player in the C&I segment and benefits from a duopolistic market in wind EPC. OB of 3.3GW (execution over 24 months) lends revenue visibility, according said, adding that it remains positive on the sector and the company.The brokerage has tweaked its FY25 and FY27 estimates, cutting realisation/MW, factoring lower EPC execution and inching up margin.Inox Wind CEO Kailash Tarachandani expressed confidence in ramping up execution from Q4 FY25 onwards.\u201cWe have been able to deliver another quarter of strong results in Q3 and are confident of delivering significantly higher execution from Q4 FY25 onwards,\u201d Kailash Tarachandani said.On the charts, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Inox Wind is at 52.2. An RSI reading above 70 would mean that the stock is in overbought territory.Five out of the six analysts that have coverage on Inox Wind maintained a 'Buy' rating on the stock while one has a 'Hold rating.Shares of Inox Wind Ltd. are currently trading 6.21% higher on Saturday at178.80."

But have some of the most gorgeous and dramatic hikes in all of Europe. They also have guesthouses, mountain huts and hotels that feel like what the Alps were like 30-plus years ago, all owned by local families and run in a traditional way very authentic to the place and culture.\"\n\nCan't-miss: Hiking in Valbona Valley National Park\n\nBest time to go: June to September\n\nAverage flight price: $926 to Tirana, Albania\n\nEcuadorian cloud forest\n\nGerard Puigmal | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Allie Almario, South America and Galapagos expert at Premier Tours\n\nWhy to visit: \"Most people think of Costa Rica when they think of cloud forest, but Ecuador also has the lure of the Galapagos Islands, so it's a terrific combination. About three hours from the capital city of Quito, Ecuador, the cloud forest feels primeval and otherworldly.\n\n\"I love the Mashpi Eco Lodge, which is on the cusp of the rain and cloud forest in a private sanctuary. You've got incredibly rich biodiversity in this remote area \u2014 so remote the silence is almost deafening.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"Mashpi Lodge offers an activity called the Dragon Fly \u2014 it is up to an hour ride in an open air cable car (seating only for four guests at a time and a naturalist) where you soar over the tree canopy. You hear nothing but the wind and bird calls and the distant crash of waterfalls 500 feet below you. The butterflies are like confetti.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"Temperatures are pretty consistent throughout the year, but the main difference is rainy vs. dry season. Be prepared and either way, hiking in the cloud and rain forest will always be an adventure.\"\n\nAverage flight price: $588 to Quito, Ecuador\n\nHamburg, Germany\n\nInigo Cia | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Kareem George, CEO of Culture Traveler\n\nWhy to visit: \"This ultra chic city is beautiful, sophisticated and extremely fun, with a variety of attractions for diverse ages and interests. The setting of the city is quite picturesque, nestled between the Elbe River and Alster Lake with many canals in between. It is an extremely walkable city with many historic attractions in the city center \u2014 such as the Rathaus (City Hall) and St. Nikolai Church \u2014 flanked by very cool neighborhoods such as the Speicherstadt (Warehouse) District, raucous St. Pauli and the quirky Schanzenviertel.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"Two of the many must-see attractions are the iconic Elbphilharmonie and the unique Miniatur Wunderland. Advance tickets are highly recommended for both.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"Hamburg is truly a destination for all seasons, however I particularly enjoyed a recent visit in the fall. The weather was perfect and it was wonderful to stroll along the lake, canals and to explore several neighborhoods on foot.\"\n\nAverage flight price: $1,090\n\nKyushu, Japan\n\nBohistock | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Kristin Braswell, founder of CrushGlobal Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"Brimming with natural beauty at every corner, the southern island of Japan's Kyushu may be overlooked for its popular northern neighbors like Tokyo and Kyoto, but it's just as thrilling. Teeming with active volcanoes, palm-forested coastlines and bubbling onsens [hot springs] to retreat in, you will be enamored at every turn by the great, wide outdoors here. I highly recommend visiting the electric metropolis, Fukuoka, and Beppu, a mountainside jewel that is home to the most spring waters in the country.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"Visiting the famous onsens, particularly the Jigoku Circuit, which are all grouped and within walking distance. They are a sight to see.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"In spring, during cherry-blossom season and when the weather is pleasantly warm, or the fall, as the foliage begins to change with the seasons.\"\n\nAverage flight price: Top three airports in Kyushu, by popularity from U.S. cities based on search demand:\n\nFukuoka: $1,326\n\nNagasaki: $1,617\n\nKumamoto: $1,594\n\nLen\u00e7\u00f3is Maranhenses National Park, Brazil\n\nIgnacio Palacios | Stone | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: John Lansdell, planner at Trufflepig Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"Remote and staggeringly beautiful, this park of sand dunes, mangroves and freshwater lagoons is prime for both relaxing in and exploring \u2014 swimming, dune walks and quad tours, birding, etc.\"\n\nCan't-miss: Swimming in the lagoons.\n\nBest time to go: \"When to visit is subjective, but high season is July and August: Full lagoons; warm, not too hot; rains have passed, but the gateway towns are busy. Either side of these months may be the best bet, although the park itself, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is vast and won't feel overly busy in high season.\"\n\nAverage flight price: $1,069 to Sao Luis, Brazil\n\nThe Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway)\n\nLeonardo Patrizi | E+ | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Melissa Wu, founder of Woodlyn Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"The Nordics offer a great variety of destinations and activities, from the bustling nightlife and modern hotels of the cities, to rural pastimes like dog sledding and gazing up at the amazing northern lights. Classic Nordic activities like saunas and cold plunges share the stage with farm-to-table culinary extravaganzas.

The ABBA museum is a must-see for music lovers, while the Viking Museum and Vasa Museum, which houses a salvaged 17th century ship, pay tribute to Sweden's history. And no visit would be complete without a stop at the Spiritmuseum, which celebrates Sweden's drinking culture.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"The Nordics offer something unique no matter what time of year you visit. Long summer days give way to amazing fall foliage, followed by Christmas markets and ice hotels during the wintertime, and lovely island-hopping adventures in spring. Stockholm's cherry-blossom trees bloom in mid- to late-April, with a gorgeous display that rivals more well-known (and crowded) spots like Washington, D.C. and Kyoto.\"\n\nAverage flight price:\n\nCopenhagen: $769\n\nHelsinki: $890\n\nOslo: $826\n\nStockholm: $801\n\nThe Philippines\n\nTravelstoxphoto | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Tesa Totengco, founder and CEO of Travels with Tesa\n\nWhy to visit: \"Although it is very much a part of Southeast Asia, the Philippines is off to the side from the rest of its neighbors. I suggest devoting your entire trip to the country and island-hopping.\n\n\"It has some of the most beautiful white powdery sand beaches (Palawan, Boracay, Bohol). There is a thriving contemporary art scene (Art Fair in Manila, held in February), and galleries supporting local artists (Silverlens, Artinformal, Gravity Art Space, Orange Project). In the capital, you can tour Old Manila and learn of the past from the 16th century Spanish colonialization right up to the American War liberating the country from Japanese occupation. There are pop-up shops throughout the year that celebrate Filipino design, and celebrated chefs with their own restaurants celebrating Filipino cuisine. It's a predominantly English-speaking country, so the traveler will never feel lost.\"\n\nCan't-miss: \"This country is made up of over 7,000 islands, each unique in culture, history and flavor. It's best to make a 'halo-halo' (meaning 'mixed') experience: Not just beach, for which the country is most famous.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"It's a tropical country, so the Philippines is hot and humid year round. Avoid the rainy season from June to October and come from December to February when the country is at its coolest.\"\n\nAverage flight price:\n\nManila: $1,296\n\nCebu City: $1,446\n\nAngeles City: $1,461\n\nTunisia\n\nMax Shen | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Sofia Markovich, owner of Sofia's Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"Tunisia is home to some of the world's most well-preserved Roman ruins, including the iconic El Jem Amphitheatre, a UNESCO World Heritage site that rivals Rome's Colosseum in grandeur. Carthage, once a powerful city-state, showcases the remnants of an ancient civilization that shaped Mediterranean history.\n\n\"From the rolling dunes of the Sahara Desert to the pristine beaches of Hammamet, Sussa and Djerba, the country offers a variety of settings for adventure and relaxation. Matmata's troglodyte homes, famously featured in Star Wars films, add a touch of cinematic wonder to the experience.\"\n\n\"Tunisia's cuisine is a highlight that captivates food lovers. With its bold flavors and Mediterranean influences, dishes like brik (a savory pastry), couscous and harissa-infused stews offer an authentic taste of the region. The country's burgeoning wine industry adds to its allure.\"\n\nWestend61 | Westend61 | Getty Images\n\nCan't-miss: \"Sidi Bou Said, with its white-washed houses and blue doors; and Carthage.\"\n\nBest time to go: \"Tunisia is great to visit year-round\":\n\nSpring (March-May): \"Warm, ideal for exploring ruins and nature.\"\n\nSummer (June-August): \"Hot, perfect for beaches but avoid inland heat.\"\n\nAutumn (September-November): \"Mild, great for both beaches and culture.\"\n\nWinter (December-February): \"Cool, best for the Sahara and fewer crowds.\"\n\nAverage flight price: $1,360 to Tunis\n\nUzbekistan\n\nIzzet Keribar | Stone | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Jonathan Alder, CEO of Jonathan's Travels\n\nWhy to visit: \"This incredible melting pot of cultures is one of the most stunning destinations in the world, with architecture, history and nature that would surprise even the most experienced traveler.\n\n\"Its cuisine \u2014 a melting pot of Persian, Indian, Italian, and Chinese with hints of Russian \u2014 is a foodie's dream. Once the heart of the Silk Road, the architecture doesn't look like anything else you've ever seen. I love to start in the capital of Tashkent, which is a modern metropolis, then head to the ancient side of the country at the far end of the desert to step back in time. The mosque of Samarkand is one of the most incredible architectural highlights you'll see in your life.\n\n\"Getting out of the cities, you can head into the mountains, which are essentially the back of the Himalayas, for incredible nature and green valleys outside of the stark, dramatic desert that you get for most of the rest of the country.\"\n\nMlenny | E+ | Getty Images\n\nCan't-miss: \"Samarkand. This was once the capital of the Silk Road, the crossing point for all trade routes between Europe and Asia. The sites here are the biggest in the country and some of the top highlights.\"\n\nWhen to go: \"Spring and fall. The summers are quite hot and the winters get very cold. You can also make this a ski destination in the winter and combine it with the rest of the country.\"\n\nAverage flight price:\n\nTashkent: $1,470\n\nSamarkand: $2,226\n\nWestern Australia\n\nLuke Mackenzie | Moment | Getty Images\n\nRecommended by: Kemi Wells-Conrad, founder and president of Wells Luxury Travel\n\nWhy to visit: \"Everyone typically thinks of Sydney and the East Coast of Australia \u2014 and don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful coastline. But I have always been a huge fan of Western Australia. It is incredibly diverse, and the landscapes are truly magnificent.\n\n\"Perth is your starting point and known as one of the most isolated cities in the world. There is world-class wine further south in Margaret River. The coast is filled with some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, such as Monkey Mia and Ningaloo Reef, which also are teeming with amazing marine life. The Kimberleys are wild, rugged and unique.\"\n\nMichael Runkel | Imagebroker | Getty Images\n\nCan't-miss: \"Ningaloo Reef. Forget the crowds of the Great Barrier Reef out of Cairns \u2014 imagine a pristine reef with no crowds. You can also swim with whale sharks here March to August. The luxury glamping experience at Sal Salis is a unique experience.\"\n\nWhen to go: \"April to September. This is the sweet spot, their 'winter.' The temperatures are mild, however still much warmer than our northern hemisphere winter. And it would allow you to travel further north to the Kimberleys \u2014 outside of their wet season and before it heats up again from October on.\"\n\nAverage flight price:"

So, I kicked like a wee black tray off the top of it and then that\u2019s when I seen, like a foot.\n\n\u201cAnd then when I looked in further, you could see the back of the skull up the other end.\n\n\u201cIt was when I noticed, like, the mummified skin on the back of the neck.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter realising that he had found a body, he called the police.\n\nBarnes was apprehended for the crime and given a life sentence with a minimum term of 23 years at the High Court in Edinburgh.\n\nDuring the trial, the court heard how Barnes withdrew the victim's money from his bank, and used it to buy \u2018goods and services\u2019.\n\nHe also lied to neighbours and friends that Coutts was alive, and devastatingly, he later pretended to be Coutts when contacting his family on the day of his daughter's wedding.\n\nBarnes stood trial on a total of 36 charges, including theft and fraud, but those charges were dropped and he was instead convicted of murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.\n\nWhen he was being sentenced Lord Mulholland told Barnes: \"You thought you would get away with these appalling crimes.\n\n\"You lied about Ean Coutts' whereabouts, pretending he was on an extended holiday in Morocco or with his sister in England.\n\n\"You even contacted his family on his daughter's wedding day pretending to be him and looking for money.\n\n\"It was an act of deception and arrogance.\n\n\"The finding of the body by the urban explorer resulted in the unravelling of your lies exposing your crimes and, you, as a murderer.\"\n\nYou can watch Murder Trial: Body in the Warehouse on BBC iPlayer now."

The same can be said even at the microscopic level of a \u201cnanoflower,\u201d compound combinations in chemistry that grow to form plantlike shapes. With this in mind, a research team based at Italy\u2019s University of Genoa have designed a novel nanostructure that relies on carnation-like nanoflowers containing enough surface area to host numerous wound-healing drug molecules.\n\nThe medical innovation is detailed in a study published in the journal ACS Applied Bio Materials. According to its creators, the bandage prototype uses two polyphenol-based materials\u2013copper phosphate and tannic acid. These reagents possess well-documented anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Once mixed and placed in a saline solution, the copper phosphate-tannic acid compounds begin to self-assemble and grow into recognizable, flower-like structures. From there, researchers then carefully attached these nanoflowers on small strips of electrospun nanofabric.\n\n\u201cPolyphenols, natural compounds abundant in phenolic structures, have received widespread attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer properties, making them valuable for biomedical applications,\u201d the team wrote in their study. \u201cHowever, the green synthesis of polyphenol-based materials with economical and environmentally friendly strategies is of great significance.\u201d\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to an accompanying announcement on January 31st, the nanoflower-covered fabrics not only \u201cinactivated\u201d the bacteria, but did so through the addition of antibiotic-resistant biofilms\u2014all while protecting lab-grown human cells.\n\nResearchers say their new, nanoflower based approach appears to be both cost-effective and extremely efficient, allowing for better means to speed up wound healing and fight infections. The possible benefits from nanoflowers aren\u2019t limited to medicine, either. Another study, published in October 2024 in Advanced Materials, points to uses across real-time imaging, wastewater purification, and even microrobotics."

            "article_content": "In a networked society, secure communication is essential. Quantum physics delivers the necessary foundation by allowing practicable technologies such as quantum key distribution. With the new fiber optic test facility at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), which opened on January 22, 2025, researchers aim to transmit, test and refine quantum keys. They also plan to set up a quantum network to link quantum computers.\n\n\n\nTo generate and transmit the quantum keys, the researchers will use cutting-edge technologies such as ultra-coherent lasers with the new fiber optic test facility. Quantum keys are crucial for secure communication because they are based on physical laws instead of the mathematical assumptions underlying earlier encryption keys, which future quantum computers will be able to break.\n\n\n\nSpanning 20 kilometers, the quantum-optical transmission line connects laboratories specially equipped with complex lasers and cryostats on KIT\u2019s Campus South and Campus North. The light-guiding core of a fiber optic cable is only about 9 micrometers in diameter. For comparison, the thickness of a human hair is about 60 micrometers.\n\n\n\nImportant Quantum Research Platform\n\n\u201cQuantum communication is a strategically important field for KIT, so I\u2019m especially pleased that with the finished test facility, KIT is providing its researchers with important infrastructure for investigating the opportunities offered by quantum physics,\u201d said Oliver Kraft, Vice President for Research at KIT. \u201cWith this facility, we\u2019re making an important contribution to the advancement of research and development in quantum network technology, with an eye to practical applications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the fiber-optic test facility, we have a platform for improving quantum key distribution, investigating its basic properties, and integrating it in classical communication,\u201d said Professor David Hunger of the Physikalisches Institut at KIT, who heads the project. Based on this work, the scientists aim to develop new transmission protocols for the keys. \u201cWith the new methods we develop, we want to make quantum cryptography more efficient and practical. We\u2019re working on this e.g. with KEEQuant, a quantum communication start-up,\u201d added Hunger. \u201cFurthermore, using novel materials such as molecular quantum emitters, we want to generate ultrapure quantum light \u2013 individual photons \u2013 to increase transmission rates.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuilding a Quantum Network\n\nThe researchers will also be progressively building a quantum network to investigate the quantum internet of the future. Their work focuses on two crucial steps: storing quantum information in special quantum memories, and quantum entanglement of the memories. This will make it possible to implement quantum repeaters for the transmission of quantum information over long distances. Since entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum computers, such computers can be connected with one another in a quantum internet via optical transmission of the entanglement.\n\n\n\nTest Facility Part of Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence Initiative\n\nThe project is a key part of the infrastructure for the Chem4Quant Cluster of Excellence initiative, in which researchers from KIT, Ulm University and the University of Stuttgart will design materials for future quantum technologies and focus on molecular quantum systems, a new field of quantum technology. In addition, the project plays an important role in the quantum repeater research conducted in the Quantenrepeater.Net (QR.N) joint project of Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and in the QuantumBW Innovation Campus.\n\n\n\nMore information\n\nDetailed caption: Opening of the fiber optic test facility at KIT: (from left to right) Prof. Sebastian Randel (KIT), Prof. Marc Weber (Head of Division B V, KIT), Prof. Oliver Kraft (Vice President Research, KIT), Prof. Mario Ruben (KIT), Prof. David Hunger (KIT) (Photo: Daryoush Djavadi)\n\n\n\nBeing \u201cThe Research University in the Helmholtz Association\u201d, KIT creates and imparts knowledge for the society and the environment. It is the objective to make significant contributions to the global challenges in the fields of energy, mobility, and information. For this, about 10,000 employees cooperate in a broad range of disciplines in natural sciences, engineering sciences, economics, and the humanities and social sciences. KIT prepares its 22,800 students for responsible tasks in society, industry, and science by offering research-based study programs.

            "article_content": "By Conor Lennon\n\nTHE widespread awareness and growing availability of low-cost tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI) is putting them on the radar of African governments and entrepreneurs keen to develop home-grown digital solutions to improving education.\n\nThe emergence of cheap or free AI tools is being eagerly embraced by those with smartphones and the ability to get online. As governments and legislators struggle to get their heads around the implications of this powerful technology and work out how to bring in regulations for its safe use, millions of people are enjoying its ability to save time, helping them to transform raw data into essays, exam answers, or, with a bit more work, even videos and podcasts.\n\nEven in developing countries where electricity and internet access is limited (it\u2019s estimated that over 570 million people in Africa lack electricity), there is enthusiasm for the potential of AI. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), for example, a nation riven by internal conflict, poverty and vast inequality, educators are seeing the impact of AI.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that our country is lagging behind in terms of new technologies for one reason or another,\u201d says Benjamin Sivanzire, a teacher in Beni, North Kivu Province. \u201cMany parts of the DRC do not even have traditional methods of communication, or even radio or television.\u201d\n\nHowever, even though Mr. Sivanzire and his students are not yet able to make use of AI in their classes, they are seeing it being used in the wider culture, often in a negative way, to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe teacher underlines the importance of educating people to distinguish between verifiable information and lies. \u201cThere are videos created by artificial intelligence that show images that are not real and have been created for propaganda purposes,\u201d he explains.\n\nBURSTING THE SILICON VALLEY BUBBLE\n\nOne concern that is frequently raised is the extent to which the development of AI tools is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small group of people.\n\nFarida Shahid, the independent Special Rapporteur on the right to education, shares these concerns.\n\n\u201cAI algorithms are being made by individuals who often sit in a particular location, such as Silicon Valley, where the people who make and test them have their own biases,\u201d she says. \u201cOften the algorithms don\u2019t do well at recognizing people with dark skin. They also have great problems with people who are autistic and don\u2019t like looking into cameras.\n\n\u201cAnother example is the UK where, recently, an AI programme was used to grade exam papers. This led to decisions that were biased against people from certain ethnic backgrounds. We really need to look at this issue more closely, starting with the human rights perspective, and I think that\u2019s where the U.N. role comes in: if you increasingly rely on AI as the source of verification, you\u2019re going to have problems because you are using a framework which privileges white males, and doesn\u2019t reflect the whole gamut of people\u2019s lives and experiences\u201d.\n\nThe urgent need to expand the developer talent base has been identified by the UN as central to ensuring that a wide variety of voices are heard in the \u201cEdTech\u201d (educational technology) space.\n\nShafika Isaacs, the head of technology and AI at the UN agency for science, technology and education (UNESCO), says that the number of African EdTech startups has been mushrooming in recent years, with entrepreneurs experimenting with the AI-enabled digital tools which could support learning and teaching across many different contexts, including in African languages, and local dialects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve personally engaged with a startup that matches high school students to career pathways, including choosing the right university, community college or even entrepreneurship programme. They have seen strong results because of their focus on children in underprivileged contexts and schools. Tech startups have also looked at developing AI-enabled mobile apps, including chat bots, that can support teachers in teaching literacy or teaching mathematics.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that there\u2019s often a disconnect between the public education system and tech startups We need educators to be proactive in engaging with those developing tools, and we encourage students and teachers to learn how to create and design technologies that are relevant to their linguistic and cultural contexts.\u201d\n\nMany African governments are keen to adopt national AI strategies and integrate AI into their national policies on technologies in education. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, where AI is already being widely used in the private sector. Mariatou Kon\u00e9, the Minister of Education, says that the country\u2019s education system is undergoing a transformation, following a 2022 review which recommended a digitalisation strategy.\n\n\u201cWe have put in place initiatives to ensure that everyone is aware of the issue of AI. It can provide individual learning programmes, and help struggling students to improve,\u201d said Ms. Kon\u00e9. \u201cHowever, we are worried about potential abuses. We have to be able to protect personal data and ensure that learners are aware of the potential dangers.\u201d\n\nThe minister agrees that, in order to guard against bias, the pool of engineers building AI tools needs to be expanded. \u201cWe need the right tools, adapted to the African context, to the Ivorian context. We have our own history, our own heritage. If we create our own industry, it has to be adapted to the realities of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\u201d (UN)"
