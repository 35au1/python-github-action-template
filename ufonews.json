I think,\u201d he says, grinning, checking his pulse theatrically. \u201cHold on a minute\u2026 Who paid for the last round? No\u2026 I got lucky really.\u201d\n\nClassic Rock is catching up with Mogg in Brighton, where the veteran singer now lives, to discuss the apparent dissolution of his much-loved band UFO, as well as the latest repackaging of the band\u2019s sixth album, Lights Out. He also sheds light on the birth of a new solo project called Moggs Motel.\n\nIt\u2019s mid-January, and we are among the first customers to walk through the door of a pub near the railway station. For some unexplained reason we drink halves instead of pints, forgetting that doing that usually hastens consumption. Gradually the pub\u2019s early drinkers arrive. Those are gradually replaced by the lunchtime crowd. By the time we leave, following multiple exclamations of \u201cJust one more?\u201d, darkness is approaching.\n\nOn that August 2022 evening, Mogg, now 76 years old, was at home with his wife Emma, a former glamour model, when he started to feel unwell.\n\n\u201cI thought it was indigestion or heartburn. But it was quite a bit more than reflux. Emma was watching a comedy show, with a glass of wine, and I was going [mimes choking],\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s laughing at the TV, and I\u2019m realising it\u2019s serious \u2013 \u2018Hang on, I could be dying here.\u2019 So I popped to the hospital down the road.\u201d\n\nThe eventual outcome was that Mogg had two stents implanted into his coronary arteries, and doctors advised him to rest. That caused the cancellation of the final run of dates of UFO\u2019s farewell tour, Last Orders, which was scheduled to finish in Athens. \u201cIt was all a bit of a shock,\u201d he admits.\n\nResponding to the suggestion that Mogg looks after himself better these days \u2013 certainly compared with the levels of UFO\u2019s Bacchanalian heyday \u2013 he simply chuckles darkly. Doesn\u2019t he go to the gym?\n\n\u201cNot any more. I use gardening as the gym. You can do as much or as little as you want.\u201d\n\nUFO in 1974 - group portrait\n\nThe enforced cancellation of the final run of Last Orders shows suggested the end of the long road UFO had travelled for more than 50 years, and our meeting in Brighton comes a few days after the announcement of an online auction for the equipment used by the band on their US tours.\n\n\u201cBasically, all of that stuff is in storage. We may as well flog it,\u201d Mogg says.\n\nIt seems awfully final.\n\n\u201cWell, the situation was frustrating,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you commit to doing something, you should finish it, but it just wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d\n\nSo UFO are over, definitely, for good?\n\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no going back?\n\n\u201cNo. That really cool tour we did in the UK was it. For us to suddenly reappear again, the fans would say: \u2018Oi! I paid to see you on that last tour.\u2019 Some might think that a great thing. Me, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s topsy-turvy career is a tale worthy of an entire issue of Classic Rock. The line-up changes, mid-tour departures, fist fights between band members, reunions, and now belatedly blighted by funerals, often marinated in strong booze and heightened by Class-A drugs. Its plot twists would merit a soap opera were they not so implausible.\n\nRegularly in cahoots with co-founding bass player Pete Way (RIP), as the group\u2019s singular strand of consistency Londoner Mogg was right there at the heart of it all. He\u2019s been a singer, lyricist, ringleader, villain (during the 70s he punched the band\u2019s talismanic guitarist Michael Schenker, causing him to quit), bandleader (for the 1985 album Misdemeanor, Mogg rebuilt UFO from scratch), and clown (he fell off stage on at least one occasion). But now, after 56 years of all that and much more, the time has come for Phil Mogg to do something else.\n\npage divider\n\nBefore we get into that, there\u2019s the not-so-trifling matter of the new 2024 reboot of Lights Out, remastered and with the added bonus of a fabulous archive show from London\u2019s Roundhouse in 1977. Mogg is well aware of EMI\u2019s efforts to overhaul the band\u2019s catalogue.\n\n\u201cThose reissues are impressive, aren\u2019t they? It makes me think why we didn\u2019t do that [employ such a level of care] back in the day.\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cNo, I\u2019m joking. They\u2019re very nice.\u201d\n\nLike many artists, Mogg has a complicated view of the industry\u2019s quest to re-sell to the public records that they already own.\n\n\u201cThe labels are always looking for something new, and I find myself wondering who\u2019s going to buy it,\u201d he muses. \u201cIf these things come out again on vinyl, that\u2019s a selling point for me. From that perspective it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAs a curious aside, Mogg confides that he recently bought a copy of UFO\u2019s quintessential 1979 double live album Strangers In The Night from a second-hand record shop adjacent to the pub in which we sit. \u201cI didn\u2019t own an original version, so I bought one. Just to put it on the shelf, I guess, along with everything else. Everything goes into a cupboard or on to a shelf.\u201d\n\nAs the swan song of UFO\u2019s herculean first era with Schenker on guitar, Strangers still stands up as a brilliant record. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mogg says fondly, nodding. \u201cBut I tend to remember the funny bits [more than the music]. With Lights Out, making that album was a barrelful of laughs. It was a good, fun time, everybody was enjoying themselves and stuff.\u201d\n\nIncluding the supposedly \u2018difficult\u2019 Michael Schenker?\n\n\u201cYeah. He had his moments. You had to look out for them. No\u2026 I\u2019m kidding. Michael was fine.\u201d\n\nFor UFO, Lights Out and its follow-up Obsession were the best of times. With Schenker on board, having joined from the Scorpions in 1973, the band had toured heavily for Force It and No Heavy Pettin\u2019, released in 1975 and \u201976 respectively.\n\n\u201cWe also knew that either Lights Out was going to do something big for us, or it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cNo disrespect to Leo [Lyons, the former Ten Years After bass player who produced those two records], but we had to jump from where we were to somewhere else. That\u2019s when some investigation began \u2013 which producer had made the albums that we liked best. And Ron Nevison\u2019s name kept coming up.\u201d\n\nUFO onstage\n\nWith Nevison signed up as producer, UFO and their new keyboard player/second guitarist Paul Raymond set up in Air Studios at London\u2019s Oxford Circus. Having worked with The Who and Led Zeppelin, Nevison was a hard taskmaster. A real man\u2019s man. And he liked to let his charges know who was boss.\n\n\u201cOnly if you took any notice of him,\u201d Mogg says. \u201cI\u2019m sure that to most people Ron could be quite intimidating, but we had this way of subtly\u2026 sort of not letting him do that. He was right and he was the producer, but he had a knack of putting things that might rub people up the wrong way. Fortunately we all became pals. Ron made the band sound amazing. He gave us that extra push.\"\n\nLights Out was packaged in an eye-catching sleeve, shot in the bowels of London\u2019s Battersea Power Station and created by the immensely popular and acclaimed design team Hipgnosis.\n\n\u201cWho knows what was going on there,\u201d Mogg ponders, with a wave of his hand. \u201cThe idea came from them, Storm [Thorgerson] and Po [Powell]. I\u2019m not sure if they had taken a load of pictures of inside Battersea when they worked with Pink Floyd. You know, Battersea Power Station\u2026 lights\u2026 that was the connection. We lucked out working with them.\u201d\n\nLights Out became and remains UFO\u2019s highest-charting album in the USA, but Mogg rejects the suggestion that the band felt tantalisingly close to becoming The Next Big Thing.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t buy into such preconceived ideas,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe were still too busy telling ourselves: \u2018All of this is a bit good, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d\n\nRetaining Nevison, UFO went to California to make Obsession, where their great adventure continued, residing in hired luxury pads and driving rented cars.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own them,\u201d Mogg says, smiling, \u201cand years later you discover that you still owe money on them. It\u2019s a funny old world. But yeah, we enjoyed the experience to the maximum. We certainly paid for it to the maximum.\u201d\n\nHe chuckles when he recalls the group\u2019s respective choices of mode of transport.\n\n\u201cI went for the Trans Am with the eagle on the front \u2013 I took that off, I couldn\u2019t stand it. Michael got a Chevvy Stringray, and Pete went for the Camaro. Paul took over [Chrysalis labelmate] Robin Trower\u2019s Cadillac. For some reason Andy [Parker, drums] picked a Honda Civic. That still makes me laugh.\u201d On one notable occasion the band raced through Coldwater Canyon, although Mogg claims they \u201cremained just within the speed limit\u201d.\n\nPete Way and Phil Mogg (holding a tabloid newspaper)\n\nFrom the outside it looked as though UFO were English (and German) rock stars living the Californian dream.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d says Mogg. \u201cWe were working in LA, but it really didn\u2019t feel romantic in the sense you are implying.\u201d\n\nAll the same, by that point UFO had put in more than a decade of hard work and knew they were making great records. \u201cThe thought never occurred to us,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, it wasn\u2019t like that. That\u2019s not the kind of people we are. You\u2019d be somewhere on the road in America, a bit knackered from partying and in one of the most awful places, and before going on stage Pete would gather us together and in very serious tones tell us: \u2018Right, we\u2019re about to take out Poughkeepsie.\u2019 It was absurd, but that was our general attitude.\u201d\n\nThere was also an awareness that it could all come tumbling down at any given moment.\n\n\u201cAs much as we were enjoying it to the max, nobody expected things to last,\u201d Mogg affirms. \u201cThere was a bit of friction with Michael, because Way and I were just juveniles. And of course, Parker was the sensible one.\u201d\n\nWere those times the best of his life?\n\n\u201cYeah, probably. It was pretty knockout.\u201d\n\nFollowing the departure of Michael Schenker at the end of the 70s, UFO invited former Lone Star guitarist Paul Chapman back for a second run with the band. The Welshman had played with UFO from 1974-75 as part of a twin-guitar line-up alongside Schenker. With Chapman, nicknamed \u2018Tonka\u2019 for his indestructible qualities, UFO thrived, although a softening of their sound caused Way to quit following 1982\u2019s Mechanix. The rest of the decade presented tough times and mixed results, and a number of line-up changes.\n\nIn 1991, Mogg and Way put the band back together without Schenker, although along with Raymond and Parker he rejoined for Walk On Water, an excellent album, again produced by Nevison, from a frustratingly short-lived reunion.\n\nSchenker rejoined again at the turn of the millennium. But following his shamefully inebriated performance at Manchester Apollo, UFO\u2019s fortunes plummeted to an all-time low. Still, Schenker\u2019s replacement, American guitar hero Vinnie Moore, remained a part of UFO until the very end, and from 2004\u2019s You Are Here onwards they made a string of very creditable records. Sixteen years ago, Way\u2019s own well-publicised issues with addiction gave the band no option but to \u2018let him go\u2019. He never returned to the line-up. To Mogg\u2019s great sadness, Way died in 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that, robbed of the bonhomie of his long-time partner in crime, life within UFO was never the same again for the singer. He enjoyed the 100 minutes or so performing on stage each night, but the travelling wore him down. As a man of advancing age, the more undignified elements of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll circus became magnified.\n\nWith bandmates past and present now passing on, Mogg became conscious of his own mortality. In 2018, during the build-up to UFO\u2019s 50th anniversary, he announced his retirement from the road upon completion of a tour that, inevitably, became significantly extended. \u201cThis is the right time for me to quit,\u201d he said back then.\n\nMoggs Motel group portrait\n\nMogg had ventured outside of UFO for two albums with Way under the handle Mogg/Way, and even undertook a short tour for an extremely fine 2002 project named $ign Of 4. With that in mind, the end of UFO wouldn\u2019t necessarily spell the end of his career as a musician. A fresh period of activity began when Mogg bumped into Tony Newton, the bassist with Voodoo Six, and now a member of KK\u2019s Priest.\n\n\u201cWe [UFO] had toured with Voodoo Six so we got chatting,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cI told him I was looking to do something, and he replied \u2013 this is great: \u2018Well I\u2019ve got a couple of riffs.\u2019 So we got together to see what transpired. And then Steve [Harris, Iron Maiden bassist] lent us his studio.\u201d\n\nOver the following year, and partly during lockdown, the project took shape. Just like the album, the band are called Moggs Motel (no apostrophe). \u201cMotels don\u2019t have apostrophes,\u201d he insists. \u201cNot the ones I stay in, anyway.\u201d\n\nBesides him and Newton, who also co-wrote and produced the album, the line-up includes Neil Carter, UFO\u2019s second guitarist, keyboard player and occasional saxophonist, who returned to the group unexpectedly following Paul Raymond\u2019s death in 2019, plus second guitarist Tommy Gentry (Gun, The Raven Age) and former Voodoo Six drummer Joe Lazarus.\n\nInserting Moggs Motel into a one-size-fits-all category isn\u2019t easy. On the day that we meet in Brighton, Mogg doesn\u2019t even try.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played the album to a couple of people I know,\u201d he confides, before listing several of them, including his daughter and \u201cmy mate who lives around the corner\u201d who considered it \u201clovely\u201d. Ultimately, he shrugs: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s rock music?\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of symphonic rock. No. Actually, I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\nHe whips out his mobile phone and plays a couple of tracks. Sunny Side Of Heaven features Alabama 3 singer Zoe Devlin Love, while the instrumental Harry\u2019s Place is a flute-driven nod to the Dirty Harry soundtrack. Mogg hopes to play a one-off showcase-style gig for the album in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being discussed, it\u2019s just a case of finding the right venue,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve even got a new hat.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is a great name for a band. Some guests check in and some leave. Other, less savoury, characters are barred.\n\n\u201cMy motel has speciality suites,\u201d he remarks proudly. \u201cThe Frank Sinatra Suite has been left reserved. I\u2019ve given Kate [UFO\u2019s long-suffering merchandise and web lady] the Sammy Davis Jr. Suite. There are also the Dean Martin and Lauren Bacall Suites. I\u2019m thinking about a Charles Bukowski Suite. You can have that one, because it\u2019s for writers.\u201d\n\nThanks. On that note, another half?\n\n\u201cYeah, why not.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2019, with no British dates on the cards for the line-up featuring Neil Carter, Mogg invited me to attend a couple of UFO shows on the continent. Travelling on the bus, he often sat up front in the dark, watching quietly as the miles were eaten up.\n\n\u201cI call it, white-line fever,\u201d he says. \u201cI love midnight driving, just the driver and you. I like to play Tangerine Dream, Love On A Real Train. Try it, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWill all of that be hard to relinquish?\n\n\u201cNot really. I said that when I stopped having fun I wouldn\u2019t do it any more. I hadn\u2019t reached that point, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain this\u2026 Well I do, but I\u2019m not going to. UFO was wound down at the right time. I\u2019d had a birthday, the band had had a good run, it was time to go: \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019 Plus I fancied doing something else anyway.\u201d\n\nAll the same, the other members of UFO, especially Andy Parker, felt that there was still mileage in the UFO name. Could the band still make records, without touring?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he fires back instantly. \u201cAnd there are deep rooted reasons. But\u2026 definitely not.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s career has been fascinating in so many ways. If Mogg could go back and change some of the many \u2018banana-skin\u2019 moments\u2019, would he do so, and what would they be?\n\n\u201cWhen all those glamour models were banging at my door, I should have opened it and let them all in,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cBut I was strong, I said no.\u201d\n\nIs there a serious answer for that question?\n\n\u201cNo. Some things get screwed up and others are great. That\u2019s life. But I do wish we\u2019d got a fair crack of the whip.\u201d\n\nBusiness-wise, you mean?\n\n\u201cIn our youth we were gung-ho, living in the moment. If only someone had looked after us. But those people are hard to find. As far as UFO goes, we got pretty screwed.\u201d\n\nUFO have been hailed an as influence by Metallica, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains, but Mogg states: \u201cI take all of that stuff with a pinch of salt. Steve [Harris], for instance, says nice things about us. [Pearl Jam guitarist] Mike McCready wrote a charming note after we covered [McCready\u2019s 90s project] Mad Season\u2019s River Of Deceit. You half-believe it, don\u2019t you? But I always mistrust someone that says: \u2018You\u2019re fucking great\u2019.\u201d\n\nFormer band members and associates, including ex-manager John Knowles and popular tour manager Tonio Neuhaus, are no longer with us, but they are never far from Mogg\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a question to ask Pete, and then I realise he\u2019s not there to answer any more,\u201d he sighs.\n\nDuring the later years, you and Pete remained extremely close.\n\n\u201cWe had some fucking great times. I mean ridiculous times,\u201d Mogg reminisces. \u201cThose two [Way and Chapman] always made me laugh. [Mogg launches into a scarily good impression of Way]: \u201cHere, John, is there any more money left in the float?\u201d [Then just as accurately as Chapman]: \u2018Eh, I tell you what, let\u2019s get drunk like we used to.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith impeccable comic timing, Mogg says: \u201cThat bastard [Way] still owes me twenty quid.\u201d\n\nSo, if UFO are over and done, how would Mogg like his band to be remembered? \u201cI\u2019m happy that we achieved what we set out to do, and I hope people think of us in the way I remember The Animals, who I saw as a kid and it gave me goosebumps,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI know we did some dodgy gigs when we overindulged, but the good ones really took off. So if we gave some people goosebumps, for me that would be sufficient.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is available now via SPV."

        "article_content": "Billionaire Elon Musk has endorsed the theory that UFOs are a 'new weapons program' hidden within the US government's vast black budget.\n\nThe tech mogul recently told Tucker Carlson that he believes 'we are the aliens' because he has never seen extraterrestrial life in his time running SpaceX.\n\n'Unidentified flying objects' are one thing,' the tech mogul said in the interview, 'but there's always a bunch of classified programs that are underway: new aircraft, new missiles and things.'\n\nHis statements echoed that of the Pentagon, itself \u2014 which reported that a spike in UFO sightings from the 1950s and 60s had been caused by tests of advanced US spy planes and space technology.\n\nBut Musk promised to be the first person to expose extraterrestrial life, vowing to post any evidence he uncovers on his social media site X the moment he finds it.\n\nElon Musk told pundit Tucker Carlson that 'Unidentified flying objects' are one thing, but there's always a bunch of classified programs that are underway: new aircraft, new missiles and things.' He opined that UFOs are likely not aliens but a top secret 'new weapons program'\n\n'I would guarantee that the split-second I see any evidence of aliens, I will immediately post that on the X platform,' Musk told Carlson on the pundits new show, hosted on the social media site X.\n\n'It will probably be our number one post of all time,' the billionaire added.\n\nMusk believes the UFOs seen in the skies are classified military vehicles.\n\n'Where are the aliens? Why don't I see them,' Musk said to Tucker.\n\n'A lot of people think we see aliens, but I have not seen any evidence.'\n\nHe continued to explain that SpaceX has more than 6,000 Starlink satellites in orbit and 'not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.'\n\nMany skeptical commentators have long maintained that UFOs could be classified US military test planes or other next-generation craft like the the Silent Ventus drone.\n\nThe drone made by Florida-based start-up Undefined Technologies, which generates thrust by ionizing the air with custom-made electrodes.\n\nSpaceX has also been rumored to be building a network of hundreds of spy satellites under a classified contract with a US intelligence agency, which could have been the secret weapons Musk was referring to.\n\nBut the comments from the on-again, off-again contender for the world's richest man elicited mixed reactions online, including reporters responsible for bringing to light some of America's most credentialed and high-profile UFO whistleblowers.\n\n'So Elon is saying the USG has tech that can go from space to the surface of the ocean in seconds while also making sharp angle turns with no visible means of propulsion or wings and instantly disappear in front of pilots' eyes,' an X user shared.\n\n'Why is he wasting money on #SpaceX then?'\n\nA UAP researcher said Musk sounded almost 'exactly like Mick West' during the interview.\n\n'It's making sense. They're all on the same team,' Robert WR commented.\n\n'They're using the same words and same method of saying, 'it's PROBABLY this,' without any shred of evidence. They're hypocrites bc that's what they accuse the ufo com. of.'\n\nBut Musk is not the only one to come forward with the theory. In March, US officials said there was 'no evidence' that the US government had encountered alien life and the UFOs seen by American are merely objects from Earth.\n\nWhile the public to criticize Musk on X about his comments, he has been consistent with the opinion throughout the year.\n\nIn May, the SpaceX founder said the people who believe there are aliens among us are the same people who believe NASA's moon landings were fake.\n\nSpeaking on a panel titled 'How to save the human race and other light topics' at the 2024 Milken Institute Global Conference held in Los Angeles, Musk gave a similar response to what he shared with Tucker.\n\nMusk cited no secret knowledge for his assessment on Carlon's program (above) - only his management of a worldwide satellite internet network via Starlink. 'We've got 6,000 satellites in orbit and not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft,' Musk said\n\n'I've not seen any evidence of aliens,' Musk said. 'And SpaceX, with the Starlink constellation, has roughly 6,000 satellites, and not once have we had to maneuver around a UFO. [...] Never. So I'm like, okay, I don't see any evidence of aliens.'\n\nNevertheless, Musk's network of 6,426 Starlink satellites currently orbiting Earth as of September 2024, do routinely engage in evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions, as many as 275 such dodges per day to avoid other objects in space.\n\nThis week, Musk offered his best, unclassified assessment of what pilots and other military eyewitnesses were encountering when they report a out of this world craft.\n\n'If you had the top secret compartmented clearance, you would know about this new program,' Musk told Carlson as a hypothetical. 'So, then, you know, some pilot sees something moving fast and says, 'Hey! I saw a UFO!''\n\nMusk continued, speaking from the voice of a hypothetical senior Pentagon official: 'Yeah, that was actually a new weapons program but we can't tell you that.'\n\nMusk's doubling-down on his stance this week was met by a similarly jaded response from Las Vegas-based KLAS-TV new reporter George Knapp, who has made a career breaking stories on the UFO beat from FBI raids of Area 51 citizen watchdogs to the 'Mosul orb.'\n\n'Great news,' Knapp posted to Musk's X platform. 'So when do they finally deploy those nifty Tic Tac [UFO] craft seen in 2004?'\n\nThe infamous 2004 Nimitz 'Tic Tac' UFO encounter has remained unsolved to the present day, meriting a mention before Congress last summer when a US Navy pilot eyewitness to the baffling pill-shaped object testified before Congress."

        "article_content": "A recent revelation by a Pentagon whistleblower has disclosed the existence of a highly classified government program called \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nReported by journalist Michael Shellenberger on his Substack newsletter \u2018Public,\u2019 this secret Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP) allegedly deals with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), formerly referred to as UFOs, and has operated for decades without Congressional oversight, raising concerns about government transparency.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, elements within the military and intelligence community (IC) have withheld information about UAPs, violating constitutional obligations. Shellenberger notes, \u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about UAPs.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s report outlines seven categories of evidence, detailing various UAP sightings captured by U.S. military sensors and personnel. It claims that \u201cthe verifiable chain of custody for UAP IMINT [Imagery Intelligence] collected by U.S. military assets ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered.\u201d\n\nThe report also mentions \u201calien reproduction vehicles\u201d (ARVs) being secured within this program. The whistleblower further warned that publishing the name \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d could lead to government surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nThese revelations align with former President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing claims that the government is withholding information about UAPs. In a June 2024 interview, Trump said, \u201cI have access, and I speak to people about it. I've had actual meetings on it. And they will tell you there\u2019s something going on.\u201d He has frequently expressed frustration over the government\u2019s secrecy, stating that his administration sought to release more information to the public.\n\nLawmakers like Senators Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have pushed for greater transparency on UAPs, have voiced concerns about the lack of accountability. \u201cMost of [the UAP whistleblowers] have held very high clearances and high positions within our government,\u201d Rubio said last year.\n\nWhile the full extent of \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d remains unclear, the disclosure has reignited public interest in UAP investigations. The Pentagon has yet to respond to the new allegations, though it previously denied any reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. Whistleblowers, however, continue to claim that crucial information about UAPs is being hidden from Congress."

The move comes after a year of significant changes for Fitbit, including the closure of its independent website and the discontinuation of its smartwatch lines.\n\nAnnounced today, Fitbit Labs is available to select users who can opt in to test these new features and provide feedback. Users who qualify will find the option within the app\u2019s \u2018You\u2019 tab, where they can either join immediately or sign up for a waitlist if the lab is not yet available.\n\nFitbit Labs\u2019 first project is an insights explorer that utilizes Google\u2019s Gemini AI models to provide users with personalized answers to their health and wellness questions. By analyzing Fitbit data, the AI should offer insights into the relationship between various metrics in an easily understandable format, including charts and graphs. The insights provided could help users understand connections between various health metrics, giving them more actionable information to manage their well-being.\n\nFitbit has indicated that more features will be tested through Fitbit Labs in the future, all with a focus on integrating Google\u2019s latest AI innovations into the Fitbit experience. However, these Labs features will only be available temporarily, and some may require a subscription to Fitbit Premium.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

        "article_content": "The mysterious character from the Dandadan manga, Count St. Germain, might be linked to the historical figure alleged to be a vampire!\n\nSpoiler Alert !!! This article contains spoilers from the Dandadan manga.\n\nThe world of Dandadan is as wild and unpredictable as it gets, filled with paranormal entities, bizarre aliens, and quirky, unforgettable characters. In this supernatural mix, there is a mysterious character that is yet to be introduced to anime-only viewers, and that is Count St. Germain. Introduced in chapter 120, Count Saint-Germain\u2019s main goal is to acquire the elusive Dandadan. But who exactly is this character, and what\u2019s the deal with his name?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCount St. Germain from Dandadan manga | Credit: Viz Media\n\nInterestingly, the name \u201cCount St. Germain\u201d isn\u2019t just a random name. It has a fascinating link to a historical character who has long piqued the interest of historians and conspiracy theorists: a man who was believed to be immortal and was surrounded by rumors of vampirism.\n\nWho is Count Saint-Germain in Dandadan?\n\nCount St. Germain is portrayed in the Dandadan universe as a paranormal collector who has a particular interest in obtaining Dandadan for reasons that are currently unclear. Under the alias of \u201cSanjome\u201d, Count St. Germain is currently serving as the high school\u2019s deputy head teacher and advisor to the History and Culture Research Club, despite his connections with the Kur, a militaristic alien race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCount St. Germain | Credit: Viz Media\n\nAlthough his dual identity suggests that he is cunning and discrete, his name is what really grabs fans\u2019 attention. St. Germain is not your typical temporary antagonist. It\u2019s evident from his introduction that he will have a bigger part to play in Dandadan\u2018s overall story.\n\nHe might easily emerge as one of the primary antagonists, using supernatural methods to achieve his goals given his fascination with the paranormal. But his name, steeped in history and tradition, offers even more hints about his true nature. The parallels between Dandadan\u2018s Count St. Germain and his real-life counterpart are impossible to ignore. Both figures are shrouded in mystery, have questionable origins, and exhibit strange, otherworldly behavior.\n\nThe Historical Count Saint-Germain: An Immortal or a Vampire?\n\nThe name Count St. Germain holds weight in history, tied to a figure who lived in 18th-century Europe, claiming to be an alchemist, diplomat, and composer. Fast forward to the early 20th century, a man named Jacques St. Germain arrived in New Orleans, claiming to be a descendant of the legendary Count St. Germain. Jacques became notorious for his luxurious parties and mysterious habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandadan | Credit: Science SARU\n\nDespite impressing the aristocracy with his wit, knowledge, and wealth, there was something truly mysterious about him \u2014 he was claimed to be immortal. Known for his refusal to eat in public and his disappearing acts, Jacques St. Germain quickly became a subject of intrigue and suspicion, and rumors of his strange, vampiric behavior spread across New Orleans.\n\nThe most chilling story tied to Jacques is the story of a woman who allegedly jumped from the second floor of his home, claiming he had bitten her on the neck in an attempt to drain her blood. When authorities searched his home, they found bottles filled with what appeared to be blood, but Jacques St. Germain was nowhere to be found. This event fueled rumors that he was not just an eccentric nobleman but an actual vampire.\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nIs the Dandadan universe about to introduce its own version of a vampire through Count St. Germain? In Dandadan, Count Saint-Germain\u2019s role as a collector of paranormal artifacts positions him as a character deeply rooted in the supernatural. Moreover, in the manga Turbo Granny refers to him as \u201cHyper Geezer\u201d. It\u2019s no surprise that fans are speculating whether Dandadan\u2019s Count St. Germain is setting up to be a vampiric force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandadan has already introduced us to a host of strange and supernatural elements, but Count St. Germain\u2019s appearance raises the stakes in more ways than one. Whether he\u2019s an immortal, a vampire, or something even stranger, the journey to uncover his secrets is just beginning as the series unfolds.\n\nDandadan is currently available to watch and read on Netflix and Viz Media, respectively."

Weill Center for the Performing Arts a haunted reputation.\n\n\"Our staff and our patrons definitely notice different things that happen around the theater,\u201d said Executive Director Katy Glodosky. \u201cThere's a reason why we leave the ghost light up at night.\"\n\nMikenzie Hammel, TMJ4\n\nThe ghost light is a stand topped with a single light bulb. Staff places it center stage every evening. They believe it welcomes the good spirits and wards off the bad ones.\n\nThe nearly century-old building was originally known as the Sheboygan Theater. It was built in 1928, during the Roaring 20s era, in response to the demand for entertainment.\n\nWeill Center\n\n\n\nWeill Center\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking bathtub gin, The Prohibition, speakeasies and jazz\u2026\u201d Glodosky noted.\n\nThe building closed in 1992 but then reopened in 2001 after a major renovation.\n\nAnd even through all the change, locals say the history has stuck around, and not just the structure of the theater.\n\nGlodosky noticed something odd in the projection room last year, snapping a few photos, and when you zoom in, a figure is positioned in the window, looking out onto the stage.\n\nKaty Glodosky\n\nKaty Glodosky\n\n\"Does that freak you out, personally? Or do you welcome that?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cI don't know if I necessarily welcome it but it's just part of the historic theater,\u201d Glodosky responded. \u201cIt's part of the history of this place. You kind of sign up for it when you join the team.\"\n\nMikenzie Hammel, TMJ4\n\nTechnical Director Julian Jetzer grew up with the Weill Center. He said it holds a special place in his heart.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d stand on the sidewalk all the way around [the block] because they\u2019d have 25 cartoons in a row on Saturdays. And that was probably when I was 8 years old.\u201d\n\nJetzer proposed at the theater to his wife of over 60 years, and he\u2019s worked there for the last 25.\n\nDuring that time, he\u2019s had his fair share of ghostly encounters.\n\nMikenzie Hammel, TMJ4\n\n\"About two or three months ago one of the alarms went off and I turned on the camera from home. And there was this white, foggy thing moving around in the theater,\u201d Jetzer recalled. \u201cI've never seen anything like that before and there were no lights on in the theater or anything.\"\n\nHe said one cleaning staff member was so scared by one of her own paranormal experiences, she left her job.\n\nWatch: The nearly 100-year-old Sheboygan theater that may be home to ghosts.\n\nStaff at nearly century-old theater in Sheboygan say they have a ghost\n\n\u201cWe like to believe that any of the entities that have been here with us for nearly a century are happy and positive and not hurtful,\u201d Glodosky said.\n\nA paranormal investigation from last weekend confirms that it\u2019s all good energy.\n\nI got a message the following Monday saying they picked up several spirits.\n\nHere\u2019s what the group said:\n\nWe had lots of activity\u2026a small girl who likes when kids come to the theater for the plays. We identified a pair of string musicians from the 30s, one of whom was looking for the ladies\u2019 lounge in the balcony. There was also a gentleman who seemed to still hang out by the old men's smoking room and when he was present the group smelled cigarette smoke. Most notably, one of our volunteers brought trigger items of her grandfathers who used to work at the theater. When we channeled our energy and thought about him, the music box started playing and the lights flashed at that exact instant. Weill Center\n\nThe Weill team encourages people to embrace the magical, strange and unusual on the stage as well as in the theater halls.\n\n\"We know that live events are special,\u201d Glodosky said. \u201cThey really bring out the opportunity to have these shared moments and connections.\u201d\n\nJetzer added: \"If there are ghosts, I think that's where they'd want to be.\"\n\nTalk to us: Hey there!

However, that announcement didn\u2019t make clear whether Rogers and WBD would move forwards as partners on the latter\u2019s lifestyle channel, though a rep indicated there would be no change.\n\nBell has been the Canadian home of WBD and predecessor Discovery\u2019s suite for three decades, operating many of its channels locally. However, in June, Rogers struck a deal to move WBD\u2019s lifestyle and factual channels into its sphere. Bell responded by filing for an injunction at the Ontario Superior Court to stop Rogers distributing the networks, claiming that WBD was blocked from moving its shows.\n\nRogers said today that Bell \u201cacknowledged all claims against Rogers were unfounded and abandoned its legal efforts.\u201d\n\nThe upshot is Rogers will launch Discovery ID and Discovery Channel as linear networks and distribute them to third-parties such as Bell. Content from Cooking, OWN, MotorTrend, Animal Planet and Discovery Science will be available on-demand and via Citytv+ on Amazon Prime Video Channels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already home to Canada\u2019s number one sports network, and this partnership helps solidify our leadership in entertainment with a diverse media portfolio of TV\u2019s most iconic brands,\u201d said Colette Watson, President, Rogers Sports & Media.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

With the launch of the Lily app, retailers and brands now have end-to-end control over their product attribute management and workflows. Upon logging in, users can seamlessly ingest products from their merchandise catalog, process them through the Lily AI for enrichment, and propagate the updated product data across their online touchpoints for enhanced discovery, increased return-on-ad-spend (ROAS), and improved organic search performance.\n\n\n\nThanks to the Lily app\u2019s suite of integrations, importing and exporting optimized product data has never been easier. Users can connect to their Google Merchant Center account, their PIM (Product Information Management), or their eCommerce search platform through one of Lily\u2019s no-code connectors. From there, the user is empowered to decide which products to enrich, and supported with a comprehensive reporting suite to analyze their data enrichment activities. Out-of-the-box integrations with Google Merchant Center, Shopify, Bloomreach, Algolia, and more eliminate the need to manually configure, customize or update data for each individual destination system.\n\nSpecifically, to empower both marketers and merchants, the Lily app supports:\n\nAgnostic catalog ingestion via API or flat file;\n\nFully automated product attribution;\n\nOn-demand activation of Lily AI product attributes in: Shopify, Google Merchant Center, Algolia, Bloomreach & more;\n\nAutomatic retrieval and enrichment of new products from destination systems and return synchronization for timely activation;\n\nA/B testing and impact measurement across Google\u2019s surfaces.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor some retailers and brands, the excitement of the omnipresent Generative AI narrative is wearing off yet they aren\u2019t abandoning hope; instead, they are pushing through and figuring out how AI can create real value,\u201d says Purva Gupta, CEO and Co-founder of Lily AI. \u201cWhile upskilling internal teams, many relied on their technology providers to leverage AI on their behalf, but today, I\u2019m excited to deliver the newest version of our Lily app to empower our clients with easy-to-use self-serve access to the most accurate and high quality AI-powered product attribute platform in the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I meet with our customers, I often hear the term \u2018automagically\u2019 to describe their vision for product data enrichment and activation,\u201d says Ahmed Naiem, President of Lily AI. \u201cNow with the Lily app, we\u2019re empowering their teams to submit product data, publish enrichments, and view reports all through a self-serve interface, yet where the app really shines through is with our Google Merchant Center integration. Not only does the app eliminate human efforts in preparing and transferring data, but it improves the performance of traditional Search, Shopping, and Performance Max (PMax) campaigns, delivering 5-20% lifts across impressions and clicks.\u201d\n\nAbout Lily AI:\n\nLily AI is a female-founded retail AI company empowering retailers and brands by bridging the gap between merchant-speak and customer-speak. Leveraging generative AI, computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning, the Lily platform enhances customer shopping experiences by analyzing product catalogs and automatically enriching the assortment with the natural language consumers actually use when they search and shop. The platform then distributes the optimized data across a retailer\u2019s entire ecosystem from their website to Google Ads and beyond, ultimately delivering upwards of 9-figure revenue lift through improved product attribution, enhanced discovery, increased traffic and higher conversion.

        "article_content": "Report Ocean has published a new report on the Building Information Modeling Software Market, delivering an extensive analysis of key factors such as market restraints, drivers, and opportunities. The report offers a detailed examination of industry trends and developments shaping the growth of the Building Information Modeling Software market. It also provides a comprehensive analysis and forecast of the market future performance.\n\nGlobal Building Information Modeling (BIM) Software Market is valued at approximately USD 3.96 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 19.4% over the forecast period 2024-2032.\n\nRequest To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) software facilitates the creation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of facilities, essentially enabling the development of 3D models embedded with detailed data on components such as material specifications, dimensions, and maintenance schedules. This technology spans the entire lifecycle of a building, from design and construction through to operation and maintenance, enhancing collaboration among architects, engineers, and constructors by enabling real-time sharing and updating of information. The adoption of BIM software is significantly reducing errors and conflicts during construction, allowing for the simulation of construction processes, early identification of potential issues, and optimization of project schedules and costs.\n\nThe market\u2019s expansion is driven by the escalating demand for efficient project management solutions and the increasing adoption of advanced technologies within the construction sector. As construction projects become more complex, the need for sophisticated tools that facilitate seamless collaboration, streamline workflows, and mitigate risks throughout the project lifecycle has grown. BIM software, with its comprehensive suite of capabilities including 3D modeling, visualization, simulation, and analysis, plays a critical role in modernizing construction practices and enabling informed decision-making at every project stage. However, high implementation costs and limited skilled workforce for BIM are the key factors that are substantially halting the growth of the market globally.\n\nMoreover, global regulatory bodies and governments are recognizing the potential of BIM to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of built environments. As a result, they are introducing mandates and guidelines that require or incentivize the adoption of BIM in construction projects.\n\nGet a Free Sample PDF copy of the report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw9963\n\nThis regulatory push is driving demand for BIM software and encouraging widespread industry adoption, further fueling market growth. Additionally, the integration of BIM with emerging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) is enhancing its capabilities, making it an indispensable tool in the construction industry\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nThe key regions considered for the global Building Information Modeling (BIM) software market study include Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Rest of the World.
