            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."

The visualised podcast, made by Uncanny Media, Bafflegab and CC Lab, will air on BBC Two immediately after the TV episode, bringing fans a frightening Friday night full of 90 minutes of Uncanny. An extended version of the podcast will then be available on BBC Sounds.\n\nCelebrity ghost watchers including the likes of Kiell Smith-Bynoe, Meera Syal and Charlie Cooper as well as Uncanny regular experts such as Evelyn Hollow will join Danny alongside the lead witness at the heart of each story.\n\nUncanny: Post Mortem follows in the footsteps of the hugely successful Traitors: Uncloaked, presented by Ed Gamble, giving listeners exclusive behind the scenes access to The Traitors.\n\nDanny Robins says \"Our Uncanny cases are so intriguing and frankly bloody frightening that after watching an episode you always want to discuss it - chatting over theories on what happened and that biggest of all questions \"do ghosts exist?\" So now, brilliantly, we can do that in Uncanny: Post Mortem, directly after the main show. It's the kind of delicious deep dive you will be desperate to do after getting hooked on each of these strange chilling cases. You'll hear more from me, our experts, witnesses and some brilliant celebrity Uncanny fans. Expect new evidence and new leads! I can't wait!\"\n\nBBC Podcast & Formats Commissioner Rhian Roberts says \"The Uncanny podcast has been going since 2021, with the TV show joining the Uncanny universe last year. We know listeners and viewers absolutely love it, adding a visualised podcast is a great next step. Uncanny: Post Mortem will be where to head to find out just how freaked out we all were, we can be scared together! There are always so many fascinating questions that come into us after an episode of Uncanny, it\u2019s going to be brilliant to have another place to share theories.\"\n\nJack Bootle, the BBC\u2019s Head of Commissioning for Specialist Factual television, says \"The first TV series of Uncanny was a big hit with both sceptics and believers \u2013 and we know many wanted to learn more about the cases Danny was investigating.

            "article_content": "Found Footage Film Mike Flanagan Loves Is Now Streaming for Free!\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about the found footage technique is that almost anyone with a camera can make a movie. The found footage boom of the 2010s ushered in a glut of first-person horror pictures. Some aspiring creators demonstrated an effective use of the technique. Others didn\u2019t quite manage to make their mark. Colin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz are among a handful of creators who used the technique to break into feature filmmaking. Credited as The Vicious Brothers, the pair delivered a tense and atmospheric chiller called Grave Encounters.\n\nIn the years since its release, Grave Encounters has developed a cult audience and even managed to win over a few high-profile fans. Among them is Oculus director Mike Flanagan. That\u2019s right, Mike Flanagan added Grave Encounters to a Letterboxd list featuring his favorite horror movies.\n\nThe plot crunch for this Mike Flanagan-endorsed shocker goes like this:\n\nThe crew of a ghost-hunting TV show hole up in an abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to catch some spooks on camera \u2013 a scenario that can only ever end badly, and it does.\n\nThough the film doesn\u2019t have the acclaim of contemporaries like The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity, it\u2019s well-made and brimming with atmosphere. The creative team made the most of their limited budget, saving on expenses by making use of an existing location perfect for the setup. The majority of the picture was filmed in Riverview Hospital in British Columbia.\n\nWhere is Grave Encounters available to stream?\n\nSeeing as Mike Flanagan knows his way around a horror movie, you may be curious to check the flick out for yourself. If you are game to experience Grave Encounters, you can find the film streaming on Tubi as of the publication of this post.\n\nIf the first installment has you hungry for more, Minihan and Ortiz penned the script for a second installment in the series titled Grave Encounters 2. John Poliquin took over directorial duties on the follow-up. A third film was subsequently announced but never materialized.\n\nIf the name Colin Minihan sounds familiar, it may be because he has carved out a space for himself in the years since Grave Encounters. He was previously known for directing music videos. Following the success of Grave Encounters, he directed the indie survival horror What Keeps You Alive and penned the screenplay for Kurtis David Harder\u2019s Spiral.\n\nThat\u2019s all we have for you, for the time being. Stay tuned for more recommendations from your favorite creators in the genre space in the near future. If you\u2019d like to chat more about under-seen indie gems, come find me on Threads.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

            "article_content": "The sprawling grounds of France\u2019s opulent Palace of Versailles are not only a masterpiece of landscaping, but a mark of 17th-century engineering innovation. The property\u2019s ornamental fountains and ponds, for example, were only made possible by a specially built machine that pulled water from the Seine and pushed it up a steep hill to Versailles.\n\nThe machine was designed at the request of the French king Louis XIV\u2014the monarch who commissioned Versailles, also known as the Sun King. His and his successors\u2019 courts are mainly remembered for ostentatious finery, but their immense wealth also enabled discovery, and Versailles turned into a hotbed for science: a theme explored by a new exhibition at the Science Museum in London: \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exhibition highlights how science flourished at Versailles, from the kings\u2019 personal interest in luxurious scientific instruments and spectacular demonstrations, to its strategic role beyond the palace through newly founded institutions and scientific expeditions,\u201d says Glyn Morgan, the museum\u2019s curatorial lead for exhibitions, in a statement.\n\nThe show spans the 17th and 18th centuries, covering the reigns of Louis XIV (who founded the French Academy of Sciences in 1666), Louis XV and Louis XVI (who was executed in 1793 during the French Revolution). Through more than 120 artifacts, the exhibition illustrates the importance of art and science in the French royal court.\n\nMany of the objects show innovations in medicine, such as a curved scalpel designed by Louis XIV\u2019s royal surgeon, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9lix. When the king developed a royal anal fistula, his surgeon had to invent a customized scalpel. F\u00e9lix tested his tool on local peasants, killing several in the process. As the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Jones writes, \u201cThe rehearsals worked: He fixed the royal fistula and Louis XIV lived on until 1715, his 72-year reign a world record.\u201d\n\nUnder the reign of Louis XV (who ruled between 1715 and 1774), a midwife called Madame du Coudray became a powerful force against French infant mortality. The king hired her to travel throughout rural France to train other midwives in the mechanics of birth, employing \u201csophisticated life-sized mannequins,\u201d per the statement. Du Coudray ultimately educated more than 5,000 women and physicians, and her last surviving model is on display in the exhibition.\n\nAfter Louis XV died of smallpox, his son and successor Louis XVI announced that the royal family would get inoculated. Included in the exhibition are posters made to reassure the public of the strategy\u2019s success.\n\nScience at Versailles extended to the wonders of the natural world. French botanists grew and studied exotic plants. Versailles had a menagerie stocked with animals like coatis and cassowaries. Visitors to the Science Museum will be able to see the menagerie\u2019s most famous resident: Louis XV\u2019s rhinoceros, given to the king by a French governor based in India and later dissected and taxidermied upon its death.\n\n\u201cAs it was studied by scientists, it became incredibly important to our growing zoological knowledge,\u201d as Morgan tells the Observer\u2019s Vanessa Thorpe. \u201cThe photographs really did not do justice to just how impressive and characterful it is. The skin is almost jet black.\u201d\n\nAlso on display are philosopher Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s handwritten, annotated French translation of Isaac Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica; the watch made for Louis XVI\u2019s wife, Marie Antoinette, by Abraham-Louis Breguet; and an early map of the moon drawn by Jean-Dominique Cassini in 1679. The French Revolution claimed the lives of some of the French royal court\u2019s thinkers, but their advances were permanent. Per the Guardian, \u201cScience strode on.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoyal ambition, scientific knowledge and ideals of beauty culminated at Versailles in spectacular demonstrations and brilliant innovations from the brightest minds of the time,\u201d says Ian Blatchford, director and chief executive of the Science Museum Group, in the statement. \u201cWe are thrilled to introduce our visitors to these fascinating stories through the stunning objects on display.\u201d\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor\u201d is on view at the Science Museum in London through April 21, 2025."

            "article_content": "Executives and researchers leading Meta\u2019s AI efforts obsessed over beating OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model while developing Llama 3, according to internal messages unsealed by a court on Tuesday in one of the company\u2019s ongoing AI copyright cases, Kadrey v. Meta.\n\n\u201cHonestly\u2026 Our goal needs to be GPT-4,\u201d said Meta\u2019s VP of Generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, in an October 2023 message to Meta researcher Hugo Touvron. \u201cWe have 64k GPUs coming! We need to learn how to build frontier and win this race.\u201d\n\nThough Meta releases open AI models, the company\u2019s AI leaders were far more focused on beating competitors that don\u2019t typically release their model\u2019s weights, like Anthropic and OpenAI, and instead gate them behind an API. Meta\u2019s execs and researchers held up Anthropic\u2019s Claude and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 as a gold standard to work toward.\n\nThe French AI startup Mistral, one of the biggest open competitors to Meta, was mentioned several times in the internal messages, but the tone was dismissive.\n\n\u201cMistral is peanuts for us,\u201d Al-Dahle said in a message. \u201cWe should be able to do better,\u201d he said later.\n\nTech companies are racing to upstage each other with cutting-edge AI models these days, but these court filings reveal just how competitive Meta\u2019s AI leaders truly were \u2014 and seemingly still are. At several points in the message exchanges, Meta\u2019s AI leads talked about how they were \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in obtaining the right data to train Llama; at one point, an exec even said that \u201cLlama 3 is literally all I care about,\u201d in a message to coworkers.\n\nProsecutors in this case allege that Meta\u2019s executives occasionally cut corners in their mad race to shipping AI models, training on copyrighted books in the process.\n\nTouvron noted in a message that the mix of datasets used for Llama 2 \u201cwas bad,\u201d and talked about how Meta could use a better mix of data sources to improve Llama 3. Touvron and Al-Dahle then talked about clearing the path to use the LibGen dataset, which contains copyrighted works from Cengage Learning, Macmillan Learning, McGraw Hill, and Pearson Education.\n\n\u201cDo we have the right datasets in there[?]\u201d said Al-Dahle. \u201cIs there anything you wanted to use but couldn\u2019t for some stupid reason?\u201d\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously said he\u2019s trying to close the performance gap between Llama\u2019s AI models and closed models from OpenAI, Google, and others. The internal messages reveal the intense pressure within the company to do so.\n\n\u201cThis year, Llama 3 is competitive with the most advanced models and leading in some areas,\u201d said Zuckerberg in a letter from July 2024. \u201cStarting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhen Meta ultimately released Llama 3 in April 2024, the open AI model was competitive with leading closed models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, and outperformed open options from Mistral. However, the data Meta used to train its models \u2014 data Zuckerberg reportedly gave the green light to use, despite its copyright status \u2014 are facing scrutiny in several ongoing lawsuits."

The release comes as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman strengthens ties with the incoming Trump administration, signaling a pivotal moment for AI policy.\n\n\u201cWe believe America needs to act now to maximize AI\u2019s possibilities while minimizing its harms,\u201d OpenAI head of global policy Chris Lehane writes in the blueprint, which highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize sectors like medicine, education, and finance while emphasizing the need for responsible development.\n\nKey Proposals in OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint\n\nThe 15-page OpenAI blueprint offers the following recommendations for advancing AI in America:\n\nIncreased Investment in Infrastructure: The company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems.\n\nThe company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems.

Balancing Growth With Safety: The company highlights the importance of security measures while ensuring the equitable distribution of AI benefits.\n\nThe timing of this initiative is no coincidence. In December, Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural fund. This move signals a calculated effort to strengthen ties with the incoming administration and influence its AI strategy.\n\nThe Stakes for AI Development in America\n\nThe competition to lead in AI is fierce. OpenAI\u2019s rivals, including xAI\u2014led by Elon Musk, an ally of incoming president Trump\u2014are scaling up investments in computing infrastructure. With the stakes so high, OpenAI\u2019s blueprint warns that delays in U.S. policy could redirect critical foreign investments to China.\n\nLehane framed the geopolitical challenge succinctly: \u201cAre those countries going to be building on U.S. rails or on CCP rails?\u201d The implications extend beyond economics, touching on national security and global AI dominance.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe economic blueprint represents OpenAI\u2019s effort to shape the Trump administration\u2019s approach to AI. With a focus on collaboration and innovation, OpenAI plans to host an event on January 30 to demonstrate its latest technology and engage with policymakers. This push underscores the critical role AI plays in America\u2019s economic and strategic future. While the debate over AI regulations continues, OpenAI\u2019s proposals aim to secure the U.S.\u2019s leadership in this transformative field, ensuring both growth and safety.\n\nLearn how to invest in AI to stay ahead of the curve and make the most out of AI opportunities offered by the likes of OpenAI\u2019s blueprint."

Learn More \u203a\n\nA man unlocking his front door with a smart keypad.\n\nWe love any opportunity to see the debuts of fun, new, even futuristic gadgets\u2014who doesn\u2019t? But the home security technology unveiled at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) had our attention because of what it means for homeowners\u2019 safety, convenience, and savings.\n\nBased on what CES presented, we saw several home security trends emerge for protecting property, family, and packages. With corresponding technology offering everything from better sensors to sleeker designs, these are our predictions for home safety and security in 2025.\n\nPhoto: Lockly\n\n1. Sleeker, Design-Forward Security\n\nThough door knobs with smart locks have added numerical or touchscreen keypads, they still look relatively similar to traditional handles. As technology advances, however, we see companies focusing on more sleek, modern designs that not only incorporate additional features but also reimagine the standard design of smart handles.\n\nLockly Styla\n\nLoved by DIYers and professional builders alike, Lockly is leading the way in creating new looks and enhanced functionality with the Styla. This combination front door handle, smart deadbolt, and video doorbell fits into a cylindrical modern door pull most easily imaginable for high-end residential applications. And it fits a lot in a skinny profile. The video component has a motion sensor, a 2K camera with color night vision, and two-way audio. The smart lock works via a 3D fingerprint sensor, a PIN Genie pad with a randomizable keypad, an RFID reader with programmable fobs, and a traditional keyhole.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough its aesthetics push the envelope enough that they may take some getting used to, we think this and other innovative designs will continue to become more common. This all-in-one handle, lock, and video doorbell comes in matte black, gray, and gold and is battery-powered for easy installation and rechargeable via USB. The Styla also comes with Lockly\u2019s new Wi-Fi hub that privately stores recorded videos and audibly chimes rather than pinging your phone. Stay tuned for when the Lockly Styla becomes available later this year.\n\nPhoto: Schlage\n\n2. Better Sensors\n\nWhile most of us have seen smart locks with numeric buttons or touchscreen keypads, some recently released products indicate better and much harder-to-fool technology is on the way. Though we\u2019re only highlighting two popular CES products here, we predict many brands will be increasing their focus on lock sensors for home security soon.\n\nTCL Smart Lock D1 Pro\n\nThe TCL Smart Lock D1 Pro requires something much more unique than a four-digit code to unlock it: your palm. Though the D1 Pro was launched this past October, CES attendees couldn\u2019t help but flock to see its revolutionary operation. Among its seven unlocking methods, the most interesting by far is its use of AI technology to read and recognize the layout of veins in your palm. Like many other smart locks, it also works via keypad, app, cards, period passwords, standard keys, and voice assist via Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The lock features a 7,800mAh rechargeable battery and durable IP54 weather-resistant construction.\n\nGet the TCL D1 smart lock at Amazon for $179.99.\n\nSchlage Sense Pro\n\nAnother reputable leader in the home security market, Schlage introduced its new Sense Pro Smart Deadbolt at this year\u2019s CES. In addition to a standard touchscreen keypad for code entry, the smart deadbolt uses Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology paired with select personal devices of your choosing to enable hands-free and tap-to-unlock access. Connected to your smart home network, the lock can automatically calculate your speed and trajectory as you approach and unlatch on its own. The Sense Pro is expected to come out later this year.\n\nPhoto: Switchbot\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Increased Front Door Visibility\n\nWith video doorbells showing up next to more front doors every day, it\u2019s relatively standard to be able to check your phone when you hear a chime alerting you to a visitor. Still, it\u2019s not always the most convenient if you\u2019re on a call to see if there\u2019s cause for attention or alarm. Some households may include members without smartphones who can\u2019t access an app-only display. Two products that showed up at CES remedied this issue by integrating their own displays, hardwiring optional.\n\nSwitchBot Video Doorbell\n\nThe SwitchBot Video Doorbell combines a traditional-looking video doorbell with a 4.3-inch smart display screen you can sit on a surface or mount to the wall. The screen delivers live videos, notifies you if anyone arrives, lets you talk to visitors while keeping your door closed, and features 512GB of local storage.\n\nThe unit can be either wired or battery-powered, and SwitchBot will also offer a solar panel to ensure continuous operation. The 2K resolution camera has a 165-degree field of view and color night vision to help you identify visitors no matter the time of day. At the time of publication, no specifics on the SwitchBot Video Doorbell launch date have been announced yet.\n\nLockly Vision Prestige\n\nIn a similar push to enable front door visibility without relying on phones, Lockly will release its Vision Prestige smart lock later this year. Rather than casting video to a separate screen like the SwitchBot Video Doorbell, this lock has a display on its interior housing. It uses presence detection powered by bit radar and a 2K resolution camera with facial recognition to clock when a person is at the door, and the screen lights up when you touch it so you can identify that individual from the inside. It even boasts an intercom, like most video doorbell cameras, so that you can have a conversation through your front door.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vision Prestige offers a few different means of securing the home, too: keyed entry, fingerprint recognition, and a patented pin entry. You can switch from a traditional touchscreen keypad to Lockly\u2019s PIN Genie, which places digits in random locations, guaranteeing safe entry into your home without revealing your code to prying eyes. We expect the Prestige\u2014an upgrade to the current Lockly Vision\u2014to drop near the end of the year.\n\nPhoto: Hyve\n\n4. Smarter Ways To Secure Deliveries\n\nWhile package delivery boxes and locking mailboxes aren\u2019t a totally new concept, more options have hit the market with smart features like remote locking and unlocking via app and automated video recording. And since package theft is a problem almost everyone has experienced, seen, or heard about, we predict package lockboxes with additional security features will continue to roll out.\n\nHyve Smart Home Delivery Pod\n\nThe Hyve smart home delivery pod may look somewhat similar to a standard front porch delivery box. Like other smart delivery boxes, users can lock and unlock the Hyve pod via an app and send unique codes to drivers, family members, and friends. But that\u2019s far from all this model offers. The box sounds a siren and sends a tamper alert to your phone if it detects anyone is attempting to access it without authorization. It also features a carbon-fiber tether to secure the entire unit to a column or railing, preventing would-be thieves from stealing the entire box. There\u2019s a window on top to allow drivers to take delivery confirmation photos, and Hyve is even compatible with package pickup software to help make arranging returns easier. You can join the waitlist for the smart package pod, expected to start shipping in June."

            "article_content": "Different office dress codes can lead to many question marks on what to wear, especially if your workplace is casual.\n\nHowever, even if your work environment is laid-back, consideration to your everyday look is important. A relaxed office setting can offer a wide variety of what you can stock your wardrobe with, allowing for some true creativity. The best casual work outfits blend the lines between professional, polished, and fashion-forward.\n\nHere, we took inspiration from the street style set to find perfect casual work looks that don\u2019t feel too stuffy or corporate. Many of these outfits incorporate elements of traditional workwear, such as blazers, trouser pants, and button-downs, but each is styled in a modern, effortless way for today\u2019s working woman. You\u2019ll also find unexpected items, such as leather shackets and bold-colored shirting, mixed with classic work pants or denim. When the look is combined with strong accessories, such as structured handbags, comfortable, kitten heels, and yes\u2014even work sneakers\u2014 the results are on point.\n\nKeep reading to discover the 9 best casual work outfit ideas to keep your office wardrobe feeling fresh and in the moment. Each look combines the simplicity and practicality you\u2019re looking for, with stylish results.\n\n\n\n1. Poplin That Pops\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIf your dress code is casual, it\u2019s the perfect excuse to experiment with color in your work wardrobe. A poplin shirt in pastel pink still reads office-appropriate, yet offers a fun twist that doesn\u2019t feel too restrictive. When paired with dark denim trousers, the look is unstoppable. We recommend accessorizing with a chunky belt and reliable Chelsea boots to keep things fresh and modern, while remaining extremely comfortable.\n\n2. Smart Separates\n\nClaudio Lavenia // Getty Images\n\nYou can still mix and match core office pieces into your wardrobe, such as button-downs and trouser pants, but keep the styling from feeling too buttoned up. Forget the matching suit jacket in this case, and pair these everyday essentials with modern accessories, such as a roomy, leather tote bag in a cool cream tone and a low-heeled leather boot, for a polished, yet relaxed approach to your office look.\n\n3. Cropped Capris\n\nChristian Vierig // Getty Images\n\nWhen it\u2019s warm outside, you can try the trend-forward, capri pant styled with a timeless blazer and button-down. It will give the look an extra nonchalant feel. Keep accessories classic, just like the rest of the outfit, with a sleek slingback and coordinating handbag. It\u2019s a fresh way to do tailoring for the modern day.\n\n4. Boardroom Basics\u2014Remixed\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s true, a blazer and silk button-down shirt have the makings of a corporate closet, but that is why we are encouraging a little remix. By wearing these work wardrobe must-haves with cool, straight jeans and \u201cDad\u201d sneakers, these foundations are made to feel a little more relaxed. You will still look professional, just with a little, street style flair.\n\n5. Luxe Leather\n\nChristian Vierig // Getty Images\n\nA casual workplace offers the opportunity to experiment with texture. A leather shacket (or faux version) is a great way to reinvent the traditional, work shirt. It will become the focal point to build your whole outfit around. Style it with wide-leg trousers, pointy shoes (flats are a must), and an east-west handbag all in a bright white hue.\n\n6. Retro Feels\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nA quirky shirt with a retro nod can lend a bit of fun to your office attire. Whether you go for a color-blocked, western-style version or an oversized bowler, keep things grounded by pairing it with neutral mainstays such as a leather midi skirt, pointed flat, and structured handbag, all in black. The look is cute, casual, yet still completely appropriate for an office setting that is on the laid-back side.\n\n7. Silky Suiting\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nIf you want to go the suiting route, make it a silk one. It\u2019s a little less formal than more structured fabrics, such as wool or cotton, and extra comfortable to wear all day long. This set feels just like your favorite pajama set. Layer a white T-shirt underneath to keep things from feeling too proper, and pair it with leather Mary Jane flat shoes (or white sneakers!).\n\n8. To the Maxi\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nWearing a one-and-done maxi dress is the easiest way to get you out the door in style. A sweater dress is the best solution for when you want to stay comfortable and warm. Keeping with the casual theme, minimalist accessories should be your go-to. We love the simplicity of a kitten heel shoe, gold chain necklace, and mini designer bag.\n\n9. Espresso Dreams\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nA cardigan can be your best friend in the colder months, but how do you keep it from looking too casual? The answer is simple: pair it with an elegant maxi skirt. In the winter, we love a wool fabrication; when it\u2019s warmer, a denim version. Style it with kitten heels and a shoulder bag, all in similar espresso tones."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

Headquartered in El Dorado Hills, California, it focuses on manufacturing AI chips for edge applications. Rather than being mostly used in vast data centers (like Nvidia\u2019s), its chips are meant to be integrated into smart products like security cameras, drones, and industrial robots.\n\n\u201cAI-powered edge computing is the future due to its low power consumption, low latency, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy advantages,\u201d CEO Dinakar Munagala, who previously worked almost 12 years for Intel, said in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\n\n\nBlaize is currently a small player in the mammoth AI chip industry and is highly unprofitable, losing $87.5 million on only $3.8 million in revenue in 2023, the most recently available year for its financials, according to its prospectus. However, chip manufacturers require loads of capital to build out their manufacturing (which Blaize says is done in the U.S.) before they can truly start scaling.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, [as a] chip company you do a massive amount of investment and when the hockey stick comes, it climbs,\u201d Munagala told TechCrunch.\n\nBlaize is also touting $400 million in deals in the pipeline. One deal in its investor deck promotes a signed purchase order of up to $104 million with an unnamed EMEA \u201cdefense entity,\u201d likely in the Middle East, for a system that can identify unknown or friendly troops, spot small boats, and detect drones. (Munagala declined to say exactly which country.)\n\nMunagala told TechCrunch he expects Blaize to be worth $1.2 billion after its SPAC merger. That is lower than private valuations for other companies like Cerebras, a closely-watched AI chipmaker which filed for an IPO last fall and was seeking to double its $4 billion valuation, TechCrunch previously reported. However, Cerebras has not yet gone public, as some investors had qualms over its over-reliance on a single Middle Eastern customer, investors told CNBC.\n\nIn contrast to Blaize, though, Cerebras focuses on data center chips. Blaize going public is ultimately a bet on a future where AI chips move from those centralized data centers to being more integrated into physical products.\n\n\u201cAll of the AI hype is happening in the data center. Interestingly, they\u2019ve totally neglected and forgotten about real physical world use cases that are very real, that are touching people\u2019s lives and are happening now and making money,\u201d Munagala told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on the practical use of AI in the physical world.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Learn More.\n\nOpenAI is doubling down on its vision for AI in the U.S., unveiling its economic blueprint, \u201cAI in America.\u201d This document outlines strategies to spur AI development, regulate the technology, and maintain America\u2019s edge over global competitors like China. The release comes as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman strengthens ties with the incoming Trump administration, signaling a pivotal moment for AI policy.\n\n\u201cWe believe America needs to act now to maximize AI\u2019s possibilities while minimizing its harms,\u201d OpenAI head of global policy Chris Lehane writes in the blueprint, which highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize sectors like medicine, education, and finance while emphasizing the need for responsible development.\n\nKey Proposals in OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint\n\nThe 15-page OpenAI blueprint offers the following recommendations for advancing AI in America:\n\nIncreased Investment in Infrastructure: The company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems.\n\nThe company urges significant public and private funding for advanced computing centers essential for AI tools and systems. International Collaboration: OpenAI advocates for partnerships with countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, to attract investment and prevent funds from flowing to China.\n\nOpenAI advocates for partnerships with countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, to attract investment and prevent funds from flowing to China. Light-Touch AI Regulations: OpenAI recommends a unified federal framework for AI regulations, opposing state-level rules that could fragment the industry and weaken U.S. competitiveness.\n\nOpenAI recommends a unified federal framework for AI regulations, opposing state-level rules that could fragment the industry and weaken U.S. competitiveness. Balancing Growth With Safety: The company highlights the importance of security measures while ensuring the equitable distribution of AI benefits.\n\nThe timing of this initiative is no coincidence. In December, Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural fund. This move signals a calculated effort to strengthen ties with the incoming administration and influence its AI strategy.\n\nThe Stakes for AI Development in America\n\nThe competition to lead in AI is fierce. OpenAI\u2019s rivals, including xAI\u2014led by Elon Musk, an ally of incoming president Trump\u2014are scaling up investments in computing infrastructure. With the stakes so high, OpenAI\u2019s blueprint warns that delays in U.S. policy could redirect critical foreign investments to China.\n\nLehane framed the geopolitical challenge succinctly: \u201cAre those countries going to be building on U.S. rails or on CCP rails?\u201d The implications extend beyond economics, touching on national security and global AI dominance.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe economic blueprint represents OpenAI\u2019s effort to shape the Trump administration\u2019s approach to AI. With a focus on collaboration and innovation, OpenAI plans to host an event on January 30 to demonstrate its latest technology and engage with policymakers. This push underscores the critical role AI plays in America\u2019s economic and strategic future. While the debate over AI regulations continues, OpenAI\u2019s proposals aim to secure the U.S.\u2019s leadership in this transformative field, ensuring both growth and safety.\n\nLearn how to invest in AI to stay ahead of the curve and make the most out of AI opportunities offered by the likes of OpenAI\u2019s blueprint."

            "article_content": "Executives and researchers leading Meta\u2019s AI efforts obsessed over beating OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model while developing Llama 3, according to internal messages unsealed by a court on Tuesday in one of the company\u2019s ongoing AI copyright cases, Kadrey v. Meta.\n\n\u201cHonestly\u2026 Our goal needs to be GPT-4,\u201d said Meta\u2019s VP of Generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, in an October 2023 message to Meta researcher Hugo Touvron. \u201cWe have 64k GPUs coming! We need to learn how to build frontier and win this race.\u201d\n\nThough Meta releases open AI models, the company\u2019s AI leaders were far more focused on beating competitors that don\u2019t typically release their model\u2019s weights, like Anthropic and OpenAI, and instead gate them behind an API. Meta\u2019s execs and researchers held up Anthropic\u2019s Claude and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 as a gold standard to work toward.\n\nThe French AI startup Mistral, one of the biggest open competitors to Meta, was mentioned several times in the internal messages, but the tone was dismissive.\n\n\u201cMistral is peanuts for us,\u201d Al-Dahle said in a message. \u201cWe should be able to do better,\u201d he said later.\n\nTech companies are racing to upstage each other with cutting-edge AI models these days, but these court filings reveal just how competitive Meta\u2019s AI leaders truly were \u2014 and seemingly still are. At several points in the message exchanges, Meta\u2019s AI leads talked about how they were \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in obtaining the right data to train Llama; at one point, an exec even said that \u201cLlama 3 is literally all I care about,\u201d in a message to coworkers.\n\nProsecutors in this case allege that Meta\u2019s executives occasionally cut corners in their mad race to shipping AI models, training on copyrighted books in the process.\n\nTouvron noted in a message that the mix of datasets used for Llama 2 \u201cwas bad,\u201d and talked about how Meta could use a better mix of data sources to improve Llama 3. Touvron and Al-Dahle then talked about clearing the path to use the LibGen dataset, which contains copyrighted works from Cengage Learning, Macmillan Learning, McGraw Hill, and Pearson Education.\n\n\u201cDo we have the right datasets in there[?]\u201d said Al-Dahle. \u201cIs there anything you wanted to use but couldn\u2019t for some stupid reason?\u201d\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously said he\u2019s trying to close the performance gap between Llama\u2019s AI models and closed models from OpenAI, Google, and others. The internal messages reveal the intense pressure within the company to do so.\n\n\u201cThis year, Llama 3 is competitive with the most advanced models and leading in some areas,\u201d said Zuckerberg in a letter from July 2024. \u201cStarting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhen Meta ultimately released Llama 3 in April 2024, the open AI model was competitive with leading closed models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, and outperformed open options from Mistral. However, the data Meta used to train its models \u2014 data Zuckerberg reportedly gave the green light to use, despite its copyright status \u2014 are facing scrutiny in several ongoing lawsuits."

            "article_content": "The stock price of FBN Holdings Plc, on Monday, fell by 5.63 per cent on the floor of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) as investors traded the stock of the oldest financial institution in Nigeria with caution.\n\nThe stock, which opened for trading at N30.20 per share, depreciated by N1.70 per share or 5.63 per cent to close at N28.50 per share on the Exchange.\n\nMarket operators attributed the downtrend recorded by the stock to investors\u2019 negative reaction to the dispute between First Bank, which is the mainstay of FBH Holdings Plc and General Hydrocarbons Limited (GHL) over a $225 million loan.\n\nAccording to stock traders, investors are adopting caution regarding the FBN Holding shares, awaiting the final outcome of the dispute, noting that this may mark the beginning of a continuous slide the shares.\n\nContrary to claims of alleged debt to First Bank of Nigeria (FBN) Plc, the management of the GHL, which cited several agreements between it and FBN, explained that there was a subsisting moratorium pending the commercial oil production.\n\nAlso, GHL said there was a Federal High Court judgement in its favour, adding further that FBN\u2019s claim of indebtedness, especially in the media space was \u201cmisleading and malicious\u201d.\n\nReferencing a January 10/11 publications in the media, including the social media wherein a \u201cFederal High Court in Lagos was reported to have frozen the accounts of GHL in all financial institutions in Nigeria and restrained the banks from releasing funds to the company owned by Mr. Nduka Obaigbena, the Chairman of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group \u201cOver alleged outstanding indebtness amounting to $225,802,379.79m to First Bank,\u201d GHL\u2019s Director of Strategy and Operations, Abdelmuizz Bello, stressed that the claims of FBN were untrue and misleading.\n\nAccording to Bello, the oil firm entered into a legally binding, enforceable Subrogation Agreement with First Bank on May 29, 2021.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, FBN was to fund GHL\u2019s exploration, production and development of OML 120 in exchange for sharing profit from oil proceeds from the OML in a 50:50 ratio after statutory payments and taxes over 8 years.\n\nBello explained that the FBN 50 per cent share would then be used to pay down its non-performing loans of about $718 million, which was discounted to $600m to resolve its solvency issues therefrom.\n\n\u201cIn its quest to stay afloat, the FBN loan was sold at $600million as an Eligible Banking Asset (EBA), with comfort from GHL. The FBN then collected the cash from Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) with which they rebuilt the bank without meeting GHL\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cThe FBN non-performing loan arose from FBN\u2019s unsecured and reckless lending to Atlantic Energy under separate Strategic Alliance arrangements, in which GHL had no nexus to or connection with.\n\n\u201cThe agreements made it clear that the Non-Performing Loan had nothing to do with GHL beyond the fact that 50% of profits from OML 120 due to FBN under the Subrogation Agreement will be used by FBN to settle the hole created in its books by the Non-Performing Loan (NPL).\n\n\u201cFor clarity, Atlantic Energy operated OMLs 26, 30, 34 and 42 \u2013 very different from GHL\u2019s OML 120,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Director of Strategy and Operations at GHL claimed that the agreements signed with the oil company enabled FBN to return to good standing because instead of declaring a loan loss of N302Bn at the then exchange rate, the signing of the Tripartite agreement with GHL enabled FBN to declare a profit of N151Bn ($377.5million) for the year ending December 31, 2021.\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nFollow us on:"

            "article_content": "Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Google had less than 90% of the online search market share for the last three months of 2024.\n\nThe last time that this happened was in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nThe statistics show that Google\u2019s competitors, such as Bing, benefited from the slight trend shift.\n\nInstead of saying we\u2019ll search online for something, we say we\u2019ll Google it. That\u2019s how synonymous the search engine of the US tech giant has become with looking something up online, and this is reflected in Google\u2019s market share. Over 90% of online searches in the last decade were conducted on Google Search, but a surprising trend change suggests that the balance of power might just be starting to shift.\n\nAs reported by Search Engine Land, statistics from Statcounter show that Google\u2019s global search market share dropped below 90% for each of the last three months. Specifically, it was 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.73% in December.\n\nOver 89% is still a commanding grip on the market, but what\u2019s most interesting about this development is that it\u2019s the first time Google has failed to hold a 90% market share in a three-month period since the first quarter of 2015 \u2014 almost exactly 10 years earlier.\n\nWhile you might assume that ChatGPT snaffled up some of Google\u2019s custom, the statistics indicate that the traditional search engine competitors benefited most from this trend change. The information is limited, but it appears that Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo! all got a slight boost. Bing was second in terms of market share in December, albeit with just under 4% of online searches.\n\nA potential shift in customer focus wouldn\u2019t be great news for Google, although there could be a silver lining. The firm remains embroiled in a long-running and high-profile antitrust case, with the Department of Justice accusing Google of monopolistic behavior. Part of Google\u2019s defense has been to point out that users have a choice and are free to exercise it. These statistics could add alittle extra weight to that argument.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

            "article_content": "Putin is considering taking drastic measures to save the economy\n\nVladimir Putin is reportedly considering proposals to freeze Russian bank accounts and introduce food rationing in an attempt to prevent an economic collapse. Russians have been hit hard by rising interest rates and food inflation that has seen prices for staple items explode. Potato prices rose by almost 95% between November 2023 and 2024, while butter shot up by 36.5%. The steep increase in food has led to a spate of robberies from supermarkets and grocery stores around the country, most notably for butter.\n\nMeanwhile, interest rates stand at a record high of 21%, heaping huge pressure on companies over-leveraged on previously cheap bank loans.\n\nREAD MORE: Russia in flames as Ukraine launches devastating attacks on Putin\n\nRussia is facing a potential banking collapse\n\nThe worsening economic outlook has forced the Kremlin into considering drastic proposals to stem the crisis. Some of the measures up for consideration include preventing Russians withdrawing their deposits from banks and issuing food cards, according to the Telegram Channel General SVR. \"Many members of the Politburo agree that the freeze is necessary, but they are in no hurry to introduce this measure and are trying to postpone the adoption of the final decision as much as possible,\" the channel reported. \"On the other hand, they cannot miss the critical moment when this measure ceases to be effective and the crisis goes according to the worst scenario, the end of which will be the 'collapse of the financial system' of the country. \"We have already reported that the Russian leadership is going to block bank deposits, exchanging deposits for bank shares and prohibiting the sale of these shares for a year. \"Food cards are on the way and a decision on this issue will be made on the weekend.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson declined to identify the channel's sources, citing personal security, but said they had \"complete confidence\" in them. An analysis carried out by a former Morgan Stanley investment banker has highlighted that the Russian economy could face a corporate and banking collapse with its continued military spending. Putin approved a record-breaking defence budget, setting aside 32.5 percent of the government's total spending for 2025, worth US$126 billion. Craig Kennedy said Russia has followed a two-track strategy to fund its war via its defence budget expenditures as well as an off-budget plan of similar size enabled by a law enacted on February 25, 2022, which compels Russian banks to give preferential loans to military-related businesses.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "In the evolving landscape of cloud computing, multi-tenant architecture has emerged as a pivotal framework for designing scalable and efficient Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. Shinu Pushpan, an expert in scalable cloud solutions, offers a detailed exploration of this transformative architecture, emphasizing its critical role in enabling resource sharing and ensuring data isolation. This article delves into the innovative aspects of multi-tenancy and its application in modern software systems.\n\nUnderstanding Multi-Tenancy: The Core of Modern SaaS\n\nMulti-tenancy is a software design approach in which a single application instance serves multiple customers, or \u201ctenants,\u201d while maintaining strict data and configuration separation. This paradigm balances resource sharing with tenant isolation, allowing organizations to optimize infrastructure utilization without compromising data security. Compared to traditional single-tenant models, multi-tenancy significantly reduces costs and simplifies maintenance, making it a cornerstone of modern SaaS offerings.\n\nEvolving from Single-Tenant to Multi-Tenant Systems\n\nThe evolution from single-tenant to multi-tenant systems reflects the growing demand for cost-effective and scalable software solutions. Though highly customizable, single-tenant systems require dedicated resources for each client, leading to increased operational overhead. Multi-tenancy addresses these limitations by enabling shared infrastructure while maintaining logical data separation. This shift has redefined software deployment strategies, offering businesses a robust solution for managing diverse customer needs.\n\nEnhancing Scalability with Multi-Tenancy\n\nScalability is a defining feature of multi-tenant systems.

And not just one. A massive snake!\n\n\"We\u2019ve discovered that the largest snake species in the world, the green anaconda - as we all know it from the movies and all the stories about giant snakes - actually consists of two different species!\n\n\u201cThe green anacondas that occur in the northern part of their range in South America (including Venezuela, Suriname, and French Guyana) turn out to be a completely different species!\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Even though they look almost identical to the eye, the genetic difference between the two is 5.5%, and that is huge.\n\n\"To put this in perspective: humans and chimps are genetically different only about 2% from each other.\u201d\n\nThe professor couldn't believe that the discovered species was part of the largest in the world (Instagram/@freekvonk)\n\nVonk continued: \u201cThe biggest anaconda I've ever seen can be seen in the video, as thick as a car tire, eight meters long and over 200 kg heavy - with a head as big as my head. From total awe and admiration a 'monster'!\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve discovered a new species before, but that was a small snake from Australia. Now it's about a mythical and legendary animal!\n\n\"Definitely one of the highlights of my scientific career. Also because this snake can be found in the Amazon, a place that feels like home to me.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch Professor, who is also a TV presenter, used the discovery to highlight the impact of climate change on the area that it was found, saying that it was \u2018heavily under pressure from climate change and the ever-lasting deforestation of primary rainforest\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlready over a fifth of the Amazon has disappeared, that's more than 30x the area of the Netherlands.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe survival of these iconic giant snakes is inseparable to protecting their natural habitat. This study highlights how efficient we need to be on our largest tropical rainforest in the world.\u201d"

Bam Margera dives into the difficulties Margera has been through over the years, as the skateboarder and stunt performer has struggled with addiction.\n\nThe documentary claims that in 2021 Margera's family tried to have an intervention with him but he refused, and they sought help from Lima Jevremovic who became his guardian in June of that year.\n\nAdvert\n\nJevremovic ended up becoming the target of the #FreeBam movement which claimed her guardianship wasn't helping him, and she features prominently in the documentary trailer as she attempts to speak to Margera and is told to leave.\n\nAlso contributing to the documentary is Margera's Jackass co-star Steve-O, who has voiced concern for his friend on multiple occasions.\n\nA new documentary about Bam Margera has been made (Investigation Discovery)\n\nIn the documentary Steve-O said it had been 'hard to watch' Margera struggling with addiction, saying that back when they first met he 'wasn\u2019t interested in substance abuse at all' while Steve-O fought his demons on that front for years before going sober, but now the roles have been reversed.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"People love a comeback story so much, but is that point going to come or is he going to be dead first? I don\u2019t know,\" he said.\n\nMargera did have a close brush with death a couple of years ago as he appeared on Steve-O's Wild Ride! podcast to say that he 'basically was pronounced dead' on 8 December, 2022.\n\nMargera said he had 'gnarly Covid' and he suffered with 'four seizures' where he almost bit his tongue off and was placed on life support, with him spending several days in the hospital.\n\nSteve-O, who has had his own health scares, took Margera on tour with him for a while saying he'd been 'real f***ing worried about him' as he introduced his co-star onto the stage.\n\nAdvert\n\nSpeaking in the documentary, Steve-O said 'people love a comeback story' about Margera (Instagram/@steveo)\n\n\"It's become extremely uncomfortable to be braced for the news of your death, Bam,\" Steve-O said to bring Margera onto the stage.\n\n\"I've been bracing myself for that f***ing awful news and I can't stand it, man.\n\n\"So I wanted you to come on tour, stay close to me, see what's possible, help you put together an act of your own.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"You've got this arc. All these funny bits and jokes and stories. It all doesn't mean s**t if it doesn't have a happy ending where you f***ing come out the other end happy and healthy and a good father and f***ing thriving in your career. And that is what I want for you brother.\"\n\nSadly, on the last day of the tour things took a turn for the worse as the following morning Margera started posting criticism of Jackass star Johnny Knoxville and director Jeff Tremaine, with Steve-O saying that Margera 'admitted that it was because he was drunk'.\n\nIt would seem that Steve-O is hoping his friend gets that 'comeback story' he talked about, even if he's afraid of what might happen."

            "article_content": "Last month, on the night of Dec. 7, multiple pilots saw lights in the sky over the Willamette Valley.\n\nAs several outlets reported, an audio recording of air traffic control that went viral features alarm over the lights\u2019 strange movements among pilots of two commercial airliners, United Flight 1596 and Horizon Air Flight 2207, the latter of which had a pilot who reported having seen the same phenomenon \u201ca few times over the last month in the same area\u201d near Eugene.\n\nWhatever they were seeing, it wasn\u2019t showing up on air traffic control\u2019s radar. It was, however, appearing on the crash avoidance system of a small Life Flight plane, Medevac 1LF, heading toward North Bend. Its pilot, Joe Buley, gave the most detailed description:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way up high and one about at my altitude. Moving in\u2026like a corkscrew pattern. Moving at\u2026extreme speeds... It\u2019s a red circular shape and it keeps zipping out towards the ocean and then coming back in, about 20 miles or closer to us and then zips back out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe response from air traffic control: \u201cYou are cleared to maneuver as necessary\u2014a left or right to avoid the UFO out there.\u201d\n\nThis incident was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the first time anybody\u2019s reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. This isn\u2019t even the first time that a United Airlines flight has reported seeing something like this over the Pacific Northwest. The region has been an epicenter of postwar UFO sightings, with more people having reported sightings in Portland and Seattle than in any other metro area in the United States since 2000. (The U.S. government now designates such sightings as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d or UAPs.)\n\nIt was here that on June 24, 1947, an amateur pilot named Kenneth Arnold set off a national frenzy after he reported seeing \u201cnine saucerlike aircraft flying in formation\u201d above Southwest Washington while flying from Chehalis to Yakima. (Thus, like \u201cgrunge\u201d and \u201cvegan strip club,\u201d \u201cflying saucer\u201d became a product of the Pacific Northwest.) Ten days later, the crew of United Flight 105 reported a nearly identical experience while flying from Boise to Pendleton.\n\nIn 1950, an Oregon couple named Paul and Evelyn Trent took two pictures on their Kodak of a \u201cdisc-shaped object\u201d that supposedly hovered above their farm outside of McMinnville without emitting any sound. The pictures ended up in Life magazine and remain a point of contention between UFO skeptics and believers.\n\nIn the 75 years since, there\u2019ve been thousands of reported sightings across the Pacific Northwest. Regardless of personal opinions of such things, it\u2019s undeniable that during this time UFOs and little green men have embedded themselves into the cultural fabric of the region, another stitch alongside New Age crystal healers, Bigfoot true believers, and whatever it is that draws people to a full-size replica of Stonehenge on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge. McMinnville and Chehalis both now hold annual UFO festivals; the Royal Canadian Mint issues a coin commemorating a 1970 sighting in British Columbia.\n\nWhat happened last month over the valley, though, was different from anything else that\u2019s come before. The Dec. 7 incident represented legitimate documentation of multiple professional pilots seeing the same things and having the same reaction to them. In that audio recording, an unnamed pilot aboard Horizon Air Flight 2207 can be heard refuting what\u2019s become the standard explanation for what they saw\u2014satellites. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Starlink, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what that looks like.\u201d Buley, the pilot of Medevac 1LF, also doubts this explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen satellites\u2026stuff like that. This was definitely different,\u201d he told KEZI-TV. (WW reached out to Life Flight Network but was told that Buley and the rest of his crew have declined to speak further on the matter.)\n\nIt\u2019s all very strange. Perhaps the UFO believers are right after all. If they are, and this is a real thing, then the greatest story of all time has been playing out above our backyard. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing at all."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes.
