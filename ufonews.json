        "article_content": "F5ve have released their otherworldly new single \u2018UFO\u2019 today (October 17). Ahead of the song\u2019s release, the Japanese girl group spoke to NME about the story behind the new single, their remarkable social media presence and how they\u2019re bringing Japan\u2019s unique subcultures to the world.\n\n\u2018UFO\u2019 comes shortly after F5ve \u2013 originally known as SG5 \u2013 hit the big time with their May 2024 single \u2018Lettuce\u2019, a quirky but scathing diss track to a former lover that\u2019s since become a viral sensation on TikTok. Over a video call from Tokyo, the girl group told NME that \u2018UFO\u2019 tells the story of a girl who is exceptionally skilled at claw machines, which were popularised in Japan during the \u201970s and have since become mainstays at arcades around the world. \u201cThe people watching her start thinking, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s so good, she must be an alien\u2019,\u201d Kaede said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really fun and unique story.\u201d\n\nThe futuristic music video for \u2018UFO\u2019 was filmed in Akihabara \u2013 which member Miyuu describes as the \u201cstarting ground\u201d of Japan\u2019s idol scene \u2013 and finds the girl group performing inside a gacha ball, each of them caked in pale makeup and eerie all-white contact lenses. They soon arrive on earth disguised as humans, but their unnaturally large pupils, awkward movements and fascination with claw machines soon give them away as extraterrestrial beings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the US, the word \u2018UFO\u2019 makes people think of aliens, but in Japan, it brings to mind things like claw machines and gacha games,\u201d Miyuu said of their alien-like appearance in the music video, explaining that \u201cit\u2019s a playful word association that blends both Japanese and English\u201d which takes inspiration from UFO-related connotations in each language.\n\nDespite being a global-facing act, F5ve unanimously agree on the importance of showcasing Japanese culture in its truest form in their music and visuals. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to spark a revolution,\u201d said Rui, the youngest of the group. \u201cWe really love and have a lot of confidence in our music and our activities, and we are proud of who we are. We want to bring Japan to the world.\u201d\n\nTake their July single \u2018Underground\u2019, an energetic dance anthem about escaping from societal expectations. Its music video begins with scenes from Tokyo\u2019s busy subway network, with salarymen filing in and out of high-speed trains on their daily commutes. Tired of the monotony on the surface, they escape into the vibrant underground rave scene where they find their place in a sea of colourful outfits and neon lightsticks.\n\nRecommended\n\n\u201cI believe that we stand out because we\u2019re able to really incorporate Japanese culture [in our music] and represent it in an authentic way,\u201d said Sayaka, referencing the \u2018Underground\u2019 and \u2018UFO\u2019 visuals. \u201cI think something unique about us is that we are globally transmitting Japanese culture, which we don\u2019t think any other group is doing right now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kaede shared that the girl group \u201ctake pride\u201d in their Japanese roots. \u201cWe want to spread the best aspects of J-pop and Japanese culture to the world, and no girl group has really done that before. As representatives of Japan, we want to share our culture and show the real side of who we are to other countries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades, the Japanese music industry has been viewed as unusually insular. While a number of acts, especially in recent years, have managed to break through and find global success \u2013 such as YOASOBI, XG and ATARASHII GAKKO!, among others \u2013 few approach their careers with international audiences in mind, at least not the way their K-pop counterparts do. While those that do, Kaede added, seldom place Japanese culture at the forefront of their craft.\n\n\u201cThis might be something culturally embedded in Japanese people, but I think we aren\u2019t as confident in representing our culture and aren\u2019t aware of how much people overseas are interested in it,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so [some artists] might think that whenever they do something for overseas fans, the content has to be catered to them; the songs have to be in English, they have to do things that are already popular overseas.\u201d\n\nWhile chasing global trends might be a safer shot at success, F5ve are reluctant to do so at the expense of their identity. \u201cI think [following trends] ends up diluting the Japanese cultural aspect,\u201d said Kaede. Instead, they trust that their music will find the right audience while the rest of the world catches up. \u201c[We are] transmitting Japanese culture as it is [and] I think it has hit audiences that have always been interested in Japanese culture and music.\u201d\n\nA huge part of being an international facing group, F5ve shared, is the way they interact with fans on social media. While not every member of the act is fluent in English just yet, they have made it a point to bond with their audience, quickly picking up on popular internet slang and memes. This, in turn, has helped them gain a reputation for being one of the most authentic (and chronically online) J-pop acts around \u2013 and it\u2019s one they\u2019ve embraced whole-heartedly.\n\n\u201cThe reactions from overseas fans are really unique, and they always bring a lot of energy with their support,\u201d Kaede shared with an excited laugh. \u201cWhat stands out to me is how they comment things like \u2018Slay mother\u2019, \u2018Queen\u2019, \u2018Face economy, face card\u2019 to compliment us. Like, I have a bob now, so they said things like \u2018Your bob is fire! Your bob is bobbing!\u2019 to compliment my hairstyle. I find it so inspiring how they express it in such a creative way.\u201d\n\nRuri even joked about how the unfettered way they use social media \u2013 \u201cOur account has less official information than other groups, and we comment on a lot of fans\u2019 posts,\u201d she points out \u2013 has fans confused on whether the accounts really belong to the girl group. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t think it\u2019s an official account,\u201d she said.\n\nSocial media savvy aside, Ruri believes that much of F5ve\u2019s bond with their fans (called hi-5) is being \u201ctrue to ourselves\u201d. She explained: \u201cEven while we are doing these unique things, we love music and performing. So being honest, having confidence and expressing how much fun we are having. I think that translates directly to fans and creates a strong bond, which I hope will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nAlthough F5ve remained tight-lipped about what\u2019s to come for them, Rui shared her desire to release a catchy anime-inspired track down the line. \u201cAnd we want to sing about Japanese drinking culture,\u201d she added, to which the rest of the group exclaimed: \u201cWe love to drink!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say much yet, but if I could give a little hint, maybe 2025, there will be a big release from F5ve. We have many songs recorded, so please look forward to it,\u201d said Ruri. Wearing a bright smile, Kaede boldly declared: \u201c2025 might be the year of F5ve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot that we want to accomplish with the songs that we currently have. And so we hope that the fans and everyone can look forward to our activities next year and everything that we want to show to the world!\u201d"

        "article_content": "The Settings app of any smartphone is a nightmare we all have to deal with on a regular basis. I say that as a longtime iPhone user who still dreads going to the Settings app even after the big redesign in iOS 18. The equally important Control Center redesign makes it easier to access some of the key settings you interact with more frequently.\n\nThe same applies to Android, of course. The Settings app has too many menus to remember, so I usually resort to using the built-in search feature.\n\nBut what if AI could help with that? Samsung is reportedly designing an AI feature that might stop you from visiting the Settings app that often. Instead, Galaxy AI might detect your needs and adjust the settings automatically. That\u2019s the kind of useful AI feature we could all use on our smartphones.\n\nAccording to ETNews, Samsung is developing AI software that would customize the phone experience without the user having to open the Settings app. That doesn\u2019t mean the phone will lack a Settings app. After all, not all Galaxy phone buyers want to use Galaxy AI features.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how this new Galaxy AI feature would work. The report says that Samsung plans to improve the \u201cperformance of \u2018touch points\u2019 such as keyboards and cameras to enable the ability to predict what consumers want in advance.\u201d\n\nAs Android Authority points out, Samsung already lets you control some Settings with the Bixby assistant. But the new Galaxy AI feature above would be more sophisticated than that. Adjusting settings on the fly with minimal user interaction would be incredible.\n\nAs someone dying to see AI evolve on smartphones and computers to the point where I can reliably control the devices, apps, and app features via voice or text prompts, I\u2019d love it if the AI could adjust my settings in real time on its own. The AI would simply learn what I like and then adjust the settings without me having to do anything.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself here. It\u2019s unclear how this Settings-related feature would work on future Galaxy AI phones, and there\u2019s no release timeline estimate for it either. What\u2019s certain is that Samsung will want to demo new Galaxy AI abilities when the Galaxy S25 series launches in early January. AI will continue to be a big marketing point for all phones, including Samsung handsets."

        "article_content": "While most countries\u2019 lawmakers are still discussing how to put guardrails around artificial intelligence, the European Union is ahead of the pack, having passed a risk-based framework for regulating AI apps earlier this year.\n\nThe law came into force in August, although full details of the pan-EU AI governance regime are still being worked out \u2014 Codes of Practice are in the process of being devised, for example. But, over the coming months and years, the law\u2019s tiered provisions will start to apply on AI app and model makers so the compliance countdown is already live and ticking.\n\nEvaluating whether and how AI models are meeting their legal obligations is the next challenge. Large language models (LLM), and other so-called foundation or general purpose AIs, will underpin most AI apps. So focusing assessment efforts at this layer of the AI stack seem important.\n\nStep forward LatticeFlow AI, a spinout from public research university ETH Zurich, which is focused on AI risk management and compliance.\n\nOn Wednesday, it published what it\u2019s touting as the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, meaning it\u2019s sought to map regulatory requirements to technical ones, alongside an open source LLM validation framework that draws on this work \u2014 which it\u2019s calling Compl-AI (\u201ccompl-ai\u201d\u2026 see what they did there!).\n\nThe AI model evaluation initiative \u2014 which they also dub \u201cthe first regulation-oriented LLM benchmarking suite\u201d \u2014 is the result of a long-term collaboration between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Bulgaria\u2019s Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT), per LatticeFlow.\n\nAI model makers can use the Compl-AI site to request an evaluation of their technology\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the EU AI Act.\n\nLatticeFlow has also published model evaluations of several mainstream LLMs, such as different versions/sizes of Meta\u2019s Llama models and OpenAI\u2019s GPT, along with an EU AI Act compliance leaderboard for Big AI.\n\nThe latter ranks the performance of models from the likes of Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral against the law\u2019s requirements \u2014 on a scale of 0 (i.e. no compliance) to 1 (full compliance).\n\nOther evaluations are marked as N/A where there\u2019s a lack of data, or if the model maker doesn\u2019t make the capability available. (NB: At the time of writing there were also some minus scores recorded but we\u2019re told that was down to a bug in the Hugging Face interface.)\n\nLatticeFlow\u2019s framework evaluates LLM responses across 27 benchmarks such as \u201ctoxic completions of benign text,\u201d \u201cprejudiced answers,\u201d \u201cfollowing harmful instructions,\u201d \u201ctruthfulness,\u201d and \u201ccommon sense reasoning\u201d to name a few of the benchmarking categories it\u2019s using for the evaluations. So each model gets a range of scores in each column (or else N/A).\n\nAI compliance a mixed bag\n\nSo how did major LLMs do? There is no overall model score. So performance varies depending on exactly what\u2019s being evaluated \u2014 but there are some notable highs and lows across the various benchmarks.\n\nFor example there\u2019s strong performance for all the models on not following harmful instructions; and relatively strong performance across the board on not producing prejudiced answers \u2014 whereas reasoning and general knowledge scores were a much more mixed bag.\n\nElsewhere, recommendation consistency, which the framework is using as a measure of fairness, was particularly poor for all models \u2014 with none scoring above the halfway mark (and most scoring well below).\n\nOther areas, such as training data suitability and watermark reliability and robustness, appear essentially unevaluated on account of how many results are marked N/A.\n\nLatticeFlow does note there are certain areas where models\u2019 compliance is more challenging to evaluate, such as hot-button issues like copyright and privacy. So it\u2019s not pretending it has all the answers.\n\nIn a paper detailing work on the framework, the scientists involved in the project highlight how most of the smaller models they evaluated (\u2264 13B parameters) \u201cscored poorly on technical robustness and safety.\u201d\n\nThey also found that \u201calmost all examined models struggle to achieve high levels of diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that these shortcomings are primarily due to model providers disproportionally focusing on improving model capabilities, at the expense of other important aspects highlighted by the EU AI Act\u2019s regulatory requirements,\u201d they add, suggesting that as compliance deadlines start to bite LLM makes will be forced to shift their focus onto areas of concern \u2014 \u201cleading to a more balanced development of LLMs.\u201d\n\nGiven no one yet knows exactly what will be required to comply with the EU AI Act, LatticeFlow\u2019s framework is necessarily a work in progress. It is also only one interpretation of how the law\u2019s requirements could be translated into technical outputs that can be benchmarked and compared. But it\u2019s an interesting start on what will need to be an ongoing effort to probe powerful automation technologies and try to steer their developers toward safer utility.\n\n\u201cThe framework is a first step towards a full compliance-centered evaluation of the EU AI Act \u2014 but is designed in a way to be easily updated to move in lock-step as the Act gets updated and the various working groups make progress,\u201d LatticeFlow CEO Petar Tsankov told TechCrunch. \u201cThe EU Commission supports this. We expect the community and industry to continue to develop the framework towards a full and comprehensive AI Act assessment platform.\u201d\n\nSummarizing the main takeaways so far, Tsankov said it\u2019s clear that AI models have \u201cpredominantly been optimized for capabilities rather than compliance.\u201d He also flagged \u201cnotable performance gaps\u201d \u2014 pointing out that some high capability models can be on a par with weaker models when it comes to compliance.\n\nCyberattack resilience (at the model level) and fairness are areas of particular concern, per Tsankov, with many models scoring below 50% for the former area.\n\n\u201cWhile Anthropic and OpenAI have successfully aligned their (closed) models to score against jailbreaks and prompt injections, open source vendors like Mistral have put less emphasis on this,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd with \u201cmost models\u201d performing equally poorly on fairness benchmarks he suggested this should be a priority for future work.\n\nOn the challenges of benchmarking LLM performance in areas like copyright and privacy, Tsankov explained: \u201cFor copyright the challenge is that current benchmarks only check for copyright books. This approach has two major limitations: (i) it does not account for potential copyright violations involving materials other than these specific books, and (ii) it relies on quantifying model memorization, which is notoriously difficult.\n\n\u201cFor privacy the challenge is similar: The benchmark only attempts to determine whether the model has memorized specific personal information.\u201d\n\nLatticeFlow is keen for the free and open source framework to be adopted and improved by the wider AI research community.\n\n\u201cWe invite AI researchers, developers, and regulators to join us in advancing this evolving project,\u201d said professor Martin Vechev of ETH Zurich and founder and scientific director at INSAIT, who is also involved in the work, in a statement. \u201cWe encourage other research groups and practitioners to contribute by refining the AI Act mapping, adding new benchmarks, and expanding this open-source framework.\n\n\u201cThe methodology can also be extended to evaluate AI models against future regulatory acts beyond the EU AI Act, making it a valuable tool for organizations working across different jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

However, the model's availability seems to be extending beyond the latest flagship devices.\n\nLast week, the Imagen 3 model made its way to Gemini on the web and mobile, and it looks like the Pixel Studio app itself might be next in line to become available to more users.\n\nHints about the app's expansion to the 2023-released Pixel 8 series, including the later-released Pixel 8a, were first spotted by Android Authority, suggesting that a stub for the app can be found pre-installed on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a devices post the Android 15 update.\n\nThe same stub has also made its way to APK Mirror with the notes \"Pixel 8 pro update Android 15 includes this,\" suggesting that the placeholder was part of the major update, at least for Pixel 8 series users.\n\nThe stub is only 0.02MB in size, and considering that it is simply a placeholder for now, that makes sense. Trying to download and install it will only give you an \"app not installed as package appears to be invalid\" prompt. The stub's eventual purpose is to guide users to the Play Store to download the app it is filling in for, and in this case, that is the Pixel Studio app. However, that will only be possible when a Play Store listing for the app for the Pixel 8 series goes live.\n\nOlder Pixels get Pixel Studio hope\n\nScreenshots highlighting the Pixel Studio app's old and new feature flag list.\n\nElsewhere, another hint pointing towards the app's availability on older devices is the removal of a feature flag from the stub's build. For reference, all previous versions of the Pixel Studio app have contained a com.google.android.feature.PIXEL_2024_EXPERIENCE flag (left screenshot in the image above), which prevents Pixel devices older than 2024 from being able to run the app.\n\nThe same flag is absent in the stub, suggesting that older Pixel devices might soon be able to run the app. It's worth noting that the Pixel 8a is an anomaly here, considering that it technically launched in 2024. However, it still belongs to the '8 series,' and its compatibility with the app will likely be bundled with 2023's core models.\n\nIt is currently unclear if models older than 2023's Pixel 8 series will gain access to the Pixel Studio app any time soon."

Nov. 1.\n\nThe state set a record for the first day of early voting, Chief Operations Officer Gabriel Sterling posted.\n\n\"2pm Early Vote Update we are just piling on the record 1st Day turnout. Already 187,973 votes have been cast, so we are looking at blowing by 200,000 votes cast in person today. Hats off to our counties and the voters who are turning out. HUGE!\u201d Sterling posted on X.\n\nThe previous first-day record was set in 2020 when there were 136,000 votes cast.\n\nThe commencement of Georgia's three-week period for early voting comes as the Georgia state election board recently passed sweeping new changes to the state's election system, including how votes are tabulated.\n\nLee County poll workers Debbie Jack and Donna Mathis practice counting ballots as part of new election hand count rules by the Georgia State Election Board, in Leesburg, Ga., Oct. 2, 2024. Becca Milfeld/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOver the summer, the Republican-controlled State Election Board passed a rule requiring all ballots to be hand counted on election night, prompting legal challenges and pushback from both major parties as officials warned about potential delays in reporting results.\n\nGeorgia's Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, told the board it was operating outside of its authority, and warned that the rule changes were likely not lawful. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign joined a lawsuit from Georgia Democrats suing to block the last-minute rule changes.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr. scheduled hearings this week to hear about the lawsuits challenging the new rules, including the hand-counting provision and new rules that expand access to poll watchers.\n\nSupporters attend a \"Get Out the Vote\" Community Fish Fry at the Agricultural Technology Conference Center where former President Bill Clinton will speak as he campaigns for Vice President Kamala Harris in Fort Valley, Ga., Oct. 13, 2024. Logan Cyrus/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnother prominent Republican in the state, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also promised that while Georgia law mandates certification on Nov. 12, he raised concerns about potential false claims that could arise as potential reporting delays linger.\n\n\"Everything we've been fighting for since 2020 has been to give the voter quicker, you know, responses, quicker results, and that's why we're going to post all the early votes by 8 p.m.,\" Raffensperger said in an interview with the Washington Post on Monday.\n\n\"Well, this now drags on for the final 30 percent until one, two, three, or four o'clock in the morning,\" he said. \"Really, that just becomes a breeding ground for conspiracy theories, and so we don't support it, but the judge will make that determination. We'll find out. We'll follow the law.\"\n\nGeorgia voters will already face changes this election cycle due to the state's Election Integrity Act, SB 202, passed in 2021, which adds more verification for voters requesting absentee ballots, limits the amount of ballot drop box locations, and, in one of the most controversial rule changes, the law now makes it a misdemeanor to give away food or water within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of a voter in line.\n\nAdvocates of the rule change argue that those rule changes will provide more transparency to the election process and have been set in place well before November's election so poll workers and voters have had time to understand the changes.\n\nHowever, Democrats have repeatedly attempted to block provisions of the law, claiming that the strict rules on identification will disenfranchise voters and criminalize portions of the election process.\n\nCandidates are educating their voters about the new voting landscape in Georgia, emphasizing how crucial turnout will be in the state.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton speaks on behalf of the Harris/Walz campaign outside a Democratic campaign office in Columbus, Ga., Oct. 14, 2024. Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton spent time in middle Georgia on Sunday and Monday, focusing on mobilizing supporters in rural areas for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"They've been able to make it easier for states that agree with them to make it harder for people to vote, but not impossible, and Georgia has more experience than almost any other state in climbing those barriers and breaching them,\" he said at a campaign stop in Columbus on Monday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will mark the start of early voting in Georgia with a series of campaign stops on Tuesday. He will first tape a Fox News town hall focused on women's issues before delivering remarks at a rally in Atlanta.\n\nThe Harris campaign is deploying surrogates around the state on Tuesday and the vice president is expected to visit the state later this week as polling shows an extremely tight race in the Peach State -- which helped secure President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 after it narrowly flipped in favor of Democrats.\n\nAccording to polling forecasts from 538, a victory in Georgia for either campaign would be pivotal to ensuring an electoral victory, which would give Trump around a 3-in-4 shot at winning the presidency and Harris about a 9-in-10 chance of becoming the next president.\n\nThat polling is reflective of how both campaigns have been prioritizing Georgia.\n\n\"If we lose Georgia, we lose the whole thing and our country goes to hell. Because we can't have her be president of the United States. She's grossly incompetent. We can't let that happen,\" Trump said during a rally in Atlanta in August.\n\nTrump in recent weeks has publicly mended his relationship with Brian Kemp, the state's popular Republican governor, after furiously lashing out at him after Kemp refused to give in to Trump's demands in 2020 to prevent state officials from certifying the election.\n\nEarlier this month, the two appeared together for the first time since 2020 when Trump toured the state after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of Georgia.\n\nHarris has campaigned on the issue of abortion in Georgia, using the state's six-week abortion ban and Trump's role in overturning Roe vs. Wade to appeal to suburban women -- a key voter bloc.\n\n\"Now we know that at least two women, and those are only the stories we know here in the state of Georgia, died, died because of a Trump abortion ban,\" Harris said last month after a ProPublica report tied the deaths of two Georgia women to the state's restrictive ban.\n\n\"This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade in his own words, quote, 'I did it, and I'm proud to have done it.' He is proud, proud that women are done.\"\n\nABC News' Olivia Rubin contributed to this report."

        "article_content": "In this article, we will explore the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nThe Software Industry: An Analysis\n\nThe software market is experiencing robust growth, driven by various trends and technological advancements. According to Precedence Research, the global software market size reached $659.17 billion in 2023\u200b. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% during 2024 \u2013 2034 to reach $2.24 trillion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. In 2023, the North American region led the software market, holding a substantial share of 44%. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.\n\nA key factor influencing the market is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being integrated into software solutions to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. A study from Salesforce reveals that 85% of IT leaders expect AI to boost developer productivity over the next three years. This expectation underscores the growing recognition of AI\u2019s role in streamlining workflows and optimizing software performance.\n\nAnother significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based software. Companies are migrating from traditional on-premises solutions to cloud services due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This transition allows businesses to access applications remotely and across various devices, which has become crucial in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nThe 2024 AlgoSec State of Network Security report highlights a notable shift towards multi-cloud environments.
