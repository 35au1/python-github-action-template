        "article_content": "This September played host to several quirky and charming indie games that may have slipped under your radar. Here's the best of the best of what we played.\n\nIf you thought that this year was already jam-packed for huge AAA releases, the month of September just rolled in to prove that the same is very much true for indie gems. This isn\u2019t even taking into account the UFO 50-shaped elephant in the room, which justifiably impressed as a generous collection of retro style games. Disclaimer: I haven't had around to checking out UFO 50 myself yet, hence why it won\u2019t be appearing on this list. However, if you\u2019re looking for an eclectic selection of smaller-scale titles to enjoy between the heavy-hitters, I\u2019ve got you covered with the cream of the indie game crop (at least from what I played).\n\nSeptember 2024 really did have something for everyone, whether you\u2019re into 16-bit beat-em-up tributes or throwback survival horror. Interestingly there were less blockbuster sequels compared to the best indie games of August roundup, meaning that there was a lot of truly new indie game experiences to check out. Let\u2019s get into it\u2026\n\nThe Plucky Squire\n\nKicking us off is the undeniably charming and whimsical The Plucky Squire, which was a day one release on PS Plus in the Extra and Premium September lineup. A seemingly ordinary top-down action-adventure in the style of classic The Legend of Zelda entries, expectations are suddenly flipped (literally) as soon as hero Jot is given the power to jump off the page of his storybook home. What follows is a creative take on the format that sees you switching words to change the world around you, frequently hop from a 2D to 3D plane, and indulge in various kinds of gameplay styles, all in the effort of taking down the evil wizard behind it all. The Plucky Squire\u2019s reality-switching premise might lack a little lustre in the later hours, but it still serves as a near-perfect papercraft journey full of colour and heart.\n\nGrapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines\n\nThe first Grapple Dog swiftly became one of my favourite indie pixelated platformers ever when it released back in 2022. That\u2019s why I was pleased to see this sequel do brilliant justice to that already swing-tastic original, featuring even more levels and puzzles to navigate through, more beautiful GBA pixel art to bask in, and an all-new Grapple Dog buddy in Luna to play as. Luna\u2019s ability to shoot from afar makes for a noticeably distinct adventure compared to Pablo\u2019s initial solo outing, and Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines electing to split its levels between these two playstyles ensures that exploring the cosmos is never boring. The core grapple-swing mechanic fortunately also returns in full force in what is easily a follow-up that proves two dogs can be better than one.\n\nGI Joe: Wrath of Cobra\n\nImage: indie.io) indie.io)\n\nSomehow we\u2019ve ended up in a golden age for pixelated beat-em-up translations of kids shows from the 80s and 90s. The trend properly kicked off when TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge arrived on the scene, which will soon be followed later this year with the equally-as-hyped Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita\u2019s Rewind. If you can\u2019t wait until then, though, GI Joe: Wrath of Cobra launched this month to fill this nostalgia-shaped hole, letting you play as the likes of Duke, Roadblock, and yes, Snake Eyes as part of a classic beat-em-up adventure. The pixel art is surprisingly gorgeous, and the super moves for all four characters each have a distinct flavour to make every playthrough feel slightly unique. This being a GI Joe game you better believe there\u2019s guns to pick up and use too, all of which come in handy in this surprisingly excellent 16-bit translation of the gung-ho toy brand.\n\nYars Rising\n\nYou needn\u2019t look far these days to find a half-decent Metroidvania on the indie games market. Developer WayForward has spent decades perfecting the art of making them, however, hence why its reinvention of the Atari\u2019s classic Yars series probably looks and plays as well as it does. Set in a noticeably cyberpunk future, you play as the titular hacker aiming to take down a corporate entity from within. There\u2019s the usual suite of powers to hunt down and acquire, of course, but setting Yars Rising apart is the way it reimagines the classic sprite-shooting gameplay of Yars' Revenge as hacking mini-games. Is Yars Rising as faithful a Metroidvania as they come? Yes, but it gained extra points as soon as I fought a boss called Missile Commander. Need I say more?\n\nChains of Fury Vol. 1\n\nHeavily inspired by the art of Hellboy\u2019s Mike Mignola and fast-paced firing of 90s boomer shooters, Chains of Fury Vol. 1 shoves both these aspects into a blender to result in one of the most distinct-looking indie FPS titles of the year. Such eye-grabbing graphics are backed up by fun and ferocious gameplay, where you\u2019re encouraged to blast through each destructible cell-shaded level by maintaining the highest kill combo. Using the environment ups the chances of improving your killing flow, as does engaging what\u2019s called Rage Mode to keep the momentum going. Though controller support on PC would be nice, and melee combat is rough around the edges, Chains of Fury\u2019s comic book aesthetic makes it worth a look for those who aren\u2019t yet sick of ripping and tearing in the style of classic Doom.\n\nBeyond Galaxyland\n\nImage: United Label) United Label)\n\nStar Wars meets The Last Starfighter (and a whole host of other coming-of-age 80s movies) in Beyond Galaxyland, an unabashed throwback to classic turn-based RPGs that comes touting a pretty unique art style. It\u2019s pixel-based, of course, but your perspective of this sci-fi meets fantasy world being projected at a slant gives each varied location you visit an otherworldly, almost diorama-like feel. You play as Doug, a human pulled into absurdity who must partner up with his pet guinea pig and blast across the stars in the hopes of saving his family back home on Earth. Mix in a pokemon-like creature-collecting mechanic, multiple planets to explore, and an eclectic selection of quirky side characters to fall in love with, and Beyond Galaxyland truly is the real deal for any player seeking a sci-fi RPG with heart.\n\nDeathsprint 66\n\nDeathsprint 66 is one of those fast-paced games that will truly only make sense once you feel it in your hands. As odd as it might seem, the best way to describe it is probably \u2018Tron meets Mario Kart\u2019, where the neon-drenched visuals are matched by brilliant sprint-boosting gameplay that feels just as addicting as when you achieve the perfect drift in the Nintendo Wii\u2019s version of Rainbow Road. For this reason, death initially comes easy in Deathsprint 66. Go figure! However, when you do fall into that flow state of endlessly surging, drifting, wall running, leaning, and grinding on top of maintaining a solid momentum, it makes breezing past the finish line worth it. There are a series of challenge modes that can be played single-player, but Deathsprint 66\u2019s brand of on-foot racing chaos is best enjoyed online with others.\n\nHollowbody\n\nIf you can\u2019t wait for Bloober Team\u2019s Silent Hill 2 remake to launch on PC and PS5 next month, then you\u2019ll be sure to scratch that PS2-style survival horror itch in Hollowbody. Besides, it\u2019s made even scarier by the fact that it takes place entirely within a wet and dreary interpretation of the UK (imagine that) albeit one set in the far future where the country has been ravaged by a virus. Unfortunately for Mica, it\u2019s her mission to venture inside the exclusion zone to try and track down a friend, solving puzzles, managing regularly depleted resources, and surviving all kinds of nightmares in order to get the job done. Hollowbody does an excellent job establishing the vibe of early 2000s horror games, setting in an oppressive mood that never once failed to keep me gripped and on edge.\n\nThe Holy Gosh Darn\n\nImage: Yogscast Games) Yogscast Games)\n\nI didn\u2019t know I needed such an irreverent and funny interpretation of the afterlife until I sat down to play The Holy Gosh Darn towards the end of the month. Playing as an angel Cassiel, you must try to prevent the invasion of an army of hellish phantoms, with your time-travelling mission to save heaven playing out much like your typical interactive adventure game; only it\u2019s packed with songs, quirky characters, and countless ways to influence events using your trusty time-rewinding device. The voice work is stellar, script on point, and I genuinely haven\u2019t laughed at a satirical game this much since, well, Thank Goodness You\u2019re Here last month. Honestly, interactive adventure games are rarely as witty or as slick as the Holy Gosh Darn, so genre fans should absolutely pay it some attention.\n\nSelfloss\n\nPonderous puzzle games with a not-so-subtle narrative metaphor underlining it all can be a dime a dozen these days. However, every so often one comes along with a unique setting and premise that I simply can\u2019t avoid. Selfloss was definitely an example of an indie game doing this to me this month, not least due to its distinctly Slavic-inspired stylings and visuals that help set it apart. You play as an elderly healer who endeavours to rid the world of an ailment by undertaking an epic journey by boat. One that sees him save the spirit of various dying creatures around him, such as giant turtles, whales, and the like. Puzzle-solving using his staff\u2019s beam of light is made excellent use of in each chapter, especially when you\u2019re required to temporarily separate the two. What it all amounts to is kept purposely obscure, but Selfloss kept me enraptured for the short time it lasted.\n\nSpecial mention: TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge \u2013 Radical Reptiles DLC\n\nFirst added to PS Plus Extra and Premium lineup back in June 2023, TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge is the gift that keeps on giving. Not only was the original 2022 game already a perfect encapsulation of the 80s TV show and the various arcade beat-em-ups of that era, but it continues to be supported via post-launch updates excellently. First came the Dimension Shock DLC that introduced Karai and Usagi, and now this month we received Radical Reptiles. Though not quite as feature-packed as the one that came before, playing as classic characters Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa gives players yet another excuse to jump into this beautiful looking and playing beat-em-up with all-new animations and character art. Complete with a remixed soundtrack from the likes of Anamanaguchi and Button Masher, I\u2019ll never deny of having more ways to prevent Shredder from getting his revenge."

        "article_content": "Pascagoula, Miss., is known for building Navy ships, but city officials say it's actually famous for two other things.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s the birthplace of Jimmy Buffett. The city put up a historical marker outside his childhood home.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the second thing: space aliens. The city put up a marker for them too.\n\n\u201cIt was the evening of October 11, 1973 when two local shipyard workers went fishing,\u201d the marker says, at the edge of the Pascagoula River.\n\nThe sign says Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker spotted a football-shaped craft, which took them aboard.\n\n\u201cInside the craft, Hickson was examined by a robotic eye, then both men were deposited back on the river bank and the space ship shot away,\u201d the marker says. Stamped at the bottom is the seal of the city of Pascagoula and the Jackson County Historical and Genealogical Society.\n\nMayor Jay Willis says when it came to writing this marker, authorities saw no reason to hedge.\n\n\u201cBecause these two guys had the same story of what happened, how it happened for the rest of their lives,\u201d Willis explains. \u201cThis marker is going to be there for a long, long time. It\u2019s a lasting tribute \u2026 to what occurred right here in Pascagoula.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way to really know what happened that night in 1973, when the men waded headfirst into one of humanity\u2019s greatest mysteries: Are we alone?\n\nBut the marker is now one of at least 15 that say, without hesitation, that aliens have come to visit Earth.\n\nThey join more than 180,000 other historical markers dotting the country\u2019s landscape, and NPR found they wouldn\u2019t be the first to claim something that may, or may not, be true.\n\nThere\u2019s a marker in Massachusetts that claims the town was once home to a real, live wizard. New York has a marker about a ghost that plays the fiddle on a bridge in the moonlight.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut locals say Pascagoula\u2019s alien marker is no tourist stunt.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be known for something, why the heck not?\u201d says Rebecca Davis, who helped write the marker when she ran the development group Main Street Pascagoula.\n\nAt first, she says, most people in town didn\u2019t believe the men\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cThey thought they were just off their rockers,\u201d Davis says, standing next to the wooded area by the river where the men said they were abducted. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the Bible Belt, you know? Like, my grandma told me, 'Girl, hush, we don\u2019t talk about that stuff.'\u201d\n\nLaura Sullivan / NPR / NPR Rebecca Davis, who used to run Main Street Pascagoula, helped write the marker. She says people today are more open to the idea that the story could be true.\n\nBut as time passed, Davis says, the feeling changed. There was also a recording of the men, who have since died, talking about their experience that believers say gives it credibility.\n\n\u201cPeople back then, I really think they wanted to believe, but they were scared to believe,\u201d she says, \u201cand now\u2019s a different time, a different age, and more openness.\u201d\n\nThat openness has spread across American society. Half of Americans now believe that military reports of UFOs are likely evidence of intelligent life outside Earth, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nBut openness is different than etching facts into a bronze or acrylic plaque and staking it into the dirt.\n\nScott and Suzanne Ramsey put up one of the nation\u2019s first alien markers in 1999 in the high desert near Aztec, N.M., where they say a spaceship crashed in 1948.\n\n\u201cWe welded up a metal stand and had a local trophy shop do the engraving,\u201d Scott Ramsey says. They replaced it with a new version in 2007.\n\n\u201cI think it kind of lends credibility to the fact that something did happen there,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s always been difficult to argue with historical markers. That\u2019s part of their allure. Rewriting them means taking the whole sign down and starting over.\n\nAnd that permanence has made alien markers an attraction. The Aztec visitor center now hands out maps and hosts the Alien Run mountain bike race.\n\nUFO enthusiasts say they pass around road trip ideas. Start in Lincoln, N.H., where a marker says Betty and Barney Hill were abducted. Head to Franklin, Ky., where another describes how a National Guard pilot died chasing a UFO. On to Shiloh, Ill., which tells of a \u201cconfirmed UFO sighting.\u201d\n\nFascination with extraterrestrials isn\u2019t new, but what was once left to low-budget sci-fi movies has taken on a new seriousness. There\u2019s declassified military reports, even interest from Congress.\n\nStill, none of it has amounted to much actual proof, and even as Frank Drake pointed the first radio telescope at the stars in 1960, and far more sophisticated probes have been searching for the last 20 years, those efforts have so far been met with silence.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped cities from stamping alien markers with official emblems and crests.\n\nOn a recent afternoon in Pascagoula, Thearon Ephriam and his uncle, David Ephriam, took a break from fishing to read the sign.\n\n\u201cAs dusk fell a buzzing sound alerted them to a football-shaped craft hovering behind them,\u201d David Ephriam read from the sign as he started to chuckle. \u201cAin't this something?\u201d he asked.\n\nLaura Sullivan / NPR / NPR Pascagoula\u2019s alien marker is now one of at least 15 that claim extraterrestrials have come to Earth.\n\nThearon Ephriam pointed to the city of Pascagoula logo. \u201cThey put a whole stand up,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cGotta be some truth in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have to be aware when we come out here,\u201d David said.\n\nThearon raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf we see a football-shaped craft we know to get low.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf one comes up behind you and looks like a football,\u201d David laughed, \u201cdon\u2019t look back, dive.\u201d\n\nHowever future researchers may view these signs years from now, even UFO enthusiasts wouldn\u2019t argue with that advice.\n\nCan't see the graphics in this story?

        "article_content": "Roughly a month ago, Michael Sayman realized he could finally build the app he\u2019d been thinking about for years: a social network where everyone but you is an AI bot. Large language models are finally good enough and cheap enough that the experience might actually feel social and useful, and not like a gimmick or a game. And so, after years of waiting and months of testing the latest models, Sayman got to work.\n\nThe app he built is called SocialAI, and it has become something of a viral phenomenon since it launched. (All he\u2019d tell me is that it was downloaded 20,000 times in the first couple of days \u2014 but says the number has gone up substantially since then.) Some people thought it seemed fun and useful; other people thought it felt deeply dystopian. Is a social network still a social network, they wondered, if you\u2019re the only human present? Still others thought the whole thing was an art project of sorts, a social commentary on the state of the online world.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, Sayman says it\u2019s really all of the above. But most of all, it\u2019s an attempt to build an entirely new way to interact with AI models. Instead of a chatbot, which tries to deliver you the single best response to your prompt, SocialAI offers you options and filters in the form of replies. When you respond to a bot, or favorite a reply, that teaches the model more about what you\u2019re looking for \u2014 and lets you choose your own AI adventure instead of just hoping the model gets it right.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, we\u2019ve had social media giants iterating relentlessly,\u201d Sayman says, \u201cwith all the data in the world, to try and perfect an interface where people can interact with as many people and points of view as possible, right?\u201d SocialAI looks like Twitter or Threads, he says, not to trick you into forgetting all the reply guys are AI but because we all know exactly how social networks work. \u201cIt\u2019s not social for the sake of the social network, but social for the sake of social interface.\u201d\n\nSocialAI is still in its very early stages, which you\u2019ll be able to tell immediately from the quality of some of the replies. Still, Sayman says he\u2019s already seeing encouraging usage and feedback \u2014 and he has lots of ideas about where to take the app next. The future of AI probably isn\u2019t a text box, but it also probably isn\u2019t exactly a Twitter clone, either. We talk through some of the features he\u2019s planning on launching, how the interface might change over time, why he thinks of social network design as the new skeuomorphism, and whether there\u2019s a business in SocialAI over time.\n\nUltimately, Sayman doesn\u2019t think of SocialAI as a dystopian nightmare. The truly dystopian thing, he says, is the current state of things, in which you never know who\u2019s human and who\u2019s not, and everyone\u2019s just posting through it all the time on increasingly dangerous and problematic platforms. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to replace the human to human connection,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help people find a way to have a secondary option when that human isn\u2019t around for them, so that they don\u2019t have to rush to social media.\u201d Next time you need to vent, he hopes you might decide to tell the bots instead. They\u2019ll be there for you."

        "article_content": "For years, Silicon Valley and Wall Street have questioned Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to invest tens of billions of dollars into Reality Labs. This week, Meta\u2019s wearables division unveiled a prototype of its Orion smart glasses, a form factor the company believes one day could replace the iPhone. That idea sounds crazy\u2026 but maybe a little less crazy than it did a week ago.\n\nOrion is a prototype headset that combines augmented reality, eye and hand tracking, generative AI, and a gesture-detecting wristband. Through micro LED projectors and silicon carbide lenses (which are quite expensive), Meta seems to have cracked a longstanding AR display challenge. The idea is that you can look through Orion \u2014 you know, like a pair of glasses \u2014 but also see application windows projected on the lenses that appear as if they\u2019re embedded in the world around you. Ideally, you can use your hands, eyes, and voice to navigate the environment.\n\nThe Orion smart glasses need a wristband and wireless compute puck to work. (Meta) Image Credits: Meta\n\nThough to be clear, Meta\u2019s Orion smart glasses are chunkier than your average readers, reportedly cost $10,000 a pop, and won\u2019t be available for sale anytime soon. We\u2019re talking years from now. All the technology in Orion is relatively young, and all of it needs to get cheaper, better, and smaller to work its way into a pair of smart glasses you can buy at the mall. Zuckerberg says the company has already been working on Orion for 10 years, but there\u2019s still no path to a sellable product.\n\nHowever, Meta is hardly the only company trying to put a smartphone replacement on your face.\n\nThis month, Snap unveiled its latest generation of Spectacles smart glasses, which are larger than Orion and have a more limited field of view. One former Snap engineer called the latest Spectacles \u201cobviously bad\u201d \u2014 though you can actually order them. Google hinted during its I/O conference in May that it, too, is working on a pair of smart glasses, perhaps a revamp of its failed Google Glass experiment from last decade. Apple is reportedly working on AR glasses that sound a lot like Orion. And we can\u2019t rule out Jony Ive\u2019s new startup, LoveFrom, which he recently confirmed is working on an AI wearable with OpenAI (though we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re glasses, a pin, or something else entirely).\n\nWhat\u2019s brewing is a race among Big Tech\u2019s richest companies to create a sleek pair of smart glasses that can do everything your smartphone can \u2014 and hopefully something more. Meta\u2019s prototype made two things clear: there is something there, but we\u2019re not \u201cthere\u201d yet.\n\nThese devices are a notable departure from the Quest virtual reality headsets Meta has been pushing for years now, and Apple\u2019s Vision Pro. There\u2019s a lot of similar technology involved, like eye-tracking and hand tracking, but they feel completely different to use. VR headsets are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and make people nauseous from staring at the displays. Sunglasses and eyeglasses, on the other hand, are relatively pleasant to wear and millions of Americans use them everyday.\n\nTo Zuckerberg\u2019s credit, he\u2019s been pushing the eyewear form factor for quite a long time, when it certainly was not popular to do so. It\u2019s long been reported that Meta\u2019s CEO hates that his popular social media apps have to be accessed through Apple\u2019s phones (perhaps leading to the ill-fated Facebook Phone). Now, Meta\u2019s competitors are also dipping their toes into eyewear computing.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, CTO of Meta and head or Reality Labs, wearing a clear pair of Orion smart glasses. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nMeta\u2019s early investment here seems to be paying off. Zuckerberg gave a keynote presentation of Orion on Wednesday that we won\u2019t be forgetting anytime soon, filling a room full of skeptical journalists with electricity and excitement. TechCrunch has not demoed Orion yet, but initial reviews have been very positive.\n\nWhat Meta offers today is the Ray-Ban Meta: a pair of glasses with cameras, microphones, speakers, sensors, an on-device LLM, and the ability to connect to your phone and the cloud. The Ray-Ban Meta is far simpler than Orion, but relatively affordable at $299 \u2014 actually not much more than a regular pair of Ray-Bans. They\u2019re kind of like the Spectacles 3 that Snap released a few years ago, though the Ray-Ban Meta glasses appear more popular.\n\nDespite the vast differences in price and capabilities, Orion and Ray-Ban Meta are more related than you might think.\n\n\u201cOrion is really the future, and we ultimately want to go for the full holographic experience. You can think about Ray-Ban Meta as our first step there,\u201d said Li-Chen Miller, a VP of product at Meta who leads its wearables team, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cWe really need to nail the basic things, like making sure it\u2019s comfortable, people want to wear it, and that people find value in it every day.\u201d\n\nOne of the things Meta is trying to nail with Ray-Ban Meta is AI. Currently, the smart glasses use Meta\u2019s Llama models to answer questions about what you see in front of you, by taking pictures and running them through the AI system alongside a user\u2019s verbal requests. The Ray-Ban Meta\u2019s AI features today are far from perfect: The latency is worse than OpenAI\u2019s natural-feeling Advanced Voice Mode; Meta AI requires very specific prompts to work right; it hallucinates; and it doesn\u2019t have a tight integration with many apps, making it less useful than just picking up my iPhone (perhaps by Apple\u2019s deisgn). But Meta\u2019s updates coming later this year try to address these issues.\n\nLi-Chen Miller, VP of product during Meta Connect in 2023. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nMeta announced it will soon release live AI video processing for their Ray-Bans, meaning the smart glasses will stream live video and verbal requests into one of Llama\u2019s multimodal AI models and will produce real-time, verbal answers based on that input. It\u2019s also getting basic features, like reminders, as well as more app integrations. That should make the whole experience a lot smoother, if it works. Miller says these improvements will filter up to Orion, which runs on the same generative AI systems.\n\n\u201cSome things make more sense for one form factor than the other, but we\u2019re certainly cross-pollinating,\u201d said Miller.\n\nLikewise, she says some of Orion\u2019s features may filter down as her team focuses on making the AR glasses more affordable. Orion\u2019s various sensors and eye trackers are not cheap technologies. The problem is that Orion has to get both better and more economical.\n\nAnother challenge is typing. Your smartphone has a keyboard, but your smart glasses won\u2019t. Miller worked on keyboards at Microsoft for nearly 20 years before joining Meta, but she says Orion\u2019s lack of keyboard is \u201cfreeing.\u201d She argues that using smart glasses will be a more natural experience than using a phone. You can simply talk, gesture with your hands, and look at things to navigate Orion; all things that come naturally to most people.\n\nAnother device that was criticized for lacking a keyboard was, ironically, the iPhone. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer infamously laughed at the iPhone in 2007, saying it wouldn\u2019t appeal to business customers because it didn\u2019t have a physical keyboard. People adapted though, and his comments sound naive more than 15 years later.\n\nI think making Orion feel natural is definitely more of a goal than a reality at this point. The Verge notes in its hands-on review that windows occasionally filled the entire glasses lens, completely obstructing the user\u2019s view of the world around them. That\u2019s far from natural. To get there, Meta will have to improve its AI, typing, AR, and a long list of other features.\n\n\u201cFor Ray-Ban Meta, we kept it very scoped to a few things, and then it does them really well,\u201d said Miller. \u201cWhereas, when you want to build a new, futuristic computing platform [with Orion], we have to do a lot of things, and do them all very well.\u201d"

Danielle, who grew up in the 1920s timber cottage, claims she is experiencing eerie paranormal activity - leaving her kids ''petrified'\n\n\"I want to enjoy living here, but I just feel I can't because of the activity in the house,\" Danielle explains. The property, which has been in her family for over 35 years, holds significant sentimental value for her, and mother Elaine. However, the joy of returning to her roots has been overshadowed by ghostly encounters.\n\nDanielle recalls feeling watched as a child, and her sister once reported seeing a spirit resembling a nurse. She said: \"When I lived here as a child, I did feel like I was always being watched. My sister had seen a spirit in what was her bedroom, she thought that the lady was a nurse. She said she looked at her and then she disappeared. I never actually experienced seeing a ghost until I moved back recently,\u201d\n\nNow, her own children are having frightening experiences. \"I know my son has seen her, as he described her to me. He said he'd seen a lady in the toy room. I said to him, 'is she a happy ghost?' He said 'oh no mummy, she's angry',\" Danielle recounts.\n\nIn a particularly distressing incident, Danielle's four-year-old son ran to her bedroom in hysterics, claiming to have heard a deep gasping voice in his ear. She said: \"He was hysterical and he said to me that there was a voice in his ear that had taken a deep \u2018gasp\u2019. My children are petrified. As a mother, I just want to protect my children,\".\n\nDespite her attempts to rationalize these occurrences, Danielle is finding it difficult to ignore the paranormal activity. \"I try to brush it off and say to him 'it's your imagination', 'it's a dream', but I know that that's not the truth,\" she admits.\n\nThe situation has become so concerning that Danielle is contemplating moving house. \"This house is my absolute life, but if it did get even worse or carry on, then we would have to consider moving,\" she said.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to resolve the haunting and keep her family in their beloved home, Danielle has turned to a team of paranormal investigators for help.\n\nIn the eighth episode of the new sixth series of Help! My House is Haunted, airiedon Really on Friday 27 th September at 10pm (also available to stream on discovery+), in a desperate effort to protect her family and remain living in the house she loves, Danielle turns to the show\u2019s team of paranormal investigators Barri, Ian and Jayne for help.\n\nLocal historian Penny Griffith Morgan tells Jayne that during the Second World War, a bomb took out a local hospital in Chaldon, where a young nurse called Pauline died, trapped in the rubble.

My House is Haunted on discovery+, a distressed and worried Emma reached her wit's end, and turned to the team of Barri, Ian and Jayne in an attempt to overcome her experiences with the evil spirits that are ruining her life.\n\nIn harrowing footage the team are forced to perform an exorcism on Emma, which Barri declared was 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced'.\n\nEmma, from Worcestershire, who claimed evil spirits are biting her and grabbing her wrists when she tries to sleep got an exorcism to detach the entity\n\nEmma explained: 'I feel like I have no spiritual boundary, these things are just latching onto me. I was woken up and there were people walking through my wall. I don't sleep. Every time I try to go to sleep, they grab me around the wrist and I can feel their fingers.\n\n'I can feel them touching me. I can smell them. I've had some horrible things said to me. I've had someone biting me, that's really horrible. I could feel the lips, I could feel its tongue and the wetness of its mouth. And I can't do a thing, I'm stuck.'\n\nAs the team of paranormal investigators arrived at the property, psychic medium Ian immediately detected a dark aura present on the land.\n\nIan said: 'Guys, do you know whether anything horrifying happened on the land where we're going to? Because I've got a feeling it's got a dark history.\n\n'Without saying too much, this area has seen more than its fair share of bloodshed and death,' paranormal researcher Jayne replied.\n\nAs Barri and Jayne headed off to investigate the case, Ian went into the property to conduct a solo exploration.\n\n'Wow, this place has got some really weird energy going on, my head's booming. This is really weird.\n\n'It's a new house, but it's almost as if the land is tainted with blood or something like that. Now, I don't know whether that's having an impact on this house or it's charging it.'\n\nIn harrowing footage the team are forced to perform an exorcism on Emma, which Barri declared was 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced'\n\nShe became more distressed and shouted to the spirit, 'You have no power over me, this is my f****** house. Get out!'\n\nA distressed and worried Emma reached her wit's end, and turned to the team of Barri, Ian and Jayne in an attempt to overcome her experiences with the evil spirits that are ruining her life\n\nHeading out to the garden, Ian conducted a form of psychometry, feeling the ground for vibrations which allow him to read the footprint of what spirits have left behind.\n\nHe said: 'I can hear this really heavy metallic clashing and banging and screaming and shouting. It's almost as if a battle or something like that went on within this area, which will feed anything negative because that is dark.'\n\nAfter sensing the most spiritual activity in Emma's bedroom, Ian invited Emma to join him for a visualisation experiment.\n\n'Ian's going to lower Emma's consciousness to find out more about these entities that keep harassing her,' Barri explained.\n\nIn this state, Emma immediately saw the spirit figure she had initially warned the team about, who she calls 'shadow man'.\n\nEmma described to the team: 'He's laughing at me, he's laughing, saying ''you won't get rid of me''. He's showing me his teeth.'\n\nShe became more distressed and shouted to the spirit, 'You have no power over me, this is my f****** house. Get out!'\n\nAs he observed the stress that 'shadow man' is causing, Ian held up a crucifix above a blindfolded Emma to test whether 'this dark entity is repelled by religion.'\n\nDespite being blindfolded, Emma immediately put her arm in front of her. 'Emma can't see yet, she's got her hand up rejecting the crucifix.\n\nMarried couple Emma and Ross could never have predicted the spiritual suffering their dream new-build would have in store for them four years after moving into their four-bed home in the small Worcestershire village of Kempsey\n\nAfter sensing the most spiritual activity in Emma's bedroom, Ian invited Emma to join him for a visualisation experiment\n\nIn what Barri described as 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced', the team met with Emma and Ross the following morning to review their evidence and listen back to the correspondence they had had with the spirits\n\nThat means this entity is trying to resist me,' Ian explained before concluding, 'it's clear Emma is gifted, but she's also vulnerable. I need to keep this malevolent entity away with prayer.'\n\nAs Emma became more visibly distressed, Ian snapped her out of the sub-conscious state, with her husband Ross immediately on hand to comfort her.\n\nAfter seeing the pain and trouble that the visualisation experiment caused Emma, the team decide the best plan of action is to carry out their investigations overnight on their own.\n\nThey choose to deepen their understanding by directly communicating with the spirits, to work out who they are and what has attracted them specifically to Emma.\n\nDespite their tireless efforts throughout the night however, the team concluded that the evil spirit's attachment to Emma is so great that they won't be able to banish the entity without Emma being present and that Ian will need to perform an exorcism.\n\n'Exorcism is always a last resort, but in this case, it's the only way to detach the spirit and move it on,' Ian reluctantly explained.\n\nJayne agreed: 'This dark entity has clearly formed an attachment to Emma, and it sounds like it won't give her up easily, adding that 'the problem is, of course, now that there are two things that will feed that attachment, Emma's fear and Ross's anger. If it's been with her for a couple of years, it's getting stronger.'\n\nIn what is a chilling and terrifying watch, throughout the exorcism Emma is battling with the entity, screaming 'LEAVE ME ALONE! THIS IS MY BODY!'\n\nAs Ian attempted to drive the entity out, he recited passages from the bible and doused Emma in holy water to cleanse her.\n\nIn what was clearly a traumatising but necessary experience, an increasingly petrified Emma continually called out, 'someone's screaming in my head Ian', 'my body's shaking', 'help me please! I didn't ask for this!'\n\nThe exorcism process reached the stage where Ian explained that Emma will need the supportive strength of a loved one in the spirit world, so she called upon her grandad to help her fight the evil that lives within her.\n\nWith the help of her grandad, and after reciting The Lord's Prayer, Ian was finally able to repel the evil entity and complete the exorcism.\n\n'It was a really dark entity, it was actually a lot deeper than I thought,' Ian concluded as he gives Emma a St. Benedict's medal, which he said 'will protect her from this evil entity coming back.'\n\nIn what Barri described as 'the most intense evening we've ever experienced', the team met with Emma and Ross the following morning to review their evidence and listen back to the correspondence they had had with the spirits.\n\nEpisode 2 of the brand-new sixth series of Help!

        "article_content": "No matter whether it is the online variety, or those that take place on the phone, call centres can be infuriating. You might spend hours waiting in a queue to get through to an advisor, only for someone to hang up accidentally, or to be put on hold for more hours, rarely with the problem being solved. And that\u2019s without mentioning the hold music that is played.\n\nBut sometimes, as I am on hold, I think about the poor people who have to do this job. What must it be like with the abuse or hatred aimed at them? Surely it would be worse if your mortal soul was on the line? Welcome to the Home Safety Hotline.\n\nHome Safety Hotline \u2013 bonkers!\n\nHome Safety Hotline\u2019s story is one of the most bonkers I\u2019ve ever played, but it is most definitely one of the more positive elements of the game.\n\nYou play an unnamed worker who you never see or hear from. You start the game on a PC home screen, with some emails and thumbnails, including a welcome video from Home Safety Hotline where you are going to be working. Here you log in, clocking in to begin work. There\u2019s a first phone call from your supervisor with words of encouragement and corporate speech and then you begin your shift.\n\nWhat happens next focuses on those people who ring up, describing any problems found in their house. Some of these will come with descriptions like \u201cI can hear strange noises coming from the walls\u201d, and so you are left to try and work out what the problem is from a list of issues. Could it be mice? Or is it black mold? Or bats? You send the client the information about the possible pest or issue, and then wait for the next call.\n\nDare you answer the call?\n\nIt\u2019s when you start to get strange calls from distorted people that Home Safety Hotline starts taking a turn down a weird avenue. It\u2019s about then that the descriptions of problems become stranger, as the list of options you can choose from includes things like \u201cStair Slug\u201d, \u201cTroll\u201d or \u201cWine Sprite\u201d. At the end of the shift, you get an accuracy grade on how well you have dealt with the customer\u2019s descriptions, and the advice given. Get a low percentage and you are soon fired and there isn\u2019t a good ending for you. Do well and your supervisor will reward you, and everything will be revealed\u2026\n\nThe story is great, strange and hard to grasp, but it is something that will stay with you. The writing from the characters (customers) is good and the descriptions of all the entities the developers have created are fantastic. There are also strange videos you can watch in between shifts, like one about hiking that takes the darkest of turns, as well as a funny one about mice.\n\nIt plays easily too. The gameplay is very simple, very much a case of pressing A to answer the phone, putting them on hold, and selecting an option to match the customer\u2019s descriptions. It\u2019s a hard game though, and you have to really sit and listen, reading the description to get it right. However, going down the list of entities can be a long process, so much so that by day 5 of working there, I wished it could have been sped up a bit.\n\nGetting weird!\n\nVisually, Home Safety Hotline has a 90\u2019s PC design to it, one that is effective and works well. Little thumbnail pictures of the people who ring up appear and when some of these pictures are distorted and weirded-up, the design works brilliantly. There is some video work as well that I loved, complete with some B-movie feels to it; very much a perfect choice.\n\nSound wise, Home Safety Hotline comes with great voice work with all the customers fully voiced; again, slowly getting more bizarre and scary.\n\nStrange, unusual and a lot of fun, Home Safety Hotline is like David Lynch meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The actual gameplay loop is highly original and it\u2019s enjoyable to try and work out the right choices from the descriptions given. It\u2019s not going to be for everyone, but those who love their games on the weird side will want to start a shift with Home Safety Hotline immediately.\n\nBuy Home Safety Hotline on Xbox \u2013 https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/home-safety-hotline/9p9nx35p7vnx\n\nFrom Pests to the Paranormal: Home Safety Hotline Now Available on Consoles \u2013 https://www.thexboxhub.com/from-pests-to-the-paranormal-home-safety-hotline-now-available-on-consoles/"

        "article_content": "Although penicillin was discovered on September 28, 1928 by Andrew Fleming, a British physician and professor of bacteriology at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, it took fourteen years for the first civilian patient to receive treatment. Such a long delay to deliver what Popular Science called one of 1943\u2019s top ten \u201ctriumphs in medicine\u201d of all time seems unconscionable. In the decades since, it has been estimated that penicillin has saved more than 500 million lives. But word of Fleming\u2019s discovery was slow to spread, the therapeutic implications weren\u2019t entirely clear, and penicillin turned out to be quite difficult to manufacture.\n\nFleming, who admittedly discovered penicillin by chance, is reported to have said, \u201cWhen I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn\u2019t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world\u2019s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I guess that was exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nHe had been conducting experiments with common staphylococcal bacteria, or staph, but left an uncovered petri dish by an open window during a vacation in Scotland. When he returned, the dish looked different. It had the usual clusters of bacterial colonies, except for one spot covered in mold. \u201cIn the broth,\u201d Fleming later wrote, \u201cthe mould grows on the surface as a white fluffy growth changing in a few days to a dark green felted mass.\u201d Around the \u201cfelted mass\u201d the broth was clear\u2014nearby bacterial colonies seemed to have been killed by mold secretions.\n\nFleming continued to experiment with what he called \u201cmold juice,\u201d eventually isolating the Penicillium fungus as the bacteria slayer. He published his findings in 1929 in the British Journal of Pathology with only passing reference to the ramifications penicillin might have to treat patients suffering from serious infections such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, gonorrhea, or meningitis. Fleming seemed more focused on its implications for helping scientists who study bacteria. \u201cIn addition to its possible use in the treatment of bacterial infections,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpenicillin is certainly useful to the bacteriologist for its power of inhibiting unwanted microbes in bacterial cultures so that penicillin insensitive bacteria can be readily isolated.\u201d\n\nA decade after Fleming published his work, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and others at Oxford University sought ways to manufacture penicillin at scale, which meant cultivating massive quantities of Penicillium. But they struggled to grow enough mold. Their production was so scant, in fact, that they ran out of penicillin while treating their first patient, Albert Alexander, in 1941. Without the medication, Alexander, who had been improving, ultimately died. It wasn\u2019t until Florey recruited help from the US Department of Agriculture and US-based pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Lilly, and Merck that mass production began in earnest.\n\nWhen, in 1943, Popular Science named penicillin as one of the top ten medicines in history, the contributing writer and physician, Iago Galdston, cited its superior infection-fighting performance when compared with the leading antibacterial treatment, sulfa drugs: \u201cPenicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids.\u201d Until then, no drugs existed that could fight \u201clong-established infections,\u201d which, as Galdston wrote, made penicillin particularly valuable. But even in 1943, penicillin was hard to come by. Galdston lamented, \u201cUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use.\u201d At the time, a single dose of penicillin cost $20 ($364 in 2024). By the time World War II ended in 1945, a dose of penicillin cost $.55 ($10 today) and was readily available in the US.\n\nLooking back, Popular Science\u2019s 1943 Top Ten List seems particularly prescient. In addition to penicillin, the new and emerging treatments that Galdston cited included vitamins and the importance of nutrition, hormone therapy to treat cancer and other disorders, and psychosomatic treatment, or the growing awareness that psychiatric disorders could manifest in physical symptoms and vice versa. Despite such medical blockbusters, it may be Galdston\u2019s final item that has had the most profound effect on medicine: \u201cBiological Thinking.\u201d Galdston defined biological thinking as an acknowledgment that \u201cthe basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment.\u201d Today, we take for granted that excess stress from factors such as jobs, relationships, and finances, can make us sick, but in 1943 the idea was novel.\n\nPenicillin remains one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics. And producing penicillin still requires growing mold, but pharmaceutical companies have perfected the manufacturing process, growing Penicillium in deep fermentation tanks not unlike those used in breweries. But these tanks produce something even more valuable than beer\u2014Fleming\u2019s \u201cmold juice.\u201d\n\nPopular Science, December 1943:\n\nTen New Triumphs in Medicine\n\nMAGIC DRUGS, INGENIOUS INSTRUMENTS, WIDER KNOWLEDGE MARK THE RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF THE LAST THREE DECADES\n\nBy IAGO GALDSTON, M. D. Author of \u201cProgress in Medicine\u201d and \u201cBehind the Sulfa Drugs\u201d\n\nWithin the short span of the past 30 discoveries have developed in the field of medicine than in any comparable period during the entire history of the science. In times past, important discoveries often were followed by long periods of little or no progressive medical thinking. Today, discoveries of the utmost importance are following quickly on each other\u2019s heels.\n\nAmong these inventions and discoveries is an instrument with a moving pen, which can \u201ctake dictation\u201d from a patient\u2019s brain. The record of electrical brain waves that this amazing secretary takes down is read by the surgeon for indications of brain disorders. Another is a drug so powerful that one part in 25 million parts of water will stop the growth of bacteria. Still another has revolutionized the science of diagnosis, and has completely recast the modern physician\u2019s approach to the problem of healing.\n\nIn this writer\u2019s judgment, 10 of the greatest medical discoveries and inventions of recent years are: The sulfonamides; penicillin; the vitamins; the sex hormones; the relation of the sex hormones to cancer; the electro-encephalograph; the electron microscope; psychosomatic medicine; brief therapy; and biological thinking.\n\nThe Sulfonamides\n\nThe sulfonamides are without doubt the best known of the recent medical discoveries. And justly so, for no single group of com- pounds has proved as effective as this one in preventing and treating such a large number of diseases. Pneumonia, gonorrhea, erysipelas, childbed fever, many forms of bloodstream infection, trachoma, septic sore throat, urinary infections, meningococcus meningitis, chancroid, gas gangrene, actinomycosis, anthrax, scarlet fever, impetigo -these are but some of the conditions effectively treated with one or another of the sulfonamide compounds.\n\nEqually remarkable and numerous are the applications of the sulfonamides in the prevention of infection. Since their first use in this respect, the lives of countless men wounded in battle have been saved. The sulfonamides have also extended the scope of surgery, heretofore limited by the threat of infection supervening upon operations in contaminated regions. They are reducing the incidence of serious complications which in times past frequently followed on simple infections. There is, however, one particular aspect of the discovery of the sulfonamides which overshadows even its great practical results. The sulfonamides have given new life to the science of chemotherapy-the treatment of internal disease with chemicals. Chemotherapy got off to a great start when Paul Ehrlich discovered Salvarsan in 910 although for the next 25 years little new appeared on the chemotherapeutic scene. Then in 1935 came Prontosil, and later the sulfonamides, and the whole picture changed. But what changed most was the concept of chemotherapy itself. Paul Ehrlich and practically all of his followers thought of chemotherapy in terms of \u201cmagic bullets,\u201d that is, in terms of protoplasmic poisons which would kill germs, but not the human body. Unfortunately few such selective poisons were found. Most of the protoplasmic poisons proved as likely to injure the victim as the at- tacking germs. Then when Prontosil and the sulfonamides were found to be so amazingly effective against bacteria, the old theories of chemotherapy had to be recast, for the sulfonamides do not belong to the class of protoplasmic poisons. In fact, the sulfonamides are not even bactericidal, that is, they do not directly kill germs. They are, however, bacteriostatic: they arrest the development of germs by interfering with their metabolism. By thus weakening the germs, they make it possible for them to be overcome by the body\u2019s own defenses.\n\nToday, research follows the path of germ metabolism, and seeks to discover how that metabolism may be adversely affected by means of chemical agents. It is this new rational basis for chemotherapy that warrants our hope of finding chemicals with which to cure tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, and other germ and virus diseases not affected by the sulfonamides.\n\nPenicillin\n\nHot on the heels of the sulfonamides came the discovery of penicillin, a chemotherapeutic agent in many respects superior to the sul- fonamides. This powerful new drug is derived from a fungus called Penicillium notatum. In 1929, this fungus, or mold, was an unwelcome in- truder into some staphylococcus cultures with which the English bacteriologist Prof. A. Fleming had been experimenting for quite some time. Fleming acutely observed then that wherever the fungus grew, the germs did not, and he reasoned that the fungus and the germs did not get along well together. He studied the matter further and found his reasoning correct.\n\nHowever, since the fungus was not antagonistic to all germs, but only to certain ones, he employed it to eliminate from groups of mixed germs those to which penicillin was antagonistic. But that was as far as the matter went at the time.\n\nWith the discovery of the sulfonamides it was natural for the scientists to turn their attention once again to the penicillium mold. Another English scientist, Prof. H. W. Florey, in 1940 extracted from the penicillium mold a brown powder-like substance. He found it to be an extraordinarily powerful drug, effective against a larger variety of infections than are the sulfonamides.\n\nThough but recently discovered, penicillin has already been subjected to numerous trials. Unlike the sulfonamides, which operate by diminishing the growth of bacteria, it has been found to kill bacteria or stop their growth entirely. But it will work in many cases where the sulfa drugs have proved useless or only partially effective. Penicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids. This renders it particularly valuable in the treatment of such conditions as osteomyelitis, empyema, infected compound fractures, and wounds and burns with long-established infections. Penicillin is superior in undermining the yellow pus-producing bacteria, the staphylococcus aureus, and many infections caused by cocci. And the user of penicillin suffers no toxic effects such as are sometimes experienced when sulfa drugs have been employed.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use. There is, however, no reason to doubt that the chemists will before long succeed in crystallizing it and reproducing it artificially.\n\nThe Vitamins\n\nThe vitamins represent a major medical discovery of an order different from any of those thus far described. Biology and medicine have been radically affected by their discovery. Until vitamins were discovered, the conviction prevailed among medical men that there wasn\u2019t much one could do about health except to prevent disease. Doctors preached personal hygiene in terms of rest, cleanliness, exercise, fresh air, and good food. But they did so in the belief that they could only preserve health, which for any given individual was more or less fixed. For the rest, attention was focused on \u201cfighting infection\u201d by such means as vaccines, serums, antiseptics, and so forth.\n\nWith the development of the modern science of nutrition, of which the vitamins are an important segment, we learned that one could be not sick, but at the same time not healthy, as in the case of \u201csubclinical conditions,\u201d in which the patient is not manifestly ill, but also is far from well. We also discovered that susceptibility to many types of disease, including infections, was due to malnutrition, and that growth, de- velopment, and aging were profoundly influenced by the quantity and quality of the foods eaten.\n\nAs our knowledge of nutrition increases, and as that knowledge is applied to the everyday diet of people, we are bound to see a reduction in the incidence of disease, and an improvement in physical growth and wellbeing.\n\nThe Sex Hormones\n\nThe discovery of the sex hormones is one of the achievements of modern medicine on which the public is comparatively unin- formed. Yet it is truly a tremendous accomplishment.\n\nIt was a bright hunch that led to the discovery of the female sex hormone. When an ovum (egg) ripens in the ovary, it is surrounded by a minute quantity of a yellowish fluid, known as the liquor folliculi. No one thought to investigate the function of that fluid until 1922, when Edgar Allen, Ph.D., of St. Louis, and his wife obtained buckets of ovaries from a meat-packing plant and, working on their kitchen table, carefully drew off the fluid from the follicles. Soon they had enough of it to enable their coworker, Dr. E. A. Doisy, to purify it and determine its chemical constitution. This made possible the crystallization of the female hormone in 1929. In 1936 it was reproduced artificially. The discovery of the male hormone, which is credited to L. C. McGee, of Chicago, took place in 1927.\n\nThe sex hormones have proved enormously useful in the treatment of a variety of disturbances, including those of the sexual and reproductive functions. From this discovery was derived the original Aschheim-Zondek test for pregnancy.\n\nThe most important result of the discovery of sex hormones, however, is the light it has thrown upon the complicated structures and operations of the glands of internal secretion. These glands affect growth, development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction; in fact, all phases of the \u201cinner activities\u201d of the human body.\n\nThe Relation of the Sex Hormones to Cancer\n\nCancer of the prostate is one of the most common types of malignancy affecting men. This type of cancer is difficult to discover in its early stages, and tends to spread so work of uniformly close tolerances is performed rapidly that, in actual experience, less than five percent of such cases can be successfully treated surgically.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. C. Huggins, of the University of Chicago, advanced the idea that the prostate cancer cells require the male hormone for their continued existence, even as the normal prostate cells do. He and his associates reasoned from this that castration or else the \u201cneutralization\u201d of the male hormone by means of the female hormone should adversely affect the prostate cancer growths. He, and others after him, tried the latter treatment. The results were astonishing. Although the cancer is not cured, most of the patients benefit enormously. Pain disappears, nutrition improves, appetite returns, and strength is regained. The original cancer growth in the prostate, and those that have spread to other parts of the body, regress so that many sufferers are enabled to carry on their normal activities in comfort. This treatment of prostatic cancer is vastly superior to any previously available. But the greatest value of the discovery is that it has stimulated many scientists to study the relation of the sex hormones to cancer in general.\n\nThe Electro-Encephalograph\n\nThis recent invention is a sleuthing machine for tracking down the mysterious ways of the brain. Working by means of vacuum tubes similar to those used in a radio, it picks up \u201cbrain waves\u201d-electrical impulses generated in the head by brain function. These currents, which have distinguishing characteristics, are visibly recorded by a moving pen. Since a brain suffering from some organic ailment sends out waves differing from those generated by a normal one, the record set down by the electro-encephalograph can be read by the brain surgeon for indications of such dis- orders as brain tumors and epilepsy. This useful diagnostic instrument promises to be of great value in the study of the physiology of the nervous system, and of the dynamics of drugs employed for their effects on the nervous system.\n\nThe Electron Microscope\n\nThe electron microscope likewise promises to prove a great research instrument. The ordinary microscope cannot magnify an object beyond approximately 2,000 diameters, this limitation being imposed by the wavelength of light. The electron microscope, however, can magnify objects from 50,000 to a 100,000 diameters. It can, therefore, be readily seen how this extremely powerful instrument has opened up new and vast fields of research in bacteriology and biochemistry. We are now able to obtain a really intimate insight into the structure of both living and nonliving matter, and, most interestingly, of that \u201cin-between\u201d matter known as the viruses, which are responsible for such destructive diseases as smallpox, influenza, and infantile paralysis.\n\nPsychosomatic Medicine\n\nOne of the more interesting developments of psychiatry goes by the name of psychosomatic medicine. It represents the fusion of orthodox clinical medicine with the best in psychiatric knowledge. It teaches the important lesson, in an irrefutable way, that there is no disorder of the soma (the body) without some involvement of the psyche (the mind and the emotions), and conversely, that psychiatric disorders have their somatic (physical) components. In some instances, indeed, physical symptoms are the only tangible manifestations of what is primarily a psychiatric condition. This insight into the interplay of psyche and soma has made possible a much more effective treatment of many conditions which in times past could be treated only superficially. It also enables the physician to anticipate, and by appropriate action to prevent, the development of a variety of physical and emotional strains and disorders.\n\nBrief Therapy\n\nRelated to psychiatry is the new experimental development of brief therapy. The objective of these experiments is, simply, brevity of treatment. Most of the techniques of psychiatric therapy as practiced today are lengthy and therefore costly. Far too many persons who require treatment cannot afford it. And there are not enough trained psychiatrists available to meet the needs. To correct these deficiencies, studies, conferences, and experiments are being conducted to develop techniques of psychotherapy that will be effective but less time-consuming.\n\nBiological Thinking\n\nFinally we come to that development in present-day medicine which blankets all others: the ability to think biologically. Today the physician thinks of his patient in terms of his many environmental relationships\u2013his job, his marriage, his friends, his education, his degree of success, and so forth. A short while ago, however, the physician thought of his patient only in terms of his complaints, of the symptoms or disorders he discovered and of the specific remedies he could use in the treatment of \u201cthe case.\u201d In fact, the physician was more concerned with the \u201ccase\u201d-with the disease afflicting the patient-than with the patient himself.\n\nToday, we know that to effect a permanent cure, the contributory as well as the primary factors must be considered and dealt with; that, in substance, the basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment."

        "article_content": "Twenty years ago this October, two physicists at the University of Manchester, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, published a groundbreaking paper on the \u201celectric field effect in atomically thin carbon films\u201d. Their work described the extraordinary electronic properties of graphene, a crystalline form of carbon equivalent to a single layer of graphite, just one atom thick.\n\nAround that time, I started my doctorate at the University of Surrey. Our team specializes in the electronic properties of carbon. Carbon nanotubes were the latest craze, which I was happily following. One day, my professor encouraged a group of us to travel to London to attend a talk by a well-known science communicator from the University of Manchester. This was Andre Geim.\n\nWe were not disappointed. He was inspiring for us fresh-faced PhD students, incorporating talk of wacky Friday afternoon experiments with levitating frogs before getting on to atomically thin carbon. All the same, we were skeptical about this carbon concept. We couldn\u2019t quite believe that a material effectively obtained from pencil lead with sticky tape was really what it claimed to be. But we were wrong.\n\nThe work was quickly copied and reproduced by scientists across the globe. New methods for making this material were devised. Incredible claims about its properties made it sound like something out of a Stan Lee comic. Stronger than steel, highly flexible, super-slippery and impermeable to gases. It is a better electronic conductor than copper and a better thermal conductor than diamond. It is also practically invisible and displays a host of exotic quantum properties.\n\nGraphene was hailed as a revolutionary material, promising ultra-fast electronics, supercomputers and super-strong materials. More fantastical claims have included space elevators, solar sails, artificial retinas, and even invisibility cloaks.\n\nJust six years after their initial work, Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, further fueling the enthusiasm around this wonder stuff. Since then, hundreds of thousands of academic papers have been published on graphene and related materials.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. Skim through the comments section of any popular article on the material, and you\u2019ll quickly find the sceptics. We have endured decades of empty promises about the real-world impact of graphene, they complain. Where are the game-changing products to enrich our lives or save the world from climate change, they ask?\n\nSo, has graphene been a resounding success or a damp squib? As is so often the case, the reality is somewhere in between.\n\nGraphene\u2019s ups and downs\n\nIn terms of public perception, it\u2019s fair to say that graphene has been held to an impossible standard. The popular media can certainly exaggerate science stories for clicks, but academics \u2013 including myself \u2013 are not immune from over-egging or speculating about their pet projects either. I\u2019d argue this can even be useful, helping to drive new technologies forward. Equally, though, there can be a backlash when progress looks disappointing.\n\nHaving said that, disruptive technologies such as cars, television or plastic all required decades of development. Graphene is still a newcomer in the grand scheme of things, so it\u2019s far too early to reach any conclusions about its impact.\n\nWhat has quietly occurred is a steady integration of graphene into numerous practical applications. Much of this is thanks to the Graphene Flagship, a major European research initiative coordinated by Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. This aims to bring graphene and related materials from academic research to real-world commercial applications, and more than 90 products have been developed over the past decade as a result.\n\nThese include blended plastics for high-performance sports equipment, more durable racing tyres for bicycles, motorcycle helmets that better distribute impact forces, thermally conductive coatings for motorcycle components, and lubricants for reducing friction and wear between mechanical parts.\n\nGraphene is finding its way into batteries and supercapacitors, enabling faster charging times and longer life spans. Conductive graphene inks are now used to manufacture sensors, wireless tracking tags, heating elements, and electromagnetic shielding for protecting sensitive electronics. Graphene is even used in headphones to improve the sound quality and as a more efficient means of transmitting heat in air-conditioning units.\n\nGraphene oxide products are used for desalination, wastewater treatment , and purification of drinking water. Meanwhile, a range of graphene materials can be bought off the shelf for use in countless other products, and major corporations, including SpaceX, Tesla, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony and Apple, are all rumored or known to be using them to develop new products.\n\nFrom promise to practicality\n\nThe impact of graphene on materials science is undeniable. The impact on consumer products is tangible but not as visible. Once a material is embedded in a working product, there is little need to keep mentioning it, and proprietary concerns can make companies reluctant to get into details in any case. Consumers can, therefore, be blissfully unaware that their car, mobile phone, or golf club contains graphene and most probably don\u2019t care as long as it works.\n\nAs production methods improve and costs decrease, we can expect graphene to become ever more widely adopted. Economies of scale will make it more accessible, and the range of applications is likely to continue to expand.\n\nPersonally, after two decades, I still get excited when I try it out for something new in the lab. While I may be guilty of having contributed to the initial hype, I remain optimistic about graphene\u2019s potential. I\u2019m still waiting for my ride on a space elevator, but in the meantime, I\u2019ll take comfort in the fact that graphene is already helping to shape a better future \u2013 quietly and steadily.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation by Stephen Lyth at the University of Strathclyde.

        "article_content": "This story was updated to add a photo.\n\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 Travis Hunter wore custom-made football cleats in Saturday night\u2019s game against Central Florida \u2013 a pair of gold-colored shoes with a graphic on them depicting the mountains and trees of Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThey had quite a night. First he scored a 23-yard touchdown in them in the first quarter. Then he made an interception and flashed the Heisman Trophy pose in them in the third quarter. After his Colorado team won the game, 48-21, Colorado\u2019s two-way superstar even took those cleats off his feet and gave them to somebody in the stands here at FBC Mortgage Stadium.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who he is, man,\u201d Colorado football coach Deion Sanders said of Hunter\u2019s big night.\n\nBy the time it was over, Hunter had caught nine passes for 89 yards and a touchdown, snagged one interception, broke up one other opposing pass attempt and recorded two tackles before walking back to the locker room in his socks.\n\nMr. Everywhere had done it again.\n\nBut this time was different.\n\nWhy was this win different for Travis Hunter and Deion Sanders?\n\nHunter\u2019s team also rose to the occasion around him to play what might be its best all-around game in Sanders\u2019 two seasons as head coach.\n\nIt also came on a homecoming of sorts for both Sanders and Hunter, both Florida natives coming home to lead the Buffaloes (4-1) to their third straight win.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how emotional I am about these young men and seeing what they could do when they put it all together and seeing what we\u2019re capable of when we put it all together,\u201d Sanders said afterward.\n\nThe win effectively puts the Big 12 Conference on notice. The Buffs are hot, on the move and might even come close to cracking the national Top 25. The Buffs led 27-14 at halftime and held the nation\u2019s No. 1 rushing offense to 177 rushing yards, nearly 200 under UCF\u2019s season average before Saturday.\n\nHere\u2019s how they did it Saturday and what it means:\n\nWhat did Deion Sanders say about win?\n\nHe was in a playful mood after a warm, humid game that started about 50 minutes late because of lightning in the area. He poked fun of Hunter, who is known to wear onesie pajamas and doesn\u2019t always like talking to the news media after games.\n\n\u201cKnowing Travis, he ain\u2019t coming,\u201d Sanders said at the postgame news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s probably on the bus with a onesie on.\u201d\n\nSanders also poked fun of his quarterback son Shedeur, who threw an interception on the game\u2019s opening drive before leading the Buffs on scoring drives in six of their next seven possessions in front of an announced sellout crowd of 45,702 at FBC Mortgage Stadium. Shedeur Sanders completed 28 of 35 passes for 290 yards and three touchdowns. He added three carries for 28 yards and was only sacked twice despite the loss of a starting guard to injury this week.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon Grown, they want to ask you about the interception,\u201d Deion Sanders said to his son as the quarterback entered the post-game news conference.\n\nThat\u2019s what Sanders calls Shedeur: \u201cGrown\u201d \u2013 as in mature beyond his years.\n\nShedeur Sanders showed it by settling down after the initial turnover and letting his running game take some pressure off of him for a change. The Buffs compiled 128 rushing yards on 29 carries, led by 39 from running back Isaiah Augustave, a native of Naples, Florida.\n\n\u201cWe got outcoached,\u201d UCF head coach Gus Malzahn said. \u201cWe got outplayed.\u201d\n\nUCF gave up two interceptions and two fumbles to Colorado, including one that was returned 95 yards by safety Cam\u2019Ron Silmon-Craig for the final touchdown of the game in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat did Shedeur Sanders say afterward?\n\nHe was asked how he stays focused amid the hype and all the football legends that come to see him and his father at games. On Saturday, Cam Newton, the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner, greeted him before the game. Hall of Fame receivers Michael Irvin and Terrell Owens watched him from the Colorado sideline, too.\n\nSo how does he do it? Shedeur Sanders answered by saying he collects personal slights, either real or imagined. He said he remembers being described as \u201cjust an HBCU kid who couldn\u2019t do it at the Power 5 level,\u201d referring to Jackson State, a historically Black college where he played in 2022 before transferring to Colorado last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t forget anything,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t forget what anybody ever said, and personally I\u2019m not one to make friends or feel like just because success is going on, now I\u2019m going to forgive everybody. Nah, whatever you said at any point in time, I\u2019m not really a forgiving type.\u201d\n\nThat kind of mindset drove him to dominate a team Saturday that was favored by two touchdowns. He spread the ball around to eight different receivers and knocked the Knights (3-1) out of their comfort zone by forcing them to pass the ball more to keep up.\n\n\u201cTo keep up with our type of scoring, that gets them out of their comfort zone and provokes them to throw the ball a little more than they\u2019d like to,\u201d Deion Sanders said.\n\nHis team now gets some rest heading into a bye weekend in Boulder. The Buffs resume play at home on Oct. 12 against Kansas State.\n\nDeion Sanders talks about his record\n\nSanders pulled a trick on the news media afterward to make a point. With four wins, his team now has matched its win total from last year, when the Buffs finished 4-8 in his first season in Boulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so darn proud of where we are,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe could be in a whole different place right now, but look it\u2026 We\u2019re going into the break. What\u2019s the record?\u201d\n\n\u201cFour-and-one,\u201d the news media responded.\n\n\u201cSay it again,\u201d Sanders said, acting like he couldn\u2019t hear.\n\n\u201cFour-and-one,\u201d the room said again.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to hear y\u2019all say it collectively, and y\u2019all fell for it,\u201d Sanders said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 4-1 going into the break, and I\u2019m so excited, you have no idea,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a really good plane ride tonight.\u201d\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

        "article_content": "It\u2019s always hard to avoid the news that a new iPhone has arrived, and arrived they have. Apple\u2019s September 9 event showcased four new iPhones: the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Chances are you know what to expect from each of those names, and the basic rule is that \u201cmore words in a name\u201d means \u201cbigger or more powerful,\u201d but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that even the basic iPhone 16 is a mobile powerhouse that\u2019s worthy of going toe-to-toe with the most powerful Android flagships.\n\nBut who cares about Android? One of the biggest questions on every Apple aficionado\u2019s lips is always, \u201cHow is the new iPhone better than the old one?\u201d After all, it stands to reason the newer iPhone is better \u2014 but exactly how much better is it? If you\u2019re currently reading this on last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Plus, should you be rushing to the store to buy your iPhone 16 Plus? Here\u2019s how the Apple iPhone 16 Plus compares to the iPhone 15 Plus, and whether it\u2019s worth the upgrade or not.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: specs\n\niPhone 16 Plus iPhone 15 Plus Size 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8 mm (6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches) 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8 mm (6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches) Weight 199 grams (6.02 ounces) 201 grams (6.07 ounces) Screen size 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED Screen resolution 2796 x 1290 pixels (460 pixels per inch) 2796 x 1290 pixels (460 pixels per inch) Operating system iOS 18 iOS 17 (upgradeable to iOS 18) Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB 128GB, 256GB, 512GB MicroSD card slot No No Tap-to-pay services Apple Pay Apple Pay Processor Apple A18 Apple A16 Bionic RAM 8GB 6GB Camera Dual-lens 48-megapixel wide and 12MP ultrawide rear, 12MP TrueDepth front Dual-lens 48MP wide and 12MP ultrawide rear, 12MP TrueDepth front Video 4K at up to 60 frames per second, 1080p at 240 fps 4K at up to 60 fps, 1080p at 240 fps Bluetooth version Bluetooth 5.3 Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C USB-C Fingerprint sensor No, Face ID instead No, Face ID instead Water resistance IP68 IP68 Battery Fast charging (26 watts) MagSafe wireless charging (25W) Qi wireless charging (15W) Reverse wireless charging (4.5W) Fast charging (20W charger sold separately) MagSafe wireless charging (15W) Qi wireless charging (7.5W) Reverse wireless charging (4.5W) App marketplace Apple App Store Apple App Store Network support All major carriers All major carriers Colors Black, white, pink, teal, ultramarine Black, blue, green, yellow, pink Prices Starts at $899 Starts at $799\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: design and display\n\nThe iPhone 15 Plus was always going to be an awkward middle child in terms of pricing, but it was anything but awkward in terms of the design. Like the rest of the iPhone 15 range, the Plus benefited strongly from a design refresh. In fact, the large frame of the 15 Plus was even more impacted than the smaller phones by the comfortably curved sides and improved weight balance. As a result, it\u2019s a very comfortable phone to hold, and it looks gorgeous.\n\nHas Apple topped it with the iPhone 16 Plus? Apple is keeping a similar design for the iPhone 16 Plus, so you can be confident that the plus points of last year\u2019s model are sticking around. But there are some significant changes afoot. The camera module layout has changed. Rather than the diagonal layout we\u2019ve come to love, Apple has gone back to a dual-stack for the two rear cameras. Additionally, it isn\u2019t extending the module into a squircle as it did with the iPhone 12, which means the iPhone 16 Plus resembles nothing less than the iPhone X when viewed from the rear. It\u2019s an odd throwback, but it\u2019s fun.\n\nBut most exciting is the addition of a new button: Camera Control. This joins the Action button and can be used to launch the camera, swipe to zoom, and even differentiate between hard and soft presses, all to streamline your camera experience. It can also be used to kick-start Apple\u2019s Visual Intelligence AI. It could be one of those features you end up forgetting about, but the early impressions say it\u2019s looking more like a sea change in smartphone design.\n\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus don\u2019t have bigger displays like the Pro models, but they do get an overall reduction in bezel size, thanks to new tech. As a result, while the newer iPhone won\u2019t have a much larger display, it will feel as if it encompasses more of the device\u2019s front because, well, it does. Unfortunately, Apple is keeping the 60Hz refresh rate on the cheaper models despite the majority of Android devices from the midrange and up moving on to much higher refresh rates.\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: performance, battery life, and charging\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Apple\u2019s newest devices have more powerful processors than the year before, but there\u2019s a caveat to explore here. It\u2019s become an unfortunate tradition that the cheaper of Apple\u2019s new devices get last year\u2019s processors \u2014 so while the iPhone 15 Pro had new A17 Pro chips, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus made do with the previous year\u2019s A16 chip. This year, things are different. The Pro models get the A18 Pro chip, but at least the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus get an A18 chip. In all likelihood, it\u2019s still an A17 chip with a new name, but at least it doesn\u2019t feel like much of a downgrade now.\n\nWill it make a difference in real-life use? Without more time with them, it\u2019s hard to tell \u2014 but it\u2019s likely it won\u2019t mean a huge jump in performance. Recent iPhones have all felt slick and superfast, and with how powerful phone hardware is now, it\u2019ll be years until it stops feeling that way.\n\nBattery life may also be a toss-up. While the three other iPhone 16 models are getting larger batteries, the iPhone 16 Plus is an outlier because it\u2019s rumored to be getting a smaller battery. Apple hasn\u2019t confirmed this and doesn\u2019t publicize its battery sizes, so we\u2019ll only know this for sure when teardowns start happening. We\u2019ll be sure to keep an eye on the iPhone 16 Plus\u2019 battery life when we perform our review.\n\nThe charging speed seems to have increased a bit. While rumors originally said Apple had built a significantly faster 45-watt charging rate into all of its new phones, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, as the iPhone 16 Plus seems to be mostly restricted to a 26W charging rate. That outstrips the 20W speed we saw in last year\u2019s Plus model, but it\u2019s not by much. Still, new owners get a big upgrade in MagSafe charging speed, jumping up to 25W.\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: cameras\n\nWhile it initially seems Apple hasn\u2019t done much to change the cameras, that\u2019s not actually the case. Despite looking the same on paper, there have been some big changes that help to bring the basic iPhones closer to the Pro leagues than they ever have been before. The 48-megapixel main lens now has the Fusion branding, meaning it can function as a 48MP lens, a 2x zoom at 24MP, or a 12MP lens with pixel-binning for increased light intake. It can also take spatial photos and videos for the Apple Vision Pro, a feat only previously available to the Pro models. However, you have to wonder how many people are paying for a Vision Pro and then skimping on their iPhone.\n\nOutside of those improvements, you\u2019re going to find the camera experience between these two phones very similar \u2014 and that\u2019s no bad thing. The iPhone 15 Plus was another of our favorite camera phones from last year, and there\u2019s merit in Apple sticking with what works.\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: software and updates\n\nThere are no surprises here: Both iPhones run iOS 18, and you\u2019re going to find the experience similar on both. Yes, the iPhone 16 Plus will have launched with iOS 18, and that puts it sligthly ahead of the iPhone 15 Plus, which will have to use one of its upgrades to get to iOS 18. That\u2019s less of a big deal than on other phones, though, as Apple is quite generous with software updates. While it doesn\u2019t put a limit on the number a device can get, it\u2019s fair to say your phone will have reached a ripe old age (for a phone) before it no longer gets new iOS versions. Apple just updated the iPhone XS, a five-year-old phone, to iOS 18, so you can expect to get at least that level of support.\n\nThere is one particular feature you\u2019ll find only on the newer phone, though, and it\u2019s a biggie: AI, specifically Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple\u2019s foray into AI will introduce a number of new features to the iPhone. Siri will be supercharged, and capable of much more natural conversations. Writing Tools will help you to rewrite your sentences to fit specific tones, or just suggest replies based on context. It can create Memory Movies, as well as create transcripts in your Phone or Notes app. Heck, there\u2019s even ChatGPT integration. It\u2019s a big shake-up in the way iOS functions, but there\u2019s only one snag \u2014 it\u2019s, er, not available yet.\n\nApple Intelligence won\u2019t be hitting iPhones until iOS 18.1 is available, and even then, it\u2019ll lack the ChatGPT functionality. Plus, it will only be available on a very exclusive list of iPhones. The entire new iPhone 16 range is included, but outside of that, you\u2019re only looking at the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max being compatible. That means the iPhone 15 Plus is frozen out.\n\nOf course, whether you care or not will come down to your personal feelings about AI, and the usefulness of those features on the whole. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how it plays out in our reviews when Apple Intelligence is finally available.\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: special features\n\nApple\u2019s phones have never exactly been replete with special features. It\u2019s not really Apple\u2019s style to shove out a bunch of features and see what sticks, like, say, Samsung is wont to do. But it would be a lie to say there isn\u2019t anything. Both of these phones have access to Apple\u2019s usual special features, including Face ID, Animojis, and other fun tricks you\u2019ve come to expect. The iPhone 15 Plus also has the mute switch on the side of the phone, a celebrated feature that allows you to mute and unmute your phone with the flick of a switch. It\u2019s one of Apple\u2019s most useful features, and it\u2019s a shame the iPhone 15 Plus will be one of the last iPhones to support it.\n\nWhile the iPhone 16 Plus doesn\u2019t have a mute switch, it does have something potentially even better. It has the Action button, previously only available on last year\u2019s Pro models. This button can function like a mute switch, or you can use it to toggle Focus modes, turn on the flashlight, open the Camera app, or any one of a number of other options. It\u2019s very customizable, though it\u2019s easy to see why people may miss the mute switch still available on the iPhone 15 Plus.\n\nThere\u2019s another new button on the iPhone 16 Plus, though, and it\u2019s a bit more exciting. Called Camera Control, this slightly recessed button opens the camera when you press it, no matter what else you\u2019re doing on your phone. When the app is open, press it again to take a snapshot, or press and hold to start taking a video. Sounds simple? There\u2019s even more to it. Because it has a capacitive sensor, you can lightly press it to open an options menu for your camera, and slide to adjust. It may take a little bit of practice to adjust to it, but when you\u2019ve got it down, it feels amazing.\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: price and availability\n\nThe iPhone 16 Plus is currently available, with prices starting from $899. As it\u2019s an Apple flagship, the chances are high you\u2019ll be able to find it in pretty much every store that carries smartphones of any kind. The iPhone 15 Plus is in basically the same situation, and is still available from Apple even after the release of the newest model. Happily, it\u2019s had a small drop in price as a result, and can be bought for $799, a $100 discount from its original asking price.\n\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 15 Plus: Is it time for you to upgrade?\n\nSo, what\u2019s the verdict? Is the newer iPhone a better phone than the last one? Well, yes. The iPhone 16 Plus is better-looking, more powerful, and has more features than the iPhone 15 Plus. Surpassing previous phones is the basic level of what we expect from a successor, so this doesn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\nBut that\u2019s not really the question we set out to answer anyway \u2014 is the iPhone 16 Plus a big enough sea change in Apple hardware to make it a must-upgrade for iPhone 15 Plus owners? No, not really. Unless you\u2019re absolutely desperate to experience Apple Intelligence, then there\u2019s little to really tempt you. Yes, the iPhone 16 Plus is clearly the more powerful and capable of the two, but it\u2019s not worth spending extra money to get what are, most definitely, small incremental updates. Even those new features you can\u2019t get on the older phone, like Camera Control and Apple Intelligence, are worth waiting for.\n\nIf you\u2019re deciding between the two phones, and aren\u2019t tempted by the lower price of the iPhone 15 Plus, it\u2019s definitely worth spending the $100 extra. But if you\u2019re thinking about an upgrade? Wait it out. Wait and see what the next few iterations of the iPhone bring to the table."
