            "article_content": "Another mysterious 'orange UFO orb' was spotted flying over the US, however, this time the inexplicable glow was seen conspicuously hovering over a military base in Tennessee.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border - on New Year's Day.\n\nThe user, who witnessed the perplexing 'celestial' event alongside their father, who is a seasoned Army veteran, said that they 'couldn't explain' what they were seeing in the skies above.\n\n'My dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before,' the post reads.\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the Redditor, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb.\n\n'Just after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,' the user claimed.\n\nThe curious onlookers were mystified at the unidentified flying object as it did not appear to have any additional lights as they suspect most drones do.\n\n'My friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone,' the post adds.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border, on New Year's Day\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the user, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, then tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb\n\n'Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.'\n\nBright high-flying 'orange UFO orbs' have been spotted across the US in recent weeks with the most recent sighting surfacing over New York City.\n\nOn December 27, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video of the inexplicable luminous object to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert has lifted the lid on some of his wildest encounters as we reveal the top five hotspots in the UK.\n\nNick Pope, who previously ran the British Government\u2019s UFO Project, spoke about his experiences with extraterrestrial life in an exclusive chat with The Sun.\n\n4 Nick Pope is former head of the MoD's UFO research programme Credit: Chris Loomis / National Geographic\n\n4 Nick lifted the lid on some extraterrestrial mysteries\n\n4\n\nFor over two decades, Nick worked as a civilian employee at the MoD, with his most prominent role beginning in the early 1990s, where he ran the department's UFO program.\n\nNick was at the helm of the project, an initiative that monitored and investigated reports of unidentified flying objects to assess their potential impact on national security and aviation safety.\n\nAlthough the program was never formally named, it was often referred to as the \u201cUFO desk\u201d or \u201cUFO program\u201d by a number of media outlets.\n\nWhen looking at the distribution of these sightings across the UK, Nick and his team discovered that the hotspots were not necessarily the rural or remote locations that many assumed.\n\nNick told The Sun: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because when we mapped out the UFO sightings, they didn\u2019t necessarily occur in remote, rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe hotspots were often London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow \u2013 all the major cities and urban areas.\n\n\"The reason for this is simple - the more people there are in an area, the more likely someone is to spot something unusual in the sky.\u201d\n\nThese cities, with their dense populations, provided more potential witnesses.\n\nIt meant that if something strange appeared in the sky, the chances of someone witnessing it were far higher.\n\nNick also notes that other areas, like Warminster have been known for their frequent UFO sightings.\n\n\u201cPeople used to go up Cradle Hill and Flea Hill in Warminster, and even some 1960s pop songs referenced the place,\u201d he added.\n\nBonnybridge, in Scotland, saw a huge surge in UFO sightings in the 1990s, to the extent that local councillor Billy Buchanan lobbied the government for an inquiry.\n\n\u201cI ended up drafting the replies to Buchanan\u2019s letters, which were sent to the Ministry of Defence,\u201d Nick recalls.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t very happy with me because the government line was always to play down the significance of UFO sightings.\u201d\n\nDespite the official stance, Nick acknowledges that Bonnybridge was, indeed, a hotspot.\n\nPilots told they\u2019re \u2018cleared to manoeuvre to avoid the UFO\u2019 in eerie audio as \u2018strange\u2019 lights spark fears in Oregon\n\nHowever, Nick also cautions against confirmation bias, adding: \u201cWhen people go to these hotspots for sky watches, they may already be believers, which can affect how they perceive what they see.\n\n\"They may be more likely to misperceive something or to see what they expect to see.\u201d\n\nAnother factor is the issue of light pollution in cities, which can obscure the view of the sky.\n\nDespite this, urban areas remained UFO hotspots due to the sheer number of potential witnesses.\n\nEven more intriguing, Nick pointed out, was the fact that UFO sightings seemed to cluster around military bases, particularly air force bases.\n\nWhile some argue that these sightings are due to secret military aircraft or advanced aerospace technology, the fact remains that military bases are more heavily surveilled, and the likelihood of sightings there is higher.\n\nFrom Rendlesham Forest to Cosford, Nick has worked on some of the most high-profile cases in UFO history, all while trying to navigate the Ministry\u2019s official stance on the phenomenon.\n\nAnd according to Nick, the number of UFO sightings reported in the UK was far higher than most people realise with reports representing only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"We\u2019d get about 200 to 300 reports a year, and at its peak, that number went up to 700 or 800,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBut even that number is misleading because many sightings went unreported due to fear of ridicule or simply not knowing who to contact.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Nick believes the actual number of UFO sightings in the UK each year could be in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe MoD had a national reporting system for UFO sightings, with people reaching out to local police stations, military bases, and airports.\n\nHowever, sightings reported to the media or civilian UFO research groups were not always included in the official data.\n\nWhat to do if you spot a UFO? \u201cIf you see something, say something,\u201d Nick advises anyone who observes a UFO. He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

They probably would attribute it to a bird strike or running into a big turkey buzzard or something.\"\n\nThe spacewalker repeated his military theory to The Hill but admitted \"It's hard to say.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I think whoever was operating the drone wasn't aware that I was there.\"\n\nChiao spoke out about his thoughts regarding the spate of drones seen flying over New Jersey recently, saying it is \"hard to believe\" the government does not know what is happening.\n\nHe called for more transparency saying, \"They could tell us what they know.\"\n\n\"If they really don't know, that's a little more disconcerting,\" he said of the objects spotted over New Jersey and various sensitive US sites.\n\nMetallic orbs like those seen by Chiao are the most commonly reported sighting logged by US military witnesses, according to the director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\nDr Sean Kirkpatrick told NASA's UFO advisory group last year that these orbs have been seen \"all over the world\" adding, \"we see these making very interesting apparent manoeuvres.\"\n\n\"In all my years of flying, nobody\u2019s ever saw a UFO or something weird,\" Chiao told The Post, later adding, \"If I had been looking the other way I wouldn\u2019t have seen \u2018em. Wouldn\u2019t have felt anything.\"\n\nCHINESE SPY BOTS?\n\nMeanwhile, a top US congressman has claimed that the mystery drones that swarmed over New Jersey are likely spy bots from China.\n\nMichael McCaul said he believes that at least some of the droves are malicious surveillance from the eastern superpower.\n\nThe chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee blasted Joe Biden's administration over the lack of information about the unusual activity.\n\n\"We want answers but the response I\u2019m getting is - we don\u2019t know what these drones are,\" the Republican fumed.\n\nMcCaul added that Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator had reports saying that the drones were the size of SUVs flying over \"military sites and bases\" suggesting they are \"adversarial\" rather than \"friendly.\"\n\nMcCaul concluded: \u201cI believe they\u2019re spy drones and the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] is very good at this stuff.\n\n\u201cWe know they bought land around military bases.\n\n\u201cThis would be very consistent with their policy over the past couple years.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting answers and I think it\u2019s because our government does not know who is behind them and that is very disturbing to me,\" he added.\n\nChina has not publicly commented on the accusations.\n\n6 Chiao said he only survived the incident with the two orbs thanks to 'dumb luck' Credit: Channel 4\n\n6 Chiao called for more transparency from the Pentagon regarding the bizarre sightings Credit: Reuters"

            "article_content": "> Space\n\nAfter calls with foreign leaders, rap sessions with lawmakers, and long classified briefings with advisers, President Jimmy Carter would often escape to the roof of the White House.\n\nThere his son Jeffrey had set up a tracking telescope, Carter said in his book, A Full Life. Feeling the weight of the world, he would gaze at the stars and contemplate his place among them.\n\n\"I recall one winter night going to the White House roof to study the Orion nebulae, but we could barely see the stars, their images so paled by city lights,\" he waxed in a poem.\n\nThat particular evening, on Dec. 18, 1977, the astrophysicist Carl Sagan joined him. They had just visited the U.S. Naval Observatory next to the vice president\u2019s mansion, where they discussed all things space \u2014 planets , stars, black holes , and astrobiology . Carter himself was a man of science: He studied engineering in college and did graduate work in nuclear physics .\n\n\"It was a welcome diversion from earthly concerns,\" he wrote in a thank-you note to Sagan.\n\nCarter, who died on Dec. 29, 2024 at 100, was an avid astronomer, with a profound curiosity for the cosmos, a part of his story that isn't well-known. It began when he was a lab assistant to an astronomy teacher his freshman year in college, and it continued as he learned celestial navigation in the U.S. Navy, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. One Christmas while on a ship with his family, he asked the captain if the crew had a sextant on board, a tool for measuring the angle between the horizon and an object in the sky. The captain proceeded to show him one, he said , displayed like a museum artifact in a glass case.\n\nBut politics often eclipsed the former president's appreciation for space. Though his first budget funded the program that became NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope, Carter was maligned for not supporting human spaceflight in the vein of the Apollo program, said Steven Hochman, former special assistant to the president at the Carter Center. He was a supporter of robotic exploration and research that could benefit people's lives, but when it came to the exorbitant cost of sending astronauts into deep space , he preferred spending on domestic concerns.\n\n\"NASA, I believe, has not given him the credit he deserves,\" Hochman told Mashable. \"I believe it is because he was critical of the Space Shuttle program and didn't provide funding for future missions to the moon or Mars.\"\n\nFor years political adversaries ridiculed Carter for having a tinfoil hat, stemming from an incident in 1969 that later circulated in the press. After a Lions Club meeting in Leary, Georgia, Carter and a few other men spotted something strange moving in the sky: a luminous object, first blue then red, the apparent size and brightness of the moon . About four years later, Carter reported the unidentified flying object to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma.\n\nThough Carter never claimed to have spotted aliens or a flying saucer \u2014 to him this was literally an unknown object in the air \u2014 people snickered and mistook his UFO sighting as such. Skeptics, who likely knew nothing of Carter's astronomy background, suggested he had merely seen Venus .\n\n\"It was not Venus,\" Carter said in a 2007 interview on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast.\n\nIn fact, his UFO sighting had taken on such mythic proportions, some had wondered whether it was the reason Carter wanted NASA to investigate UFOs in 1977. Despite a White House request expressing a need to address the general UFO \"public relations problem,\" NASA had, surprisingly, declined.\n\nThe subject prompted The Journal of Scientific Exploration to invite Richard C. Henry, the agency's deputy director of astrophysics during Carter's administration, to write an essay about it more than a decade later. Henry, a semi-retired professor at Johns Hopkins University today, came to no definitive conclusions on why NASA rebuffed the White House. But, in a postscript , Henry said he sent his draft to Carter before publication in 1988.\n\n\"The most important point that you could clarify, if you will, is whether you yourself were behind (the UFO panel proposal) letter of July 21, 1977, to NASA,\" Henry wrote.\n\nBeside the sentence, Carter jotted his reply in one word: No.\n\nYet buried within Henry's paper was a small window into Carter's passion for astronomy. In November 1977, the president and his son sent a message to NASA headquarters asking to borrow a seven-inch Questar telescope. Given that there were no telescopes at headquarters \u2014 just paper, Henry said \u2014 he tried to hunt one down at another NASA campus.\n\nIt turned out Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, had one.\n\n\"By great luck, a NASA plane was flying from Huntsville to Washington the next day ([Science adviser Frank] Press was emphatic that the President wanted no special flights or other waste of taxpayer dollars),\" Henry wrote.\n\nThe NASA official and his wife, Rita Mahon, picked up the Questar at Washington National Airport and promptly took it to the White House. They then unpacked the telescope from a large wooden crate and showed the Carters how to set it up on the Truman balcony overlooking the South Lawn. The night was cloudy, but they trained on the moon.\n\nThe president then proceeded to take the telescope with him to Camp David near Thurmont, Maryland, on Nov. 23, 1977, where he and his family spent Thanksgiving, according to his daily diary . He returned it about a week later.\n\nOne has to wonder if Carter brought a telescope with him again just 10 months later, when he invited Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to join him at the retreat. The renowned talks would result in the Camp David Accords , which later earned the Middle East leaders a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThere's an amusing irony to the false urban legend that Carter believed he was visited by aliens: He is, after all, the most likely person to make humanity's introduction to extraterrestrials.\n\nSome 15.5 billion miles away from Earth, hurtling through the cold, uncharted abyss, is NASA's Voyager 1 probe. It is the farthest spacecraft from home, having left the solar system in 2012. Soaring through interstellar space at 38,000 mph , it carries a gold-plated record produced by Sagan, with a melange of sounds from the planet.\n\nCrickets. Wind. Greetings in 55 languages, from Akkadian to Wu. A mother kissing her child. These and a letter from Carter are among the recordings on the disk.\n\nThe odds of making contact with aliens, if they exist, are slight, if not insurmountable. Galaxies are spinning away from each other into the infinite unknown. The speed at which space is expanding far outpaces our technology to overcome it. It's as if the universe were contrived to keep its inhabitants apart.\n\nBut should some other intelligent life forms encounter Voyager \u2014 or Voyager 2 , which carries a duplicate record \u2014 thousands or even billions of years into the future, they will discover Carter's words:\n\n\"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings,\" he wrote. \"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\"\n\nMany knew Carter's intimate relationship with his faith. He grew up Southern Baptist, the son of a farmer in the boomtown of Plains, Georgia. He referred to himself as a born-again Christian. Long after his presidency, he attended regular church services and taught Sunday School .\n\nBut how his evangelical beliefs squared with his thoughts on the universe aren't clear. He wrote in a poem, titled \"Considering the Void:\"\n\nWhen I behold the charm / of evening skies, their lulling endurance; / the patterns of stars with names / of bears and dogs, a swan, a virgin; / other planets that our Voyager showed / were like and so unlike our own, / with all their moons, / bright discs, weird rings, and cratered faces; / comets with their streaming tails / bent by pressure from our sun; / the skyscape of our Milky Way / holding in its shimmering disc /an infinity of suns / (or say a thousand billion); / knowing there are holes of darkness / gulping mass and even light, / knowing that this galaxy of ours / is one of multitudes / in what we call the heavens, / it troubles me. It troubles me.\n\nWhat exactly was haunting Carter? Was he expressing a collision of faith and science in what lies beyond? An existential crisis of never knowing the big picture?\n\nPerhaps, as he wished, humankind will survive this time so that we may live to know more."

            "article_content": "Adam Spatacco\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWithout question, semiconductor stocks have been some of the biggest winners amid the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. While stars such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom fetch the most attention, investing in the chip sector at large during the past two years has yielded market-beating returns.\n\nAs of market close on Dec. 20, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF had gained 39% in 2024 \u2014 handily topping the returns of both the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nNevertheless, not all semiconductor stocks have fared so well. Take Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), for example \u2014 with shares up a piddling 6% in 2024, investors might think this particular chip stock is a bust.\n\nSmart investors know that looking at the return of a stock is just one variable when assessing an opportunity. Below, I'm going to dig into what has influenced Micron's price action throughout the year and make the case for why 2025 could be a rebound year for the company.\n\nMicron stock just got smoked\n\nThe chart below illustrates movement in Micron shares throughout 2024. The peaks and valleys depicted in the graph make one thing abundantly clear \u2014 Micron is pretty volatile. In particular, the last six months have been abnormally rocky with shares dropping by about 38% since June.\n\nMy take on what's causing Micron shares to experience so much volatility comes down to one thing: expectations. When businesses such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom and many others exhibit robust growth on a consistent basis, investors tend to apply these trends to other companies in the same industry.\n\nAlthough I understand the psychological factors behind these parallels, it's imperative for investors to understand that such a notion is rooted in faulty logic. Not all chip companies manufacture the same products or serve the same purpose, and for that reason, each business is going to experience its own set of unique headwinds and catalysts.\n\nMicron's position in the AI realm focuses on memory and storage applications. Although the company has had impressive top-line growth that's augmented by rising profitability, Micron's forecast for a big miss in its 2025 fiscal second quarter spooked investors.\n\nAgain, I don't necessarily see this as a reason to sell the stock. Below, I'll dig into why Micron's latest plunge is unwarranted.\n\nThe shares could rebound in 2025\n\nSince AI emerged as the world's next megatrend about two years ago, one product in particular has become the technology sector's holy grail: graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nCompanies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices develop chipsets known as GPUs that are capable of running complex algorithms at extremely high speeds, and it's this hardware that powers myriad generative AI applications. Taking this a step further, Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures GPUs for Nvidia and AMD while Broadcom supplies a host of network infrastructure equipment needed to power data centers where these GPUs are housed.\n\nWith all of that in mind, doesn't it seem natural that those specific businesses have experienced abnormally high growth during the past two years?\n\nIn my eyes, Micron just hasn't had its moment yet, but I think it's coming. Considering investments in AI infrastructure are expected to be in the trillions of dollars during the next several years, I think it's safe to say that demand for GPUs and data center services isn't going to slow.\n\nAt a more granular level, this means that training and inferencing workloads are going to become more sophisticated and mission critical as competition in the AI arms race intensifies. It's this dynamic that should result in a greater need for memory and storage protocols \u2014 and Micron is extremely well-positioned to capture that demand.\n\nThis isn't just lofty theory, either. Per Micron's 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended Nov. 28), the company's data-center revenue increased by a staggering 400% year over year and reached a record level. Furthermore, the company's data-center segment now accounts for more than 50% of the business. To me, these trends underscore the need for Micron's memory chips and I expect the tailwinds to carry into next year and beyond.\n\nAlthough the company's near-term outlook may not have lived up to expectations, I think the long-term narrative is still very much in focus. According to management, the total addressable market for high bandwidth memory is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030 \u2014 more than six times what it is today. Considering Micron's trailing-12-month revenue is in the ballpark of $29 billion, I think the company has significant upside.\n\nIs Micron stock a buy right now?\n\nValuing Micron is a daunting task. Even though the company generates positive earnings, it has only recently transitioned to a profitable enterprise and so using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seems a little out of place, in my opinion.\n\nInstead, I'll use the PEG ratio to assess an investment in Micron. The PEG ratio looks at analyst forecasts for earnings growth over several years. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, the stock could be seen as undervalued. Right now, Micron's PEG ratio is just 0.23.\n\nIn my opinion, Micron's low PEG suggests that investors could be overlooking the need for memory and storage chips as AI workloads become larger and more complex. Over time, however, I think the need for Micron's services will become increasingly obvious. To me, buying Micron right now is a bargain opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nAdam Spatacco has positions in Nvidia.

            "article_content": "The next big thing\n\nWe all know about large language models (LLMs) that are facilitating computers to generate and process big data, enabling them to respond to natural language questions. But now, small language models (SLMs), which have the capability to generate human-like language and are trained on datasets that are limited, are also becoming all the rage. It is understood that they can be trained and used easily, besides being more cost-effective and using less computational power, making them ideal for specific tasks. Big tech giants Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon and others are investing billions in developing general-purpose LLMs to handle a variety of tasks, but they might not be able to be customised for certain needs. They may require a smaller version of generative AI. Infosys chief technology officer Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar was recently quoted as saying that several small language models for India-specific needs have already been launched and with a growing developer base, a lot more GenAI applications will be implemented for Indian and global markets. Last year saw several launches of lightweight models such as Microsoft\u2019s Phi family of SLMs, Google\u2019s Gemma and a smaller variant of Meta\u2019s Llama model. Microsoft\u2019s Sundar Srinivasan was also quoted as saying that while LLMs have pushed the boundaries of accuracy across various AI tasks throughout 2024, SLMs have driven mass adoption and true democratisation of AI. Industry experts are certainly looking at SLMs as the next big thing in AI.\n\nA godfather\u2019s warning\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, a British-Canadian computer scientist who is referred to as the \u2018godfather\u2019 of AI, has raised an alarm that the technology may lead to human extinction in the next 30 years, with a 10-20% chance of that happening. Hinton was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics earlier in 2024 for his contributions to AI. In an interview to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he was quoted as saying that we\u2019ve never had to deal with things more intelligent than ourselves before discussing his evolving views on AI\u2019s potential risks. He says that the likelihood of AI causing harm has risen in recent times. \u201cAnd how many examples do you know of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing? There are very few examples. There\u2019s a mother and baby. Evolution put a lot of work into allowing the baby to control the mother, but that\u2019s about the only example I know of,\u201d he had said conceding on a previous account that he wished he\u2019d thought about safety earlier \u2013 alluding to his apprehension about the potential for AI to ramp up the arms race. Hinton has been speaking about the potential dangers of unregulated AI development after he resigned from Google in 2023. He made headlines when he left Google and raised alarms of the repercussions of machines such as AI that could one day outsmart people, adding that there is also the possibility of some bad actors exploiting AI for destructive purposes.\n\nGemini vs OpenAI\n\nThe rivalry between Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft-backed OpenAI has been escalating. According to reports, Google is set to build business and focus on Gemini AI for customers in 2025, amidst rivalry with OpenAI. As reported, its contractors are using an internal platform for comparing Gemini\u2019s outputs to those of other AI models and are relying on Claude, a family of large language models developed by Anthropic, to improve the responses provided by its own AI model. TechCrunch reported that Google contractors are given responses generated by Gemini and Claude in response to a user prompt which they have to rate within 30 minutes on factors such as truthfulness and verbosity. Meanwhile, Google recently unveiled the Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model in competition with OpenAI. In its blog, Google said that it is their \u201cmost capable model yet\u201d. \u201cWith new advances in multimodality \u2014 like native image and audio output \u2014 and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,\u201d Google said. Additionally, it launched a new feature called \u2018Deep Research\u2019, which is capable of using \u201cadvanced reasoning and long context capabilities to act as a research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports\u201d, available for Gemini\u2019s advanced subscribers.\n\nAlso Read Realme GT 7 Pro review: Great plot, predictable ending OpenAI might enter the humanoid robot: Here\u2019s all we know OpenAI announces o3, o3 Mini AI models; due for release in 2025: Details Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking: Google\u2019s AI now reasons and explains\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI, too, has unveiled new o3 and o3 mini models, which will be launched later this year. The new models are quite advanced versions and much better than its predecessors in several performance benchmarks, as per reports.\n\nAI in Mahakumbh\n\nAs AI is increasingly becoming pervasive, why should Mahakumbh be left behind? In line with the advancing tech, the Uttar Pradesh government has planned to use AI-enabled cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) wristbands and mobile app tracking to track the headcount of pilgrims at the upcoming religious carnival. Starting in Prayagraj on January 13, approximately 450 million devotees are likely to attend Mahakumbh, which is recognised by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The government will also launch a dedicated website and app, an AI-powered chatbot in 11 languages, QR code-based passes for people and vehicles, and a multilingual digital lost-and-found centre for visitors."

            "article_content": "New breakthroughs in gene editing mean that cures for genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis could be developed in the near future.\n\nGene editing technology has advanced significantly recently, off the back of a 2012 discovery.\n\nOn this week\u2019s Show Me The Science podcast, Professor Luke O\u2019Neill said that the ability to edit genes began with the discovery of CRISPR technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCRISPR was discovered by two scientists, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier... They won the Nobel Prize for this discovery, it was discovered in 2012,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe CRISPR mechanism was first seen in bacteria \u2013 often, scientists use different organisms to study things.\n\n\u201cWhat these two people discovered was the bacteria make an enzyme that can attack viral genes.\n\n\u201cNow, virus infect bacteria \u2013 virus affect all of us, of course.\n\n\u201cOur while life on Earth is affected by viruses and have genes \u2013 and it turns out bacteria have a defence mechanism against viruses.\n\n\u201cSo, the virus goes into the bacteria - the bacteria makes this thing called CAS - CAS locks onto the viral DNA and edits it, chops it out basically.\u201d\n\nProf O\u2019Neill said that this discovery can be used to clip and correct genes in various ways.\n\nAccording to Prof O\u2019Neill, the first approval for a CRISPR gene editing therapy was handed out in the UK in November for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia, which limits the body\u2019s supply of haemoglobin.\n\n\u201cPeople with this disease, it\u2019s awful, very painful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen, the severe end, you can die from it, right? So, the question became, could you correct that broken gene?\n\n\u201cThe gene is broken \u2013 you're getting broken haemoglobin and now these sickle cells are there and they can\u2019t carry oxygen and you get sickle cell disease.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a second disease called transfusion dependent beta thalassemia \u2013 and again, that\u2019s a dodginess in the gene for the haemoglobin as part of this as well.\n\n\u201cThe CRISPR people thought, can we correct the haemoglobin? And indeed we can.\n\n\u201cWhat they do here is they correct the broken gene and now you get a normal haemoglobin and then you\u2019re fine and you don\u2019t have sickle cell disease anymore.\u201d\n\nHowever, Prof O\u2019Neill said that with this method, there had been a concern that the wrong gene could be hit.\n\nNew breakthrough\n\nNow though, Lithuanian scientists have come up with a new technology which massages the gene instead of chopping it out.\n\n\u201cIt relaxes the DNA double helix and now the gene doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t get expressed,\u201d Prof O\u2019Neill said.\n\n\u201cIf you take it away, the gene goes back to normal. So what we have here is a reversible way to do this.\n\n\u201cJust in case something untoward happens, you can withdraw the therapy, and so therefore it\u2019s likely to be a bit safer \u2013 this is the idea.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prof O\u2019Neill, this new development could help to treat a range of genetic diseases in the near future.\n\nFeatured image: Split image showing Luke O'Neill (L) and red DNA strands (R)."

            "article_content": "The next big thing\n\nWe all know about large language models (LLMs) that are facilitating computers to generate and process big data, enabling them to respond to natural language questions. But now, small language models (SLMs), which have the capability to generate human-like language and are trained on datasets that are limited, are also becoming all the rage. It is understood that they can be trained and used easily, besides being more cost-effective and using less computational power, making them ideal for specific tasks. Big tech giants Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon and others are investing billions in developing general-purpose LLMs to handle a variety of tasks, but they might not be able to be customised for certain needs. They may require a smaller version of generative AI. Infosys chief technology officer Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar was recently quoted as saying that several small language models for India-specific needs have already been launched and with a growing developer base, a lot more GenAI applications will be implemented for Indian and global markets. Last year saw several launches of lightweight models such as Microsoft\u2019s Phi family of SLMs, Google\u2019s Gemma and a smaller variant of Meta\u2019s Llama model. Microsoft\u2019s Sundar Srinivasan was also quoted as saying that while LLMs have pushed the boundaries of accuracy across various AI tasks throughout 2024, SLMs have driven mass adoption and true democratisation of AI. Industry experts are certainly looking at SLMs as the next big thing in AI.\n\nA godfather\u2019s warning\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, a British-Canadian computer scientist who is referred to as the \u2018godfather\u2019 of AI, has raised an alarm that the technology may lead to human extinction in the next 30 years, with a 10-20% chance of that happening. Hinton was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics earlier in 2024 for his contributions to AI. In an interview to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he was quoted as saying that we\u2019ve never had to deal with things more intelligent than ourselves before discussing his evolving views on AI\u2019s potential risks. He says that the likelihood of AI causing harm has risen in recent times. \u201cAnd how many examples do you know of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing? There are very few examples. There\u2019s a mother and baby. Evolution put a lot of work into allowing the baby to control the mother, but that\u2019s about the only example I know of,\u201d he had said conceding on a previous account that he wished he\u2019d thought about safety earlier \u2013 alluding to his apprehension about the potential for AI to ramp up the arms race. Hinton has been speaking about the potential dangers of unregulated AI development after he resigned from Google in 2023. He made headlines when he left Google and raised alarms of the repercussions of machines such as AI that could one day outsmart people, adding that there is also the possibility of some bad actors exploiting AI for destructive purposes.\n\nGemini vs OpenAI\n\nThe rivalry between Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft-backed OpenAI has been escalating. According to reports, Google is set to build business and focus on Gemini AI for customers in 2025, amidst rivalry with OpenAI. As reported, its contractors are using an internal platform for comparing Gemini\u2019s outputs to those of other AI models and are relying on Claude, a family of large language models developed by Anthropic, to improve the responses provided by its own AI model. TechCrunch reported that Google contractors are given responses generated by Gemini and Claude in response to a user prompt which they have to rate within 30 minutes on factors such as truthfulness and verbosity. Meanwhile, Google recently unveiled the Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model in competition with OpenAI. In its blog, Google said that it is their \u201cmost capable model yet\u201d. \u201cWith new advances in multimodality \u2014 like native image and audio output \u2014 and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,\u201d Google said. Additionally, it launched a new feature called \u2018Deep Research\u2019, which is capable of using \u201cadvanced reasoning and long context capabilities to act as a research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports\u201d, available for Gemini\u2019s advanced subscribers.\n\nAlso Read Realme GT 7 Pro review: Great plot, predictable ending OpenAI might enter the humanoid robot: Here\u2019s all we know OpenAI announces o3, o3 Mini AI models; due for release in 2025: Details Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking: Google\u2019s AI now reasons and explains\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI, too, has unveiled new o3 and o3 mini models, which will be launched later this year. The new models are quite advanced versions and much better than its predecessors in several performance benchmarks, as per reports.\n\nAI in Mahakumbh\n\nAs AI is increasingly becoming pervasive, why should Mahakumbh be left behind? In line with the advancing tech, the Uttar Pradesh government has planned to use AI-enabled cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) wristbands and mobile app tracking to track the headcount of pilgrims at the upcoming religious carnival. Starting in Prayagraj on January 13, approximately 450 million devotees are likely to attend Mahakumbh, which is recognised by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The government will also launch a dedicated website and app, an AI-powered chatbot in 11 languages, QR code-based passes for people and vehicles, and a multilingual digital lost-and-found centre for visitors."

            "article_content": "OpenAI has unveiled a new update for ChatGPT, allowing users to interact with the popular bot not only via computer or mobile apps but also through phone calls and text messages. The service can be accessed using the number 1-800-CHATGPT or 1-800-242-8478.\n\nThis new feature enables users to engage in direct voice conversations with the system instead of typing questions and commands through a computer interface or mobile app. The service provides 15 minutes of free usage each month, during which users can ask questions, request explanations, or seek assistance on various topics in which ChatGPT specializes, such as problem-solving, quick answers, or advice across different fields.\n\nOne of the notable advantages of this service is that no user account is required to make a call, making it accessible to those who are not registered or are unfamiliar with advanced technologies. Furthermore, OpenAI announced that it is developing a new mechanism to integrate WhatsApp messages with users' personal ChatGPT accounts. This integration will allow synchronization and preservation of interaction history across different channels, enhancing the user experience.\n\nThe main idea behind this service is to make ChatGPT more accessible to a broader audience through everyday channels like phone calls and text messages, enabling users from all backgrounds and locations to communicate with the system simply, quickly, and conveniently. The service is particularly suitable for individuals who prefer voice interaction or are not accustomed to using advanced apps or interfaces. ft, and Amazon (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)\n\nThis update is part of a release of 12 significant updates, during which OpenAI also launched Sora, an innovative AI-based video creation tool that has garnered significant attention. Additionally, the company is implementing an aggressive growth strategy, including hiring a chief marketing officer and introducing new features such as a built-in search engine designed to compete with leading search services like Google.\n\nThese updates occur against the backdrop of growing competition in the generative AI market, expected to reach revenues of one trillion dollars within a decade. OpenAI is competing with tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic. In October, OpenAI completed a funding round valuing the company at $157 billion, securing a $4 billion credit line, bringing its liquidity to over $10 billion.\n\nThe new 1-800-CHATGPT service, as mentioned, offers simple access without requiring a user account. However, the company has updated that it is working on developing a mechanism to integrate WhatsApp messages with users\u2019 ChatGPT accounts. During a live broadcast unveiling the new service, it was revealed that the tool was developed \"in just a few weeks.\" The service is expected to expand ChatGPT's user base, solidifying its position as a leader in the AI market."

            "article_content": "A recent article in the journal Nature described the new Google-backed artificial intelligence tool GenCast, which can significantly outperform conventional weather forecasting \u2014 with implications for saving money and lives by improving preparations for extreme weather.\n\nAnnounced in early December, GenCast is a machine-learning model that boasts \"better forecasts of both day-to-day weather and extreme events\" than existing systems.\n\nThe technology, developed by the Google-owned company DeepMind, based in London, improves forecasting accuracy for up to 15 days into the future \u2014 a time frame that traditional models have found problematic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a big deal,\" Kerry Emanuel, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor emeritus, told The New York Times.\n\nThe newspaper explained that Emanuel and colleagues argued in 2019 that extending the time for reliable forecasts from 10 days to 15 days could help people avoid the worst of extreme weather and reap \"enormous socioeconomic benefits.\"\n\nAs the Times detailed, the \"chaotic nature of Earth's atmosphere\" has historically put limits on how far into the future forecasters can peer accurately. GenCast achieved higher accuracy in tests using historical data against a current standard-bearer, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\n\nAccording to the Times, the new model also \"ran circles\" around its DeepMind predecessor, released in late 2023. \"It's like we've made decades worth of improvements in one year,\" R\u00e9mi Lam, who worked on both models, said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother improvement: GenCast is a \"probabilistic\" model rather than a \"deterministic\" one \u2014 meaning that it gives probabilities for outcomes rather than just yes/no predictions. This is the difference between a forecast with a percent chance of precipitation and a forecast that simply gives a best guess of whether it will rain at a particular time and place.\n\nGenCast can also use smaller computers and produce results faster than conventional forecasting methods. Yet it still relies on traditional meteorology. The new tool uses AI's ability to pick out patterns from data and create something new, but it's anchored by 40 years of real-world data and current-day measurements, the Times reported.\n\nLam pointed out how this makes GenCast's results less susceptible to some fallacies of other AI products that train on the internet's chaos of facts and fictions. \"We have a ground truth,\" Lam told the Times.\n\nAmong other concerns, AI has been criticized for its massive energy needs. This is particularly a problem if the energy comes from sources that release heat-trapping gases that in turn cause planetary warming and amplify extreme weather.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeepMind has argued that its application of the technology will help people deal with the consequences of changing weather patterns.\n\n\"Weather impacts all of us,\" GenCast's announcement stated. \"As climate change drives more extreme weather events, accurate and trustworthy forecasts are more essential than ever.\"\n\n\"... Consider tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes and typhoons. Getting better and more advanced warnings of where they'll strike land is invaluable.\"\n\nThe DeepMind researchers highlighted how GenCast could also help the field of clean energy, such as by better predicting the reliability of wind power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith DeepMind opening its models to the public, the world may not need to wait long for it to have influence.\n\nForecasters are interested in using the model. Matthew Chantry, a machine learning coordinator at ECMWF, told the Times that his center was already incorporating aspects of the tech.\n\n\"We are eager to engage with the wider weather community,\" two of DeepMind's lead researchers wrote in their blog. They acknowledged that such collaborations \"are critical to our mission to apply our models to benefit humanity.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Despite some episodic spikes here and there, the economy of Bangladesh is still struggling, and the government isn't sure what the top priority should be. Businesses are under pressure as inflation rises beyond 9 percent and GDP growth slows to 5.2 percent in FY24 with further downward trend.\n\nAs we know, family-run and promoter-led firms dominate the Bangladesh economy, especially in the textile, export and manufacturing industries. Nearly 4 million people work in the readymade garment industry alone. Many company leaders/owners have been put behind bars or are absconding due to recent upheavals, which have interrupted operations and made decision-making more time-consuming. Further degradation will cause closures, pay reductions, and rapid layoffs.\n\nIn response to similar problems, nations like Vietnam and India offered financial aid and tax breaks to save domestic companies. But Bangladesh rather eliminated incentives and reportedly raising taxes, which may make recovery far more challenging.\n\nWhat's at stake if large companies fail?\n\nThe collapse of large companies would shock Bangladesh's job market. Over 80 percent of formal occupations are directly or indirectly related to these companies. Layoffs will cause families to experience immediate financial instability and income loss.\n\nNot only the manufacturing industry but also transporters, raw material suppliers, port personnel, and logistics providers would all see a sharp drop in business, which would result in a large number of job losses. The loss of jobs in the unorganised sector, which is heavily reliant on the spending power of those in corporate occupations, would make poverty worse.\n\nThe economy as a whole will suffer from a deteriorating labour market. As incomes decline, consumer spending will also decline, which will force more businesses to shut down or scale back operations. There will be more protests and strikes, which will lead to higher unemployment rates and more instability in society. Similar periods of political and economic instability have been experienced by nations like Pakistan and Sri Lanka as a result of delayed interventions. Bangladesh is unable to afford to take the same path.\n\nWhat the government must do now\n\nLarge companies and promoters need immediate breathing space to survive. The government must step in with low-interest loans, deferred taxes, and grace periods for repayments. Vietnam saved thousands of businesses this way. Bangladesh must act similarly to prevent layoffs and closures. Investment incentives must also be restored to attract capital and revive confidence in economic zones that are now stagnant.\n\nThe workforce needs skill development badly. Mismatched skills keep 40 percent of graduates unemployed. The 'Skill India' mission trained millions and increased employment. Bangladesh must duplicate such initiatives to prepare its workers.\n\nReviving clothing export orders necessitates careful attention. Simplifying trade regulations, offering export incentives, and lowering transportation costs can all help. Vietnam invested $1.2 billion in textiles to compete; Bangladesh must do the same or risk falling behind.\n\nEqually important is simplifying regulations. Endless red tape slows corporate growth and hiring. To grow and stabilise employment, the government must streamline processes.\n\nA last chance to act\n\nBangladesh's large companies don't just create jobs -- they sustain entire ecosystems. If these companies collapse, millions of jobs will vanish, poverty rates will spike, and social unrest will escalate. Countries like Vietnam and India acted fast to prevent such outcomes with bold interventions. Bangladesh, however, risks falling further behind if it continues to delay action.\n\nThe time for hesitation is over. The government must step up with financial support, regulatory reforms, and investment incentives to protect jobs and stabilise corporations. Employment must be prioritised to prevent economic disaster and ensure Bangladesh's long-term recovery. Reconstituting boards or temporarily releasing funds to ailing banks would not help. Business continuity, including corporate and large loan restructuring for distressed companies, is key here. Policy makers need to think beyond and act sensibly.\n\nThe author is chairman of Financial Excellence Ltd"

Now, ECS has become the first manufacturer to confirm plans to unveil a product featuring AMD's mainstream-focused Krackan Point chips at CES 2025.\n\nECS is set to showcase the first laptop featuring AMD's upcoming Krackan Point APUs at CES 2025. AMD has already confirmed that Krackan Point is designed to offer a low-cost entry point into Microsoft's Copilot+ PC standard, positioning it to compete with Intel's Lunar Lake Core Ultra 200V series.\n\nThe processor powering the ECS UP42KP laptop is likely the Ryzen AI 7 350. The manufacturer's description matches the rumored specifications of this chip, which include four Zen 5 cores, four Zen 5c cores, an integrated GPU with eight RDNA 3.5 compute units, and an XDNA 2 NPU capable of 40 TOPs \u2013 meeting the threshold required for Copilot.\n\nWith a TDP ranging from 15W to 54W, the 14-inch 1080p laptop supports DDR5-5600 RAM, 16 PCIe lanes, Wi-Fi 6, HDMI 2.1, and USB 4. It also supports Windows Hello via an IR camera with a privacy shutter. While the release date and pricing details remain unclear, AMD aims for Krackan Point devices to retail for under $800.\n\nThe Ryzen AI 7 350 is the most powerful Krackan Point APU announced so far, but a lower-tier version \u2013 the AI 5 340 \u2013 was spotted on Geekbench last November. This cheaper variant will maintain the AI 7 350's NPU performance but feature three Zen 5 cores, three Zen 5c cores, and a Radeon 840M iGPU with four RDNA 3.5 CUs.\n\nKrackan Point sits just below Strix Point in AMD's Zen 5 lineup. Since its debut late last year, Strix Point APUs, such as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375, have started appearing in the latest handheld gaming PCs. Lenovo is expected to unveil a device featuring the Z2 Extreme variant at CES.\n\nRyzen AI Max, featuring up to 16 Zen 5 cores and 40 RDNA 3.5 CUs, is the next step up. A benchmark of an engineering sample was recently spotted running on an upcoming high-end 2-in-1 notebook from Asus.\n\nUsers are also eagerly awaiting the launch of AMD's Fire Range, the company's most powerful Zen 5 laptop processors. A recent Geekbench AI test suggests they will debut in Asus' 2025 ROG Strix G-series laptops.\n\nIn the desktop sector, AMD is also set to unveil new Ryzen 9000 X3D CPUs this month. TechSpot recently named last year's 9800X3D the best gaming CPU, and it has outpaced all of its non-X3D counterparts in sales at Mindfactory.\n\nThe new ECS Krackan Point laptop will be accompanied by a new Snapdragon X Plus notebook, a mini PC, and new Intel motherboards."

Having earned certifications from AWS and Oracle, he has continuously kept up with the latest developments in technology. Projects like improving the backbone for telecom operators, redesigning the middleware architecture of TelePacific Systems, and developing a unified IT platform for the City of Tshwane in South Africa are just a few examples of his technical proficiency. Krishna's ability to use creative IT solutions to address intricate, systemic inefficiencies is demonstrated by the latter, a massive project to digitize and integrate government operations.\n\nIn his current role, Krishna has produced quantifiable effects at the organizational level. For example, his efforts in internal application security have doubled the system's order handling capacity, resulting in 50% shorter processing times and a 100% increase in transaction rates. Improved service delivery and cost savings are directly correlated with this efficiency. Likewise, his hybrid cloud designs for medical devices guaranteed adherence to international regulatory standards while protecting against data breaches.\n\nHowever, Krishna's career has been fraught with difficulties. For example, integrating legacy systems with contemporary platforms necessitated creative approaches to data processing and security. He maintained their relevance in an age of rapid technological advancement by ensuring smooth communication across disparate systems through the use of tools like RESTful services and API gateways.\n\nThe significance of proactive planning and resilience in IT architecture is highlighted by Krishna's predictions about future trends. He promotes integrating modern technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve operational dependability and security. Moreover, his emphasis on continuous training for IT professionals reflects his recognition of the dynamic nature of security threats and compliance requirements.\n\nReflecting on his experience, Krishna asserts, \u201cIn IT architecture, the key to solving tomorrow\u2019s challenges lies in anticipating them today. Innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies but designing systems that are secure, adaptable, and prepared for the unexpected. This idea acts as a compass for businesses attempting to negotiate the intricacies of integration architecture in a digital environment that is changing quickly.\n\nKrishna has shown through his work that innovation and successfully tackling IT challenges depend heavily on careful design and strategic foresight. As industries continue to change, experts like him establish the benchmark for excellence in integration architecture, helping businesses to accomplish their strategic and operational goals."

The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert has lifted the lid on some of his wildest encounters as we reveal the top five hotspots in the UK.\n\nNick Pope, who previously ran the British Government\u2019s UFO Project, spoke about his experiences with extraterrestrial life in an exclusive chat with The Sun.\n\n4 Nick Pope is former head of the MoD's UFO research programme Credit: Chris Loomis / National Geographic\n\n4 Nick lifted the lid on some extraterrestrial mysteries\n\n4\n\nFor over two decades, Nick worked as a civilian employee at the MoD, with his most prominent role beginning in the early 1990s, where he ran the department's UFO program.\n\nNick was at the helm of the project, an initiative that monitored and investigated reports of unidentified flying objects to assess their potential impact on national security and aviation safety.\n\nAlthough the program was never formally named, it was often referred to as the \u201cUFO desk\u201d or \u201cUFO program\u201d by a number of media outlets.\n\nWhen looking at the distribution of these sightings across the UK, Nick and his team discovered that the hotspots were not necessarily the rural or remote locations that many assumed.\n\nNick told The Sun: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because when we mapped out the UFO sightings, they didn\u2019t necessarily occur in remote, rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe hotspots were often London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow \u2013 all the major cities and urban areas.\n\n\"The reason for this is simple - the more people there are in an area, the more likely someone is to spot something unusual in the sky.\u201d\n\nThese cities, with their dense populations, provided more potential witnesses.\n\nIt meant that if something strange appeared in the sky, the chances of someone witnessing it were far higher.\n\nNick also notes that other areas, like Warminster have been known for their frequent UFO sightings.\n\n\u201cPeople used to go up Cradle Hill and Flea Hill in Warminster, and even some 1960s pop songs referenced the place,\u201d he added.\n\nBonnybridge, in Scotland, saw a huge surge in UFO sightings in the 1990s, to the extent that local councillor Billy Buchanan lobbied the government for an inquiry.\n\n\u201cI ended up drafting the replies to Buchanan\u2019s letters, which were sent to the Ministry of Defence,\u201d Nick recalls.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t very happy with me because the government line was always to play down the significance of UFO sightings.\u201d\n\nDespite the official stance, Nick acknowledges that Bonnybridge was, indeed, a hotspot.\n\nPilots told they\u2019re \u2018cleared to manoeuvre to avoid the UFO\u2019 in eerie audio as \u2018strange\u2019 lights spark fears in Oregon\n\nHowever, Nick also cautions against confirmation bias, adding: \u201cWhen people go to these hotspots for sky watches, they may already be believers, which can affect how they perceive what they see.\n\n\"They may be more likely to misperceive something or to see what they expect to see.\u201d\n\nAnother factor is the issue of light pollution in cities, which can obscure the view of the sky.\n\nDespite this, urban areas remained UFO hotspots due to the sheer number of potential witnesses.\n\nEven more intriguing, Nick pointed out, was the fact that UFO sightings seemed to cluster around military bases, particularly air force bases.\n\nWhile some argue that these sightings are due to secret military aircraft or advanced aerospace technology, the fact remains that military bases are more heavily surveilled, and the likelihood of sightings there is higher.\n\nFrom Rendlesham Forest to Cosford, Nick has worked on some of the most high-profile cases in UFO history, all while trying to navigate the Ministry\u2019s official stance on the phenomenon.\n\nAnd according to Nick, the number of UFO sightings reported in the UK was far higher than most people realise with reports representing only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"We\u2019d get about 200 to 300 reports a year, and at its peak, that number went up to 700 or 800,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBut even that number is misleading because many sightings went unreported due to fear of ridicule or simply not knowing who to contact.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Nick believes the actual number of UFO sightings in the UK each year could be in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe MoD had a national reporting system for UFO sightings, with people reaching out to local police stations, military bases, and airports.\n\nHowever, sightings reported to the media or civilian UFO research groups were not always included in the official data.\n\nWhat to do if you spot a UFO? \u201cIf you see something, say something,\u201d Nick advises anyone who observes a UFO. He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

            "article_content": "LONDON, Jan 4 \u2014 A top-secret lab in the UK is developing the country\u2019s first quantum clock to help the British military boost intelligence and reconnaissance operations, the defence ministry said Thursday.\n\nThe clock is so precise that it will lose less than one second over billions of years, \u201callowing scientists to measure time at an unprecedented scale,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe trialling of this emerging, groundbreaking technology could not only strengthen our operational capability, but also drive progress in industry, bolster our science sector and support high-skilled jobs,\u201d Minister for Defence Procurement Maria Eagle said.\n\nThe groundbreaking technology by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory will reduce reliance on GPS technology, which \u201ccan be disrupted and blocked by adversaries,\u201d the ministry added.\n\nIt is not a world first, as the University of Colorado at Boulder developed a quantum clock 15 years ago with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nBut it is \u201cthe first device of its kind to be built in the UK,\u201d the statement said, adding it could be deployed by the military \u201cin the next five years\u201d.\n\nA quantum clock uses quantum mechanics \u2014 the physics of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale \u2014 to keep time with unprecedented accuracy by measuring energy fluctuations within atoms.\n\nAccurate timekeeping is crucial for satellite navigation systems, mobile telephones and digital TV, among other applications, and may open new frontiers in research fields such as quantum science.\n\nCompanies and governments around the world are keen to cash in on the huge potential benefits quantum technology could bring.\n\nGoogle last month unveiled a new quantum computing chip it said could do in minutes what it would take leading supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete.\n\nThe United States and China are investing heavily in quantum research, and the US administration has imposed tight restrictions on exporting such sensitive technology.\n\nOne expert, Olivier Ezratty, told AFP in October that private and public investment in such technology had reached US$20 billion (RM90 billion) during the past five years.\n\nThe defence ministry said future research would \u201csee the technology decrease in size to allow mass manufacturing and miniaturisation, unlocking a wide range of applications, such as use by military vehicles and aircraft\u201d. \u2014 Reuters"

            "article_content": "Students of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) have staged a protest demanding the abolition of discriminatory quotas in the university's admission exams and a reduction in various fees.\n\nThe protest took place on the university premises at 4:30 pm today (4 January).\n\nThe students called for the elimination of all types of discriminatory quotas, as well as a reduction in admission, semester, and credit fees.\n\nArman, a student from the Department of Political Studies, said: \"Discrimination has not yet been eradicated in the country. While the admission fee for the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) exam has been reduced to Tk200, it is unacceptable that students are being charged an application fee of Tk1,200.\"\n\n\"We urged the university administration to reduce all types of fees as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nMohammad Shakil, a student from the Department of Sociology, said \"The discrimination we aimed to eliminate for a fairer society has not ended. The main goal of the July Movement was to properly assess merit, but quotas continue to take precedence over merit. This contradicts the very spirit of the July Revolution.\"\n\nHe added, 'Only quotas for backward communities should remain, but the students admitted under the meritorious quota mostly come from highly educated and wealthy families. This is extreme discrimination, and it is an insult to the martyrs of the July Revolution.'\"\n\nKiran Hawlader, a student from the Department of Chemical Engineering and Polymer Science, said: \"We have been demanding a reduction in application, admission, semester, and credit fees for a long time.\"\n\n\"Although the university administration has given assurances, no action has been taken so far.\"\n\n\"We are warning that we should not have to take to the streets to resolve issues that can be settled through dialogue,\" Kiran added.\n\nThe protesters have called for the postponement of the application process, which is scheduled to begin on 5 January, until the fees are revised."
