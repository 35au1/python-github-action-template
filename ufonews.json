        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 sheds light on the controversial Roswell UFO crash incident of 1947. On one hand, the government allegedly covered up the truth by claiming that it was an experimental balloon aircraft that crashed. On the other hand, UFO enthusiasts believed that in addition to the crashing of an actual UFO, bodies of aliens were also recovered. The episode consists of in-depth interviews with some of the experts in the field, including Donald Schmitt, who shared his opinion on the subject.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Made Significant Contributions to UFO Research\n\nDonald Raymond Schmitt\u2019s journey to success was not short or easy. After graduating from Hartford Union High School, he earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree from Concordia University Wisconsin. He also attended Milwaukee Area Technical College for higher studies. Given his interest in UFOs and related subjects, he organized five archaeological dig projects at the 1947 Rowell crash site, with the first one in 1989. The next two digs came after more than a decade, in 2002, followed by 2006. The previous two digs were conducted in 2013 and 2016. His efforts were so impressive that the central theme of \u2018The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence\u2019 was based on the second dig.\n\nIn the 1970s, Donald used to work as a special investigator for the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the art director for the International UFO Reporter and the scientific consultant to the Air Force Project Blue Book. So, when the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in Chicago was founded, he became the Director of Special Investigations and retired from the post after serving for a decade. Apart from being a member of Holy Hill Basilica Choir, he was also the president of Hartford Community Chorus at some point. Donald was also employed at Bloom and Associates as an art director/consultant and at Stellar Productions. Formerly, he was also the Wisconsin State Director of MUFON.\n\nInterestingly, he also co-produced the 2020 documentary \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which centers on the unidentified aerial phenomenon. Starting in 2019, he is a co-founder of the International Coalition on Extraterrestrial Research (ICER), where he serves as the North American Representative. Furthermore, he is currently the co-founder of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. There, he is appointed as a board advisor and a lead investigator.\n\nThe Best-Selling Author\u2019s Debut Book is Now a Golden Globe-Nominated Movie\n\nDonald R. Schmitt has also dabbled in the field of writing and has authored several books. The former special investigator published his debut book, \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 in 1991, sharing the title of co-author with Kevin D. Randle. Chronicling the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, the book garnered several eyeballs and ended up getting adapted into a movie for the screen by Arthur L. Kopit and Jeremy Kagan for the latter\u2019s movie, \u2018Roswell.\u2019 Starring Kyle MacLachlan and Martin Sheen in pivotal roles, the 1994 film also earned a nomination for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at the Golden Globes in 1995. Interestingly, the Golden Globe nod is what Donald considers his most remarkable accomplishment in life.\n\nOver the years, he has made great strides in the world of writing by not only penning his observations in articles but also full-fledged books. Another of his books, \u2018Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up,\u2019 which he co-authored with Thomas J. Carey, sat on the throne of the top-selling UFO-themed book across the globe for two years \u2014 2007 and 2008. According to reports, Stellar Productions has optioned the book for the movie, \u2018Majic Men.\u2019 Donald has earned the title of best-selling author not once nor twice but seven times (author/co-author) for many of his titles, such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell,\u2019 \u2018Roswell: The Chronological Pictorial,\u2019 \u2018The Children of Roswell,\u2019 and \u2018Inside the Real Area 51.\u2019 Not just that, Donald has also graced the television screens to share his insight on all things UFO by featuring on \u2018Oprah,\u2019 \u2018CBS 48 Hours,\u2019 \u2018Larry King Live,\u2019 and many more.\n\nDonald Schmitt and His Wife Lead a Private Yet Fulfilling Married Life\n\nThough the professional life of Donald R Schmitt is in the public eye, the personal aspects are something he prefers to keep private. He has been blessed with the companionship of his lovely wife of many years, Marie, and together they have weaved a beautiful life with love, compassion, and understanding. The investigative author has never hesitated to profess his affection and gratitude for his wife for all the support and faith she has shown for and in him since they tied the knot.\n\nIn fact, a testament to that would be the heartwarming shout-out he gave the love of his life in the Acknowledgement section of his 2017 book, titled \u2018Cover-Up at Roswell: Exposing the 70-Year Conspiracy to Suppress the Truth.\u2019 It read: \u201cAnd finally, I will shout it from the highest roof that I am truly blessed with a wife who loves me for being me.\u201d Apart from the fact that his father passed on before his mother, Viola, not much is known about his familial life. As of writing, Donald and his wife seemingly reside in their peaceful ranch in the small community of Hubertus in Washington County, Wisconsin.\n\nRead More: Kevin Randle: Where is the Ufologist Now?"

        "article_content": "Many a horror franchise has been temporarily goosed by an injection of sci-fi \u2014 even the slasher at the center of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d series went into orbit in the 2001 \u201cJason X\u201d \u2014 but that element doesn\u2019t do a lot to distinguish \u201cV/H/S/Beyond.\u201d This seventh entry in the ersatz found-footage omnibus series should be another reliable draw for genre platform Shudder, where it begins streaming Oct. 4. And the ongoing overall enterprise continues to have value as a launching pad for up-and-coming talents. But despite its new thematic wrinkle, the five segments here feel familiar in ideas and unmemorable in execution. It\u2019s a middling addition to a variably inspired anthology brand that will no doubt trundle on through more installments yet.\n\nThe wraparound device, directed by Canadian documentarian Jay Cheel, mingles interviews with real-life UFO enthusiasts and skeptics, also throwing in passing mentions of highlights in the history of alleged abductions, plus clips from popular representations (including vintage drive-in camp \u201cEarth vs. the Flying Saucers\u201d). There\u2019s also a fictive element in discussing a man\u2019s disappearance from his family\u2019s home, leaving behind VHS tapes of a supposed \u201calien encounter\u201d that we finally see at the film\u2019s end.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe first three regular sequences are a little too alike, in that they all escalate quickly to frenzied, bloody action confused by the found-footage subgenre\u2019s usual hectic first-person camerawork. In Jordan Downey\u2019s \u201cStork,\u201d a squad of police raid a dilapidated house amid rampant baby kidnappings. Before finding what they\u2019re looking for, they must battle adults who\u2019ve basically turned into fast-moving zombies. Virit Pal\u2019s \u201cDream Girl\u201d has two paparazzi (Syandeep Sengupta and Rohan Joshi) sneaking onto a Mumbai film set, then into the trailer of \u201csuperstar Tara\u201d (Namrata Sheth) to snap some \u201ccandids.\u201d Alas, they discover a little too much about her, leading to another gory melee. Justin Martinez\u2019s \u201cLive and Let Dive\u201d finds skittish Zach (Bobby Slaski) coerced into skydiving with friends to mark his 30th birthday. Unfortunately, their plane gets caught between an alien spaceship and pursuing government aircraft, with the survivors facing related new perils once they\u2019ve crash-landed in an orchard below.\n\nEach is a bit better than the last, but these splattery scenarios nonetheless feel like the same thing in different settings \u2014 preliminary jitters, then carnage and monsters \u2014 only somewhat alleviated by the novelty of \u201cStork\u201d\u2019s surreal climactic attic tableau, \u201cGirl\u201d\u2019s Bollywood musical number, or \u201cDive\u201d\u2019s alarming creature design.\n\nThere is definitely a shift in approach with siblings Christian and Justin Long\u2019s \u201cFur Babies,\u201d but this more comedic miniature is also the collection\u2019s worst episode. Libby Letlow plays the gratingly chirpy proprietress for \u201cDoggy Dreamhouse,\u201d a canine boarding facility some animal rights activists suspect of being abusive. But when they send members incognito to spy on her, it turns out her harshest \u201ctraining\u201d is largely reserved for two-legged captives. Though it eventually tips towards silliness of a \u201cIsland of Dr. Moreau\u201d-esque stripe, the intended satire here of both simpering pet pamperers and PETA-style fanatics is painfully broad.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s actor Kate Siegel\u2019s latest collaboration with spouse Mike Flanagan, this one her first as director, while he is the writer. (They previously co-wrote the screenplay for his very good 2016 feature \u201cHush,\u201d in which she starred.) That definitely ups the expectations for \u201cStowaway,\u201d a slow burn with Alanah Pearce as Halley, a woman interviewing locals around \u201cknown UFO hotspot\u201d the Mohave Desert for a documentary \u2014 though whether she\u2019s sincerely interested or secretly ridiculing them, we\u2019re not sure.\n\nFlanagan\u2019s script offers this \u201cV/H/S\u201d entry\u2019s only stab at character nuance by hinting that our heroine arrived at this isolated place and task by having already burned every other bridge in her life. In any case, camping out one night, she investigates unusual lights in the distance, ultimately entering some kind of alien craft. But just what happens to her there is so murkily visualized (in sharpest contrast to the arguably over-sharp bodycam imagery in \u201cStork\u201d) that the segment just kind of floats off into fuzzy obscurity. Intriguing and frustrating in the general realm of \u201cSkinamarink\u201d\u2019s twilight-zone dread, it requires patience yet doesn\u2019t quite go anywhere definite enough to reward that effort fully.\n\nThe found-footage format can grow repetitious fast, and too much of \u201cBeyond\u201d degenerates into chaotic chase/attack set-pieces that feel interchangeable in their shaky cams and barely coherent action. The energy is high \u2026 but high energy can get monotonous, too. Actors running around screaming aren\u2019t all that effective (or convincing, as supposedly \u201creal\u201d people filming themselves) sans sufficient setup in terms of character involvement, ominous atmosphere or narrative engagement. While the individual conceits here are workable enough \u2014 even if two of them really have no connection to the ostensible UFO theme \u2014 nearly all head toward variations on the same shrill bloodbath, suggesting future \u201cV/H/S\u201d chapters might do better to re-focus on inventive writing rather than simply providing disparate excuses for gory mayhem.\n\nThat said, this competent if mostly forgettable effort\u2019s strongest elements are in exactly that department. Though their handiwork is often glimpsed too briefly, special makeup effects designer Patrick Magee and VFX supervisor Justin Martinez (both credited for the entire feature) contribute some vividly icky, grotesque images."

The second light then disappears, only to reappear to the left of the first light.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s three, there\u2019s three!\u201d a child says.\n\n\u201cFour!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d an excited voice adds.\n\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d\n\nThe video switches to a night vision camera, which makes the lights\u2019 disappearance and reappearance even more phenomenal.\n\nPlay Video UFOs captured in the skies over White Hills south of Perth UFOs captured in the skies over White Hills south of Perth\n\nThe video\u2019s owner noted that: \u201cThis was witnessed by many people along the West Coast of Australia\u201d.\n\nIt was posted on the Perth UFO sightings earlier this week and attracted more than 100 comments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who has been into astronomy for 30+ years. I am very familiar with the sky and most things people confuse for UFO\u2019s,\u201d one member commented.\n\n\u201cThis footage, however, is the first I can\u2019t explain.

I rang the water police thinking it was a flare. I was told there we several calls and that it was likely space debris. I saw it about 5 times in the space of 10 minutes,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nA third video was captured over Forrestfield on Thursday night and the woman who shot the footage wrote: \u201cSaw these lights from the sky 9.30 Forrestfield so took 2 photos from the driver\u2019s seat in my car the lights were very bright shining through the clouds then saw in the photo this dark shape around the lights?\u201d\n\nIn recent days the Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS has been delighting astro-photographers across WA who have been capturing stunning images.\n\nBut typically comets don\u2019t jump around the sky.\n\nPerth Observatory tour administrator Matt Woods confirmed water police had reached out to them after receiving reports of the mysterious lights.\n\nWhile Mr Woods couldn\u2019t confirm what the lights were, he wondered if they were flares ejected by military planes."

        "article_content": "Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, \u2018CTRL\u2019 revolves around Nella Awasthi, a popular content creator whose social media relationship with her boyfriend, Joe Mascarenhas, comes to an end after she catches him cheating on her. Subsequently, Nella installs an AI app named CTRL that helps her erase Joe from her digital life. However, unbeknownst to her, the app takes rapid control over every aspect of her life, blurring the lines between reality and the virtual world.\n\nThe Netflix thriller presents a cerebral film that latches on to growing concerns within the modernizing digital world. With data, social media, and personal privacy colliding within the screenlife drama\u2019s plot, a grave and chilling account is presented with unflinching authenticity. It asks valid questions about individual awareness, the practices of the dark web, and how invasive technology can be when left unchecked and employed as a commodity. Therefore, the film\u2019s basis seems tied to prescient issues of the contemporary world and the reality faced by everyone with access to the internet. But is that really the case?\n\nCTRL Focuses on the Dark Side of Social Media\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is a fictional story penned by director Vikramaditya Motwane and co-writers Avinash Sampath and Sumukhi Suresh. The movie explores the pitfalls of social media culture through a gripping thriller storyline, punctuating it with incisive forays into the internet\u2019s toxic elements. While the story begins in a relatively happy place, it takes a slow descent into the issues plaguing ordinary people in relation to their digital interactions. Probing questions about authenticity are posed as the protagonist, Nella, finds herself living a lie in front of the camera but leading a completely different one offscreen. Additionally, the darkest aspects of the narrative come to the fore when an invasive AI begins exploiting the insecurities of human emotions through its own agendas.\n\nThe movie mainly examines the exploitative nature of social media and how memory, human emotion, and feelings can often get tied in a virtual setting, which often has no borders on its privacy. As people yearn for more, Nella finds herself catering to their needs by becoming the face of perfection but lacking the imperfections needed to sell reality. Director Vikramaditya stated that the film revolves around the concept of sharing oneself with the world without understanding the consequences that come from it. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2013 how much sharing is too much sharing and the dopamine hits likes and favourites give you. It\u2019s about how much you end up doing for social media. It\u2019s like a doomsday scenario and it\u2019s not impossible to believe this.\u201d\n\nCTRL is a Topical Thriller About the Commodification of Human Experience\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 derives most of its central tension from the battle between human free will and an authoritarian AI app that wants to dictate everything for its users. There is an Orwellian fantasy lurking in its premise. Parallels can be seen with how rapidly modernizing internet practices attempt to take away control from people\u2019s lives, particularly in the manner in which it preys on insecurities. It serves as the burning question of the film. Even Ananya Pandey, who plays Nella, chimed in on the topical concern by emphasizing how it can be particularly damaging for mostly the younger generation, who find themselves victim to a lot of seedy online elements and the mental challenges they pose at times.\n\nMemory also plays a major role in \u2018CTRL.\u2019 With most people\u2019s lives today stored in digital archives, a person\u2019s memories can be attached to their social media avatar. In the movie, this becomes a central topic and one that was inspired by other films. During the development process, the scriptwriters discussed the enduring legacy of \u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019 as a key influence, particularly in the manner in which it explores erasing a loved one from one\u2019s life. The same concept rears its head throughout the Netflix screenlife thriller. The director also revealed that the Spike Jonze-directed science fiction movie, \u2018Her,\u2019 had some influence over the writing. However, he hailed the Michel Gondry directorial as a masterpiece, even if it does not touch upon the topic of AI.\n\nThe Ctrl App is a Fictional AI Service With an Invasive Protocol\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is built around the futuristic service provided by the titular AI app that Nella installs on her laptop, which eventually takes control over her life. It is a made-up application conceived by the scriptwriters Vikramaditya Motwane, Avinash Sampath, and Sumukhi Suresh. While it is not based on any real-life apps, Vikramaditya stated that it would serve as an interesting reflection of how AI has become a major hot-button issue in today\u2019s society. \u201cGiven the conversations about AI, we realized that there was a lot more that we could say about social media, data and privacy in the guide of a straightforward thriller,\u201d the director said. As such, some vague parallels can be drawn between the CTRL app and chatbot AIs like ChatGPT, especially how it is capable of mimicking natural human dialogue.\n\nHowever, in terms of the app\u2019s personalized aspects, digital assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa have more similarities. The story focuses primarily on the CTRL app\u2019s invasive nature and how it eventually takes over Nella\u2019s life and dictates every aspect, including her schedule and emotional needs. In many ways, it also provides an outlet for people to alleviate their loneliness, which is a prime concern in the case of Nella, who goes through a very public breakup and finds herself ostracized on the internet. It speaks to a greater issue converging on modern society, specifically in the domain of ethics, and whether human insecurities might be harnessed to the advantages of AI services like CTRL. Still, for the time being, it is a fictional service with no ties to reality.\n\nRead More: CTRL Ending, Explained: Why Does Nella Give Up?"

        "article_content": "AI, PoS, And ROI: An alphabet Soup Of 21st Century Drug Development\n\nBy Remco Jan Geukes Foppen, Vincenzo Gioia and Carlos N. Velez\n\nThis article is part one of a two-part series.\n\nPart 1: AI for rapid Drug Discovery\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of pharmaceutical development, AI promises to revolutionize the entire drug discovery and development process, impacting target discovery, clinical trial design, site selection, and even post-approval competitive monitoring and analysis. The latest AI models can dramatically accelerate the research pace supporting the pharmaceutical industry. Today, the industry faces increasingly complex challenges, such as chasing \u201cundruggable\u201d targets or developing bispecific antibodies. The industry is also seeking ways to lower the cost of drug discovery and development that, according to recent estimates, can easily exceed $1 billion.\n\nIn addition to increasing drug development speed and reducing costs, the adoption of AI models can potentially increase the probability of a drug completing Phase 2, the second major phase of clinical trials for a new drug, where the drug is tested on a larger group of patients to assess its efficacy and monitor side effects. Successful Phase 2 studies are a critical milestone in drug development. Therefore, anything which can help achieve this milestone could result in lower costs, faster times to approval, and improved likelihood of successful approvals and product launches.\n\nIn the first article of this two-part series, we identify and explain the AI technologies and tools that are transforming the drug discovery and development landscape, specifically focusing on use cases to accelerate drug discovery and clinical development. For the second article in the series, we will answer the following two questions: First, does the higher speed and lower cost with which AI can identify new molecules translate into an increase in the Probability of Success (PoS) in the crucial Phase 2 stage of clinical trials? And second, what is the financial benefit(s) of an AI-driven increase in PoS?\n\nThe AI Toolbox\n\nAI is a group of technologies that can be adopted individually or in combination to perform a specific task. These technologies resemble tools in a toolbox, enabling us to choose and use the right tool(s) at the right moment(s) for the right problem(s).\n\nFig. 1: AI tools representation\n\nAI enables machines to think and solve problems like humans. It encompasses machine learning, where machines learn from examples, and deep learning, which uses multi-layered networks for complex tasks like facial recognition. Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs), represents the latest evolution, allowing machines to create new content and process language in sophisticated ways.\n\nAI technologies, particularly generative AI, enable computers to create new content, such as text and images. As companies digitally transform, they unlock diverse data sources. These technologies power everyday tools from voice assistants to recommendation systems, making computers increasingly helpful. While the expanding AI toolbox offers new opportunities, it also presents challenges like the risk of AI hallucinations.\n\nHow GenAI Accelerates Drug Discovery\n\nGenerative AI, powered by deep learning, analyzes vast and diverse datasets across scientific literature, genomics, and experimental results, uncovering insights that might escape human researchers. It rapidly explores chemical spaces, generating and evaluating millions of potential molecular structures faster than traditional methods. This expands the range of drug candidates and allows AI models to predict molecular interactions with protein targets, identifying promising compounds and potential side effects early in the development process. Multi-objective optimization capabilities enable AI to simultaneously refine multiple desired properties of a drug, such as its efficacy, safety, and bioavailability, a complex and time-consuming task when approached through conventional means. Traditional drug discovery processes can be applied in silico only if LLMs are repurposed to drug discovery needs with domain-specific algorithms like structure prediction, homology, docking, protein design and possibly for in-house requirements to accommodate intellectual property.\n\nCurrently, AI is used most commonly in small molecule drug discovery, drug target discovery, and drug molecule design in oncology and CNS. While some may perceive the integration of AI in drug discovery as conflicting between overhyped and underestimated, many companies of all sizes, from startups to multinational companies are actively utilizing AI as point solutions or as fully AI-embedded end-to-end approaches. Leveraging years of confidential training data to discover and develop new drug candidates, these AI models continue to grow in size and complexity, and require increasingly advanced computational resources, including high-end GPUs that support GenAI, to process proprietary datasets securely. Interestingly, a small minority of companies have no current plans to implement AI/ML.\n\nThe integration of multiple data types, such as text, images, and sound, combined with LLMs enhances the granularity of analysis over single modality. There is a growing trend toward multimodal biomedical AI, and expectations are that efforts will be made for the first multimodal model to receive FDA approval. With these developments one will have to take into account the semantic divergence in the meaning and application of AI in order to achieve a common understanding, and to understand where hallucination risks occur so that the required validation processes for the outcomes are deployed. As regulators emphasize interpretability and explainability, feature importance of machine learning in disease prediction, in drug design and in clinical trial outcomes are becoming increasingly important to identify objective indicators. With new generative and multimodal AI, unanticipated and opportunistic outputs emerge, including the risk of hallucinations. Ultimately, the combination of GenAI and LLMs holds immense potential to revolutionize the drug discovery process, making it more efficient, precise, and innovative.\n\nAI-Focused Biotechs: Increasing Research Speed\n\nCurrently, a dozen AI-discovered drug candidates from various companies have entered in record time into Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, targeting a wide range of medical conditions. The first AI-designed drug to enter clinical trials with drug-like properties was DSP-1181, developed by a joint venture between Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and Exscientia. The discovery phase for DSP-1181, aimed at treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, took only 12 months.\n\nInsilico Medicine showcased the capability to identify new drug targets and generate candidate molecules in just 18 months, further demonstrating the accelerated potential of AI in drug discovery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, BenevolentAI leveraged its AI platform to identify baricitinib as a potential treatment for the virus in just three days \u2014 an impressive example of rapid drug repurposing. Similarly, Verge Genomics advanced VRG50635, a small molecule inhibitor of PIKfyve for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), from research to clinic in just four years, successfully moving past Phase I trials. Many AI-enabled drug discovery programs now take less than four years to complete, compared to the typical five years or more required for the traditional discovery phase.\n\nIncreasing Speed With AI In Clinical Development\n\nAI is also revolutionizing clinical trials, from automating tasks to improving analytics and predictive modeling. The market for AI in clinical trials is rapidly expanding, with most reports projecting a CAGR of over 25%. However, estimates of current market size vary widely. Market.us reports a $174.1B market for 2023, largely driven by Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technologies, while Precedence Research estimates $1.6B. This discrepancy may partly stem from the increasing use of synthetic data in trials, such as developing synthetic control arms, which addresses patient privacy concerns and fills real-world data gaps.\n\nA recent FDA workshop highlighted AI's potential in trial optimization. Michael Lingzhi Li presented a case study with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, where interpretable AI predicted incidence rates at potential sites for their COVID-19 vaccine trial. This model adapted to changing conditions (such as COVID variants, mobility restrictions, release of vaccines, for example), resulting in 33% faster trials and 25% fewer participants. The interpretability of the model provided convincing arguments for the site selection, which as a consequence resulted in a diverse vaccine trial.\n\nAI tools are also enhancing trial operations, monitoring treatment response, improving patient engagement (reduction of patient drop out), and accelerating recruitment. In regulatory affairs, AI tracks global guidances \u2014 which as a reference are published around the world every 15 minutes \u2014 and predicts queries. These applications compound the speed improvements already seen in AI-assisted drug design.\n\nAI In Drug Discovery And Development: Faster\u2026Cheaper\u2026Better Value?\n\nAl-driven drug discovery is on the rise. Automating data analysis, and predicting outcomes with greater accuracy, result in drug candidates entering clinical trials in record time compared to traditional drug development. Beyond speed, AI promises to reduce costs by minimizing experimental overhead and even improving trial efficiency. This would not only cut financial burdens but also improve the quality of drug candidates balancing drug properties like safety and efficacy, and increasing the chances of approval and success in the market.\n\nIn the second installment of our series, we will examine real cost savings attributed to the use of AI, and whether AI can consistently improve the probability of success and likelihood of approval for new drug candidates.\n\nAbout The Authors:\n\nRemco Jan Geukes Foppen Ph.D., is an AI and life sciences expert.

        "article_content": "ABOVE: Aristolochic acid, a bitter compound produced by Aristolochia flowering plants, is typically rejected by fruit flies. Gut tumor-bearing flies, though, increased their preference towards it, possibly due to its impact on tumors, according to a new study. Chiwei Xu\n\nFor thousands of years, humans likely learned about herbal remedies by observing other animals\u2019 behavior. The Navajo people credit brown bears with leading them to the osha root (Ligusticum porteri), which they use to relieve headaches, treat infections, or chase insects away.1 An Asian legend claims that by watching mongooses chew Rauvolfia serpentina leaves before fighting with cobras, humans discovered its use as a snake-bite antidote.2 While it\u2019s not possible to verify these folk stories, their abundance suggest that animal self-medication has informed human medicinal knowledge.\n\nStudying fruit flies in the lab could also inspire novel cancer drugs, according to a new study in Current Biology.3 A team led by University of California, Santa Barbara neuroscientist Craig Montell found that flies with gut tumors chose to consume a particular bitter compound more often than healthy flies, which normally rejected it. Ingesting this compound had strong, sustained antitumor effects in these flies, hinting at a potential self-medication strategy that could guide drug discovery.\n\nGiven that flies rarely develop cancer due to their short lifespans, the team artificially created three cancer-like models to test whether tumors influenced the flies\u2019 preference for various compounds. Using three different transgenes, they induced the insects\u2019 intestinal stem cells to proliferate and develop tumor-like characteristics. The researchers then allowed tumor-bearing and healthy flies to choose between sucrose alone or a mixture of sucrose and one of four bitter compounds, including caffeine and the botanical compound aristolochic acid (ARI). By measuring how often flies fed on sucrose alone or the bitter meal option, the team determined how strongly they preferred one or the other.\n\nGut tumors did not alter the flies\u2019 rejection of three of these aversive compounds, but they did change their taste preference for ARI. Two of the fly cancer models now showed no preference towards sucrose alone; they fed on both dish choices with the same frequency. The third strain became even more attracted to ARI than to sucrose alone. Notably, when the researchers assessed the impact of ARI on tumors, they found that it suppressed cell proliferation. Even consuming it for two days led to a prolonged suppression of gut tumor growth.\n\nMontell and his colleagues then explored the neural mechanisms behind this shift in taste. The tumor could be altering how the flies\u2019 bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons respond to ARI, or the change might occur in the brain after this interaction, or both. To test the first hypothesis, the team conducted electrophysiological experiments on the taste-sensing cells on the flies\u2019 proboscises and legs. They found that these peripheral neurons responded no differently to ARI in gut tumor-bearing flies than in control ones. Thus, the change in taste preference likely occurs in the central nervous system, though the details are still unknown.\n\n\u201c[The findings] suggest there is something about the cancer that\u2019s altering the brain in a way that this compound no longer is aversive,\u201d said Jeremy Borniger, a cancer neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory who did not participate in the present study. \u201cThe next step is\u2026to identify which neurons or which groups of neurons in the brain are regulating this process\u2014how does the tumor alter these cells so that they receive the same signals from the taste of this compound and then interpret it differently?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, despite its tumor-suppressing effects, ARI is too toxic to the kidneys and liver to be developed into a drug. However, the study\u2019s approach may open promising avenues for discovering medical compounds. For Montell, that is actually the most exciting outcome of this work: It establishes Drosophila as an animal model for self-medication and, therefore as a system to screen thousands of molecules for potential novel drugs against gastrointestinal carcinomas. \u201cThe initial screen would be looking for chemicals for which [gut tumor-bearing flies] have an increased preference. . .and then, of those that you find, which ones actually increase their lifespan,\u201d he explained. While scientists have previously used fruit flies for screening cancer drugs, Montell noted that, \u201cConceptually, this would be different because it would be using self-medication as the primary screen, so people have not done that before.\u201d4"

        "article_content": "A hot jobs report combined with still-dovish Fedspeak lifted the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nSoftware leaders ServiceNow (NOW 3.04%), Snowflake (SNOW 3.85%), and UiPath (PATH 4.52%) rallied on Friday, up 3.1%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, in the day's trading.\n\nThere wasn't any company-specific news today on these three enterprise software leaders. However, today's solid jobs report, in combination with still-dovish commentary from Federal Reserve officials, sent each stock soaring.\n\nSoftware stocks to benefit from a soft landing\n\nThe past few years of rising interest rates have generally been difficult for software stocks. While ServiceNow has impressively managed to buck the trend and recover strongly after 2022's downturn, Snowflake and UiPath are still down 62% and 76% over the past three years, respectively.\n\nNOW data by YCharts\n\nInterest rates have had a lot to do with it. When the post-pandemic inflation took off and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, it hit software stocks in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, rapidly raising interest rates caused companies, fearing a downturn, to pull back on software spending, especially since there had been a huge amount of software adoption during the pandemic. Second, rising rates also disproportionally hurt software stock valuations, as software stocks tended to trade at very high multiples of earnings or sales. Rising rates lower the present value of earnings far out in the future, which hurt high-multiple stocks like software. So, software stocks were hit by a \"double whammy\" of slowing growth and sharply discounted valuations.\n\nWhat could reverse the trend? Well, a \"soft landing\" in which inflation and interest rates come down without a recession would be the ideal scenario. Increased confidence and hiring could spur more software \"seat\" subscriptions or, in the case of Snowflake's pay-as-you-go model, more consumption of computing. Meanwhile, lower interest rates would lift valuations.\n\nInflation has been coming down recently, which spurred the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points last month on Sept. 18. Yet while some had thought lower inflation might go hand in hand with a slowing economy, today's September jobs report blew away expectations, with 254,000 jobs added, far above the 150,000 forecast and up from a revised 159,000 jobs added in August.\n\nSolid job growth and lower interest rates is the ideal environment for stocks generally, but especially the rate-sensitive software sector.\n\nOf course, the hot jobs report could mean that inflation may not be subdued yet, and could keep rates high. But Federal Reserve governor Austan Goolsbee, appearing on Bloomberg TV today, said the strong jobs report doesn't mean inflation is going up. He still sees inflation getting back to the Fed's 2% target and also declared no change in the outlook for continued interest rate cuts over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe next issue for software: AI disruption\n\nWhile the interest rate and economic picture looks terrific for software stocks now, there are still a few issues to consider. First, while interest rates are likely to get back to a \"neutral\" rate soon, they aren't likely going all the way back to pandemic-era low levels. So, one shouldn't expect software companies to reattain the inflated valuations they saw in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the AI revolution has the potential to benefit or disrupt certain software companies. ServiceNow has done quite well as it serves at the nexus of companies' private on-premises data and the outside cloud, and can therefore serve as a manager of enterprises' AI while also incorporating outside LLMs. Interestingly, UiPath and Snowflake are more cloud-based, and while they have been posting growth, they haven't been benefiting as much from AI -- at least not yet.\n\nSo while the interest rate picture is getting much better for software, investors will have to be choosy on which stocks will have AI as a value-add and which might see increased competition from the AI revolution."

The Apple phone is available in classic white, black, vibrant pink, ultramarine, and teal. The chassis is made of aluminum, while the back is color-infused glass. At just 6 ounces, the iPhone 16 is one of the lightest smartphones to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 and the rest of the Pixel 9 series feature a more polished design than the previous generation. Some say the phone lineup reminds them of Apple\u2019s in terms of its cleaner look. This is evident in the stylish dual camera system on the back, which has evolved from a visor into a prominent flat-top island mountain. It\u2019s simply gorgeous and something to appreciate. The phone\u2019s satin-finish metal chassis has just the right amount of curvature to seamlessly blend in with the flat Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 rear panel, making it a pleasure to hold. Like the iPhone 16, you can purchase a Pixel 9 in white (Porcelain) or black (Obsidian). It\u2019s also available in beautiful Peony and Wintergreen. Because Google\u2019s phone has a larger display than Apple\u2019s, it weighs an ounce more than its competitor.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch OLED display, while the Pixel 9 has a slightly larger 6.3-inch OLED display. Both displays offer excellent resolution, though the iPhone 16 leads slightly in this aspect, with a higher pixels-per-inch count that means it\u2019s a bit sharper and crisper.\n\nIn addition to screen size, the Pixel 9 outperforms the iPhone 16 in terms of its display\u2019s peak brightness and refresh rate. The Pixel 9 boasts an impressive peak brightness of 2,700 nits, surpassing the iPhone 16\u2019s still respectable 2,000 nits.\n\nFurthermore, the Pixel 9\u2019s refresh rate of 120Hz matches that of most high-end smartphones, while the iPhone 16 is limited to 60Hz. That\u2019s similar to previous iPhone models, but it\u2019s holding back the regular iPhone 16 series. As a result, the Pixel 9 delivers smoother screen refreshes, which is particularly noticeable during activities such as gaming.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: performance and software\n\nBoth phones feature new chipsets: the iPhone 16 has an A18, while the Google Pixel 9 has a Google Tensor G4.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has significantly improved performance this year, thanks to the chipset and 8GB of RAM. Although Apple claims a 30% faster CPU and 40% faster GPU, you might notice little difference in everyday use since the iPhone 15 was already relatively fast.\n\nHowever, that A18 chip has other benefits that are (or will be) noticeable. Specifically, it enables the updated Photographic Styles on the phone and the upcoming Apple Intelligence package. The former has been around since the iPhone 13. This time around, however, the camera feature has been significantly improved. There are more styles to choose from, and you can now also customize the tone and color of each one using an improved slider control. Apple Intelligence, which the company has not yet released, will bring artificial intelligence to the iPhone for the first time. Once the feature is released, we will better understand how good the A18 chip is \u2014 or perhaps isn\u2019t.\n\nThe iPhone 16 ships with iOS 18, and based on previous iPhone releases, you\u2019ll likely get six to seven software updates.\n\nCircling back to the Pixel 9, previous Tensor G chips had been criticized for performance problems. In particular, some past Pixel users complained about overheating issues and occasional stutters, depending on what was done on the device. We had no issues with the Tensor G4 with 12GB of RAM featured in the Pixel 9. The performance on the Pixel 9 was the smoothest and most enjoyable Pixel experience to date.\n\nThe Pixel 9 comes with Android 14 software. Google promises seven years of software updates, which means you can keep your device for a long time if you choose. The Pixel 9 ships with Google\u2019s built-in AI assistant, Gemini. Better still, Pixel 9 users get a free year of Gemini Advanced, which adds more intelligence. That\u2019s a savings of around $240 for the year.\n\nLeaving aside the issue of AI, which we\u2019ll get to below, both of these phones have high-tier performance and long update promises. As such, this has to be a tie.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: cameras\n\nCameras have always been a significant part of smartphones, and that\u2019s still the case with the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9.\n\nThe iPhone 16 features a 48-megapixel Fusion primary rear camera, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 12MP selfie camera. The camera setup is quite similar to that of the iPhone 15, although there are a few notable changes.\n\nOne significant change is that the ultrawide camera now offers autofocus, allowing macro photography. Additionally, you can capture Spatial photos that can be viewed on an Apple Vision Pro. The primary camera also now has a new anti-reflective lens coating, and it can capture pictures with zero shutter lag, similar to the iPhone Pro models.\n\nOverall, we\u2019re happy with the iPhone 16\u2019s cameras. The primary camera is excellent, capturing detailed photos with really pleasing colors. It also focuses quickly, handles moving subjects well, and does a great job in lowlight environments. The ultrawide camera makes taking macro photos a treat, and the selfie camera is as reliable as ever on the iPhone.\n\nThe most significant change to the iPhone 16\u2019s growing list of camera tools is the addition of a physical Camera Control button. This button on every iPhone 16 series phone functions like a traditional camera shutter button, but offers more functionality due to its built-in capacitive sensor. The sensor allows you to access six options on a new camera menu: exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles, and tone. To navigate these options, you can slide your finger across the Camera Control, lightly press the button to select an option, and then adjust the chosen setting by sliding your finger again.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but Camera Control seems like a fun new way to interact with your iPhone\u2019s camera. However, it might take you a little bit of time to get used to it.\n\nThe Pixel 9 also features two cameras on the rear: a 50MP primary camera and a 48MP wide-angle camera that enables a macro mode. The 10.5MP selfie camera also has autofocus.\n\nWhen testing the Pixel 9, we took many photos, and we came away impressed. The primary and wide-angle cameras shot sharp, colorful images that were never dull or underwhelming. We also enjoyed using the phone\u2019s Action Pan, which adds motion blur to moving objects, and the new Reimagine feature in Magic Editor, which allows you to change scenes based on your imagination.\n\nCasual photographers will enjoy using the cameras on both of these phones, as they are equipped with hardware and software features that will provide years of enjoyment.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: battery and charging\n\nThe battery life of both these phones is decent, but not exceptional, especially when compared to more expensive phones from the same companies. Despite them both being decent, one is better than the other.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has a 3,561 mAh battery, which should last a day without recharging. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 has a bigger 4,700mAh battery, allowing you to use it for a second day (at least for a while) before recharging.\n\nThe iPhone 16 theoretically supports 45-watt wired charging, but seems to be limited to around 20W most of the time. We tested the iPhone 16 with an Anker 747 and found that it charged from 5% to over 60% in 30 minutes. However, it took over an hour and a half to reach 100%. Charging from a low or dead battery to around 70% is relatively fast, but the final 30% takes a while. If you prefer MagSafe charging, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the iPhone 16\u2019s charge speeds have increased from 15W to 30W. Apple\u2019s phone supports MagSafe, Qi2, and Qi wireless charging.\n\nThe Pixel 9 maxes out at 27W charging, similar to the iPhone. It could charge a dead battery to 53% in 30 minutes and get an entire charge in 92 minutes. The Google phone supports Qi wireless charging, but not Qi2.\n\nWe\u2019re giving this one to Google\u2019s phone, if only because it has a bigger and longer-lasting battery.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: AI\n\nIn just a few weeks, Apple plans to release at least the initial components of Apple Intelligence to the general public. Within six months, every feature should finally be available. Apple Intelligence is designed to provide a secure, helpful, and intuitive AI experience. It will offer personalized writing assistance, new creative tools, improved Siri, and more.\n\nGoogle Gemini, also available for iPhone through the Google App, is designed to help users make everyday tasks easier and offer a more helpful Google Search experience. Like Apple Intelligence, it will help you write better, improve your images, and more.\n\nBecause Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available, the Pixel 9 wins this category by default.\n\nWinner: Google Pixel 9\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: price and availability\n\nThe iPhone 16 costs $799 for the 128GB model and $899 for the 256GB model. There\u2019s also a 512GB model for $1,099. The Google Pixel 9\u2019s base 128GB model also costs $799. The 256GB version is available for $859 if you need more storage.\n\nThe Pixel scores points because its 256GB model is available for $40 less than the similarly equipped iPhone 16 model. However, it loses that point because only Apple offers a 512GB model.\n\nApple iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: verdict\n\nThis result may change in six months. However, for now, the Pixel 9 bests the iPhone 16 overall. Google\u2019s entry-level phone has much more going for it, from having a larger display and battery to offering an AI product right now when you open the box.\n\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t a bad phone; it\u2019s actually a terrific phone that currently lacks some of Apple\u2019s promised features.\n\nUltimately, an incomplete product cannot outperform a completed one. However, your decision will likely be based more on each phone\u2019s operating system. If you prefer Android, you\u2019ll choose the Pixel 9 and Android 14; if you\u2019re a fan of iOS, then the iPhone 16 with iOS 18 is the one for you.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9\n\niPhone 16"
