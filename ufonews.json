        "article_content": "I love diving into gaming history, playing old games and keeping those experiences in my mind for when I play new ones. There\u2019s a whole new world of insight you can access when you come into something armed with context of what came before. Even in my short time at Shacknews I\u2019ve pushed things like preservation because capturing, holding onto, and sharing knowledge feels like an important and underserved piece of criticism in games. UFO 50, a collection of retro-styled games from Mossmouth, feels as much like validation for those principles as it does a new, original work. It\u2019s a fictional portfolio from a long-lost video game studio that celebrates not just games themselves, but the value of going back and unearthing art from the past to both enjoy it and learn from it.\n\nReal games, fictional context\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 doesn\u2019t narrate its story to you, but there\u2019s still a compelling framing device that bleeds into the game\u2019s nuts and bolts. You\u2019re playing a set of 50 games developed by UFO Soft, a company that developed and published games on its series of LX consoles. The games were made throughout the 1980s, and you literally wipe the dust off each cartridge when you play them for the first time. In the main menu each title has a little synopsis, as well as a sentence or two adding some kind of additional historical context. Perhaps it\u2019s an anecdote about a game\u2019s inspiration, such as from a poster in the studio\u2019s bathroom. Other times you\u2019ll get something like how Night Manor, a point and click-style horror game, was UFO Soft\u2019s only game featuring required warning text.\n\nDespite only being a few paragraphs of text in total, there\u2019s a real sense of UFO Soft being a real company that existed in UFO 50\u2019s imagined world. You can feel the vibe that this was a small group in an era when games could be pumped out based on singular ideas, then iterated on in further sequels and other new projects, enough to sustain a company and build not just a library, but an identity. Each little snippet of context feels like reading through old gaming magazines and building a picture in your mind of what it may have looked like to work in gaming in the 1980s.\n\nA complex collection\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s deliberate or not, considering how in interviews the folks behind this game didn\u2019t initially view this project as a single package. But the ways in which the games in UFO 50 follow a sort of evolutionary path is fascinating. If you play each game in order you can map out the trajectory in your mind, especially when you come across sequels and spinoffs of what seem to be UFO Soft\u2019s core IPs. It\u2019s actually wild to think about how the real-life developers plotted out the fictional devs\u2019 progress and laid it out across these titles, rather than simply making each individual game as \u201ccomplete\u201d with all the lessons we\u2019ve collectively learned as devs and gamers in 2024. You\u2019ll see an idea introduced in a game early in the list, then grow and improve over time as you move through the years until there are games towards the end that feel like several ideas and learned lessons culminating into bigger, more elaborate productions.\n\nThat being said, not every game on this list is going to be a certified banger for every player. There\u2019s a wide selection of genre, as well as complexity and that mythical force we refer to in shorthand as \u201cpolish.\u201d There are games here I booted up, played for a couple minutes, and moved on from. I probably won\u2019t play Bug Hunter ever again, for example. But there are other games like Grimstone, a full-by-god wild west JRPG, that I will absolutely go back to and see all the way to the end. It almost feels like I\u2019ve gone back to my formative years playing around with emulators and huge ROM lists, going through and finding what resonated with me while taking in little pieces of everything. Fist Hell felt like a bad version of River City Ransom, while Valbrace is a strange hybrid of Wizardry and Punch-Out that feels like nothing I\u2019ve ever played before. It\u2019s an eclectic mix, and each individual piece contributes to the overall bigger picture of UFO Soft as an entity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that as fun as these games can be, there's a sort of line being toed between authenticity and approachability. A lot of the games in the collection are tough even by the standards of their era, mostly because a lot of them give you one life and no continues. If you die, you simply start right back at the beginning. Other games that are more substantive may offer multiple lives or chances, but it's still a harsh Game Over when you use them up. Features like rewind or unlimited continues may clash with the idea that you're literally cleaning up and playing old cartridges in the narrative, but some kind of compromise would have made trying to really dive into and complete each game a more appealing venture. To UFO 50's credit, the longer games (especially the RPGs) do have auto-saving and checkpoint systems. But having auto-save kind of invalidates the earlier remark about authenticity, so there's a little inconsistency there anyway.\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 is like stumbling across a time capsule and discovering a wealth of lost knowledge inside. And yet, it\u2019s entirely a singular work of fiction. That by itself is deeply fascinating and makes this thing worth playing. Even if you pass over most of the games and only find a few that stick with you from a fun perspective, the depth on a conceptual level is absurd and gratifying to simply think about. We\u2019re living at a time in which older games are vanishing from both physical reality and our sort of collective cultural well at an increasing rate, when remakes are seen as replacements for original work and curiosity to seek out history is dwindling unless there\u2019s a purchasable remaster. UFO 50 is fun to play and take at face value, but it also highlights how age really isn\u2019t a detriment to having a great time and engaging with games.\n\nUFO 50 is available now for PC. The game was purchased by Shacknews for this review."

        "article_content": "With 8 Silent Hill 2 Remake endings to get through, those who are out to find them all have a lot to work through, as 5 of the 8 endings can only be unlocked on New Game Plus. Not only that, the choices that impact which ending you get are sometimes made throughout the whole game, not just in the last moments of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, meaning that you can't necessarily reload a save and just choose a different outcome - there have been hours of choices or secret items leading up to this moment.\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, it's very important that players understand the steps necessary to unlock the endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake - that way you can pick which one you want and aim for it early on, using all the steps in our spoiler-free guide and walkthrough.\n\nAll Endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThere are 8 possible endings to the Silent Hill 2 Remake, all of which we've laid out below, as well as whether you'll be able to unlock them on New Game Plus or your first playthrough.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Ending Requires New Game Plus? Leave No In Water No Maria No Rebirth Yes Dog Yes UFO Yes Bliss (new to Remake) Yes Stillness (new to Remake) Yes\n\nAs mentioned, the last two of these - \"Bliss\" and \"Stillness\" - are unique additions to the Remake, and did not appear in the original game. However, all the others are recreations of possible endings in the 2001 version.\n\n\n\nThe first time around, you'll be able to complete the game and get any of the first three endings - Leave, In Water or Maria - while in subsequent playthroughs of New Game Plus, you'll have the option to unlock all eight of them, including the first three. Below, we'll go through the requirements to unlock them all, without spoiling what those endings actually include.\n\nHow do the endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake work?\n\nIt's worth explaining that many of the endings in Silent Hill 2 work on a behind-the-scenes points system, or at least something similar to that idea. The Remake is constantly judging your actions in-game, with the idea being that the game is trying to work out how James is feeling about himself and the situation based on the actions you make him take, both in and out of combat. Some endings are based on him caring about the people he meets (or not), whereas others are based on how much he works to defend himself physically or how much self-preservation he exhibits.\n\nIt can be pretty hard to read and is always a little esoteric, but we'll lay out the basic steps that are being measured, and what they contribute to, below.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Leave ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"Leave\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal frequently throughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.\n\nDo not examine Angela's Knife, or Mary's Photo, Letter or Handkerchief in your inventory.\n\nDo not visit Maria at the Hospital 2F bed, or the Labyrinth prison cell.\n\nIn the Silent Hill 2 Remake coin cabinet puzzle, pick the \"Snake\" coin at the end when asked to choose who's responsible.\n\nIn the corridor at the end of the game where you can hear Mary speaking, make sure you listen to the whole thing before moving to the next area.\n\nDon't go out of your way to protect Maria from threats or stay close to her when she's following you.\n\nThe goal here is to meet two criteria: have James show a high level of self-preservation, while also seeming uninterested in focusing on either Maria or Mary. Healing frequently is the easiest way to ensure this - don't spend a lot of time in low health, and you should be fine, even if you break some of the other rules.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake In Water ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"In Water\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal yourself rarely throughout the game so James spends as much time as possible at low health.\n\nExamine Angela's Knife, Mary's Photo, Letter and Handkerchief in your inventory multiple times across the course of the game.\n\nDo not visit Maria at the Hospital 2F bed, or the Labyrinth prison cell.\n\nAt the Coin Cabinet, pick the \"Man\" coin at the end when asked to choose who's responsible.\n\nIn the corridor at the end of the game where you can hear Mary speaking, make sure you listen to the whole thing before moving to the next area.\n\nDon't go out of your way to protect Maria from threats or stay close to her when she's following you.\n\nThis time around, you need to complete the game while showing James as somebody with low self-preservation and self-regard, while also focusing on Mary - but NOT Maria.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Maria ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"Maria\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal frequently throughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.\n\nDo not examine Angela's Knife, or Mary's Photo, Letter or Handkerchief in your inventory.\n\nYou SHOULD visit Maria at the Hospital 2F bed, and the Labyrinth prison cell, multiple times each time. (Make sure you visit her in the hospital after locating the Marked Bracelet, and in the Labyrinth even after something bad happens to her).\n\nAt the Coin Cabinet, pick the \"Woman\" coin at the end when asked to choose who's responsible.\n\nIn the corridor at the end of the game where you can hear Mary speaking, DO NOT listen to the whole thing before moving to the next area.\n\nPrevent Maria from taking damage wherever possible.\n\nDo not make Maria uncomfortable by physically bumping into her, breaking a lot of glass around her, or being separated from her for long periods of time.\n\nAfter meeting her in Rosewood Park, follow her obediently and DO NOT deviate from the pathways she suggests until you reach the hospital (this means don't go looking for the Silent Hill 2 Remake Garage Jack lever).\n\nThe goal here is to show high self-preservation (James wants to live), while also making Maria look like a high priority, but not Mary. This is probably the trickiest of the three \"first playthrough\" endings to achieve, as keeping Maria safe and happy is pretty fiddly, especially when something as minor as bumping into her can have a negative effect.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Rebirth ending\n\nThe Rebirth ending can only be achieved on New Game Plus, and rather than something you do through choices, this time you have to find four special items to add to your inventory throughout the game.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Crimson Ceremony is found in the cemetery where you first meet Angela, on a grave by the lakeside.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe White Chrism is on a table outside of Baldwin Mansion after you first solve the Silent Hill 2 Remake motel safe code puzzle with Maria.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Obsidian Goblet is inside the Historical Society you enter after the hospital, inside an alcove on the wall.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Lost Memories book is in the \"Lost and Found\" on 1F of LakeView Hotel. Breaking a wall in the cafe will allow you to access this.\n\nOnce you have all these four items, completing the main story will automatically trigger the \"Rebirth\" ending, regardless of what choices or actions you've made along the way. This can only be cancelled by triggering the specific conditions for the endings that are listed after this one.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Dog ending\n\nThe legendary \"Dog\" ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake is also specific to New Game Plus, and is unlocked through the following means:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nFind the Broken Key Part 1. This is on top of a desk in the backroom of the Pet Center in the South Vale, which you can explore while fixing the Silent Hill 2 Remake jukebox.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nFind the Broken Key Part 2. After going through the locked gate in the Motel with Maria, turn right three times to find a doghouse in a dead-end path. The second key part is there.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nCombine both key parts in your inventory to make the Dog Key, then use it to open the Observation Room on 3F of the Lakeview Hotel. This will trigger the Dog Ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake UFO ending\n\nAnother ending specific to NG+, the UFO ending in the Silent Hill 2 Remake is achieved through the following method:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nGet the Blue Gem. This is in the window of a jewellery store North of Big Jay's when you're doing the Jukebox repair. Just crack the glass of the store to take the gem. \"Investigate\" the Blue Gem in your inventory at the following locations throughout the game (there'll be a symbol on an eye drawn somewhere nearby to mark you're in the right spot):\n\nThe Rooftop of Saul Street Apartments (while fixing the Jukebox)\n\nThe Pier to the Northwest of Rosewood Park after meeting Maria.\n\nThe dock at the South of LakeView Gardens you moor at after rowing over the lake.\n\nRoom 312 of LakeView Hotel, before you watch the Video tape.Empty list\n\nFulfil all these criteria and the last time you investigate the Blue Gem, in room 312, it should immediately trigger the UFO ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Bliss ending\n\nA new ending created specifically for the Remake, the \"Bliss\" ending is also specific to NG+. Here's how you get it:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nIn the Northwest corner of the 1F Hospital Garden, while solving the puzzle of the Silent Hill 2 Remake Director's Office hand, you'll find a Small Chest if you crawl through a hole.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nIn Pete's Bowl-O-Rama, just South of the Historical Society after the Hospital, there's a safe you can open with the code 1887 to get the Rusted Key. Combine the Key and Chest in your inventory to get the White Claudia. Progress through the game until you reach room 312 of the Hotel. Select the White Claudia from your inventory to drink it. Watch the video tape, and this time you'll get an alternate ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Stillness ending\n\nThe last ending, \"Stillness\" is another of the two new finales concocted specifically for the Remake of Silent Hill 2, and specific to NG+. Here's how you get it.\n\nGet the Chainsaw at the very beginning of NG+ (our guide to the Silent Hill 2 Remake weapons will show you how).\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nAfter leaving the Ranch, smash the window of the green car on Wiltse Road to get the Key of Sorrow.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nLater in the game, after watching the video in Room 312, go to the Manager's Officer on 1F and use the key (and the code 314) to open the safe and get the Toluca Postcard. Inspect the postcard in your inventory at least once. Complete the rest of the game to get the Stillness ending.\n\nWhat is the Silent Hill 2 Remake best ending?\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nWarning: this section of the guide has spoilers for the plot of Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nThe Silent Hill 2 Remake has no best ending as we understand it, it's largely a matter of opinion, and harder to break up into black and white \"good/bad\" binaries. Still, some endings do seem darker than others: the \"Maria\" ending has James not only still ignoring the worst elements of what he did to Mary, it implies the awful events may repeat themselves, with Maria coughing on the way back to the car and James telling her to get that sorted in an ominous tone of voice.\n\n\n\nThe best ending is largely a matter of opinion - and what ultimate fate you think James deserves for what he did. Discarding the comedic UFO and Dog endings, in some finales he lets go of his guilt, but in those he can't, James ends up either destroying himself or potentially going down bleak paths (such as the occult resurrection in the \"Rebirth\" ending). There is no truly clean ending to a game as complex as Silent Hill 2 - and there probably shouldn't be.\n\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+. Not to be reproduced without permission"

        "article_content": "The capabilities of artificial intelligence applications and modern processors, such as GPUs, are beginning to exceed data center architectures. While the intense power and cooling demands of generative AI are well reported, relatively little has been set about the memory bottleneck that currently pegs AI performance. But that is changing due to memory innovation.\n\nAI needs memory. Lots of it. Yet traditional memory architectures can act as a bottleneck for AI performance. Thus, the introduction of Compute Express Link is timely. This new server interconnect opens the door to memory resources being pooled and shared. It can help to bridge the performance gap that sits between low-latency memory and solid-state drives. CXL can also lower the cost of memory, which is one of the most expensive elements of IT, while eliminating yet another barrier standing in the way of AI achieving its full potential.\n\nDiscover more about the subject in this TechRepublic Premium feature by Drew Robb.\n\nFeatured text from the download: GEN AI EXPOSES BOTTLENECK The presence of the latest generation of demanding workloads such as gen AI has brutally exposed a bottleneck in IT. As large language models get bigger, as processors and graphical processing units become more powerful, and as rack densities soar, traditional IT designs struggle to keep up. But it is the memory bottleneck that has become most apparent. If you graph CPU cores against time and then factor in memory bandwidth, the divergence in trend lines is stark. Memory bandwidth expansion paralleled CPU core expansion for a while. But it has stalled for several chip generations while the core count grew ever higher. Result: CPUs are getting starved of memory to the point where you are not able to fully benefit from additional cores. As well as latency, once main memory is full, demanding applications can run into issues such as excessive memory copying, too much I/O being consumed by storage, excessive buffering, and out-of-memory errors. Any of these can crash applications if they go on too long. Another common memory problem is underutilized or stranded memory resources. Some processors may be in dire need of memory, while others have an ample supply. This boils down to system design and limitations. DRAM is traditionally housed in dual in-line memory modules close to the CPU. With this design, other CPUs can only access certain DIMMs and not others.\n\nBoost your AI knowledge with our in-depth 11-page PDF. This is available for download at just $9.

        "article_content": "Google Maps is a place of great discovery \u2014 and the latest sighting may be one of the oddest yet.\n\nIn East Antarctica, just southeast of Japanese research outpost Showa Station, eagle-eyed users spotted a mysterious \u201cdoorway,\u201d which has become the topic of wild theories online, with some speculating that it\u2019s Bigfoot\u2019s vacation home or a marooned shuttle craft from \u201cStar Trek.\u201d\n\nOne Reddit user who noticed the ominous structure at the coordinates 69\u00b000\u201950\u2033S 39\u00b036\u201922\u2033E simply asked, \u201cMassive door in Antarctica?\u201d\n\nThe doorway has been the topic of fantastical theories online. Google / SWNS\n\n\u201cJust a blown-off Boeing door,\u201d one person suggested, a reference to a shocking midair mishap last January, with another jokingly asking, \u201cWonder if they get door dash there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would we do without the conspiracy theorists?\u201d John Smellie, a professor and volcanologist at the University of Leicester, joked to the Daily Mail regarding the many suggestions offered.\n\nBut scientists have revealed what they believe the structure really is \u2014 and it\u2019s not nearly as exciting as any Reddit theses.\n\nA Reddit user noticed the ominous door at the coordinates 69\u00b000\u201950\u2033S 39\u00b036\u201922\u2033E. Google / SWNS\n\nAfter looking at the coordinates on Google Earth Pro and seeing historical imagery, Bethan Davies, a professor of glaciology at the University of Newcastle, told the publication that the mysterious doorway \u201cis in an area of fast sea ice \u2026 just offshore of the coast\u201d that is littered with \u201ca series of islands\u201d where shallow water exists.\n\n\u201cThis is an iceberg that became grounded and is now stuck and melting out [in place],\u201d Davies explained. \u201cYou can see many other icebergs in the area.\u201d\n\nProfessor Martin Siegert, co-director of the Imperial College London\u2019s Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, agreed with Davies, telling the outlet: \u201cThis is simply ice flow around a solid subglacial obstacle, influenced also by melting and re-freezing of ice and by katabatic winds.\n\n\u201cThe ice is quite thin here, as evidenced by other outcrops of rock nearby, so the influence of the bed on ice flow will be strong,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting pattern, but not unusual or surprising glaciologically.\u201d\n\nSmellie added that it looked \u201clike a short rocky ridge outcrop has been exhumed due to a lowering of the ice, explaining that the protrusion \u201cforms the \u2018top\u2019 of the \u2018doorway.\u2019 And there are two prominent parallel snow tails forming the sides of the \u2018doorway.\u2019 The snow tails show you the orientation of the predominant wind direction.\u201d\n\nThe volcano guru then amusingly shut the door on any conspiracy ramblings.\n\n\u201cSo, with a good imagination, there is a weak and totally false door-like appearance overall,\u201d Smellie declared. \u201cI am pretty sure it\u2019s just a natural phenomenon and nothing to get excited about.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Marie Curie is well known for her chemistry achievements but less so for helping other women succeed in science\n\nMarie Curie, born more than 150 years ago, is still the only female scientist many people can name. The double Nobel Prize winner is most famous for her discovery of radioactivity, as well as the radioactive elements radium and polonium. She is less well known for encouraging a generation of women who worked in her lab and went on to work in research because of the path she paved. Though few women in science have reached Curie\u2019s level of fame and name recognition, they continue to make gains in the field because of her life and example.\n\nIn the new book The Elements of Marie Curie: How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2024), author (and Scientific American poetry editor) Dava Sobel chronicles Curie\u2019s life and work, and sketches biographies of many of the women who worked with her. Sobel found that few people are familiar with the network of researchers she nurtured, as well as many other aspects of the famous chemist\u2019s history. \u201cEverybody knows her name, but hardly anybody knows anything about her,\u201d Sobel says.\n\nScientific American spoke with Sobel about Marie Curie\u2019s contributions to science, history and gender equality.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n\nHow did you learn about the female scientists Curie worked with?\n\nIn 2020 I was asked to review a book called Women in Their Element, a collection of essays about female chemists. The only two names I recognized to begin with were Marie Curie and her daughter [Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]. But then as I read, I was really struck by the number of women who had spent some time with her, either studying under her or working in her lab. By the fifth or sixth one, it really started to look like a network. And through the Curie Museum in Paris, I discovered there were really at least 45 women who passed through her laboratory. She was the first woman ever to teach at the Sorbonne. And then that made her a magnet for these other women. Also, she was already world-famous because she had won the Nobel Prize, and that spread her name everywhere. So I thought, well, this is something about Madame Curie that most people don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s how I got started.\n\nHow did Curie end up making the huge discoveries she made?\n\nShe had extraordinary drive to get herself out of Warsaw to Paris, to be able to get an advanced education, to believe in herself that much [in the face of strong resistance toward women in science at the time], and then to be willing and able to do the kind of laboratory work that she did. And then she married the right person. She and her husband Pierre Curie worked together when she started to do her doctoral research on this new discovery of [physicist Henri] Becquerel\u2019s, uranic rays.\n\nThis was the radiation coming from uranium decay.\n\nRight. This was a new thing, and nobody was paying attention to it because everybody was more interested in x-rays at the time [in 1896]. And [Curie] thought she\u2019d go after the less exciting topic; there were 1,000 papers already written about x-rays, and nobody was doing anything with uranic rays. So that was the right time.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me that she entered this field at this time and then had her first child just a year later, in 1897. I\u2019d assumed, before I read the book, that the children came well after she\u2019d established herself as a scientist.\n\nThis is a very female story. She had two children; she had a miscarriage; she had trouble nursing. Some of the women who came to her lab stopped working when they got married and had children. It\u2019s been more than 100 years, and that\u2019s still true for many women in science. I really wanted to meet those issues directly in the book because I think it\u2019s so important for young women to read about other female scientists and how they managed.\n\nDid Curie actively set out to recruit more women into science?\n\nI don\u2019t think she was specifically looking to hire women, but what was different about her was that she had nothing against hiring them. So that was big, and then again, she was so prominent that she attracted them and inspired them. There are a couple of women in the story who were much younger and grew up hearing about her, which made them think, \u201cOh, I could be a scientist, too.\u201d And the amazing thing to me is how she still has that effect. She\u2019s been dead for almost 100 years, but she is still an inspiration\u2014and not just to women who go into science but women in a variety of fields.\n\nWhat do you think most people get wrong about Marie Curie?\n\nYou\u2019ll often hear that she didn\u2019t really do anything: it was all Pierre, and she was just his assistant. Pierre himself was on record debunking that, but nobody listened.\n\nAnother criticism was, \u201cShe used her hands, but not her head. She was very involved in doing all of this very difficult chemical extraction, which required repetition of many steps, and that was what she was good at.\u201d That is also a very familiar trope about women in science: that women do this grunt work, the boring things, and the men just have aha! moments 24 hours a day.\n\nThat kind of attitude is just one aspect of the type of resistance Curie faced. What was the climate like at the time for women in science?\n\nShe was operating in this environment of huge sexism. She was barred from the [French] Academy of Sciences. Even though she had a lot of support, they did not vote her in, and to be published in their weekly proceedings, to present your work, you had to be a member. So she was constantly having to ask friends to present the work of the people in her laboratory, which was an enormous embarrassment. She was the premier authority on her subject, and she didn\u2019t have the standing in the professional community that she deserved. And then later, her daughter tried several times to get voted into the academy. She was also a Nobel Prize winner, and she couldn\u2019t get in either. So yes, there was a lot of sexism, a lot of barricades, but she broke through most of them.\n\nBeyond promoting individual women in science, how do you think Curie changed science for women after her?\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the early 1900s, so physics altogether was at an inflection point, and she was, for three decades, the only woman in the room at these important Solvay Conference meetings [a groundbreaking series of physics congresses that begin in 1911]. So she knew all of the top physicists: [Ernest] Rutherford, [Albert] Einstein, [Enrico] Fermi, Niels Bohr, everybody. She knew them personally, and I think she normalized some of that for them\u2014that \u201coh, yeah, women do this, too,\u201d which might not have occurred to them. So I think, by her presence, she had an effect on her peers.\n\nYou are Scientific American\u2019s poetry column editor. Is there any connection between Curie and poetry?\n\nWell, being Polish and being in a family that was very nationalistic, very proud of their Polish heritage, she grew up on these three very famous Polish poets [Adam Mickiewicz, Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski and Juliusz S\u0142owacki], and her family also had a tradition of writing verses on this or that occasion, and she wrote a couple of poems. She wrote about her life as a student when she was first in Paris. I don\u2019t think she ever wrote any poems about her work. And there have been a lot of poems written about her. Even Adrienne Rich wrote a poem about Madame Curie."

        "source": "PCQuest",
        "article_content": "Low-code and no-code (LCNC) systems are changing how companies create applications in today's fast-paced digital world. By use of visual tools and drag-and-drop interfaces, these platforms enable users\u2014from expert developers to non-technical staff\u2014to rapidly design applications, therefore negating the need for considerable coding skills. However as LCNC platforms become more widely used, security issues have started to emerge. Creating safe apps on these platforms has special difficulties, especially at a time of rising cyber risks and data leaks. Knowing these difficulties and looking at ways to protect private information is crucial.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe Inherent Challenges of Low-Code/No-Code Security\n\nOne of the main advantages of LCNC platforms is the speed at which applications can be developed, but this speed can sometimes come at the expense of security. One of the biggest risks is the inheritance of insecure code. LCNC platforms often rely on open-source components, which may contain vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities, if undetected, can be replicated across multiple applications, potentially exposing entire systems to breaches. Organisations must utilise tools like Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to scan code for weaknesses early in the development cycle and prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production.\n\nAdditionally, access control is a frequent challenge with LCNC platforms. Many of these systems lack fine-grained access control mechanisms, hence it is rather difficult to properly limit user rights. Sensitive data may find its way to unapproved users without strong role-based access control (RBAC). Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and ensuring that only authorised users can modify or access sensitive areas of the system are crucial steps in enhancing security.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAddressing Shadow IT and Integration Risks\n\nAnother challenge that organisations face is shadow IT\u2014the use of unsanctioned applications or modifications by \"citizen developers.\" While LCNC platforms empower non-technical users to develop and customise applications, this can lead to the creation of insecure apps without proper IT oversight. Shadow IT often only happens when staff try to solve a problem quickly and ignore accepted security procedures. This introduces security risks, as unapproved applications may not undergo the necessary vetting to ensure compliance with the organisation's security standards. To mitigate this, organisations must implement strict controls over who can create and modify applications and ensure all developments are reviewed by IT departments.\n\nIntegration risks are also a concern, particularly when connecting third-party modules or plugins to an LCNC platform. Each connection is a potential vulnerability point, as improper integration can expose applications to attacks. Secure connections, encrypted data transfers, and regular testing of integrations are essential practices to prevent breaches.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEnsuring Platform Compliance and Vendor Accountability\n\nThe choice of LCNC platform plays a critical role in the overall security of applications. Organisations should select platforms that are compliant with ISO 27001 and other relevant certifications. Such platforms are designed with security best practices integrated into their frameworks, offering tools for secure development and monitoring throughout the application lifecycle. Leading LCNC platforms also offer built-in solutions for identity and access management (IAM), ensuring that access to the application is controlled and monitored based on business roles.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s important to understand the security practices of the platform vendors. Reputable LCNC vendors conduct penetration testing and employ automated security scans to identify vulnerabilities in real-time. They also ensure that open-source components used in their platforms are secure by monitoring and updating these elements regularly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nProactive Security Measures and Continuous Monitoring\n\nUsing a proactive security-first strategy is one of the best approaches to protect applications developed on LCNC systems. This covers teaching nontechnical users and developers about safe coding techniques and the need to adhere to organisational security standards. To instantly identify and address security concerns, companies also have to apply continuous monitoring systems.\n\nApart from this, standard security audits are absolutely vital. Audits guarantee that security policies are correctly applied, help to find fresh vulnerabilities, and ensure that applications stay compliant with industry standards including GDPR. This is particularly crucial as LCNC systems change and new integrations or functionalities are included.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFinally, collaboration between LCNC developers and security experts is essential to addressing more complex security challenges. By working together, they can ensure that best practices are implemented from the outset, minimising risks while optimising the efficiency of the development process.\n\nA Balance Between Speed and Security\n\nWhile low-code and no-code platforms have revolutionised the speed of application development, security cannot be overlooked. Organisations must navigate the security challenges posed by LCNC platforms with a proactive mindset. By selecting compliant platforms, incorporating robust access controls, educating users, and regularly auditing applications, businesses can leverage the benefits of rapid development without compromising on data protection.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAs LCNC platforms continue to evolve, adopting a security-first strategy will ensure that businesses can build powerful, scalable applications while safeguarding sensitive information from growing cyber threats.\n\n\n\nAuthor: Lalit Mehta, Co-Founder & CEO- Decimal"

        "article_content": "The Biden administration sharply intensified pressure on Israel this week to improve dire conditions for civilians in the Gaza Strip, warning that it would be forced to take punitive measures, potentially including a suspension of military aid, if the flow of humanitarian assistance is not increased within a month.\n\nIn an Oct. 13 letter to senior Israeli officials, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin demanded urgent steps to ensure that noncombatants have access to food and other necessities, blaming lawlessness and actions by the Israeli government in permitting a deterioration of conditions in Gaza, according to two officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss correspondence that had not been made public.\n\nAbsent a change, Blinken and Austin cautioned, the administration would be obliged to take steps laid out under policies linking compliance with international norms to the provision of U.S. weapons and military assistance. The letter gives Netanyahu one month to comply, which would delay any action until after the U.S. presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe warning from Austin and Blinken, addressed to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, raises the possibility that the United States could suspend arms transfers to Israel if the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to block the flow of humanitarian aid, which the United Nations recently said has not reached Gaza in two weeks.\n\nU.S. officials say they are concerned about the sharp drop-off in aid, which they say could make the provision of military aid illegal under U.S. law. But critics say there have been ongoing humanitarian problems with little change in U.S. policy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden made clear his displeasure with the Israeli restrictions on aid to northern Gaza when he spoke by phone to Netanyahu last week, noting \u201cthe imperative to restore access to the north, including by reinvigorating the corridor from Jordan immediately,\u201d according to a readout of the call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Israeli military office that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, COGAT, has denied that Israel halted the \u201centry or coordination of humanitarian aid\u201d in northern Gaza.\n\nU.S. officials believe that giving Israel 30 days to comply with the demands \u2014 vs. forcing a faster schedule \u2014 is reasonable, given the complexity of the response required and the schedule of U.S. weapons deliveries.\n\nCritics of Biden\u2019s handling of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Iranian-backed militant group whose fighters attacked the country on Oct. 7, 2023, have blamed his administration for failing to leverage Washington\u2019s extensive transfer of arms that Israel has used in Gaza. More than 40,000 people have died in the past year of conflict, according to local health authorities.\n\nSince the war began, the administration has halted only one shipment of U.S. weapons bound for Israel. In May, Biden decided to continue the flow of arms after his administration issued a 46-page report on Israel\u2019s compliance with humanitarian laws, a review requested by Democrats in Congress alarmed by the war\u2019s mounting civilian toll. The report found that Israeli \u201caction or inaction\u201d had contributed \u201csignificantly\u201d to the insufficient flow of aid to Palestinian civilians, but it also said that the United States does not \u201ccurrently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance.\u201d"

        "article_content": "The automation marketplace has changed vastly from what it was 30 years ago, but many trends persist and intensified during this time. The first is the increasing emphasis on software and services. Rapid advances in processing capability launched the decade of industrial, artificial intelligence (AI). Cloud computing, edge data processing, virtualization, containerization, Open Process Automation (OPA) and time-sensitive networks (TSN) have transformed the world of control systems. Suppliers continue to beef up their software capabilities, as we saw in 2022 with Emerson buying a majority stake in AspenTech, and Schneider Electric\u2019s acquisition of industrial software giant Aveva that closed in January 2023. ARC Advisory Group keeps reporting this in just about every Control/ARC Automation Top 50 article in recent memory, but software is the driving force behind today\u2019s market, and AI is now the tip of the spear. Suppliers know this, and will continue expanding and honing their software expertise and industrial AI solutions.\n\nGet your subscription to Control's tri-weekly newsletter.\n\nApproaching the Control/ARC Automation Top 50 global and North American automation suppliers is a unique exercise because we must keep one eye in the rearview mirror and the other on the road ahead. According to our standard methodology, ARC has a strict definition and scope of the automation marketplace that you can read about here. We examine supplier performance based on calendar-year revenues. ARC uses publicly available data in addition to information from our own database that we\u2019ve developed during more than 30 years of following the automation marketplace, the overall operations technology (OT) space, and the key end-user trends that drive them.\n\nHardware and services\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean hardware isn\u2019t important. The influx of commercial, IT-based solutions began in the automation marketplace more than 30 years ago, too, with the adoption of commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) operating systems and computing components. The industrial sector debated the benefits of Ethernet for years, until the dam finally burst, and just about every control network available today is based on Ethernet technologies with a few modifications. Today, this trend is accelerating faster than ever, with demand for industrial, edge-based systems and cloud-based automation architectures soaring. Computing requirements for industry will increase exponentially over the next decade, with AI again leading the way. Ethernet Advanced Physical Layer (APL) networking was also introduced in 2023, and will bring the benefits of Ethernet down to the device level and hazardous locations.\n\nAveva and AspenTech aren\u2019t the only recent software acquisitions, though they are substantial. In 2023 alone, ABB acquired a majority stake in Swedish AI startup Viking Analytics; Emerson acquired National Instruments (NI); PTC announced its acquisition of pure-systems; Belden acquired edge-software provider CloudRail; Rockwell Automation acquired OT cybersecurity provider Verve Industrial; and the list goes on. ARC expects more acquisitions as suppliers continue to strength their AI and cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the services business for all of these automation suppliers that continues to grow at the fastest rate. Almost universally, supplier service revenues are increasing faster than either their hardware or software businesses. Suppliers continue to differentiate themselves based on their deep understanding and engineering knowledge of specific industrial and customer requirements, and are striving to create lifelong partnerships with their clients where they provide a continuous stream of value-added lifecycle services. Many of these services are increasingly tailored to help users get more value out of their sustainability and digital transformation programs.\n\nSupplier performance in 2023\n\nOn a year-over-year (YoY) basis, consolidated supplier revenues grew by 8% worldwide and by more than 3% in North America during 2022. This continues the post-COVID-19 growth trend that we\u2019ve seen since 2021, when the market sharply rebounded from the pandemic. In typical fashion, the discrete manufacturing markets were the first to contract and the first to bounce back, while the process industries lagged slightly behind.\n\nIn typical fashion, the overall market leaders haven\u2019t changed significantly, though some smaller suppliers gained ground during 2023. It\u2019s worth noting that changes in relative position on this list don\u2019t necessarily indicate the strength or competence of any supplier, and could be due to other factors, the most obvious being merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. This list will give you an idea of who the market leaders are, but any evaluation of suppliers should obviously be more in-depth than their positions in the Control/ARC Top 50 rankings. With the rapid changes taking place in the automation market, it\u2019s also a good time to reevaluate supplier selection criteria.\n\nBig acquisitions fortify positions\n\nEmerson\u2019s acquisition of NI cemented its number-one position in North America with total revenues close to $8 billion. NI\u2019s consolidation into Emerson also removed it from the list, affecting the relative positions of other suppliers.\n\nThe same happened with Schneider Electric, which now wholly owns Aveva. It likewise cemented its number-four position worldwide, and moved up the list in North America to the number four position, placing it very close to ABB. In North America, Hexagon gained some ground to reach the eighth slot by acquiring several software suppliers concentrated in the digitalization, optimization and AI spaces.\n\nAutomation market hitting a wall?\n\nAfter robust growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, the global and North American automation markets remain strong, but they\u2019re also facing some serious headwinds and signs of softening in several sectors. We expect an overall slowdown in growth, but not a market contraction. Uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and mounting geopolitical conflicts and tensions also contribute to future market uncertainty.\n\nFor example, ARC\u2019s Automation Index declined in 2Q24, which was the first time since the post-pandemic recovery. The automation markets had experienced growth since 3Q20 (past 12 consecutive quarters). Demand for automation products continued to expand in the U.S. market, but at a slower pace. The YoY growth cycle started showing a decline since late 3Q23, and shows further decline through 1Q24. Many of the leading automation suppliers in North America have also increased prices to keep pace with rising production and distribution costs.\n\nMany of the key automation suppliers in North America are reporting strong backlogs, which they plan to work through in 2024. ARC is seeing a shift in growth from converting backlogs to new orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excess inventory. Supply-chain issues have also eased since our last report, and because of this, we\u2019re witnessing improved lead times.\n\nNew energy and decarbonization activities also remain strong, as we'll discuss later in this report. Aside from obvious investments in renewable energy, sustainability is also driving investments in automation for hydrogen infrastructure and its frequent counterpart, carbon capture and storage. Investment in plastics and other recycling technologies, such as wind turbine blade recycling, are increasing. Electrification, utilities, data centers and infrastructure (rail, port and marine) sectors are all experiencing strong growth.\n\nHowever, automotive growth remains weak as automotive manufacturers focus on near-term profitability amid a slowdown in demand for electric vehicles. In addition, semiconductor growth remains weak as manufacturers face several different challenges, including excess memory capacity and workforce shortages. Despite these signs of softening, our outlook remains positive for continued growth in both North America and worldwide through the end of 2024.\n\nHow AI is transforming industry\n\nAI has revolutionized the way we approach problem-solving and decision-making in various industries. Often described as prediction machines or inference engines, AI systems are designed to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions about future events or outcomes. This predictive capability is central to AI's value proposition, enabling businesses to anticipate trends, optimize processes, and make informed decisions. For instance, in the industrial sector, the most widely deployed AI use case involves predicting equipment failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.\n\nThe surge in investment in AI infrastructure is a testament to this technology's transformative potential. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have highlighted the rapid growth in AI investment since the breakthrough of Generative AI (Gen AI) with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5, with projections indicating a global spend nearing $200 billion by 2025.\n\nOver the longer-term, AI-related investment could peak as high as 2.5% to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. and 1.5 to 2.5% of GDP among other major AI leaders, if Goldman Sachs Research\u2019s AI growth projections are fully realized. This investment is driving down the cost of AI solutions, making them more accessible, and enabling broader adoption across industrial sectors. They\u2019re hungry to apply the technology to address growing skills gaps, control spiraling energy costs, and meet demand for more sustainable products and services with more resilient supply chains.\n\nAI and the data explosion\n\nThe industrial sector's challenges aren\u2019t just about volume, but also involve the complexity and fragmentation of data generated by sensors, machines and smart factories. This data is often disconnected and scattered across various applications, making it difficult to harness for insights and decision-making. Many end-users find it necessary to build a better framework for managing data when implementing new technologies like AI, and this is driving growth in industrial IoT platforms like Honeywell\u2019s Forge, Siemens\u2019 MindSphere, ABB\u2019s Ability, Rockwell Automation\u2019s FactoryTalk InnovationSuite, and Schneider Electric\u2019s EcoStruxure. Other suppliers like Yokogawa are implementing their own industrial AI platforms that allow connections between operational assets and the enterprise.\n\nEach industrial AI use case requires specific datasets, and may necessitate different tools and techniques. For instance, predictive maintenance relies on sensor data to forecast equipment failures, while generative design uses parameters like materials and cost constraints to create product designs.\n\nSustainability drives digital transformation\n\nThe real question is how all this technology is applied and what its business case is. Energy transition and sustainability are being woven into the core business strategies of most of the world\u2019s largest industrial companies, which now have a mandate and opportunity to not only to tackle environmental and social challenges, but also take advantage of the commercial opportunities and competitive advantages that sustainability offers.\n\nFor several years, sustainability issues were approached as something to be dealt with cautiously in reaction to increasingly stringent regulations. However, massive commercial opportunities have emerged beyond just regulatory compliance. Many companies are discovering that ramping up digital transformation initiatives can help reach their sustainability goals. Sustainability can provide business value across several dimensions, including increased energy efficiency, new processes for carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen production and transportation.\n\nSpending on sustainability increases\n\nFor instance, Bank of America (BoA) reports that, prior to COVID-19, the U.S. spent about 0.4% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy, while Germany spent 0.5% or more, and the EU\u2019s other member nations spent more traditionally. Today, the U.S. spends 0.8% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy thanks to passing its $1.8 trillion stimulus package. The most recent stimulus is structured quite differently from what the U.S. did before. It doesn't peak until 2026, and will run until 2031. The stimulus was designed so that many projects are in \u201cred states,\u201d and $2.4 trillion is needed to meet net-zero emission targets laid out for the U.S. over the next five years, according to BoA\u2019s research.\n\nMost companies are enhancing energy efficiency and switching to clean-energy sources. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) facilities have also been growing significantly. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, Section 45 Q tax credits for capturing carbon have increased to $85 per ton, and most companies can do this at a much lower cost. This makes CCUS extremely profitable, which is why we see so much activity in it, including ExxonMobil\u2019s acquisition of Denbury, Occidental\u2019s acquisition of Carbon Engineering and others.\n\nEdge computing push intensifies\n\nIndustrial, edge-computing solutions can overcome limitations such as latency, reliability and security by extending the cloud into OT environments, while also reducing cloud-input data volumes and egress costs. Data at the edge of networks can be aggregated and contextualized to deliver summary information and insights directly to the cloud, ultimately reducing cloud-based, data-storage costs. Edge functionality has likewise expanded digital transformation\u2019s reach into remote, hazardous and other distributed environments, simultaneously addressing potential lacks of reliable network connections and skilled IT personnel in the field.\n\nCustomers and suppliers alike are aligning their edge strategies to take advantage of the cloud\u2019s centralized management, security and scaling capabilities, while preserving operational integrity by marrying these with onsite, edge capabilities. The descent of cloud-native, containerized architectures to the edge is simplifying deployment and management of edge applications, a key edge value driver, by providing a lightweight and portable way to package software and its dependencies. Industrial data can be pre-processed at the edge, sent to the cloud for analytics or model training, and then redeployed at the edge in lightweight software containers.\n\nIndustrial automation and cloud-native architectures are coming together, while industrial automation itself is increasingly software-defined. The data sought by edge and cloud-based solutions resides in the logic, process and motion controllers sold by traditional automation suppliers, which are typically large players with deep domain knowledge that closely integrate their edge offerings with their higher-level, software-based solutions.\n\nThese products typically focus on domain-specific use cases that relate to their core automation competencies. Early offerings look to apply analytics to monitoring and maintenance applications focused on reduced downtime and asset utilization objectives. Automation suppliers are also taking advantage of existing edge technology and ecosystems, and partnering with and/or investing in complementary infrastructures, open-source and multiple cloud providers."
