He is a foundational figure in the national pantheon and leader of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as it settled Boston.\n\nWinthrop\u2019s sensational account of \"a great light in the night\" was witnessed by a group of \"sober, discreet\" and \"credible persons\" over Muddy River in Boston \u2014 a trickle of a creek that today wraps around American sports landmark Fenway Park.\n\nMeet The American Who First Planted Apples In The Colonies: William Blaxton, Eccentric Settler\n\nWinthrop's leadership of the fledgling Massachusetts colony shaped the destiny of the United States, established more than a century after his death.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\nHe has serious street cred in academia, making his spectacular record of unexplained phenomena all the more remarkable.\n\nJohn Winthrop, who led the settlement of Boston in 1630, chronicled daily colonial life in his journal. His writing, widely esteemed among scholars, includes three reports of UFO sightings.\n\n\"John Winthrop\u2019s journal has long served as a cornerstone of Massachusetts historical scholarship,\" the Massachusetts Historical Society writes in a recent look at the Puritan's UFO sightings.\n\n\"He diligently recorded the events of his life, along with the trials and tribulations of the people of the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the first 19 years of its existence.\"\n\nWinthrop\u2019s incredible tales of aerial phenomena in early America, long unknown, generated sudden interest in recent years, after federal government and military officials admitted that it\u2019s been studying UFOs for decades.\n\nStories of paranormal and unexplained phenomena were effectively mainstreamed for academics and serious analysts.\n\nU.S. Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray explains a video of unidentified aerial phenomena, as he testifies before a House Intelligence Committee subcommittee hearing at the U.S. Capitol on May 17, 2022. Federal officials' recent admissions that the government has been investigating UFOs for decades generated interest in reports of unexplained phenomena by Massachusetts Bay Colony founder John Winthrop.\n\nFew Americans were more serious than Winthrop.\n\nHe was a devout Christian and an industrious nation builder. Despite the hardship of carving a new civilization from the wilderness, and governing a new society, he dutifully kept almost daily records of life in the colony for nearly two decades.\n\nOne 2005 biography is titled \"John Winthrop: America's Forgotten Founding Father.\"\n\n\"His energies seemed prodigious and inexhaustible,\" PBS Frontline said of Winthrop.\n\n\"Repeatedly elected governor, he was chiefly responsible for maintaining civic and social order.\"\n\nJohn Winthrop was born on Jan. 12, 1587 or 1588, in Edwardstone, Suffolk County, England, to Adam and Anne (Browne) Winthrop.\n\nThe Arbella, a copy of Gov. John Winthrop's flagship, moored in Forest River Park in Salem, Massachusetts, on the edge of a model pioneer village.\n\nBoth his parents came from prosperous families, according to various accounts.\n\nHe began journal-keeping in 1605 while still a teenager, chronicling his growing devotion to Christ. His faith was increasingly at odds with national sentiment after King Charles I, an Anglican sympathetic to Roman Catholicism, gained the throne in 1625.\n\nWinthrop departed for the New World in the spring of 1630 aboard the Arbella with an expedition of Puritans to establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony, about 35 miles north of the Plymouth Colony settled by the Pilgrims in 1620.\n\nWinthrop issued a message on the ship that has echoed through American history.\n\nIt\u2019s remembered today as the \"city upon a hill\" sermon \u2014 inspired by several biblical passages and delivered to a daring people fleeing decrepit old Europe to create a New World in service of Christ.\n\n\"For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us,\" Winthrop said.\n\nReception of a Narragansett warrior by John Winthrop, Massachusetts, c 1630s (c 1880). Winthrop was the leader of a group of Puritan settlers who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. A print from \"Cassell's History of the United States\" by Edmund Ollier, Volume I, Cassell Petter and Galpin, London, c 1880.\n\n\"So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world.\"\n\nThe \"city upon a hill\" sermon helped establish the concept of American exceptionalism \u2014 a new society that would be a \"model of Christian charity\" for the world to admire and emulate.\n\nMeet The American Who Inspired The Nation In Two World Wars: Christian Soldier Sgt. Alvin York\n\nThe phrase \"a city upon a hill\" has been widely quoted by following generations, most notably by President Ronald Reagan, who cited Winthrop by name in his farewell address.\n\n\"I've spoken of the shining city all my political life,\" Reagan said to the nation on Jan. 11, 1989.\n\nJohn Winthrop, Puritan founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, chronicled the minutiae of nation-building for 19 years in a detailed journal. His March 1, 1639, entry includes the first report of a UFO encounter in America. He recorded two other UFO sightings in Boston in 1644.\n\n\"In my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace \u2026 That's how I saw it, and see it still.\"\n\nWinthrop was God-fearing, intrepid, faithful, hard-working and diligent \u2014 serious in faith and deed. Few people in American history had less time, inclination or motive to devote to fantasy or foolishness.\n\nWinthrop\u2019s report of an eerie UFO encounter on a winter night in Boston is sandwiched between perfunctory passages about business dealings with the natives.\n\nThe subject turned suddenly.\n\nEngraving depicting a lighter, a type of flat-bottomed barge used to transfer goods and passengers to and from moored ships. Dated 19th century. Puritan leader John Winthrop recorded America's first UFO incident in 1639, witnessed by three men on a lighter similar to this one. His report hints they were also abducted.\n\n\"In this year one James Everell, a sober, discreet man, and two others, saw a great light in the night at Muddy River,\" Winthrop wrote on March 1, 1639.\n\n\"When it stood still, it flamed up, and was about three yards square; when it ran it was contracted into the figure of a swine.\"\n\nWinthrop went on, \"It ran swift as an arrow toward Charlton [Charlestown] and up and down about two or three hours. They were come down in their lighter [a small barge] about a mile, and, when it was over, they found themselves carried quite back against the tide to the place they came from. Divers[e] other persons saw the same light, after, about the same place.\"\n\n\"That's stunning,\" UFO researcher Nick Pope told Fox News Digital after hearing the story for the first time.\n\nNick Pope, a former UFO investigator for the U.K. Ministry of Defense and frequent contributor to \"Ancient Aliens\" on The History Channel, calls Puritan leader John Winthrop's passages on UFO's in early colonial Boston \"pretty stunning.\"\n\nPope is a former UFO investigator for the U.K. Ministry of Defense and contributor to \"Ancient Aliens\" on The History Channel.\n\nSeveral sources say ignis fatuus, a spark of swamp gas, is the likely cause of the strange light.\n\nAngels In Our Midst? One Scientist Explains Why The Bible Supports Extraterrestrials\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t explain how the phantom light raced across the river \u2014 or why Everell and the other men in the boat wound up a mile downstream.\n\n\"Some researchers would interpret this as a possible alien abduction if it happened today,\" authors Jacques Vallee and Chris Aubeck wrote in \"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times.\"\n\n\"Winthrop's UFO\" was an art installation placed in 2019 along Muddy River in Boston, where Puritan leader John Winthrop recorded America's first UFO sighting in 1639. Artists Ann Hirsch and Jeremy Angier of A+J Art+Design created it; it represents the figure of a light in the shape of a swine, as Winthrop described.\n\nWinthrop reported two more UFO sightings in 1644, the first on Jan. 18.\n\n\"About midnight, three men, coming in a boat to Boston, saw two lights arise out of the water near the north point of the town cove, in form like a man, and went at a small distance to the town, and so to the south point, and there vanished away.\"\n\nMeet The American Who Rowed Washington Across The Delaware On Christmas: Sailor-soldier John Glover\n\nA week later another supernatural encounter was \"seen by many,\" he wrote.\n\n\"A light like the moon arose about the N.E. point in Boston, and met the former at Nottles Island, and there they closed in one, and then parted, and closed and parted diverse times, and so went over the hill in the island and vanished. Sometimes they shot out flames and sometimes sparkles.\"\n\nWinthrop never mentioned the events again.\n\nHis journal was not published until 1825. The mysterious passages were ignored amid the insight into colonial history culled from his voluminous writings.\n\nMuddy River in Boston on Jan. 18, 2022. John Wintrhop, Puritan founder of Massachusetts Bay Colony, recorded America's first UFO sighting along Muddy River on March 1, 1639.\n\nThe eerie objects remain unidentified today, yet come from one of the most trusted sources in American scholarship.\n\n\"I think it speaks to the fact that those skeptics don\u2019t like to admit, but most UFO witnesses, like Everell or Winthrop, are serious, sober individuals,\" said Pope.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t surprise me you have these very historical figures seeing these things. It\u2019s vindication of what we see today. If you look at modern [UFO] accounts, very often they\u2019re [from] police officers, pilots, military personnel, radar operators.\"\n\nJohn Winthrop died of natural causes on March 26, 1649. He was 61 or 62 years old.\n\nHe\u2019s buried today in King\u2019s Chapel Burying Ground in the heart of downtown Boston.\n\nEstablished in 1630, it\u2019s one of the nation\u2019s oldest cemeteries.\n\nJohn Winthrop, Illustration, \"Ridpath's History of the World,\" Volume III, by John Clark Ridpath, LL.

        "article_content": "'How far can you push this one idea?': The UFO 50 team discusses the making of the most bonkers and beautifully weird gaming achievement of 2024\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Mossmouth\n\nFor all its ebullience, and for all its palpable enthusiasm for the medium, there's something deeply weird about UFO 50 . The 50-game collection draws its power from constraints: the fictional hardware at its heart, the LX, is an 8-bit system with a 32-colour limit. The resulting aesthetic is immediately recognisable: Everyone knows the Nintendo and Sega systems of this era.\n\nBut people are less likely to know about the ZX Spectrum, and I'll bet few are familiar with the Amstrad CPC 464 mascot Roland. Most people know about the Commodore 64, but can they name five games? (And if so, why isn't one of them Mad Nurse ?) The systems you never got to play are gaps in the continuum. In the internet age, dipping into the catalogue of the MSX platform, or the PC-8800 series of home computers, feels like visiting an alternate vision of the future that just didn't take.\n\nUFO 50 channels this uncanny atmosphere for me, telling the story of a mysterious 1980s game development studio while keeping to that most fundamental of storytelling tenets: show, don't tell. Mossmouth isn't telling the story of UFOsoft: it's bringing it to life in the form of a whole game catalogue. UFOSoft now exists, and the sensibilities of its four central fictional developers don't fit neatly with the canon.\n\nWe were probably more influenced by the games we didn't get to play as kids\n\nI spoke to most of the UFO 50 team\u2014the IRL UFO 50 team\u2014earlier this week. My first point of curiosity was what source they were most inspired by. I told them the UFO 50 collection feels more akin to computer games of the '80s, rather than the better known console games by the likes of Nintendo, Sega, Capcom et al. The actual point of inspiration was, of course, varied and highly personalised.\n\n\"In general, I've been very attracted to the aesthetics of computers and consoles that I never owned,\" said Derek Yu, Mossmouth founder, Spelunky creator, and one of the six UFO 50 developers.\n\n\"We were probably more influenced by the games we didn't get to play as kids; the stuff we saw in magazines and fantasized about,\" said Eirik Suhrke, who not only worked on music for all of the UFO 50 games but also had a hand in design. Tyriq Plummer, who has worked with WayForward and on Cadence of Hyrule, picks up on the thread: \"[I like] the idea of being influenced more by the things that you don't experience, because they live larger in your brain and have more potential. The things you do experience are much more locked in and real in a way that kind of limits them.\"\n\nUFO 50\n\nPlummer is the youngest on the UFO 50 team, so he never experienced the 8-bit era first hand: his exposure to those games of yore is via emulation. Yu, for his part, said he feels more indebted to MS-DOS games, while Jon Perry\u2014a tabletop designer who has made games with Yu since childhood\u2014points to early '90s browser and freeware games as points of reference (Derek and Jon used the now defunct Klik and Play toolset to make games way back then). As for Paul Hubans\u2014creator of The Indie Game Legend and the forthcoming Madhouse\u2014he had the NES firmly in his sights while developing UFO 50.\n\nThe game was announced in 2017. Back then, Yu told us that it'd be out the following year. \"If we really analysed it upfront and realised it was going to take eight years or whatever, we might not have dived in,\" Suhrke said about missing that optimistic deadline.\n\nMembers of the team\u2014which also included Downwell creator Ojiro Fumoto, who wasn\u2019t in our call\u2014tended to take directorship over any given game, though most titles involved an element of collaboration and are touched by several hands. During our chat Perry reveals that a game he commandeered\u2014the clever shrinking puzzle-platformer Mini and Max\u2014had a fair bit of input by Hubans. Not everyone on the team knew this, and why would they? No one's even finished every game.\n\nUFO 50\n\n\"We both played all of them a little bit, but yeah\u2026 I've been watching on Twitch and just seeing new stuff constantly,\" Suhrke said. \"No one has the full picture.\"\n\nYu continues: \"There's a lot of 'when did you add that to this game?' after release. That's always the best is when you're surprised by the game that you're working on. That's partly why it's been so enjoyable to work on it for all these years: we're constantly sharing and surprising each other.\"\n\n\"It's interesting to see where we overlap on games,\" Hubans said. \"With Mini and Max it was very much Jon's idea, but he let me have a lot of creative liberty with fleshing out a lot of the details at a certain level. And I kind of see that as the game where John and I overlap. Then there's games where Derek and Jon overlap, or Eirik and Derek overlap, and so on and so forth.\"\n\nIt's a matter of how far can you push this one idea? How can you maximise whatever this game is trying to be by itself?\n\nBut the influence of each member of the team isn't as simple as who directed which game, or who might have had a secondary hand in it. \"It's also just the fact that we've been hanging out for eight years and playing each other's games and influencing each other's designs and, you know, reading each other's code and influencing each other's code styles even,\" Suhrke said.\n\n\n\n\"It's kind of like a band would sort of merge to form one sound: we've all influenced each other just by hanging out and playing each other's games and collaborating in very subtle ways that I'm not sure we could even point out.\"\n\nUFO 50\n\nThese real world designers aren't credited according to the individual games they directed or helped make; in the fiction of UFO 50 they're archivists. The UFOSoft team are fictional characters that aren't, so said Perry, consistently mapped to any of the flesh world developers.\n\n\"But they map a little bit,\" he admits, \"and that's just because we all have our own recognizable styles and tics that appear. So it's not like we would roleplay the same character and make multiple games that would then get assigned to one fictional character. We wanted to produce games that had certain natural leanings and tendencies and then it just became natural to roughly assign those to fictional characters in a way that leverages the sort of trends you could already see in the games, so that the fiction would be more believable.\"\n\nThe fiction was there from the start, but the way it unfolds\u2014the evolution of the UFOSoft catalogue\u2014was constantly reiterated throughout development in interesting ways. Take Barbuta for instance, which was (perhaps unsurprisingly) inspired by La-Mulana and Montezuma's Revenge. It's the first game in the collection if you're following the default chronological order, and it's also one of the hardest and most opaque: if you're determined to play the games in order it's an unforgiving introduction. Developed by UFOSoft's Thorston Petter (in the real world, Suhrke), that game was actually tweaked to be more primitive and less approachable than its original design when the team decided it should be UFOSoft's \"first\".\n\nUFO 50 Barbuta\n\n\"That game was not designed to be the first game in UFO 50 chronologically,\" Yu said. \"I feel like that's important to note. We weren't like, 'we need a first game and it's got to be a certain way'.\n\nSuhrke continues: \"But once it had that position there were certain ways in which we leaned into it. Originally there was normal feedback when you hit an enemy: it would flash and there would be a sound, but then we recognized that if you remove even that [feedback] it feels even colder and more alien to you. And so like every other UFO 50 game it's a matter of how far can you push this one idea? How can you maximise whatever this game is trying to be by itself? For Barbuta, that was just to make it as unwelcoming as you can; to try to get players to defeat it out of spite.\"\n\nBarbuta's spiritual successor is another Petter joint, in the form of Mooncat. It's a platformer with a bizarre two-button approach to movement, which recalls when games didn't have tried-and-true rules about mechanics as fundamental as movement. It was born of Suhre wanting to make a platformer for a Ludum Dare game jam with a two-button restriction (he said it took a hallucination to come up with the game concept) but it's a perfect fit for the UFO 50 ethos.\n\nUFO 50\n\nAt a time when the industry seems thoroughly down at heel, UFO 50 feels like a rarity: something a handful of people made because they wanted it to exist. Chatting to the team feels like talking to a close-knit group of friends, and none waste an opportunity to mention how much fun it has been to work on the project. \"It feels like everyday I've been learning from these other people who are just so good at what they do and invested in making something really cool, and finding a way to connect everything has been extremely gratifying as a game designer,\" Yu said. \"It feels like you're learning from the work and the other people all the time, every day.\"\n\nThe team politely declined to discuss the uber-secretive 51st game , which appears to be a meta-narrative about the meta-narrative. Nor would they confirm that a 16-bit UFO collection could emerge. I get the sense that they'll definitely be working together in the future, though.\n\n\"This has been bootcamp for me,\" Suhrke said. \"I think I've become very good at making UFOSoft games. Give me a tube for nutrition and I can keep cranking these out. Assuming I personally keep making games, you're going to see stuff [from me] that feels like it has the DNA of UFOSoft in it; It's sort of like a chicken and egg.\""

The city put up a historical marker outside his childhood home.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the second thing: space aliens. The city put up a marker for them too.\n\n\u201cIt was the evening of October 11, 1973 when two local shipyard workers went fishing,\u201d the marker says, at the edge of the Pascagoula River.\n\nThe sign says Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker spotted a football-shaped craft, which took them aboard.\n\n\u201cInside the craft, Hickson was examined by a robotic eye, then both men were deposited back on the river bank and the space ship shot away,\u201d the marker says. Stamped at the bottom is the seal of the city of Pascagoula and the Jackson County Historical and Genealogical Society.\n\nMayor Jay Willis says when it came to writing this marker, authorities saw no reason to hedge.\n\n\u201cBecause these two guys had the same story of what happened, how it happened for the rest of their lives,\u201d Willis explains. \u201cThis marker is going to be there for a long, long time. It\u2019s a lasting tribute \u2026 to what occurred right here in Pascagoula.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way to really know what happened that night in 1973, when the men waded headfirst into one of humanity\u2019s greatest mysteries: Are we alone?\n\nBut the marker is now one of at least 15 that say, without hesitation, that aliens have come to visit Earth.\n\nThey join more than 180,000 other historical markers dotting the country\u2019s landscape, and NPR found they wouldn\u2019t be the first to claim something that may, or may not, be true.\n\nThere\u2019s a marker in Massachusetts that claims the town was once home to a real, live wizard. New York has a marker about a ghost that plays the fiddle on a bridge in the moonlight.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut locals say Pascagoula\u2019s alien marker is no tourist stunt.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be known for something, why the heck not?\u201d says Rebecca Davis who helped write the marker when she ran the development group Main Street Pascagoula.\n\nShe says at first most people in town didn\u2019t believe the men\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cThey thought they were just off their rockers,\u201d Davis says, standing next to the wooded area by the river where the men said they were abducted. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the Bible Belt, you know? Like my grandma told me, 'Girl, hush, we don\u2019t talk about that stuff.'\u201d\n\nLaura Sullivan / NPR / NPR Rebecca Davis, who used to run Main Street Pascagoula, helped write the marker. She says people today are more open to the idea that the story could be true.\n\nBut as time passed, Davis says, the feeling changed. There was also a recording of the men, who have since died, talking about their experience that believers say gives it credibility.\n\n\u201cPeople back then, I really think they wanted to believe, but they were scared to believe,\u201d she says, \u201cand now\u2019s a different time, a different age, and more openness.\u201d\n\nThat openness has spread across American society. Half of Americans now believe that military reports of UFOs are likely evidence of intelligent life outside Earth, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey.\n\nBut openness is different than etching facts into a bronze or acrylic plaque and staking it into the dirt.\n\nScott and Suzanne Ramsey put up one of the nation\u2019s first alien markers in 1999 in the high desert near Aztec, N.M., where they say a spaceship crashed in 1948.\n\n\u201cWe welded up a metal stand and had a local trophy shop do the engraving,\u201d Scott Ramsey says. They replaced it with a new version in 2007.\n\n\u201cI think it kind of lends credibility to the fact that something did happen there,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s always been difficult to argue with historical markers. That\u2019s part of their allure. Rewriting them means taking the whole sign down and starting over.\n\nAnd that permanence has made alien markers an attraction. The Aztec visitor center now hands out maps and hosts the Alien Run mountain bike race.\n\nUFO enthusiasts say they pass around road trip ideas. Start in Lincoln, N.H., where a marker says Betty and Barney Hill were abducted. Head to Franklin, Ky., where another describes how a National Guard pilot died chasing a UFO. On to Shiloh, Ill., which tells of a \u201cconfirmed UFO sighting.\u201d\n\nFascination with extraterrestrials isn\u2019t new, but what was once left to low-budget sci-fi movies has taken on a new seriousness. There\u2019s declassified military reports, even interest from Congress.\n\nStill, none of it has amounted to much actual proof, and even as Frank Drake pointed the first radio telescope at the stars in 1960, and far more sophisticated probes have been searching for the last 20 years, those efforts have so far been met with silence.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped cities from stamping alien markers with official emblems and crests.\n\nOn a recent afternoon in Pascagoula, Thearon Ephriam and his uncle, David Ephriam, took a break from fishing to read the sign.\n\n\u201cAs dusk fell a buzzing sound alerted them to a football-shaped craft hovering behind them,\u201d David Ephriam read from the sign as he started to chuckle. \u201cAin't this something?\u201d he asked.\n\nLaura Sullivan / NPR / NPR Pascagoula\u2019s alien marker is now one of at least 15 that claim extraterrestrials have come to Earth.\n\nThearon Ephriam pointed to the city of Pascagoula logo. \u201cThey put a whole stand up,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cGotta be some truth in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have to be aware when we come out here,\u201d David said.\n\nThearon raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf we see a football-shaped craft we know to get low.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf one comes up behind you and looks like a football,\u201d David laughed, \u201cdon\u2019t look back, dive.\u201d\n\nHowever future researchers may view these signs years from now, even UFO enthusiasts wouldn\u2019t argue with that advice.\n\nCan't see the graphics in this story?

        "article_content": "Wordy is a new iOS app that offers a unique way to learning English. The app automatically translates and defines unknown words while you watch your favorite movies or TV shows. Wordy has over 500,000 titles available, including popular series such as HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Penguin\u201d and the new Disney+ show, \u201cAgatha All Along.\u201d\n\nCreated by indie developer S\u00e1ndor Bogy\u00f3, a 23-year-old from Budapest, the app was born out of his frustration with looking up unfamiliar phrases in his non-native language while watching shows in English. His experience with Language Reactor, a Chrome extension similar to Wordy, led him to realize the need for a mobile app that would make it easier to use his phone while watching TV or using the computer.\n\nWhen a user selects an episode from Wordy\u2019s library, the AI analyzes the subtitles, then extracts and lemmatizes each word. Using your phone\u2019s microphone, a custom speech recognition model identifies spoken sentences from the audio coming from the TV or computer. This helps the app find where you are in the episode and follow along, scrolling down the transcript and highlighting certain words that may be difficult for non-native English speakers. When a new word appears, you can quickly glance at your phone for the translation.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a summary page for each episode, allowing you to view every word at once, which are sorted by difficulty level: Proficiency English, Advanced English, Upper-intermediate, Intermediate, Elementary, and Beginner. Wordy also provides the option to save words to your Library and practice them later using digital flashcards.\n\nImage Credits: Wordy\n\nWordy uses a combination of its proprietary and third-party AI models. Bogy\u00f3 explained to TechCrunch that it leverages the largest open movie database, TMDB, for film and series data, along with OpenSubtitles.com via their API, which he has found to provide the most accurate and reliable subtitles.\n\nDuring our testing, we opened the app on our phone while watching Netflix\u2019s hit TV show, \u201cWednesday\u201d on a laptop. Wordy pointed out terms like \u201cplagued\u201d and \u201csadism,\u201d which are more sophisticated vocabulary that beginners just learning the language may not know. We found that the translations were accurate and easy to understand.\n\nOne caveat is that it\u2019s currently only available in English, whereas rival Language Reactor supports all the major languages. Bogy\u00f3 assured us that he is working on adding more languages. He plans to integrate Spanish into the app in November, with French and German to follow in the coming months.\n\n\u201cI prefer to maintain quality over rushing the process, so I\u2019m taking the time to ensure each language integration meets my standards for accuracy and user experience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe app costs $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year. An Android version will launch in November."

        "article_content": "Fifteen years ago, on September 25, 2009, Paranormal Activity was released in theaters and scared the pants out of audiences everywhere. Even before the movie\u2019s premiere, it had already become legendary. Instead of debuting via a massive theatrical release rollout, the micro-budgeted movie was screened in college towns across the country to drum up word of mouth.\n\nIt worked. Thanks to the (somewhat still new) popularity of Facebook and the prominence of texting on phones, Paranormal Activity didn\u2019t need a marketing campaign. Frightened audiences told everyone they knew about the scary movie they just watched. Soon, the internet was ablaze with word of this new movie that didn\u2019t have stars anyone had heard of before.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe birth of a new horror franchise\n\nFilmed in the found-footage style, the movie centers around a young couple, Micah and Katie, who are determined to capture the paranormal activity happening in their house. But it\u2019s not just a ghost that\u2019s haunting them, it\u2019s a demon. Even worse, the more attention they give to it, the stronger and more active it becomes.\n\nParamount realized Paranormal Activity was destined to become a hit and picked it up for wide distribution. When the movie finally premiered in theaters across the country, audiences were terrified. When speaking to Empire, Jordan Peele recounted his experience seeing the movie in theaters. \u201cWhen the s*** hit the fan, Katie is dragged out of the room screaming. The audience absolutely lost it,\u201d the horror icon said.\n\nSince then, Paranormal Activity has received six sequels and has become one of the most prominent examples of found-footage movies ever. It\u2019s also just as scary as it was in 2009, and aside from the dated use of the camcorder, it still looks and feels terrifying.\n\nParanormal Activity was genuinely scary to a desensitized audience\n\nPeele isn\u2019t the only one who was horrified by Paranormal Activity. In 2009 Roger Ebert even gave the movie 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \u201cIt illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x.\u201d\n\nThe movie was so scary that its trailers even used audience footage from its screenings to show how horrified moviegoers were. By the end of its box office run, Paranormal Activity had raked in over $193 million.\n\nSimilarly to The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity gets a lot of its horror from what audiences don\u2019t see. Strange sounds and small movements captured by the camera seem trivial, but when the movie\u2019s pacing is flawless, each small instance can feel monumental and the anticipation that builds between them is undeniable.\n\nAs the movie continues, the stakes get higher and the hauntings more intense. But the film never uses special effects or has some haggard-looking ghost running around. Even its \u201cbig moments\u201d are subtle compared to other horror movies. For example, at one point Micah scatters baby powder around the floor to see if something really is walking through their house at night. When he turns the lights on, the prints left behind look like some kind of lizard or bird.\n\nEven as someone who doesn\u2019t believe in the paranormal, this movie still gets to me. It utilizes our natural fears, like being in a big, empty, dark house at night \u2014 and then hearing a strange sound in the hallway.\n\nBut the movie definitely requires some patience. If you like being scared by CGI-generated monsters and loud musical cues, then this probably isn\u2019t the movie for you. But if you turn off all the lights in a quiet room late at night and watch Paranormal Activity, you will discover just how horrifying it is.\n\nParanormal Activity ushered in the paranormal horror era\n\nThe success of Paranormal Activity was so massive it created a sea change in the horror genre. When the film premiered initially in 2007 and then had its full release in 2009, horror was in its full-blown \u201ctorture porn\u201d phase, where filmmakers were doing everything they could to have the goriest and grossest torture movie possible. The Saw franchise, Hostel, and The Hills Have Eyes reboots were proving to be box office hits, and The Human Centipede had just made its debut at FrightFest.\n\nBut after Paranormal Activity outgrossed all those movies (Saw II for example was the highest-grossing Saw film, making just under $148 million, which was $40 million less than Paranormal Activity), Hollywood realized a new horror trend may have just emerged. The torture porn trend ended almost immediately after Paranormal Activity, and by the following year, the paranormal era was hitting high gear and gore was gone.\n\nAfter Paranormal Activity, more paranormal horror films followed, including numerous Paranormal Activity sequels, as well as Insidious and The Conjuring, both of which would spawn their own massive franchises. There was also a wave of other low-budget found-footage paranormal movies that, while never making a huge splash, became notable hits within the horror community, like Hell House LLC, Grave Encounters, and The Taking of Deborah Logan.\n\nNow could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity\n\nParanormal Activity was made and released during a period of massive change. Social media had just become a widely used tool by society, and smartphones had just started rolling out to the general public.\n\nNew technology that wasn\u2019t around at the time of its release could be used to make a really fun modern Paranormal Activity sequel or reboot. Between Nest cams, doorbell cameras, smartphones, drones, and even dashcams, there are so many new tools that could be used to reinvent the found-footage genre and add new touches.\n\nThe streaming era could also be helpful, since studios don\u2019t need to invest as much money into theatrical releases and instead can release low-budget movies on their streaming platforms for much less investment. With how cheap the Paranormal Activity movies are to make, they could be perfect for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Shudder, or even Tubi.\n\nAnother reason why now could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity movie is that belief in the paranormal has actually risen in recent years. There\u2019s a lot of really touchy topics that have probably caused this \u2014 largely America\u2019s regression into fanaticism and conspiratorial thinking \u2014 but modern studies have shown some shocking results. In 2021, it was reported that 57% of Americans believe in ghosts, and in 2023 another study revealed that over half of Americans think they\u2019ve actually been visited by a ghost.\n\nThese findings might make some of us question our fellow Americans and their belief systems, but for Hollywood and anyone wanting to make a paranormal movie to scare the crap out of people\u2026now seems to be the perfect time.\n\nYou can watch Paranormal Activity on Max."

The tour, which costs $25 for adults, included the history of the house as well as a critique of how the 2013 movie \"The Conjuring\" was different from the story told by members of the Perron family, who lived in the house in the 1970s and told of being beset by a malevolent spirit.\n\nAfter the tour, which lasted about 45 minutes, guests were given free-run of the house and grounds to explore and take pictures.\n\nThe Conjuring House website lists a variety of \"experiences\" that customers can book, including 60- and 90-minute house tours; so-called GHO events, where an experienced paranormal investigator guides novices through a multi-hour investigation, including providing equipment; overnight investigations, where groups of up to eight can have exclusive use of the house overnight to conduct investigations, but they are on their own, no equipment provided; and Ghamping, where guests can camp in tents provided by The Conjuring House, with the camping season ending next month.\n\nThe seance room in the Conjuring House. The Burrillville house inspired the 2013 supernatural horror film \"The Conjuring,\" when members of a family who lived in the house in the 1970s told of being beset by a malevolent spirit.\n\nThe website's special events page, where Halloween events have been listed in the past, was empty Wednesday afternoon.\n\nOwner Jacqueline Nunez did not respond to a text message from a Journal reporter asking about Halloween plans.\n\nThe Conjuring House Facebook page and Instagram were not available Wednesday. Its X feed had zero posts, and the newest video on its YouTube channel was several years old.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Want to tour The Conjuring House?

This can be done by looking at the atmospheric spectra of a world to discover the spectral pattern of a molecule that can only be created through biological processes.\n\nWhile it sounds straightforward, it isn't. The presence of simple molecules such as water and oxygen don't prove life exists on a planet. It's true that Earth's atmosphere is oxygen rich thanks to life, but geological activity can also produce large quantities of oxygen.\n\nAnd as a new study shows, some molecules we've long thought to be biological in origin may not be.\n\nIdeally astronomers would love to find evidence of a really complex molecule such as chlorophyll. But there isn't likely to be tons of chlorophyll in an atmosphere, so the spectral pattern would be faint, and even if it were clear the pattern is complex and hard to distinguish.\n\nSo astronomers generally focus on simpler but unique molecules. One of these molecules is dimethyl sulfide, (CH 3 ) 2 S or DMS for short. It is only produced by phytoplankton on Earth, so it would be a strong indicator of life. Or so we thought.\n\nIn this new work the team was able to synthesize DMS and other sulfur-based molecules in the lab abiotically. While that doesn't prove the same process can happen in the wild, the team went on to show how DMS could be formed on a world with a thick organic haze.\n\nWe know such planets exist because Saturn's moon Titan is just such a world. If, for example, Titan happened to be closer to the Sun, the ultraviolet radiation would be significant enough to trigger the chemical reactions necessary to create DMS.\n\nIf Titan were in Earth's orbit, a distant alien race would detect DMS in the atmosphere of a planet in the Sun's habitable zone. It would look like a slam dunk, but Titan would still be toxic to life as we know it.\n\nBut Titan might have some presence of exotic life, which is another conclusion to this study. While the authors show that the presence of DMS or similar molecules wouldn't prove life exists on a world, they argue that it would indicate a strong potential for life.\n\nBasically, a warm planet with the kind of rich organic haze in its atmosphere would necessarily have the kind of complex organic molecules life needs to evolve. If DMS exists on a world, then the potential for life exists at the very least.\n\nWhile this study shows we will need to be careful about treating particular molecules as biosignatures, it also supports what exo-biologists have known for some time.\n\nThe discovery of life on another world isn't likely going to happen as a single great eureka moment. What is more likely is that a handful of planets will have chemical markers that support the possibility of life.\n\nOver time as we find more candidate biomarkers in their atmospheres we will be ever more confident that life exists.\n\nThis article was originally published by Universe Today.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Science Advances (2024). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ado1662\n\nIn a discovery that sheds light on the complex mechanisms of gene regulation, scientists at EPFL have uncovered a critical role for the protein ZNF274 in keeping certain gene clusters turned off by anchoring them to the cell nucleolus. The study is published in Science Advances.\n\nOur DNA is not just a string of genes; it's a complex and dynamic structure where the spatial organization within the nucleus plays a crucial role in regulating which genes are turned on or off. One key player in this intricate process is the nucleolus, a spherical structure that sits inside the cell's nucleus, the compartment where gene expression is orchestrated and performed.\n\nThe nucleolus is primarily known as the site of production of ribosomes, which play key roles in the making of proteins. However, recent studies have found that the nucleolus is also involved in regulating gene expression.\n\nControlling gene activity\n\nThe nucleolus is surrounded by regions of the genome called nucleolus-associated domains (NADs), which host repressed\u2014or \"silenced\"\u2014genes. Scientists think that NADs play a key role in maintaining under tight control genes arranged in clusters along chromosomes, which is essential for proper cell function and development. However, the mechanisms that target specific gene clusters to NADs have remained largely mysterious.\n\nUnderstanding how genes are repressed in these compartments is critical not just for basic biology but also for understanding diseases where gene repression goes wrong. For example, improper regulation of gene clusters has been implicated in various developmental or psychiatric disorders and cancers.\n\nThe protein ZNF274: The boss of silenced genes\n\nA team of scientists at EPFL, led by Martina Begnis and Didier Trono, has now found that a protein called ZNF274 helps control certain groups of genes, including those needed for brain development, by locking them in specific parts of the cell where they stay quiet, ensuring that these genes only turn on when they're supposed to.\n\nHow does ZNF274 do this? By serving as a bridge between NAD components and these gene clusters, which it recognizes because they carry a critical sequence motif. ZNF274 anchors target genes, including those involved in neural development, to NADs, thereby maintaining their repression.\n\nFocusing on the consequences of ZNF274's absence\n\nThe researchers used a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and advanced sequencing techniques to create cells that lacked the ZNF274 protein, in which they could study the effects on gene expression and genome organization.\n\nThe absence of ZNF274 led to the activation of previously repressed gene clusters, e.g. those encoding protocadherins, which are critical for neural development. They also noticed changes in the structure of chromatin\u2014the complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes\u2014leading to altered 3D genome architecture.\n\nThe study found that ZNF274 helps keep certain groups of genes turned off by attaching them to the nucleolus. When ZNF274 is missing, these genes become active when they shouldn't.\n\nThe researchers also found that ZNF274 uses a specific part of it, called the SCAN domain, to contact the nucleolus. This connection keeps the genes in \"off\" mode, preventing them from being switched on accidentally.\n\nThe study has broad implications for our understanding of gene regulation, providing insights into the fundamental processes that ensure the correct expression of genes during development.\n\nIt also suggests that disruptions in this system could contribute to developmental disorders and diseases such as schizophrenia and Prader-Willi syndrome, where gene regulation is known to be affected.\n\nMore information: Martina Begnis et al, Clusters of lineage-specific genes are anchored by ZNF274 in repressive perinucleolar compartments, Science Advances (2024).

        "article_content": "When a team of Spanish and Japanese researchers chartered a plane up to 10,000 feet into Japanese airspace, their aim was to analyze the chemistry of airborne dust particles. But what they found in the air samples were microbes, many of which were still viable\u2014and several of them could infect and be harmful to humans. Their findings were published earlier this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\u201cWe were not supposed to find anything like this,\u201d Xavier Rod\u00f3, lead study author and a computational ecologist at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, tells Popular Science\u2019s Lauren Leffer. It\u2019s a \u201cdetection of an unprecedented diversity of microbial taxa at heights [far above the planetary boundary layer].\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the scientists found 266 kinds of fungi and 305 types of bacteria. Based on air currents and chemical analysis, they inferred that the microbes came from an agriculturally intensive region in China. This meant that the wind had carried them for at least 1,200 miles, unbeknownst to humans.\n\nWhile previous research suggests dust can travel thousands of miles and that microbes can piggyback on dust particles, scientists were surprised to find that microbes could survive such a high-altitude and long-distance journey.\n\nThe idea to collect air samples by flight came from previous research by Rod\u00f3 and others about Kawasaki disease, a rare heart condition with a mysterious origin that usually impacts young children, he tells the New York Times\u2019 Carl Zimmer. Rod\u00f3 noticed that the disease appears in surges in both Japan and California that often coincide with winds from northeast China. This suggested that something capable of causing infection might have traveled on the wind\u2014so the team boarded a plane to find out.\n\nAs they flew, they let air flow into a filter, which trapped the microbes for study, at altitudes between 0.6 and 1.9 miles high. Even at the upper end of that range, they indeed found live microbes, and some were proven to be viable when they multiplied in Petri dishes.\n\nRod\u00f3 tells the Guardian\u2019s Damian Carrington that the microbes were in \u201cultra-low concentrations\u201d that in most cases \u201cwouldn\u2019t elicit infection,\u201d in humans. Still, the findings have implications for human health. For example, some of the microbes carried drug-resistant genes, which is a troubling discovery given the context of a global rise of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that there is this biodiversity seeding across far distances,\u201d Rod\u00f3 tells Popular Science. \u201cOf course, if the bugs that are distributed have resistant genes, then you now have those being introduced into a new community, which could be worrisome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am surprised by the number of human pathogens that they revealed,\u201d David Schmale, an aerobiologist at Virginia Tech who did not participate in the research, tells the New York Times. He adds that the best way to study them would be to infect human cells or lab animals, which is something the team plans to do, using human lung cells.\n\nThe study hasn\u2019t solved the puzzle of what causes Kawasaki disease. But it does raise new research questions, including how the microbes stay alive while being carried so high on the wind and whether winds can spread diseases.\n\n\u201cThis is something that deserves attention,\u201d Rod\u00f3 says to the New York Times."

        "article_content": "(GOTHIC, Colo.) \u2014 We are Gunnison County and nestled in the shadow of the majestic Rocky Mountains, you\u2019ll find a vibrant center for scientific exploration. The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is recognized globally as a premier center for scientific research and education.\n\nThe abandoned mining town of Gothic, Colorado is now a hub of scientific research all thanks to the vision of former Western Colorado University Professor Dr. John C. Johnson.\n\nWhen Johnson first set foot in Gothic in 1919, he was captivated by the area\u2019s rich biodiversity. He recognized its potential as a living laboratory and brought students to study among the town\u2019s ruins. Fast forward to 1928 and RMBL was officially established.\n\nWith its well-equipped facilities, RMBL provides crucial support for scientists and students alike, offering living quarters, research labs, and protected research sites.\n\n\u201cLooking through campus we have over 60 cabins, only three of the structures are left over from 1880,\u201d Rick Reavis, Interpretive Guide at RMBL said.\n\nReavis just completed his eighth summer at RMBL. He\u2019s been exploring the many plant species found in the Rocky Mountains since the mid-1980s and you might learn a thing or two during his tour.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that has been written about aspen trees and one of them is if you rub your hands on the trunk of the tree, that exfoliating bark has an SPF of about five,\u201d Reavis explained. \u201cIt can be used for a sunscreen.\u201d\n\nAs scientists tackle increasingly complex questions about our dynamic world, RMBL provides an essential resource.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re known for our long-term research since we have been around so long,\u201d Dr. Jennie Reithel, Science Director at RMBL said. \u201cWe have Marmot studies that are 60 years old, plant research that\u2019s 50 years old, butterfly research that\u2019s at least that long as well. It\u2019s the duration of these studies that helps us see the impact of climate on our natural systems.\u201d\n\nThe researchers of today build on the findings of their predecessors by tracking environmental changes year-round with cutting-edge technology.\n\n\u201cRMBL recognized the opportunity to utilize sensors to look at the area in a different way,\u201d Erik Hulm, Director of Institutional Advancement at RMBL explained. \u201cWe started what\u2019s called the spatial data platform which utilizes drones. It\u2019s using fixed sensors to measure humidity, wind speed, and wind temperature to measure soil moisture.\u201d\n\nRMBLE\u2019s campus sits on 1,000 acres spanning across the Gunnison Valley with more than 4,000 research plots. It hopes the insights gained there will continue to guide policymakers as they navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing environment. Science conducted at RMBL has influenced environmental policy. Research on acid deposition was used during the revision of the National Clean Air Act. RMBL has affected policy on water, pollination, pollution, and human health.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real need for that, the translation between the basic science and what our policymakers need,\u201d Dr. Reithel said.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned researcher or a curious student, the staff at RMBL invites everyone to explore the wonders of nature, and if you plan a visit be sure to ask for Rick Reavis.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Examples of website builders include SquareSpace and Webflow.\n\nWorkflow automation tools\n\nDesigned to automate repetitive tasks and processes without needing to code, and suited specifically for complex processes, these are focused on workflow efficiency. Examples of workflow automation tools include monday.com and Pipefy.\n\nNo-code automation use cases\n\nPortfolio management\n\nGain a holistic view and understanding of your portfolio, from current financial statements and project priorities to overall performance.\n\nProject tracking\n\nTracking project timelines, invoices, and dependencies by automating redundant tasks makes your project management easier and more efficient. Use plug-ins to leverage all of your tools on one platform.\n\nResource allocation\n\nImprove your management and team efficiency by automating resource allocation and capacity planning. This is particularly useful when managing a project using the lean methodology.\n\nTask management\n\nNo-code automation allows for tracking at every level, from checklists all the way up to sprints and roadmaps, making information accessible to stakeholders all in one place.\n\nWork management\n\nEmpower scrum teams to define their work breakdown structures, create schedules, and track timesheets and task lists at various levels.\n\nBenefits of codeless automation\n\nAutomating any amount of manual work through automation shows countless benefits to businesses and employees alike.\n\nReduced spending\n\nBy using no-code automation, both the personnel and time required for the project are reduced considerably due to the uniquely visual experience and lack of coding required on the back end of the application.\n\nAccessibility\n\nBecause of the nature of no-code automation being for the citizen developer, no-code automation brings the design directly to the person who needs the tool. This reduces the amount of miscommunication that might occur when trying to explain the vision to a professional coder who might not understand the industry for which they\u2019re building the tool.\n\nIncreased efficiency\n\nBy automating mundane, monotonous, or redundant tasks, businesses are able to reduce the time their employees spend on those tasks, increasing work output and decreasing human error. This reduces wasted time on revisions and corrections, allowing employees to focus their attention on the items that require human interaction.\n\nBusiness agility and scalability\n\nNo-code automation allows companies to expand their offerings and business scale without traditional constraints. The automation of many tasks allows businesses to scale up and down as needed with the drag-and-drop capabilities. These changes are easily and quickly implemented in no-code platforms.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is the best codeless automation?\n\nThe best codeless automation depends on your specific needs. If you want to develop an app, you will likely choose different software than if your goal is to automate data tracking or build website surveys. It\u2019s important to speak with all project stakeholders in order to determine which platforms will best help you reach your audience or maintain your workflow.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of codeless automation?\n\nBecause the components are pre-built, the user can only do so much to make their creation truly specific or bespoke to fit their needs. However, while the creations that come from no-code platforms are technically limited, the existing databases for pre-built components are so vast that finding a tool to suit your needs well enough without coding is highly likely.\n\nCan project management be automated?\n\nYes, project management can be automated. While project management can\u2019t be completely automatic, it can be automated in several manually redundant areas to reduce the time project managers are spending on minor tasks. With no-code software, you can automate sending reminders, delegating tasks to level out workload, emailing updates on progress, and more."
