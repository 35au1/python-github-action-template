        "article_content": "It\u2019s been another insane week in the world of AI. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk was debuting his long-awaited Cybercab this week (along with a windowless Robovan that nobody asked for), Google\u2019s AI was helping researchers win Nobel Prizes, Zoom revealed its latest digital assistant, and Meta sent its Facebook and Instagram chatbots to the U.K.\n\nCheck out these stories and more from this week\u2019s top AI headlines.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nGoogle\u2019s AI helped researchers win two Nobel Prizes\n\nThe 2024 Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics were awarded to researchers with deep ties to Google on Wednesday. Former Google researcher Geoffrey Hinton won for physics for his work with foundational machine learning techniques that led to the current AI revolution, while DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis won for his efforts to decode protein structures.\n\nHowever, not all of their peers were satisfied with the awards, with one associate math professor arguing about Hinton\u2019s prize, \u201cWhat he did was phenomenal, but was it physics? I don\u2019t think so. Even if there\u2019s inspiration from physics, they\u2019re not developing a new theory in physics or solving a longstanding problem in physics.\u201d\n\nAdobe is giving creators a way to prove their art isn\u2019t AI slop\n\nIt\u2019s getting to where you can\u2019t even believe everything you read and see on the internet these days, what with 57% of it likely being AI-generated. To help protect artists (aka its customer base) Adobe is launching a beta of its Content Authenticity web app in the first quarter of next year that will enable content creators to certify that their art is human-made.\n\nThis is no simple metadata, mind you \u2014 Adobe\u2019s certification system uses a combination of digital fingerprinting, watermarking, and cryptographic metadata to prove the provenance of images, video, and audio files, and can\u2019t be easily stripped or circumvented.\n\nMeta\u2019s AI Chatbot goes to London\n\nAfter launching in the U.S. and Australia, Meta announced this week that it is bringing its AI chatbot to Facebook and Instagram users in the United Kingdom and Brazil, as well as on the company\u2019s smart glasses. The AI assistant can generate text and still images and, as the company recently revealed, will be trained on data generated by its bespectacled users.\n\nGoogle releases Imagen 3 (but only paying subscribers get to generate people)\n\nThe latest and greatest of Google\u2019s image generation engines, Imagen 3, dropped this week for all users. The new model offers improved photorealism and fewer artifacts (just look at that cat!). I gave it a quick try and it does what it says it does on the box, allowing me to quickly generate an image from a text prompt, then change and refine that output through subsequent iterations.\n\nHowever, there are limits on what you can produce. Currently free-tier users can only generate images of non-human entities. You want it to draw you a picture of a person, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to the $20 Gemini Advanced tier.\n\nZoom debuts its new customizable AI Companion\n\nZoom has drastically expanded its product line in recent years from a simple video conferencing app to an entire ecosystem of marketing and collaboration tools. This week the company revealed its next-generation AI Companion, a digital assistant that will work seamlessly across Zoom\u2019s various apps to help streamline and automate common business tasks, like transcribing meeting notes, setting agendas, and summarizing reports.\n\nUsers will even be able to customize the AI and fine-tune it on the company\u2019s specific knowledge database, though that feature will cost $12 per user per month. The updated AI Companion 2.0 itself will be rolling out at no additional charge to Zoom Workplace subscribers.\n\nAmazon debuts AI \u2018Shopping Guides\u2019 for more than 100 product types\n\nYou know that AI summary that Google started sticking at the top of its search results page, the one that everybody seems to despise? Great news, Amazon is doing basically the same thing for more than 100 types of products it carries.\n\nNow you\u2019ll be able to learn about the key points and important information about that dog food or camping tent you\u2019re considering buying, alongside product listings filtered for your specific search."

Those brave enough to join the tour will not only get to explore the museum floor but also get behind-the-scenes access to its attic \u2014 which is used as storage for many historical books, documents and items, and is reportedly the most haunted area.\n\nVarious paranormal phenomena in the building have been reported ranging from capturing phantom voices on audio recorders to encountering full-body apparitions.\n\nIn one instance, a former Lewis County Historical Museum employee had closed up for the day and was alone in the museum when a woman wearing Victorian-era clothing approached them and asked when the next train was arriving, employees at the museum have said.\n\nThe employee is said to have informed the woman the building hadn't been an actual train station for decades. After the brief exchange, the woman is said to have politely thanked the employee before walking off and vanishing.\n\nLewis County Historical Museum Executive Director Jason Mattson has had his own paranormal experiences, including opening one morning and discovering shaving cups switched in exhibits overnight when nobody was inside, and books on the floor appearing to have been pulled off shelves they wouldn't fall off by themselves.\n\nThe tours are recommended for those 13 and older only, and tickets are $20 per person and can be purchased online at https://tinyurl.com/2mhnsdfm. All proceeds benefit the Lewis County Historical Museum.\n\nThose taking the tours are invited to bring along their own flashlights and other paranormal investigative tools.\n\nThe Lewis County Historical Museum is located at 599 NW Front Way in downtown Chehalis. For more information, visit https://lewiscountymuseum.org/.\n\nFounded in 2006, the South Sound Paranormal Research Team is a nonprofit that offers investigations free of charge to residents in Washington and Oregon who believe they may be encountering hauntings or other paranormal activity.\n\nTo learn more and get in contact about organizing an investigation, visit https://www.sspri.org/.\n\n----To submit news tips or photos to The Chronicle's newsroom, email news@chronline.com.

Back at Gamescom we had the pleasure to talk to Rebekah Saltsman, Finji CEO, about this indie game coming in 2025 to PC and Mac.\n\nUsual June starts June, a young woman trying to enjoy her summer break... with the ability to see ghosts. Suddenly, the ghosts starty acting strange, so she will unravel a conspiracy mystery with her friends, even though they don't know about her special ability.\n\n\"She can see ghosts. And she has found a mystery in the town that she goes to college in. She has her friends and they're kind of like scooby-dooing around\", Saltsman told us.\n\nJune investigates urban legends with her friends and will end up in \"this other place, this other world, where she is discovering that she has these other abilities because of her ability to see ghosts.\"\n\nAction, adventure and puzzles with some ghostly abilities\n\nIt is in those areas, in a paranormal world, where she will gain other abilities, including combat and traversal movements that will clearly differentiate the two parts of the game: the more quiet, exploration bits in the real world and the action in the ghost world, where we get \"to beat up some monsters\" and solve some puzzles.\n\nThe tone of the game will be light and fun, however. \"We are not in sort of blood and gore territory here. The story does have some teeth. But the visuals, the gameplay, all of that is definitely a T rating.\"\n\nYou can watch our full interview with Finji's Rebekah Saltsman below, while waiting for Usual June's release next year."

But fear not; it's been extinct for more 300 million years.\n\nAnd while we've known about these colossal creatures for nearly two centuries, scientists had never found a fossil with its head intact \u2014 until now.\n\n\"We found the first complete head in a juvenile,\" Micka\u00ebl Lh\u00e9ritier, a paleontologist at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 in France, told As It Happens host Nil K\u04e7ksal.\n\n\"We were shocked \u2014 really shocked.\"\n\nNot only does the discovery paint a more complete picture of this ancient arthropod, from its head to its many, many toes, but it also changes what scientists thought they knew about its modern descendents: centipedes and millipedes.\n\nThe findings, by Lh\u00e9ritier and his colleagues, have been published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nHistoric discovery by an undergrad intern\n\nThe discoveries hail from two fossils found in a French coal field in the 1980s, preserved in a lump of the solidified mineral.\n\nOnce upon a time, scientists would have had to crack it open to find the treasures within, risking further fragmentation. But modern technology means scientists were able to peer inside the fossils using a CT scanner, similar to the kind you might see in a hospital, \"but much more powerful,\" Lh\u00e9ritier said.\n\nThe discovery was made with the help of undergraduate intern Adrien Buisson.\n\n\"He was very happy,\" Lh\u00e9ritier said. \"And me as well, of course.\"\n\nThe fossil of a juvenile Arthropleura from Montceau-les-Mines, France, inside its nodule. (Lheritier et al/Science Advances/Reuters)\n\nScientists have been studying Arthropleura fossils since the first one was discovered in 1854, but the fossils have been incomplete.\n\n\"We have been wanting to see what the head of this animal looked like for a really long time,\" said James Lamsdell, a paleobiologist at West Virginia University, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThat's because the fossils, found in Europe and North America, have been of shells left behind by Arthropleura after they moulted, squeezing their way out of their exoskeletons as they grew.\n\nAnd boy, did they ever grow. It's estimated Arthropleura could reach about 2.6 metres in length and weigh more than 50 kilograms.\n\nThat's because they roamed \u2014 or perhaps skittered \u2014 the Earth during the Carboniferous Period, when the planet's surging atmospheric oxygen levels caused some plants and animals grow to gigantic proportions.\n\n\"You also have dragonflies that could reach the size of an eagle, or scorpions that could reach the size of a small dog,\" Lh\u00e9ritier said.\n\nBut these newly described fossils are just four centimetres long, because they're babies.\n\nLh\u00e9ritier says if Arthropleura is anything like a modern millipede, the shape of its head likely didn't change much as it grew, likely to about 20 centimetres in width.\n\n\"What we have to find is the head of an adult because we still don't have one,\" Lh\u00e9ritier said. \"It will be interesting to compare the morphology of the adult head and the one of the juvenile.\"\n\nA reconstruction of an Arthropleura, shown from different angles. (Lheritier et al./Science Advances/Reuters)\n\nSo what did the heads look like? Roughly circular, with slender antennae, stalked eyes and mandibles, which are oral appendages that function as jaws.\n\n\"The head of Arthropleura combines features of millipede and centipede,\" Lh\u00e9ritier said. \"For example, the antennas are really millipede-like, while the mandibles ... are centipede-like. And so this is quite, I would say, striking.\"\n\nThe study's authors say this lends new credibility to a controversial theory that millipedes and centipedes are more closely related than previously believed, with Arthropleura as a shared ancestor.\n\n\"Millipedes and centipedes are actually each other's closest relative,\" co-author Greg Edgecombe, an expert in ancient invertebrates at the U.K. Natural History Museum, said in a press release.\n\nA recreation of an Arthropleura at a dinosaur park has the eyestalks, but not the mandibles. (Fabrio Conte/Shutterstock)\n\nBased on its mouthparts and a body built for slow locomotion, the researchers suspect Arthropleura was a detritivore like modern millipedes, feeding on decaying plants, rather than a predator like centipedes.\n\nLh\u00e9ritier says you can think of it like an elephant or a long-necked dinosaur: \"a big animal spending most of his time eating.\"\n\nThe protruding eyes, Lh\u00e9ritier says, are also a fascinating find, as they're usually associated with aquatic crustaceans like shrimps and crabs.\n\n\"Millipedes and centipedes didn't have these kind of eyes,\" he said. \"And so it is really peculiar.\"\n\nPredator or not, not everyone would be keen to spend their time thinking about giant creepy crawlies.\n\nBut Lh\u00e9ritier says he finds Arthropleura, and all arthropods, \"fascinating and really cool.\"\n\nAnd as far as he's concerned, the bigger the better.\n\n\"I think they are ... magnificent,\" he said, \"like elephants or whales.\"\n\nWith files from The Associated Press and Reuters.

        "article_content": "The fintech industry has significantly transformed over the past decade, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. The need for robust security measures for fintech companies has never been more critical. Fintech companies continue to innovate making data security a top priority.\n\nOver the years, fintech security has evolved to include various technologies and practices, including virtual data room solutions. Today, these technologies develop, offering new ways to protect financial transactions and sensitive data. This article will explore the future of data security in fintech from the data room perspective.\n\nUnderstanding fintech and the role of data security\n\nFintech, meaning financial technology, refers to technology integration into financial services to improve the delivery of financial products. Fintech companies needed advanced security measures to protect their customers\u2019 sensitive data. The transformation of fintech security has been forced by the need to stay ahead of cybercriminals while providing compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nData security in the fintech sector involves technologies, processes, and best practices for protecting sensitive financial data. It includes data security protocols, compliance with regulations, and ongoing security risk monitoring. The main goal of data security is to prevent unauthorised access and safeguard against data breaches and other cyber attacks.\n\nVirtual data room software for fintech data security\n\nA virtual data room (VDR) is a digital space where important documents and information are stored and shared. It lets authorised users access and work together on files for business activities. Maintaining security is paramount because of the nature of the data stored in VDRs. Data breaches can lead to a competitive edge, legal repercussions, and harm to reputation.\n\nSecurity measures are crucial for safeguarding data and upholding compliance standards within virtual data rooms. For enhanced protection, dataroom software employs security functionalities such as encryption, access controls, audit trails, and device restrictions. The important and sensitive data stored in VDRs needs security to stop cyber threats. Ensuring security in VDRs is crucial for keeping things private following the rules and avoiding problems.\n\n\u201cInvesting in a secure data storage place will reap the rewards in many ways,\u201d says Gilbert Waters, Co-founder and marketing specialist at data-rooms.org. The organization of VDR security starts with choosing among data room providers known for data protection. Ensure they hold security certifications such as ISO 27001 and undergo independent audits. Avoid providers that don\u2019t specify their security architecture or protocols.\n\nKey VDR security elements\n\nVirtual data rooms utilise a layered approach to security, with multiple critical elements working together to protect sensitive data. Some of the key elements include:\n\nData encryption . It is crucial for all data stored and sent via a data room to be encrypted using recognised methods, like AES 256-bit encryption . This process transforms data into a code that can only be decoded with the encryption key. Multi-factor authentication . It mandates users to present two or more credentials for access, such as a password paired with a one-time code or biometric verification. This strategy safeguards against password compromise and unauthorised entry. Advanced virtual data rooms support MFA techniques like SMS codes, authenticator apps, and biometric identifiers. Access controls . Granular user permissions allow tight control over document storage and access. Admins can restrict viewing, downloading, printing, watermarking, and other actions on a user and document group basis. Complex access regulations based on user attributes can be configured. Audit trails track all user activity.\n\nFintech data security trends\n\nTechnology integration transforms and reshapes data security management and how financial institutions operate. Here are the main trends that influence and shape data security:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) . They have changed financial services, helping in fraud detection, threat intelligence, and transaction analysis. Artificial intelligence technologies leverage algorithms to analyse data and identify patterns and potential security threats that might go unnoticed by traditional methods.\n\nBiometric technologies . It includes facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, which are increasingly used in fintech applications to enhance security. These technologies provide a higher level of protection compared to traditional methods. Biometric authentication enhances data privacy by ensuring access to financial accounts only to authorised users.\n\nBlockchain technology . Blockchain uses a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of nodes. Each transaction is secured cryptographically and linked to the previous one, forming a chain resistant to tampering. This immutability is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nCloud technology . Cloud computing enhances data privacy in several ways. It uses advanced encryption techniques to secure data at rest and in transit. Strict access controls allow companies to define who can access specific data and under what conditions, further bolstering privacy. Advanced threat detection and response mechanisms are integral to cloud services, helping identify security breaches.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the fintech landscape evolves, ensuring robust security measures is more crucial than ever. Fintech security is a critical element in the fintech industry, as the sector faces many challenges. By adopting innovative technologies financial institutions can protect sensitive customer data, mitigate risks, and build trust with their customers. Using data rooms, in particular, can provide a relevant tool for maintaining data security and compliance in the fintech sector. Leveraging virtual data rooms for sensitive data companies must partner with providers who actively invest in the latest security innovations and stay ahead of emerging risks."
