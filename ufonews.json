        "article_content": "Dandadan has finally arrived and in its first two episodes by studio Science SARU, the story of Okarun and Momo has proven itself as one of the biggest new anime arrivals of 2024. For the most part, the anime adaptation has stuck closely to its source material, as the original Shonen Jump manga by creator Yukinobu Tatsu has been a big part of the anime series. However, keen-eyed fans who experienced the manga and the television series noticed that a big change was made to episode one. Said change might come as a shock considering it is quite political.\n\nFor those who have yet to truly experience Dandadan, the series has become a hot ticket item for streaming services. It might come as no surprise that Crunchyroll took no time to bring Momo and Okarun\u2019s supernatural story to its platform but anime fans might be surprised that both Netflix and Hulu also were more than willing to open the door for Dandadan. On top of presenting a hilarious story that focuses on Momo and Okarun receiving powers from the extraterrestrial and the supernatural, Tatsu\u2019s story is fit to burst with energetic action scenes. Luckily, Science SARU \u201cgot the assignment\u201d and has managed to perfectly translate the world-shattering battles to the screen.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nBarack Obama Wasn\u2019t President in Dadadan\u2018s Anime\n\nIn Dandadan\u2019s first manga chapter, Yukinobu Tatsu had Okarun holding up his \u201cUFO\u201d magazine to highlight some of the biggest conspiracies that he was into. Not only does the manga feature former President Barack Obama, but it even names him in said magazine to make sure that readers know who he was. In the anime adaptation, Obama is replaced with a stand-in politician as Okarun tries to spread the \u201cgood word\u201d on UAPs to his new friend Momo. Ironically, replacing Obama is the only major change that was made to the bizarre fictional publication.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/aina7x/status/1842583692369416490\n\nPolitics In Anime\n\nAnime has not kept itself completely isolated from US politics in recent years, even if you don\u2019t count Dandadan. For example, the hard-hitting series Baki The Grappler would routinely see the United States needing to bargain with Baki\u2019s powerhouse father, Yujiro Hanma. Thanks to this fact, the series would feature \u201cThe Ogre\u201d having one-on-one conversations with the likes of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton. In the fighting manga, these politicians would receive different names than their real-world counterparts.\n\nOne of the biggest examples of anime crossing over into the world of American politics was thanks to Death Note. While the original story of Light Yagami ended years ago, the recently released sequel manga saw a new recipient of the cursed notebook. Following Light\u2019s death, new protagonist Minoru Tanaka strikes a bargain with the Shinigami Ryuk and simply wants the Death Note for financial gain. In looking to sell the notebook to countries, manga readers witness Donald Trump himself having a face-to-face with Ryuk and realizing that he might have gotten more than he bargained for.\n\nFor the most part, Dandadan has still stayed true to its source material outside of this political switch. Reportedly, the first season will house around twelve episodes, meaning that manga readers will have a good idea of the events taking place in the anime\u2019s opening salvo. Regardless, Science SARU has a hit on their hands and considering how many manga chapters have been produced, Dandadan might look forward to several anime seasons in the future.\n\nWant to see what the future holds for Momo and Okarun?

        "article_content": "The Settings app of any smartphone is a nightmare we all have to deal with on a regular basis. I say that as a longtime iPhone user who still dreads going to the Settings app even after the big redesign in iOS 18. The equally important Control Center redesign makes it easier to access some of the key settings you interact with more frequently.\n\nThe same applies to Android, of course. The Settings app has too many menus to remember, so I usually resort to using the built-in search feature.\n\nBut what if AI could help with that? Samsung is reportedly designing an AI feature that might stop you from visiting the Settings app that often. Instead, Galaxy AI might detect your needs and adjust the settings automatically. That\u2019s the kind of useful AI feature we could all use on our smartphones.\n\nAccording to ETNews, Samsung is developing AI software that would customize the phone experience without the user having to open the Settings app. That doesn\u2019t mean the phone will lack a Settings app. After all, not all Galaxy phone buyers want to use Galaxy AI features.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how this new Galaxy AI feature would work. The report says that Samsung plans to improve the \u201cperformance of \u2018touch points\u2019 such as keyboards and cameras to enable the ability to predict what consumers want in advance.\u201d\n\nAs Android Authority points out, Samsung already lets you control some Settings with the Bixby assistant. But the new Galaxy AI feature above would be more sophisticated than that. Adjusting settings on the fly with minimal user interaction would be incredible.\n\nAs someone dying to see AI evolve on smartphones and computers to the point where I can reliably control the devices, apps, and app features via voice or text prompts, I\u2019d love it if the AI could adjust my settings in real time on its own. The AI would simply learn what I like and then adjust the settings without me having to do anything.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself here. It\u2019s unclear how this Settings-related feature would work on future Galaxy AI phones, and there\u2019s no release timeline estimate for it either. What\u2019s certain is that Samsung will want to demo new Galaxy AI abilities when the Galaxy S25 series launches in early January. AI will continue to be a big marketing point for all phones, including Samsung handsets."

Paranormal Percussion is a local Halloween show that features only drums and percussion.\n\n\"I realized people in Utah really love Halloween and people love drumming so we kind of put the two together,\" said the show's founder, Matt Nickle.\n\nParanormal Percussion is put on by Warehouse 5 Drum Theatre. Nickles says the show is the perfect combination of spooky and family-friendly \"Each year I come up with new arrangements of things,\" Nickle said. \"I like playing the Ghostbusters theme, the Thriller theme, the funnest thing is playing on instruments that are a little unconventional like a coffin or a car.\"\n\n\"It's really just about a bunch of us drummers who have been drumming our whole life just getting out here and beating some drums and having a good time together,\" said Paranormal Percussions performer, Derek Julio.\n\nSince the show started in 2019 people have traveled from all across the state to see their favorite Halloween songs come to life on the stage. Nickles and Julio say the audience feedback so far has been spooktacular.\n\n\"It just feels wonderful when we know they have had a really good time, a really good experience,\" Julio said. \"It's meant to be spooky, it's meant to be a little fun, I think it's really funny, a lot of aspects of it,\" Julio said.\n\nWarehouse 5 Drum Theatre hopes to continue making audiences smile and putting drummers in the spotlight by eventually putting on other seasonal shows.\n\n\"It's really fulfilling for me, the first year was really scary because I had these arrangements, but I didn't know if they would make sense live but once we put the show together it was really nice,\" Nickles said.\n\nFor show times, locations, and tickets you can click here."

Film buffs may remember it as the site where the \"Holy Grail\" \u2014 the cup that Jesus is said to have used during the Last Supper \u2014 was found in the 1989 movie \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\"\n\nWhile excavating the tomb, archaeologists recently unearthed the remains of pottery that was buried with the individuals. They found that one of the skeletons was holding a ceramic vessel resembling a chalice, according to a statement from the University of St Andrews in Scotland.\n\nSediments and materials from the burials date to sometime between the mid-first century B.C. and the early second century A.D., according to an analysis by Tim Kinnaird , a research officer at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews.\n\nIt's not clear who these 12 people were, and research into the tomb and its remains are ongoing.\n\nRelated: 31 ancient temples from around the world, from G\u00f6bekli Tepe to the Parthenon\n\nArchaeologists unearth a ceramic chalice in a tomb beneath the Treasury in Petra.

Caravan routes traveled through their kingdom and Petra became a major city with breathtaking architecture. The Romans took control of their kingdom during the second century A.D. and Petra declined afterward, according to the American Museum of Natural History .\n\nWhen the remains of a tomb were detected, an excavation plan was drawn up by Jordan's Department of Antiquities and the American Center of Oriental Research. Discovery Channel also supported the excavation and produced a documentary about it, which recently aired in the TV series \" Excavation Unknown .\"\n\nLaurent Tholbecq , a professor at the Archaeology and Heritage Research Center at the Free University of Brussels who was not involved with the research, told Live Science that \"two similar tombs were excavated beside this one by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan about twenty years ago.\"\n\nThe newly discovered tomb, which must be older than the Treasury, will help provide a date of the Treasury itself, which has long been a matter of debate, he said.\n\nThe \"dating of the Khazneh, which has long been disputed but is now placed in the first quarter of the 1st century AD, should be confirmed by the date of the artefacts found in this tomb,\" Tholbecq told Live Science in an email.\n\nLucy Wadeson , an archeologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved with the research, praised the finding. \"This discovery will hopefully shed light on the little known burial practices of the Nabataeans since so few unlooted tombs have been excavated,\" she told Live Science in an email. \"With the human remains and grave goods found in their original context, we can finally reconstruct the funeral rituals associated with these magnificent tombs.\"\n\nMegan Perry , an anthropology professor at East Carolina University who has done extensive archaeological work in Petra but was not involved with this excavation, said that the discovery of this tomb is not a surprise and is a bit overhyped. A \"tomb immediately adjacent to this one was excavated in 2003, so the finding of another tomb is not particularly unexpected,\" Perry told Live Science in an email. Perry also noted that \"other tombs excavated [in] Petra, including the ones that I have researched, have found far more than 12 individuals.\"\n\nPerry said that \"surprisingly little of Petra has actually been excavated, so any new data is good data, provided the project is conducted with best practices in mind,\" and noted that it may provide more information on Al-Khazneh.\n\nLive Science reached out to the archaeologists who excavated the tomb but did not hear back by the time of publication."

        "article_content": "Elias Torres has achieved a lot for somebody who immigrated to the US from Nicaragua at 17 without knowing any English. He served as a VP of engineering at HubSpot before co-founding Drift, a company that sold to Vista Equity for about $1.2 billion in 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare to get this far, but I\u2019m not done,\u201d Torres told TechCrunch.\n\nAbout a year ago, Torres (pictured above) founded Agency, an AI-powered startup designed to automate tasks traditionally handled by customer success managers (CSMs). These professionals provide personalized support to users of complex B2B software, ranging from onboarding and training to upselling new features.\n\nOn Wednesday, Agency is coming out of stealth and announcing that it raised a $12 million seed round led by Sequoia and HubSpot Ventures.\n\nThe idea for Agency was born when Torres started consulting for OpenAI in early 2023. The ChatGPT maker asked Torres for help developing AI solutions for some of their enterprise customers, including NBA and LiveNation. In the course of doing that, it occurred to Torres that companies could benefit from AI customer success managers.\n\nHe was encouraged to build a startup around this concept when he met with Brian Halligan, co-founder and executive chairman of HubSpot. \u201cWe worked together on the CRM at HubSpot, and he told me, \u2018Let\u2019s build something great together again,\u2019\u201d Torres said about his conversation with Halligan. (Halligan joined Agency\u2019s board.)\n\nShortly after meeting with Halligan, Torres reached out to Sequoia partner Patrick Grady, who had previously invested in Drift. Grady was instantly sold on the idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hire great CSMs. It\u2019s hard to scale great CSMs,\u201d Grady told TechCrunch. \u201cIf you have a product that can do a lot of the work on their behalf, and you can scale your company without having to hire an army of CSMs. That\u2019s pretty useful.\u201d\n\nAgency can free up time in the customer success manager\u2019s workday by handling tasks such as scheduling, follow-ups, note-taking, customer onboarding, and meeting preparation.\n\nTorres explained that Agency\u2019s AI gains a deep understanding of each customer from emails, CRM data, chat messages, and phone conversations, which allows it to anticipate customer needs at any point.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we\u2019ve been dreaming about for a long time,\u201d he said, adding that this was the goal of Salesforce, the CRM he helped build at HubSpot and Drift, which was building personalized conversations for salespeople. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the technology to do this until now.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s product is currently being tested with companies, including HeyGen, and is available in an invite-only beta for customer success professionals.\n\nWhile Agency currently faces little direct competition, another function within the sales and marketing organization, sales development representative, is facing disruption from dozens of AI-powered solutions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody else going after this market,\u201d Sequoia\u2019s Grady said. \u201cHopefully people won\u2019t discover that for a while, and they\u2019ll have a little bit of room to run.\u201d"

The report offers a detailed examination of industry trends and developments shaping the growth of the Loan Servicing Software market. It also provides a comprehensive analysis and forecast of the market future performance.\n\nGlobal Loan Servicing Software Market is valued at approximately USD 3.83 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 12.01% over the forecast period 2024-2032.\n\nRead the Market Summary Here @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw10064\n\nLoan servicing software is a specialized system used by financial institutions to manage and administer loans post-origination. This software handles various tasks, including payment processing, interest calculation, escrow account management, delinquency tracking, and customer communication. The adoption of such software helps lenders maintain accurate loan records, ensure timely payments, and provide efficient customer service, thereby streamlining operations in the financial sector.\n\nThe market\u2019s growth is driven by the increasing demand for streamlined lending operations, escalating adoption of cloud-based solutions, and rising costs associated with credit servicing. Financial institutions are increasingly integrating advanced technologies and software to offer optimized portfolios and enhanced solutions to customers. Cloud-based payment platforms enable quicker payment collection and offer financial institutions the ability to provide fast and efficient services. Additionally, the global trend of adopting new technologies like blockchain, RPA, and AI in the banking sector is shaping the market, as these innovations reduce processing and servicing times.\n\nHowever, the market faces challenges such as competition from open-source loan servicing software. Smaller organizations, such as non-banking financial companies and small lenders, often opt for open-source solutions due to their lower IT budgets, which can impede the growth of paid software solutions.\n\nRequest To Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bw10064\n\nDespite this challenge, the growing focus on streamlining business operations in the financial sector is expected to foster the continued development and adoption of advanced loan servicing software.\n\nKey regions considered in the global loan servicing software market study include North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Rest of the World. North America is anticipated to dominate the market growth during the forecast period, driven by the presence of major financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America, which process large loan volumes. These institutions utilize loan servicing software to manage their operations efficiently, enabling them to track banking services, access servicing information, and manage borrower payments. Whereas, the market in Asia Pacific is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate over the forecast period fueled by rapid growth of the lending industry, increasing loan volumes, and the need for efficient loan management. Additionally, the rising adoption of digital technologies and the growing emphasis on regulatory compliance are fueling the demand for advanced loan servicing software solutions in the region.\n\nMajor market players included in this report are:\n\n\n\nAbrigo\n\n\n\nApplied Business Software Inc\n\n\n\nOracle Corp.\n\n\n\nC Loans Inc.\n\n\n\nConstellation Software Inc.\n\n\n\nCyrus Technoedge Solutions Pvt.
