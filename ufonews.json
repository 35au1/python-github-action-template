            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch ads or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Lawyer Pierre Dewitte, a privacy advocate whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

They are building narratives that resonate deeply, relying on real-time engagement, multimedia storytelling, and data-driven personalization. In this transformation, generative AI is emerging as a powerful ally with their audiences and here\u2019s how.A recent report fascinated me, where NASSCOM and BCG projected India\u2019s AI services market to reach $17 billion by 2027. Another study I read by Microsoft India showed that 92% of knowledge workers in India are already using generative AI at work, compared to the global average of 75%. This means the adoption rate of AI is faster than expected, and it\u2019s across industries. Even IBM aptly captures this moment by describing it as marketing\u2019s \u2018sink or swim\u2019 scenario. With 76% of marketers already integrating generative AI tools into their strategies, there is a palpable urgency to adopt these technologies to avoid falling behind. This adoption, combined with India\u2019s unique cultural diversity, presents both opportunities and challenges for brands that want to leverage AI in their marketing strategies.The government\u2019s IndiaAI Mission, with an investment of $1.25 billion, is playing an important role in fostering AI infrastructure, startups, and public sector AI applications. These initiatives have the potential to position India at the forefront of AI-driven solutions, from healthcare to governance.In my opinion, AI isn\u2019t just about efficiency. It\u2019s reshaping how brands communicate, particularly in a diverse market like India. It has the capacity to generate personalized and dynamic content at an unprecedented scale, something that was unimaginable until recently. By leveraging advanced algorithms, AI is helping brands tailor their narratives to specific audiences, ensuring messages are more relevant and impactful.Generative AI offers an unprecedented opportunity for brands to connect with India's diverse audience. For example, smartphone brands can utilize AI to generate personalized product recommendations and localized marketing campaigns in different languages. With over 700 million smartphone users in the country, mobile devices have become the primary medium through which consumers interact with brands. By using AI, brands can create hyper-targeted campaigns that resonate with audiences from different states\u2014whether it\u2019s a high-end smartphone in Delhi or a budget device in rural Maharashtra.Generative AI\u2019s multilingual capabilities enable brands to craft messages in Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, or other common dialects. This helps create a more personal connection with consumers, something particularly important in a country as linguistically diverse as India. In fact, India\u2019s multilingual environment makes it an ideal testing ground for large language models (LLMs) that can scale globally.Even in the Indian online gaming industry , generative AI offers vast potential. Companies can now create hyper-personalized experiences based on player data. For instance, AI can help design region-specific in-game communications or craft custom experiences that resonate with players in specific states. Given that India\u2019s online gaming sector is on the rise, this level of personalization can significantly improve player engagement and loyalty.Generative AI also plays a crucial role in promoting responsible gaming. By monitoring gameplay behaviour, AI can help detect signs of any misuse or financial distress, prompting the platform to intervene in real-time. This ensures players are safeguarded from harm while also ensuring the sustainability of the industry as a whole.AI is being deployed across sectors, from healthcare to agriculture, helping businesses tackle large-scale challenges. Companies like Reliance and TCS are investing in AI-driven solutions to gain a competitive edge. Additionally, India\u2019s unique Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has become a foundation for rapid AI development. This blend of technology and governance can turn India into a hub for AI-driven innovation, making the country an attractive destination for global AI players like Nvidia, which is investing heavily in India\u2019s AI supercomputing infrastructure.While the promise of AI is immense, it is not without its challenges. India\u2019s cultural and linguistic diversity, while offering opportunities, can also lead to potential missteps. A campaign that resonates in Tamil Nadu might fall flat in Punjab. Ensuring that AI models are trained on culturally relevant and inclusive datasets is essential for brands that want to avoid alienating any audience.There are also concerns around data privacy. With India\u2019s evolving regulatory landscape, brands must prioritize compliance to avoid potential backlash. I noticed plenty of incidents recently where news around brands like Samsung, Amazon, JP Morgan, and major U.S. banks restricted the usage of apps like ChatGPT, fearing data leaks, underscoring the risks. Like it or not, generative AI continues to become more prevalent, and companies must implement stringent data protection measures to ensure consumer trust, especially in a market as vast and complex as India.Sooner than expected, everything we see and experience will change as generative AI is here to stay, and its role in shaping brand narratives will only grow. The key to success lies in finding the right balance between the efficiency of AI and the emotional intelligence of human oversight. AI can produce content at scale, but it\u2019s up to brands to ensure the final message is culturally relevant and emotionally resonant. So, no more jumping and grabbing all the trending hashtags\u2014use AI to generate content, but don\u2019t push it blindly. As Spider-Man once said, \u201cWith great power comes greater responsibility.\u201d Let\u2019s be serious about AI, as we need to know as much as we can about its usage, benefits, and concerns before we proceed.I genuinely believe that generative AI is a unique opportunity for brands in India to leverage its capabilities as it continues to evolve. There\u2019s no way out, so we better embrace this new digital mantra in our professional lives\u2014but not without studying this phenomenon to the T. The debate of whether AI is replacing human creativity, curiosity, and spontaneity won\u2019t happen if we use it wisely to enhance what we do with the right intent. Therefore, the future of brand communication lies in the synergy between AI-driven innovation and the nuanced understanding of India\u2019s diverse audience, and that\u2019s fine by me.(The author is the chief communications officer, Baazi Games.)"

Nothing is targeting a general release of Nothing OS 3.0 stable for this month, and ahead of the release, we finally have a good look at the new Nothing Gallery app that is expected to arrive along with it.\n\nNothing smartphones so far have relied on Google Photos for photo management, which isn\u2019t a bad choice at all. However, users have long requested a dedicated stock gallery app, which Nothing teased was coming with Nothing OS 3.0. However, as we noted in our Nothing OS 3.0 beta hands-on, the update was missing the Nothing Gallery app. The company shared just a glimpse of the Gallery experience, but the app has now leaked before the public launch. We\u2019ve installed it on our device, and this is what it looks like:\n\nAs you can see, the Nothing Gallery app takes a more simplistic approach to a photo management app. You can choose which folders to show in the Photos view. The Photos view is a giant universal feed of all images on your device, so a filtering option is much appreciated here. You can pinch in and out to change the density of photos on display.\n\nWhen viewing a photo, the image preview bar at the bottom allows you to scroll through other images, which is a nice touch for quickly locating adjacent photos. A persistent toolbar is also present at the bottom, letting you mark an image as Favorite, share it, delete it, and access more menu options with the three-dot menu button. The menu button has further options, which helps avoid cluttering the toolbar with buttons used less often.\n\nWhen viewing videos, the persistent toolbar also gets a play/pause button and a volume control button. There is no visible seekbar, though, but the time played and total duration of the video are visible.\n\nThe Albums view further lets you filter down to a specific folder only. You can also create new folders/albums here. It also has a folder for recently deleted files, allowing you to make mistakes, just in case you accidentally delete something you shouldn\u2019t have. There\u2019s also a Search view that lets you search through all images.\n\nIf the entire UX looks too bright and white to you, then thankfully, there\u2019s a dark theme here, too. However, we could not locate an independent toggle for it, so the theme appears to be entirely dependent on your system theme. We also noticed that the Nothing Gallery app supports XDR/Ultra HDR photos.\n\nYou can get a better look at the app in our experience video below:\n\nCuriously, we could not locate any AI features within the Gallery app. Nothing had mentioned the following in its announcement: Gallery will include in the future: automatic AI image categorisation, \u201cmore natural language search,\u201d and more AI features like AI Upscaling and Super Resolution and AI Image Generation. Given that the Nothing Gallery app is currently in beta, it\u2019s possible that Nothing meant that these features will be present in the future. The company may also make further changes and adjustments to the UX and features since this is not the final release. You can sideload the APK on non-Nothing devices, but the app will not work unless you make further changes, and we do not recommend going down that route.\n\nHow do you like the Nothing Gallery app so far?

If you own a PC with an NPU (or Neural Engine, in Apple\u2019s parlance), which applications can you use now to see what an AI PC is capable of?\n\nWhat follows are eight AI PC applications that are available to use now on Mac computers with M-series chips or Windows PCs with processors that include an NPU. These range from an AI assistant that can analyze and summarize private documents to applications for live video production, DJing, image editing and audio deepfake detection."

Almost two decades on, the family's wild journey shows no signs of slowing down, but what are the renowned quartet up to these days?\n\nIn 2002, The Osbournes made its debut, providing an uncensored glimpse into the lives of rock icon Ozzy Osbourne, his straight-talking wife Sharon, and their two youngest offspring, Jack and Kelly.\n\nThe series was an immediate success, mixing tumultuous family episodes with the eccentric allure of its stars. Although the series concluded in 2005, the Osbourne clan has remained a fixture in pop culture, securing their status as one of the most recognisable families in showbiz.\n\nREAD MORE: Patrick Stewart shares heartbreaking domestic abuse story he 'never told anyone'\n\nNow, 19 years post-show, the Osbournes continue to adapt and maintain their presence in the limelight. From Ozzy's ongoing health struggles and Sharon's audacious media career to Kelly's transformation and Jack's interest in the supernatural, the family's narrative demonstrates they're far from retiring.\n\nHere's a look at what each member has been doing since the cameras ceased rolling.\n\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nFollowing the reality show's finale, Ozzy reunited with Black Sabbath for a victorious stint, which included the release of the album '13' in 2013 and 'The End' farewell tour in 2017, marking a historic end for the band, reports the Express.\n\nDuring this time, he also enjoyed success alongside his son Jack on their travel documentary series, 'Ozzy and Jack's World Detour', giving fans a personal and whimsical insight into their father-son bond.\n\n2016 proved to be a year of personal upheaval for Ozzy Osbourne when he was embroiled in reports of an affair with his hairstylist, leading to a temporary split from Sharon, his wife of over 33 years. The couple eventually patched things up after Ozzy sought treatment for sex addiction and reaffirmed their commitment with a vow renewal on Mother's Day 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Ozzy went public with his Parkinson's diagnosis following a severe fall that aggravated his existing injuries from a 2003 ATV accident. Even amid numerous back operations and ongoing health issues, Ozzy managed to release two acclaimed solo albums.\n\nFast forward to early 2024, Ozzy offered fans a glimmer of hope with an update that described his recovery as \"slow but steady\", crediting his improved wellbeing to his commitment to sobriety. However, his loyal followers were left disappointed when he had to pull out from the much-awaited Power Trip festival in October due to persistent health battles.\n\nOzzy is now back living in England with Sharon, his wife.\n\nSharon Osbourne\n\nSharon Osbourne remains a force to be reckoned with in show business. Building her profile after 'The Osbournes' wrapped up in 2005, Sharon found success on 'The X Factor UK' and 'America's Got Talent', and turned her hand to talk shows, including a spot on 'The Talk', where she resonated with American viewers until her abrupt departure in 2021.\n\nShe exited amidst a storm of controversy triggered by her on-air support for Piers Morgan after his remarks about Meghan Markle, which led to accusations of racism and homophobia directed at her.\n\nThe couple made a permanent move from LA to England, where Sharon briefly hosted The Talk UK on TalkTV before stepping back in 2024 to concentrate on Ozzy's health. Sharon has also battled her own health issues, surviving colorectal cancer in 2002 and undergoing a double mastectomy in 2012 after discovering a genetic risk of breast cancer.\n\nKelly Osbourne\n\nKelly Osbourne, once known as the rebellious teenager from MTV, is now a devoted mum to her first child, Sidney, born in late 2022. The father of the baby boy is none other than Slipknot DJ Sid Wilson, marking a match made in metal heaven.\n\nThe pair made their relationship public at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Kelly has been open about her journey to sobriety, celebrating five years clean in 2024. She's fully embraced motherhood, sharing snippets of her life with Sidney on social media while juggling appearances in fashion and television.\n\nIn 2002, Kelly released her own album, Shut Up, and showcased her singing talent again on The Masked Singer in 2019. She's a woman of many talents, having also written her book, There's No F**king Secret: Letters From a Badass B***h, which was published in 2017.\n\nKelly has also been candid about her struggles with both sobriety and weight, opening up about relapsing and fat shaming in late 2021. \"This past year has been the hardest year of my life,\" she wrote on Instagram at the time. \"I was completely and utterly broken. I am still putting myself back together again.\"\n\nJack Osbourne\n\nJack Osbourne has made headlines since his days as the mischievous youngster on The Osbournes, evolving into a family-oriented TV figure. As a father to four, Jack recently tied the knot with Aree Gearhart in a confidential ceremony in September 2023 and welcomed their baby girl Maple in July 2022.\n\nHis three other daughters, Pearl Clementine, Andy Rose, and Minnie Theodora, are from his previous marriage to Lisa Stelly. Finalising their divorce in 2019, after six years, they've agreed on shared custody.\n\nDiagnosed with multiple sclerosis at just 26, Jack has turned into an outspoken MS campaigner, all the while shaping a unique career path within paranormal television. He's entertained audiences co-hosting shows such as Portals to Hell and Ozzy and Jack's World Detour, combining his thirst for thrills and the unexplained.\n\nOn social media, Jack gives fans a peek into his home life behind the cameras. Taking on personal challenges, Jack has maintained his sobriety since he was 17 and commemorated 16 years clean in 2019. He has openly discussed his battles, saying: \"I chose to kind of commit myself to living life sober. ... People need to be more open about, 'Hey, there is a solution to this problem.'\"."

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.\n\nFeatured Video For You 10 mind-blowing discoveries from the James Webb Telescope"

            "article_content": "Lake Enigma is located in Antartica's Victoria Land\n\nBizarre microbes found in a lake in Antarctica have provided key insights into how life on other planets may have developed. A study published by the Italian National Research Council published in Communications Earth & Environment, a peer-reviewed journal, suggests, in contrast to what was previous believed, Lake Enigma, located in Antarctica\u2019s Victoria Land, does in fact contain liquid water. The study was led by scientists from the Institute of Polar Sciences of the Italian National Research Council (CNR-ISP). The team includes prominent researchers like Dr Maurizio Azzaro and Dr Angelina Lo Giudice, who specialise in microbial ecology and polar environments. Scientists used advanced ground-penetrating radar and drilled through the ice during an Italian Antarctic expedition in 2019-2020 to confirm the existence of liquid water.\n\nEuropa: Professor discusses 'potential life' on Jupiter's moon\n\nThe lake's isolation from external elements, including extreme cold and lack of sunlight, has created a unique, closed microbial environment. The study also uncovered \"ultrasmall\" bacteria from the superphylum Patescibacteria, which are known for their minimal cellular activity but play critical roles in the lake's ecosystem. Their discovery of microscopic lifeforms has exciting implications for both Earth sciences and astrobiology. This isolated environment, locked under ice for around 20,000 years, contains liquid water and hosts extremophiles - microorganisms capable of surviving extreme cold, low nutrients and high pressure.\n\nTrending\n\nThe launch of the Europa Clipper mission in October\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their discovery underscores the resilience of life and broadens the understanding of where it might exist. It highlights water as a key solvent for life, not only on Earth but potentially on other icy worlds like Europa and Enceladus. The chemical and energy processes in Lake Enigma provide a parallel for studying similar extraterrestrial environments where liquid water is present beneath icy crusts. The Galilean moon of Europa for example is thought to have a sizeable lake beneath its frozen surface.\n\nEuropa is believed to have a subsurface ocean"

This year, the solstice happens at 4:21 a.m. EST on Dec. 21, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the solstice itself is brief, it signals the official start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The event also brings the longest night and shortest day of the year. From this point on, the days will gradually begin to lengthen again.\n\nCold weather safety: How to prepare for winter 2024 \u2014 from freezing pipes to driving in snow and ice\n\nDoes winter solstice change?\n\nThe exact timing of the solstice can vary slightly from year to year.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t fall on the same date each time, though it typically occurs between Dec. 20-23. This variation is due to how the calendar aligns with Earth's orbit around the sun.\n\nIn 2024, the solstice falls on Dec. 21, marking the official beginning of winter and ushering in the season\u2019s characteristic cold fronts and holiday traditions.\n\nWhen does winter end?\n\nWinter will end on March 20, 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Winter solstice 2024 is coming.

Speed is important, but to be the best, antivirus software must also vigorously safeguard your computer from cybersecurity threats.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nI reviewed Eset Premium to find out if it offers robust malware protection, an easy-to-use interface, and responsive customer service. I also checked out the subscription options to find out if there\u2019s enough value for the money.\n\nSpecs\n\nEset Premium Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 1+ (Essential, Premium), 5+(Ultimate) Support Chat, Email, Phone Free version? No\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nEset offers flexible pricing with options to add more devices and extend the subscription term to enjoy a lower price.\n\nThe $50-per-year Essential plan is the least expensive, providing real-time malware protection, a network firewall, and PC cleanup tools. A $60 Premium subscription includes a password manager, ransomware protection, and file encryption. Both tiers cover one device, and more can be added for $5 each.\n\nThe top tier is the $130 Ultimate plan, starting with protection for five devices plus $5 for each additional computer or phone. It includes an unlimited VPN, image metadata removal, and dark web monitoring.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bargain, we have a guide to the best deals on antivirus software. High-quality security doesn\u2019t have to be expensive.\n\nYou can try Eset Essential or Premium free for 30 days, but Ultimate requires a paid subscription. Eset offers some basic malware scanner and removal tools, but there are better free antivirus apps.\n\nDesign\n\nI began Eset setup on the website welcome page, which showed my active subscription. I selected the Protect device to start the download to my Windows PC.\n\nThe installer offered some customization options. I enabled Eset LiveGrid and customer experience, which uses anonymous data from my computer to help strengthen protection and improve usability for all Eset customers. I left the unwanted application detection off, since I prefer to manage that myself.\n\nA quick tour briefly highlighted a few features, while an initial scan run to identify any malware on my computer. Despite my choice to skip unwanted app detection, a popup window suggested that I might want to \u201cclean\u201d an app I\u2019d intentionally downloaded. I chose to ignore the warning.\n\nEset\u2019s Premium app gives an overview of my security status. A green checkmark indicates real-time protection is active. The left sidebar has tabs for malware scans, software updates, tools, settings, account details, and support.\n\nPremium comes with a password manager, ransomware protection, data encryption, network inspection, and browser protection. The app has a confusing number of options. I left the default settings for most.\n\nBy the time setup was complete, the computer scan finished and alerted me to several more apps that I recognized and wanted to keep.\n\nFeatures\n\nAccording to independent security lab AV-Comparatives, Eset Premium performed well in 2024 but failed to offer good security in previous years. Out of a possible three stars, Eset earned a single star in real-time malware protection tests conducted from July to October 2023.\n\nI usually refer to AV-Test when checking the track record of antivirus software. While the 2024 results show excellent malware prevention, there are big gaps in evaluations from December 2021 to February 2024.\n\nFor the best protection, an antivirus solution like Norton 360 boasts a near-perfect protection record that spans several years.\n\nI spot-checked browser protection by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. Eset Premium successfully identified and blocked all 13 threats, in each case opening a new tab to alert me to the danger. For perspective, it\u2019s worth noting the free antivirus Microsoft Defender blocks Wicar threats also.\n\nI also tested the password manager, which asked me to create a master password, different from my Eset login, to unlock the vault. It\u2019s quite basic, automatically filling logins on websites where I have an account. The best password managers are much more advanced with login sharing, folders to organize accounts, and secure storage for files and photos.\n\nSupport\n\nEset Premium\u2019s help tab offers 24/7 technical support via an AI. In my tests, it was very responsive and could help with simple questions. However, the chatbot was easily stumped, reporting it doesn\u2019t have the requested information and supplying tangential links that didn\u2019t help.\n\nIf you expect quick responses from a real support agent, I found Bitdefender\u2019s customer service to be among the best. It\u2019s also a low-cost antivirus with a great track record.\n\nThe AI was able to provide the live chat hours, 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT. I tried again during normal hours, and the chatbot said no agents were available. However, it provided a link to a contact page that had a button for live chat.\n\nIf you use Eset, don\u2019t trust the AI to connect you to a human. Go to Eset\u2019s contact page. A live agent came on quickly and was able to answer my questions. Overall, support is good, despite the AI glitch.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEset\u2019s privacy policy says your data is only used to provide the services you pay for. It\u2019s only shared with third-party companies that assist with customer support, billing, and other services related to your subscription.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s internal security seems robust, BleepingComputer reported Eset\u2019s exclusive partner Comsecure was breached. Hackers were able to target Eset customers in a brief (10 minutes) but malicious phishing campaign.\n\nIs Eset right for you?\n\nEset is fast and offers good protection in 2024, but it has a checkered track record. While leading antivirus software blocks threats year after year with few lapses, independent security labs found Eset allowed some malware in several tests between 2021 to 2023.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for protection without impacting performance, there are some better options that make the cut for the best antivirus software for gaming PCs."
