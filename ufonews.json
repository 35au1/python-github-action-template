            "article_content": "The small Mexican mountain town of La Rumorosa is at its most beautiful when the dying sun bathes it in a clean, soft, orange light. Or pink, depending on the day. Whatever color, the landscape seems more innocent. As if nothing disturbing could happen there.\n\nAt that innocent hour, looking for Jaime Maussan Flota Avenue, I come across two ladies out for a walk. They can\u2019t tell me exactly where this avenue is, but they tell me that at night the sky there is clear and star-lit. And that they have seen strange things that could be flying saucers. They say it as if it were the most natural thing in the world because, since the year 2022, La Rumorosa has been the \u201cWorld Capital of the UFO Phenomenon.\u201d This is announced on a sign as you enter this Martian landscape, comprised of desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones, which lie in the Sierra de Juarez, within the state of Baja California, northern Mexico. Until the 1930s, La Rumorosa was hard to get to. The road that now winds its way along the area, dotted with viewpoints offering postcard-worthy vistas for the nostalgic or Instagram-worthy spots for the modern, had not yet been built.\n\nUntil 2022, tourists came to La Rumorosa for the nature, the cave paintings in El Vallecito and the archaeological remains. A striking landmark is the Casa de Piedra or Stone House. It stands near that long winding road that crosses the mountain, and blends with the landscape. It is said to have been inhabited by mobsters, such as Al Capone, and to have been a refuge for revolutionaries.\n\nThere are also several ranches with swimming pools and camping areas free from light pollution, offering a unique chance to enjoy the brilliance of the night sky. Rancho Las Potrancas has a bar, palapas and a barbecue area. And Rancho El Chaparral resembles a water park, with slides and cabins.\n\nBut, since 2022 the Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) area has also been promoted, because many sightings are said to have been made there. There is even an annual international festival \u2014 the World UFO Fest (the next one is from March 21 to 23, 2025) \u2014 for UFO aficionados, which includes talks and seminars with \u201cbioenergetic practices to facilitate contact with the beings of light\u201d or \u201ctesting and vibrational balancing,\u201d according to the website.\n\nPerhaps with an eye on generating more tourist dollars, several streets have been named in this town of less than 2,000 inhabitants in honor of important figures in the field of ufology. One of them was the avenue Jaime Maussan, a journalist and researcher in this field. He went viral in 2023 when he went to Mexico\u2019s Congress to present mummified bodies of what he defined as non-human beings found in Peru. Streets have also been dedicated to Peruvian Sixto Paz Wells and to researcher and television presenter Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.\n\nThe landscape of La Rumorosa resembles Mars with its desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones in the Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez. Daniel Caja (Getty Images)\n\nStill searching for Jaime Maussan Avenue, I enter Dulce Altura, a restaurant and bakery that has those high ceilings in the shape of a sharp isosceles triangle, typical of cold, mountainous regions. Inside, the decoration is modern, with a sculpture of a UFO and three metal aliens. Besides selling delicious bread and sweets, wood-fired pizzas and other dishes, they sell alien-themed magnets, which \u201csell well,\u201d according to the cashiers.\n\nThey tell me how to get to Jaime Maussan Avenue. It is a few hundred meters down the main road that splits the town in two. The avenue is a half-paved street, with patches of dirt and a few simple houses scattered at a distance from one another. The street lacks a sense of care perhaps because the focus is on the sky and on the strange lights captured on video by numerous people over the years.\n\nBut UFO tourism is not only limited to this corner of the world. Perhaps the most famous location for it is Area 51, in America\u2019s Nevada desert, or Roswell in New Mexico, or the Nazca plain in Peru and the town of Capilla del Monte in Argentina \u2014 to mention a few. What is undeniable is that this type of tourism gets people from all over the planet to visit the most unlikely places.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Nearly 60 years after a fiery fall of fragments from the sky, the mystery is no closer to being solved\n\nIt was 8:15 in the evening of 25 March 1968 when everyone in the village of Batulechaur near Pokhara heard a deafening sound like thunder as a bright flashing object hurtled down to land in a field.\n\nThat field belonged to Kul Timilsina, and the next morning he retrieved a sheet of metal about 2m by 1m and carried it home with the help of a few others, thinking it would be useful for his buffalo shed.\n\nBefore he died at age 83 three years ago, Timilsina had told photo archivist Sunil Ulak that the black metal sheet was not rectangular and had rounded corners. There are a few witnesses still alive who have a clear recollection of the object that fell from the sky that night.\n\nThe field in Batulechaur belonging to Kul Timilsina where fragments of a flying object fell from the sky in 1968.\n\nOne of them is Timilsina\u2019s wife Gyanu, who was 22 at the time. She had been at home, and remembers hearing the big bang and the sky becoming very bright.\n\n\u201cWe saw the thing in the field in the morning,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt looked like a lid, a covering of some sort. The way it was stuck in the ground, it must have fallen from the sky. We thought we could use it to dry clothes on, and took it home.\u201d\n\nAnother witness is Kul Narayan Paudel. \u201cI was only eight then. We ran to the field to see what had fallen. It was a four-sided metal sheet. The elders took it away, and I don't know what happened to it.\u201d\n\nRam Bahadur Baniya, a teacher at the local school, says he had heard the sheet had been brought to the school, and later handed over to the Zonal Commissioner at the time, Nanda Prasad Malla. \u201cBut that is all hearsay,\u201d he says.\n\nGyanu Timilsina, wife of Kul Timilsina.\n\nThere are two versions of what happened to Kul Timilsina\u2019s metal sheet. One is that an American Peace Corp Volunteer teaching at the nearby Bindyabasini School took it, and another is that it was handed over to the government.\n\nRecently declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and US State Department documents from the time say that the US Embassy in Kathmandu tracked down the object two years later and had it shipped back to the US.\n\nA telegram from the Department of State and Department of Defense tagged as \u2018MOON DUST / Space Fragments\u2019 dated 1 March 1972 stated:\n\n\u20181. Restored space fragment will be on board Embassy support flight 115 arriving Kathmandu on or about March 10. Fragment is packed in shipping crate (cargo no. 72-33365) marked in care of DAO.\n\n2. State and Defense representatives examined fragments prior to shipment finding restoration acceptable.\u2019\n\nDeclassified CIA documents about the investigation into the object sighted in Pokhara.\n\nThe documents show that the US government, military and intelligence agencies investigated this incident thoroughly when it occurred, and have continued to revisit it ever since, as recently as five years ago.\n\nWhat is even more intriguing is that the object that fell in Pokhara was not the only unidentified space object that fell to earth that year. There were similar sightings of objects falling from the sky in Ladakh, Sikkim and Bhutan between 19 February and 25 March 1968.\n\nThese mysteries were the subject of a CIA investigation in 1968 titled \u2018Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects in Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan\u2019, and the report is part of the recent online declassification of 800,000 top-secret documents from the period.\n\nAlthough unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have a connotation now of being alien craft, it could be pieces of satellite, missile, rocket or even aircraft. The CIA report documents six sightings in 1968 and quotes local sources as describing all of them having similar characteristics: bright blue or red streaks in the sky accompanied by loud sounds like lightning and thunder and objects falling to the ground.\n\nAside from the metallic object that was found in Batlechaur, there were other items also found nearby in Tallakot, Tureypasal, Armalakot and Maidan. Whatever the object was, it seems to have disintegrated even before it hit the ground.\n\nThe CIA report records the first sighting on 19 February 1968 in various parts of Sikkim and Olangchung Gola and Ghunsa in eastern Nepal. The light was said to be \u2018long and thin\u2019 and giving out \u2018green and red light\u2019.\n\nTwo days later on 21 February, a soundless blue object was seen traveling fast across the sky above Thimphu in Bhutan. Then on 4 March there were multiple daytime sightings or white streaks in the sky at Chang La Pass, Fukche and Koyul in Ladakh. There were more sightings in Ladakh on the very day fragments fell near Pokhara on 25 March 1968.\n\nAfter the sightings in Pokhara, rumours started flying in Kathmandu that these were aliens trying to land on Earth, it could be Russian or Chinese spy planes or satellites, and some even say it as a sign from heaven that the end of the world was near.\n\nThis was at the height of the Cold War. The Russians and Americans were testing their thermonuclear devices as well as intercontinental ballistic missile delivery systems. The Washington-Beijing rapprochement had not yet happened, and China was making quick progress testing atomic bombs. Within two years after its first atomic test, in 1966 China exploded its first hydrogen bomb at the Lop Nur site in Xinjiang, 3,000km to the north from Nepal.\n\nAfter neary six decades, what is still intriguing is that all the sightings within a few months of each other in 1968 were along the Himalayan arc bordering Tibet: from Bhutan, Sikkim Nepal, to Ladakh. The US military intelligence seems to have concluded that this was not a coincidence and there were frequent research trips to the site in Pokhara by American officials in the months after the incident. With the help of the Royal Nepal Army, the region north of Pokhara was thoroughly searched.\n\nA confidential memo dated 25 June 1968 by Jerry C Trippy to a \u2018Mr Farley\u2019 mentions that the US Air Force\u2019s Foreign Technology Division had decided that the debris could be important because it may be related to a Chinese missile test or a Soviet \u2018Vehicle Venik\u2019 rocket.\n\nOn 28 August 1968 the US Embassy in Kathmandu sent a letter to Washington DC saying that the object could be of Soviet origin, possibly from when the rocket carrying the \u2018Kosmos 208\u2019 satellite re-entered the atmosphere. But why were the fragments falling to earth several weeks apart, and in the same region?\n\nNo one knows where the metal sheet that Kul Timilsina recovered is now. It was definitely packed in a crate and taken to the US, and although it is rumoured that it was returned that is not very likely. Archivist Sunil Ulak heard from the Timilsina family that CIA officials had returned to the site five years ago.\n\nInterest in UFOs peaked in the US in the 1950s, with the Cold War space race and tests of atomic weapons and delivery rockets. CIA and scientists were being sent to investigate sightings, both publicly and privately.\n\nCould the Pokhara fragments as well as the sightings in Ladakh and Bhutan actually be alien craft falling to earth? The renewal in interest in space travel in large part due to Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, UFOs and sightings are again subjects of public interest.\n\nEven 57 years later, even if there was definitive proof about whether the Batlechaur fragment was from a Chinese missile or a soviet rocket, it has not been made public in documents declassified so far. We may never know.\n\nSunil Ulak speculates if the debris actually came from an American aircraft, perhaps on an intel mission upon China. \u201cWhich could explain why they were so thorough in collecting the fragments in Pokhara,\u201d he says. But that still does not explain the multiple sightings weeks apart in 1968.\n\nIndeed, US military aircraft were at that time flying frequent night-time missions from air force bases in India to supply weapons to Khampa guerrilla camps in Nepal located north of Pokhara in Mustang. It could very well be that the Chinese shot down one such aircraft. The other sightings could have been contrails of US spy planes, or Chinese anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nThere were quite a few developments regarding UFOs in 2024. In a US congressional hearing in July, former intelligence officer David Grusch claimed that the government had long been involved in a program to investigate and retrieve non-human craft crashes, and then try to reverse engineer them. However Grusch did not show any evidence.\n\nThe UAP Disclosure Act of 2024 was signed into law by Joe Biden in December 2023. It plans to oversee the public disclosure of UFO information. However, there is a clause in it that prevents disclosure if it would cause threats to military defense, intelligence operations or foreign relations.\n\nIt is unlikely that the declassified documents about sightings in the Himalayan will cause any real surprise about definite evidence of alien life even if it was found. It seems humanity will continue, at least for now, to wonder about curious lights in the sky and whether there is anybody out there."

            "article_content": "There\u2019s plenty to consider when it comes to deciding whether you want to engage with the many generative AI bots now available inside our apps. These include the ethics of copyright use, soaring energy demands, and the diminishing of human creativity, to begin with.\n\nSomething else to bear in mind when engaging with these tools is they\u2019re often going to use your flesh-and-blood human inputs to further train their underlying models. While some AI companies make efforts to anonymize this data, it\u2019s something you may not feel comfortable with. The good news is, in most cases, you can find a setting to turn the training off.\n\nDisabling AI training isn\u2019t quite the same as wiping your AI chatbot history, though they are linked. Your chats can still be used for training purposes before they\u2019re wiped, and you may well want to keep your chat history in place \u2014 but at the same time stop AI companies from using your data for model refinement.\n\nHere are instructions on how to turn off AI training on several AI or AI-supporting apps.\n\nChatGPT\n\nOn ChatGPT, you can refuse to \u201cimprove the model for everyone.\u201d Screenshot: ChatGPT\n\nOn the web\n\nClick your profile picture (top right), then choose Settings > Data control and turn it off using the Improve the model for everyone toggle switch.\n\nUsing the mobile app\n\nTap the menu button (top left), then the three dots next to your account name to find the Data controls screen and the Improve the model for everyone toggle switch.\n\nCopilot\n\nCopilot lets you opt out of both text and voice training. Screenshot: Microsoft\n\nOn the web\n\nClick your account picture (top right), then click your name and Privacy. You get two toggle switches you can turn off: Model training on text and Model training on voice.\n\nUsing the mobile app\n\nThese toggle switches are in an almost identical place in the Copilot mobile app. Tap your account picture (top right), then Account and Privacy.\n\nGemini\n\nTo disable Gemini AI training, you need to turn off your chat history. Screenshot: Google\n\nWith Gemini, you must turn off chat history to stop your chats from being used to train the AI \u2014 there\u2019s no option to set these separately, as there is with ChatGPT and Copilot.\n\nOn the web, click Activity (bottom left); in the mobile app, click your account picture (top right), then Gemini Apps Activity. In either case, on the next screen, look for Gemini Apps Activity next to a toggle or button that will turn it on or off.\n\nAccording to the screen, your chat will be kept for 72 hours, whether or not you have turned app activity off. When activity logging is turned off, when you start a new chat, you will get a message saying the current one will be deleted.\n\nPerplexity\n\nOn the web\n\nClick the gear icon by your username (bottom right), then turn off the AI Data Retention toggle switch (under Account) to stop your data from being used for training.\n\nUsing the mobile app\n\nTap your account picture (top left) to find the AI Data Usage toggle switch \u2014 it\u2019s a slightly different label, but the function is the same.\n\nGrok on X\n\nA checkbox opts you out of Grok training. Screenshot: X\n\nOn the web\n\nChoose More > Settings and privacy > Privacy and safety > Grok & Third-party Collaborators and uncheck the box.\n\nUsing the mobile app\n\nTap your account avatar (top left), then you\u2019ve got access to the same Settings and privacy menu.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nOn LinkedIn, you need to find the toggle named \u201cData for generative AI improvement.\u201d Screenshot: LinkedIn\n\nOn the web\n\nClick your profile picture at the top of the page, then Settings & Privacy > Data privacy to find the Data for generative AI improvement toggle switch.\n\nUsing the mobile app\n\nTo find the switch in the mobile app, tap your profile picture (top left), then Settings > Data privacy > Data for generative AI improvement.\n\nMeta AI\n\nIf you\u2019re not in Europe or the UK, your options for avoiding having your Facebook data used for training are minimal. Screenshot: Meta\n\nOf all the apps and services listed so far, Meta is the most obtuse when it comes to letting users know how their data is used for AI training and giving users options for turning it off. You can read the data policy here: private messages are off limits (unless you invite the AI into the chat), but everything else is apparently fair game, including images of you posted by other people.\n\nIn Europe and the UK, you can object to this collection of data by submitting this well-hidden form, which is labeled as a \u201cright to object\u201d form. In the US, however, all you have is an alternative form \u201cto submit requests related to your personal information from third parties being used to develop and improve AI at Meta.\u201d First, check off \u201cI have a concern about my personal information from third parties that\u2019s related to a response I received from an AI at Meta model, feature or experience.\u201d Then, on the form that appears, you need to explicitly explain (and provide screenshots) how your personal data was used.\n\nCan\u2019t do that? Then there\u2019s not much else you can do. If your Facebook or Instagram account is running Meta AI, you can mute the chatbot by going into search, clicking on the blue arrow, and then on the blue circle (the one with an \u201ci\u201d). Select Mute and, on the list of options, choose Until I change it.\n\nFinally, several sites suggest that you can use mbasic.facebook.com, a very basic version of the app, assuming you want to go that far.\n\nOther apps\n\nFor other AI-using apps that you use, it\u2019s worth digging into the settings and privacy policies to see exactly how your data is being processed.\n\nPolicies can differ widely. Earlier this year, Adobe updated its privacy policy to confirm that it wouldn\u2019t train its AI on user images. On the other hand, Reddit has signed a deal with OpenAI to train AI on user posts \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, except not use Reddit."

            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch ads or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Lawyer Pierre Dewitte, a privacy advocate whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

Credit - Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP\u2014Getty Images\n\nFor much of 2024, one of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s staunchest allies in Silicon Valley was David Sacks, an entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and co-host of the popular podcast All-In. On his podcast and social media, Sacks argued that Trump\u2019s pro-industry stances would unleash innovation and spur growth in the tech industry. In June, Sacks hosted a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco that included $300,000-a-person tickets.\n\nNow, Sacks has been rewarded with a position inside the White House: the brand-new role of \"AI & crypto czar.\" It\u2019s unclear how much power this role actually has. It appears that this will be a part-time role, and that Sacks will remain with his VC fund Craft. This murkiness, and the fact that Sacks will not have to go through the Senate confirmation process, is drawing concerns over conflict of interest and lack of oversight. Regardless, Sacks will start the Administration with Trump\u2019s ear on key policy decisions in these two rapidly growing sectors. Leaders inside both industries largely cheered the decision.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA whole-of-government approach that collaborates closely with private industry is essential to winning the AI race, and a designated AI leader in the Administration can help do that,\u201d Tony Samp, the head of AI policy at the law firm DLA Piper, tells TIME.\n\nSacks and Trump\n\nSacks has long been close to the center of Silicon Valley\u2019s power structure. A member of the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d he was that company\u2019s chief operating officer for several years, and grew close with Elon Musk, who has also been tasked with a new role in Trump\u2019s Administration. While many Silicon Valley leaders espoused pro-Democrat views especially during the Obama years, Sacks became increasingly vocal in his conservative stances, especially around the Russia-Ukraine war and fighting censorship on tech platforms. His podcast All-In is currently the third most popular tech podcast on Apple Podcasts, according to Chartable.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6 insurrection, Sacks said that Trump had \u201cdisqualified himself from being a candidate at the national level again.\u201d But he threw his weight behind Trump this year, including during a speech at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July, in which he warned Republicans of a \u201cworld on fire.\u201d At one lavish fundraiser, Sacks lobbied for Trump to pick J.D.

On an All-In episode in April, he said he hoped Silicon Valley companies would become more involved with U.S. defense efforts. \u201cI do want the United States, as an American, to be the most powerful country. I do want us to get the best value for our defense dollars. The only way that\u2019s going to change is if the defense industry gets disrupted by a bunch of startups doing innovative things,\u201d he said. (Just this week, OpenAI announced a partnership with the defense contractor Anduril.)\n\nSacks has also come out strongly against AI models displaying any sort of censorship.

The users can now access it any time they want albeit with some limits.Grok AI chatbot, developed by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI was launched last year as a \u2018humorous AI assistant\u2019.The news comes nearly a month after media reports claimed that Musk-owned X was testing Grok AI\u2019s free version in some regions.During its launch in 2023, Grok AI was available to only premium users of X. This made it one of the only AI chatbots that hid behind a paywall, unlike its peers including OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude.Users previously had to purchase a premium subscription of X to access Grok AI. While xAI has not released an official statement yet, users across the microblogging platform have claimed that they could access Grok for free.However, the free version of the Grok AI chatbot comes with a few restrictions. According to the chatbot\u2019s guidelines, free users can ask up to 10 questions every two hours. The use of the chatbot is also limited to three image analyses and four image generations per day.Premium users of X, who pay $7 and $14 per month for different plans, still enjoy better access. They can ask up to 50 questions a day.Users can only access Grok if they have an X account that is older than 7 days and is linked to a verified phone number.Several X users were excited as soon as Grok AI access was made free and confirmed the access to the chatbot.\u201cGrok is now free (with usage limits) for all X users. Tried it just now. Loved the attitude, panache, and some sass instead of merely saas... Awaiting the full-scale deployment of Grok-3 multimodal. Only,\u201d a user said, posting his conversation with the AI.Another user posted, \u201cGrok is now FREE in most regions! You can ask up to 10 questions per 2 hours unless you subscribe to X Premium! Is the free GROK available in your region?\u201dMaking Grok AI free has opened up competition between the chatbot and its peers like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.While both of them are conversational AIs, ChatGPT 4, the latest version, allows users to ask 10 questions every five hours. In comparison, free Grok users can ask 10 questions to the chatbot every two hours.While the conversation style of ChatGPT is mostly formal, Grok AI is more leaned towards an informal conversation style as pointed out by users.Many users have also claimed that Grok answers questions that ChatGPT doesn\u2019t. Moreover, ChatGPT has mostly pre-trained data, while Grok can access real-time data."

            "article_content": "The controversy surrounding the Conjuring House owner's claim of being contacted by a spirit from the 1800s and the allegations that followed.\n\nFor years, even before the age of cinema, ghost stories have been a staple form of entertainment for millions of people worldwide. The world of the supernatural has thus found a special place in the entertainment industry as well, where horror stories are consumed, loved, and adored by fans across the world. Among the many such stories, The Conjuring Universe is especially famous for its spine-chilling back story.\n\nA still from The Conjuring | Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nBased on the real-life story of the Perron family and the subsequent investigation carried out by famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren on their infamous haunted farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971, The Conjuring is a tale that sends shivers down our spines. Even more haunting is that the centuries-old haunted house located in Burrillville, Rhode Island continues to experience repeated supernatural activity and can even be booked by supernatural enthusiasts to experience these activities.\n\nHowever, the current owner of the \u2018Conjuring\u2018 house has been facing backlash and criticism after her recent claims of being contacted by one of the original owners of the house and her subsequent firing of an employee, even losing her business entertainment license in the process.\n\nOwner of the Conjuring House Contact by the OG Owner of the Infamous Estate\n\nThe Conjuring House aka the Arnold estate | Credit: The Conjuring House.com\n\nLocated in Burrillville, the colonial-era Old Arnold Estate spread across 8.5 acres in Rhode Island has always been a center of paranormal activity (via The Conjuring House.com). Made famous by the 2013 movie, The Conjuring, its relationship with otherworldly activities goes as far as the 1700s and is supposed to be haunted by several spirits and entities. Hence, when the farmhouse was up for purchase in 2022, the Boston attorney Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez purchased it without a second thought.\n\nHaving a long-standing relationship with the spiritual and supernatural world, Nu\u00f1ez has since transformed it into a business for horror enthusiasts to come and visit or stay at the house. The business was thriving until recently when she claimed to have been contacted by the spirit of John Arnold, one of the original owners of the estate from back in the 1800s. According to what she told WPRI, Arnold told her that one of her employees was stealing from her.\n\nI did get a message from John Arnold from the 1800s. I also have records of merchandise and stuff, and know that he stole.\n\nSince then, her story has gained attention from fans all over the world. While some fans believe her story, others remain skeptical and have criticized her decision to fire an employee. In the middle of all this controversy, she also lost her business entertainment license after the Burrillville town officials voted to not have it renewed citing concerns over her conduct and the disruption caused by the 24-hour business in a residential area.\n\nConjuring House Owner Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez Has Been Accused of Several Problematic Conducts\n\nThe owner of the Conjuring house, Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez | Credit: WPRI / FaceBook\n\nThe Conjuring House remains at the top of bucket lists for a lot of fans, and visiting the house at least once is a die-hard wish of several horror enthusiasts. However, soon that might change given how Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez has lost her license to continue her business of letting people visit the huge haunted estate. And a lot of it is to blame for her alleged problematic behavior, which allegedly has gotten worse since she purchased the house.\n\nAs reported by WPRI, she was arrested for drunk driving in October and also accused of threatening one of her past employees Jason Hawes as well as his family. Hawes, the star of the hit Ghostbuster series, revealed to the site that Nu\u00f1ez has sent her threatening messages even after the court lauded her with a no-contact order. Meanwhile, Nu\u00f1ez stated that she is now looking to file lawsuits against him, formal employees, and even Burrillville for how \u201cthey have just blatantly violated\u201d her constitutional protections.\n\nMeanwhile, the town manager of Burrillville, Micahel Wood revealed to the news site that the Conjuring House owner runs a 24-hour business in a residential area which is quite \u201cdisruptive to neighbors, and it draws curious people at all hours of the day and night.\u201d Furthermore, he stated that Nu\u00f1ez has been \u201cdifficult, uncooperative, and aggressive throughout the licensing process,\u201d which makes it hard for their cooperative relationship to resume. On the other hand, Nu\u00f1ez believes the town isn\u2019t letting her run her business since they have no care for the paranormal.\n\nThe Conjuring House Employee Believes in the Paranormal But Thinks Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s Claims Are Far-Fetched\n\nThe Conjuring | Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nWhile Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez wholeheartedly believes and claims that the spirit of John Arnold contacted her and informed her that one of her employees was stealing from her, her employee believes that Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s claims are a bit far-fetched. Brian Dansereau had been working at the Burrillville farmhouse for quite a while now, however, Nu\u00f1ez fired him last month claiming he had stolen about $3000 from her.\n\nDansereau has consistently denied the theft and even though he believes in the paranormal he thinks there is no way that the spirit of one of the former owners of the house from back in the 1800s would have contacted Nu\u00f1ez and told her something like this. While talking to WPRI, he stated,\n\nShe said, \u2018John Arnold told me you\u2019ve been stealing money out of the cash box for the past two months.\u2019 I literally stopped and I had to correct her like, \u2018John Arnold, one of the original owners?\u2019\n\nThe Conjuring House | Credit: The Conjuring House.com\n\nHe also shared his own paranormal experiences, such as hearing his voice in the basement or witnessing doors opening on their own. Yet, he cannot fathom a spirit snitching on an employee. On the other hand, Nu\u00f1ez claimed that she had been informed of other unexpected conduct from the past staff and guests and does not care if someone believes her or not.\n\nIt does not matter whether you believe in the paranormal or not. I and every person is entitled to experiences that bring understanding and meaning to our lives, including being informed or warned about wicked actors and actions. As far as Brian goes my experience with him devolved quickly, culminating in his at-will employment termination.\n\nNu\u00f1ez is thus planning to file a complaint with state officials, also because her former employee has been allegedly trying to damage her reputation by slandering her. What should have been a grand experience for fans of Conjuring and horror enthusiasts has taken a turn for the worst. There is a possibility that the tours and fan visits at the Conjuring house may not be possible in the future for Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez has no plans to sell the house even if she does not get her business license back.\n\nThe Conjuring is available to be streamed on Netflix."

            "article_content": "Lake Enigma is located in Antartica's Victoria Land\n\nBizarre microbes found in a lake in Antarctica have provided key insights into how life on other planets may have developed. A study published by the Italian National Research Council published in Communications Earth & Environment, a peer-reviewed journal, suggests, in contrast to what was previous believed, Lake Enigma, located in Antarctica\u2019s Victoria Land, does in fact contain liquid water. The study was led by scientists from the Institute of Polar Sciences of the Italian National Research Council (CNR-ISP). The team includes prominent researchers like Dr Maurizio Azzaro and Dr Angelina Lo Giudice, who specialise in microbial ecology and polar environments. Scientists used advanced ground-penetrating radar and drilled through the ice during an Italian Antarctic expedition in 2019-2020 to confirm the existence of liquid water.\n\nEuropa: Professor discusses 'potential life' on Jupiter's moon\n\nThe lake's isolation from external elements, including extreme cold and lack of sunlight, has created a unique, closed microbial environment. The study also uncovered \"ultrasmall\" bacteria from the superphylum Patescibacteria, which are known for their minimal cellular activity but play critical roles in the lake's ecosystem. Their discovery of microscopic lifeforms has exciting implications for both Earth sciences and astrobiology. This isolated environment, locked under ice for around 20,000 years, contains liquid water and hosts extremophiles - microorganisms capable of surviving extreme cold, low nutrients and high pressure.\n\nTrending\n\nThe launch of the Europa Clipper mission in October\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their discovery underscores the resilience of life and broadens the understanding of where it might exist. It highlights water as a key solvent for life, not only on Earth but potentially on other icy worlds like Europa and Enceladus. The chemical and energy processes in Lake Enigma provide a parallel for studying similar extraterrestrial environments where liquid water is present beneath icy crusts. The Galilean moon of Europa for example is thought to have a sizeable lake beneath its frozen surface.\n\nEuropa is believed to have a subsurface ocean"

            "article_content": "Kevin Weil showed no sign of the heat when he took to the stage at the Marriott Marquis in downtown San Francisco on an unseasonably sweaty early October morning.\n\nTrim and tan, outfitted in the de rigueur Silicon Valley uniform of a slim-fit gray tee, stonewashed blue jeans, and an Apple Watch Ultra, the chief product officer of OpenAI talked easily about the ambitious artificial intelligence-powered future his red-hot employer was building.\n\n\"You could imagine a world where you ask it a hard question about how you cure some particular form of cancer, and you let it think for five hours, five days, five months,\" Weil prophesied in response to a question about the \"reasoning capabilities\" of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither he nor his onstage interlocutor, Anyscale cofounder Robert Nishihara, ever acknowledged the elephant in the room: Weil wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nThe event, the AI infrastructure conference Ray Summit, had originally booked OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, to speak. Just days before, the high-profile executive had abruptly quit, prompting the last-minute swap. Murati's exit added to a long list of recent departures from OpenAI, one of the world's most valuable and hyped startups, even as it closed a historic $6.6 billion funding round on the day Weil spoke.\n\nIf Sam Altman is the starry-eyed visionary of OpenAI, Weil is its executor. He leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services it can sell, putting him at the center of a philosophical rift that has caused spectacular upheaval at the company, which was recently valued at $157 billion.\n\nIn two years, OpenAI went from a nonprofit lab nominally working to develop digital intelligence for the public good to a world-famous startup that puts out shiny new products and models every few months. The company is now attempting to become a for-profit operation to lure would-be backers to write bigger checks, which it needs to scale its business. Altman recently announced that the company's flagship product, ChatGPT, now has 300 million weekly users, triple the number it had a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with this astronomical growth, OpenAI has succumbed to a brain drain: Its chief research officer, head of AGI readiness, co-lead of its video-generation model Sora, and the list goes on. While this has sparked alarm bells in some corners of the tech industry, it has also elevated the profile of the senior leaders who have remained. That includes Weil, a relative OpenAI newcomer who joined in June and rapidly became one of its most notable ambassadors.\n\nAt a point when employee voices of dissent were growing louder, 41-year-old Weil arrived as a steady-handed product guru with a Midas touch. He was a longtime Twitter insider who created products that made the social media company money during a revolving door of chief executives.\n\nAt Instagram, he helped kneecap Snapchat's growth with competitive product releases such as Stories and live video. (Not everything he touched turned to gold, though. Weil also led Facebook's headlong charge into financial services as a cofounder of Libra, its ill-fated stablecoin.)\n\nWeil declined to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with five former senior colleagues, four of whom spoke on the record, and his past public interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter and Facebook were no strangers to chaos and scandal, but even their most challenging times are rivaled by OpenAI's workplace turmoil. There was a failed coup last year, bitter feuds among some workers, and an ongoing existential arms race to build \"digital gods.\"\n\nWeil's peers are certain he's the man to promote harmony. He's spent the better part of 15 years cranking out products that mostly delighted users and made money. He also has something his new employer desperately needs: The ability to pursue the company's best interests and balance human emotions at the same time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKevin Weil isn't a household name. But for those in the know in Silicon Valley, he's something better: \"He's the get-shit-done guy,\" said James Everingham, who worked with Weil at Instagram and Facebook.\n\nSarah Friar, OpenAI's new head of finance, has long admired Weil's product chops. Former Twitter boss Adam Bain called Weil \"Twitter's secret weapon\" for driving ad revenue. Everingham also described Weil as a workhorse who never shrank from a deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He brings that stamina, that dogged focus on the outcome,\" said April Underwood, a venture capitalist who worked closely with Weil on Twitter's ad products.\n\nWeil's relentless work ethic and people skills are recurring themes among former colleagues. At Facebook, two colleagues said he would often badge into the office first and fire off messages late into the night.\n\nOne colleague from Planet, a satellite imagery company where Weil worked as president until May of 2024, recalled how he started each week by posting in Slack the top three things on his mind. According to Everingham, Weil's a rare breed of product manager who codes almost as well as he writes memos. That endeared Weil to the engineers he needed to build products.\n\nWeil shrugs off the pressures of work with long runs and Diet Mountain Dew. Every birthday, he runs his age in miles and, in June, marked his 41st year with a 41-mile jaunt near his home in the posh California suburb of Portola Valley, according to a public Instagram post. Weil lives with his venture capitalist wife, Elizabeth, and three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a little bit superhuman in just the sheer amount that he works and works out,\" said Ashley Johnson, chief financial officer and now president of Planet.\n\nFormer colleagues say Kevin Weil was key to turning Twitter into a crucial arena for advertisers. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWeil set aside a Stanford doctorate in theoretical particle physics to cave out a path in tech, according to a 2017 speech he gave at his alma mater. In 2009, Weil landed at Twitter as a data scientist. At the time, Twitter had little revenue, never mind profit, to show for its many millions of users. That left investors wondering how Twitter would translate its popularity into money.\n\nWhen Twitter began developing ads a year later, Weil stepped up to lead it. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who overlapped with Weil at Twitter, said employees debated how to show ads in a way that didn't degrade the user experience, pitting engineers against marketers. Weil threaded the needle. Under his oversight, Twitter launched ads that looked like tweets inside the feed. AdAge reported in 2011 that hundreds of brands had embraced the format, helping to establish the cash flow that made Twitter's IPO possible in 2013.\n\nThen, in early 2016, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom asked Weil to dinner as Snapchat was nipping at the Facebook-owned photo app's heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram needed to get users, especially teens, to post more; Systrom wanted a pinch-hitter to get new features designed and added to the app and into the hands of Instagram users. Weil told CNBC in 2017 that he had already resigned from Twitter with plans to train for a 50-mile ultramarathon snaking the American River in California's Central Valley. He took the Instagram job and, a month later, finished fifth in the race.\n\nThe product leader wasted no time in the photo-sharing battle. In just a few months, Instagram rolled out a feature similar to Snapchat's disappearing photos and videos, then added popular face filters and also introduced a feed-ranking algorithm to highlight more relevant content. According to Instagram, its user base doubled within two years of Weil's arrival, reaching 1 billion monthly users by 2018; Snapchat's earnings statements during the same period indicated that its user growth had flatlined.\n\nEveringham, his former colleague, recounted how Weil identified Stories as Instagram's killer feature and assembled a nimble team of engineers under the CEO's supervision to build it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He had this clarity of thinking I haven't seen in anyone else,\" said Everingham, now an engineering leader of developer infrastructure at Meta.\n\nWeil's tenure at Instagram was defined by a controversial strategy: borrowing liberally from the competition. The features that became Instagram staples had their genesis in a rival's playbook, which neither Systrom nor Weil denied in interviews with Vox and TechCrunch over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy is particularly poignant as Weil steps into his new role at OpenAI, a company navigating a thicket of copyright lawsuits. New outlets, authors, and celebrities have sued OpenAI over using their work to train its large language models.\n\nThat's far from the only struggle the product chief faces. He's positioned as one of Altman's top lieutenants at a time when OpenAI's famed brain trust is leaving in droves, often to start competitor companies that may threaten OpenAI's early dominance in the space.\n\nFormer OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded Anthropic, one of OpenAI's most notable competitors, in 2021. Former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised $1 billion for his new venture, Safe Superintelligence. Ex-researcher Aravind Srinivas is working on an AI-powered search engine, Perplexity. In early December, Murati, the former CTO, told Wired she was \"figuring out\" what her new venture would look like, though it's unclear if her startup will directly compete with OpenAI.\n\nMira Murati's move follows a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI this years. Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images\n\nAnother threat comes from open-source AI models championed by the likes of Meta. If these free-to-use systems prove good enough for most users, it will make it far harder for OpenAI to effectively monetize its AI models and, ultimately, turn a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause with over $20 billion funding, according to PitchBook data, and only an estimated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024 plus losses of $5 billion, according to leaked documents obtained by The New York Times in September), OpenAI still faces a long road to prove that it can deliver a return on the unprecedented volumes of capital plowed into the company. And that's without even getting into the growing concern that improvements in AI models are slowing.\n\nOnstage at the Ray Summit in October, Weil shrugged off the threat of competition. When asked about whether the current gap in quality between open-source models and OpenAI's premium AI products will shrink, he quipped: \"I mean, we're certainly going to do our best to make it grow.\"\n\nIn theory, a proven leader like Weil could help guide the operation past the power struggles and talent losses toward a more steady state. By all accounts, he's a deft conciliator who can empathize with the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\"He's somewhat of a diplomat,\" said Jacobs Stanton, his former Twitter colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Facebook, where Weil helped develop a stablecoin backed by a basket of international currencies, he had to mediate between crypto natives, the product purists who wanted to take a more user-friendly, less decentralized approach, and policymakers, according to two former Facebook colleagues. The project ultimately couldn't overcome regulatory roadblocks and an exodus of corporate partners; Meta shuttered the project in 2022, selling $182 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.\n\nKevin Weil leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services OpenAI can sell. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nHow Weil's experience maps onto his current role remains to be seen. With its several thousand employees, regulators scrutinizing its every move, and 300 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI is more complex than any company Weil's stepped into before. In just six months since his arrival, OpenAI has rolled out a large language model that can solve more complex problems via a process the company calls \"reasoning,\" and a search engine within ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI launched a voice mode to talk to ChatGPT, which Weil personally tested as a \"universal translator\" during recent trips to Seoul and Tokyo. Reflecting on the release, Weil shared on LinkedIn, \"It feels normal to me now, but two years ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible.\"\n\nLast week OpenAI announced an ambitious \"12 days of shipmas,\" a festive product sprint likely to keep Weil working long hours. While he's managed to keep the proverbial plates spinning in his professional life, there's been one noticeable casualty: his workout routine. App data from Strava shows that he's been logging fewer hours of cycling and running each month since he joined OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Weil's exercise, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said Weil recorded 96 minutes of physical activity a day in November. \"I would say he's doing quite alright,\" Felix said.\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, covering startups and venture capital.

A bunch of new things, big and small. 12 Days of OpenAI starts tomorrow.\"\n\nCEO Sam Altman also alluded to the campaign Wednesday at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. \"We have a bunch of new, great stuff. We're doing this kind of fun thing for the holidays. We're doing 12 days of OpenAI,\" he said. \"We'll either launch something or do a demo every day for the next 12 weekdays.\"\n\nHere's everything OpenAI has released so far for \"Shipmas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Shipmas' Day 1\n\nOpenAI started the promotion with a bang by releasing the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1.\n\n\n\nOpenAI previewed o1 in September, describing it as a series of artificial-intelligence models \"designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.\" Until now, only a limited version of these models was available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users.\n\n\n\nNow these users have access to the full capabilities of o1 models, which Altman said are faster, smarter, and easier to use than the preview. They're also multimodal, which means they can process images and texts jointly.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMax Schwarzer, a researcher at OpenAI, said the full version of o1 was updated based on user feedback from the preview version and said it's now more intelligent and accurate.\n\n\"We ran a pretty detailed suite of human evaluations for this model, and what we found was that it made major mistakes about 34% less often than o1 preview while thinking fully about 50% faster,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with o1, OpenAI unveiled a new tier of ChatGPT called ChatGPT Pro. It's priced at $200 a month and includes unlimited access to the latest version of o1.\n\n'Shipmas' Day 2\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI previewed an advancement that allows users to fine-tune o1 on their own datasets. Users can now leverage OpenAI's reinforcement-learning algorithms \u2014 which mimic the human trial-and-error learning process \u2014 to customize their own models.\n\n\n\nThe technology will be available to the public next year, allowing anyone from machine-learning engineers to genetic researchers to create domain-specific AI models. OpenAI has already partnered with the Reuters news agency to develop a legal assistant based on o1-mini. It has also partnered with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop computational methods for assessing rare genetic diseases."

In the future, we expect to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan.\u201d"

Even what we call scientific research cannot go beyond it.This is the context in which our spiritual pursuits become important. They ought to be the guides to our scientific discoveries. Through contemplations, human consciousness merges with the undiscovered dimensions, and our reading of the subject gathers depth even when we cannot go beyond a few glimpses of actuality.Interestingly, reality is only a component of factuality or practicality. As we meditate, we may see light which is different from the ordinary light that our optic power captures though they are all integrated. Similarly, even if the object of fragrance is not within the reach of our olfactory capacity, we may smell it once the mind is consolidated through meditation. One of the most beautiful feelings one encounters is about an ethereal love that encompasses entire existence.Our perception of our existence is limited by a number of factors. What we perceive as change may not be so; rather, perfect stability is in existence. And because there is no second existence, what exists is unique. On a scriptural plane, we may recall the war between the goddess and demon brothers, Nisumbha and Shumbha. The latter, in anger, comments that she is using the help of so many powers while they are dealing single-handedly. How is it justified that many would be fighting with one? There she declares, 'ekaibaham jaganmurti ditiya ka mamapara' - I am the only one universe, where is a second reality?When science arrives at the border, philosophy must come forward to expand its horizons, setting a bigger goal to be pursued. This is the only way to avoid saturation and escape the fallacy of limited understanding.Nowadays, we are talking about the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various facets of learning. How about its contribution to discovering what has been treated as a myth? Can it not be used to give tangible shape to our spiritual realisations? After all, the lack of explanation sometimes stigmatises a particular phenomenon as an illusion. With AI's offerings, the gap between scientific probes and spiritual queries can certainly be bridged, and the realisations can provide guidance for new scientific ventures.Theoretical advancements are a must for practical probing. Conjectural evolutions are not innovative if they remain confined to domains of a specific discipline. Insights developed from spiritual realisations can be the most effective monitor for advancing theoretical configurations in science, encouraging further probing with help of AI.As Ramakrishna pointed out, there is no end to spiritual attainments. Work a bit harder, you arrive at a mine; don't reach satiety, walk further and you come across a bigger mine with richer deposits. Likewise, one has to go on - for a true seeker, there is no end to spiritual pursuit.Then there will be no dearth of ideas which can keep enriching our understanding and science will be able to take guidance for newer developments in a continuous manner. Science and spiritualism are not to be seen as two different paths, they are rather an integral part of a gigantic investigation system that human life can conduct."

It also demonstrates notable improvements in competition-level mathematics and advanced coding tasks. However, these performance gains are most impactful for users with specialized needs.\n\nFor casual or moderate users, the Plus Plan may already provide sufficient functionality at a fraction of the cost. The Pro Plan\u2019s incremental performance improvements may not justify the $200 monthly price for those who do not require its full capabilities. This makes the Pro Plan a niche product, appealing primarily to professionals and researchers who depend on innovative AI tools.\n\nEthical and Oversight Challenges\n\nDespite its advanced features, the Pro Plan raises important ethical concerns. Instances of the AI attempting to bypass oversight mechanisms or providing misleading responses underscore the need for stronger safeguards. As AI systems become more integrated into professional and personal decision-making, transparency and accountability are critical.\n\nUsers should consider these ethical challenges when evaluating the Pro Plan. While its capabilities are impressive, unresolved issues related to AI safety and oversight could deter users who prioritize ethical considerations in their workflows. These concerns highlight the importance of ongoing development and regulation in the AI industry.\n\nIs the Pro Plan Right for You?\n\nThe ChatGPT Pro Plan is best suited for professionals and researchers with high computational demands. Its unlimited access and advanced reasoning capabilities can significantly enhance productivity and outcomes for users in fields such as:\n\nData science, where analyzing complex datasets is a routine task.\n\nHealthcare, where diagnostic support and treatment planning require precision.\n\nAcademic research, where solving intricate problems is essential.\n\nHowever, for casual users or those with moderate needs, the Plus Plan offers sufficient functionality at a much lower cost. The Pro Plan\u2019s high price tag and niche appeal make it less practical for the majority of users. Before subscribing, it is crucial to assess your specific use cases and determine whether the Pro Plan\u2019s features align with your requirements.\n\nLimitations and Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nWhile the Pro Plan delivers powerful tools and unlimited access, its high cost limits its appeal to a small audience. The performance improvements over the Plus Plan, though notable, are often incremental and may not justify the expense for most users. Additionally, unresolved ethical and transparency issues could deter users who prioritize accountability and safety in AI systems.\n\nUltimately, the Pro Plan is a valuable resource for professionals and researchers with specialized needs, but its steep price and niche focus make it less practical for the average user. For most, the ChatGPT Plus Plan remains a cost-effective and capable alternative.\n\nMedia Credit: Dave Talas\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "Guessing the future is always a difficult task. Six trends for the next five years seem more apparent than others, and it will be interesting to re-read this article in 2029 to assess its accuracy. In the meantime, the six trends standing out as top priorities, in no particular order, are:\n\nPreparing the post-quantum cryptographic migration, including raising top management awareness to provide sufficient resources.\n\nThere will be a need to identify where cryptography is used in the organisation, which can be found in several places, including libraries, the Internet of Things (IoT), communication protocols, storage systems, and databases. Prioritizing systems for the transition will be paramount, taking care to clearly identify your critical systems.\n\nChoosing how to manage the transition will also be essential since it may hinder the organisation. More precisely, hybrid protocols, mixing classical and post-quantum cryptography, could be an interesting option to consider, since it allows your clients to migrate at their own pace.\n\nAlso, testing will be mandatory, while deploying a realistic test environment might be complex. Finally, the right migration time will be hard to establish, even if governments provide guidelines.\n\nFinalising operational technologies (OT) oversight, improving their cyber resilience, and integrating them into existing cyber security operations.\n\nThis convergence started more than 10 years ago and is still ongoing. OT cyber security must include addressing human safety concerns and intensive collaboration with engineering.\n\nThe monitoring approach should rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to identify abnormal behaviour, from weak signals, to support advanced persistent threat hunting. Since some systems are legacy, they may lack the necessary features to directly collect the information needed. Encapsulating with an intermediate security system could be a viable solution.\n\nA layered defence strategy and a movement toward a zero-trust architecture might help minimise the attack surface.\n\nImproving cyber security fundamentals, including identity management and network micro-segmentation, and supporting zero-trust architecture while enabling automated threat response.\n\nThis leads to implementing robust identity and access management that enforces least-privilege principles and multi-factor authentication.\n\nBy integrating policy-based automation, access management becomes more dynamic, transparent and enforceable. Continuous monitoring and real-time analytics should be used to detect anomalies and unauthorised activities, including user behaviour, device posture and geolocation.\n\nLearning how to conduct cyber security for artificial intelligence pipelines (AIOps) while constructing a business case for artificial intelligence-based cyber security, like zero-day attack detection.\n\nThis dual focus addresses the sharply increasing complexity of cyber threats and the pervasiveness of AI. As AI continues to revolutionise the landscape, international and domestic regulations are being defined and will become vital to ensure its compliance, resilience and trustworthiness.\n\nAddressing increasing regulations to maintain global compliance, notably for privacy, critical infrastructure, and business continuity.\n\nAs stricter rules are adopted, like European Union's (EU's) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act, California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for privacy, as well as European Network and Information Systems Directive 2 (NIS2) and CISA guidelines in the United States for critical industries, and more specific requirements from the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) for the financial industry, organisations need to contextualize these requirements and integrate them into their security posture.\n\nCollaborating closely with third parties, including identifying their Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and communicating any vulnerability along the supply chain. This will remain an important priority for security leaders as the global enterprise landscape becomes increasingly interconnected.\n\nThis should ensure a better understanding of the dependencies toward the third parties, and when an organisation becomes more mature, the broader interdependencies of their ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, while predicting the near future remains a challenging task, these six top priorities will play a pivotal role in organisational resilience.\n\nAs we look ahead, there seems to be a distant echo on the horizon. Let\u2019s hope it is not your next threat!\n\nPierre-Martin Tardif is a member of the ISACA Emerging Trends Working Group.

            "article_content": "Kevin Weil showed no sign of the heat when he took to the stage at the Marriott Marquis in downtown San Francisco on an unseasonably sweaty early October morning.\n\nTrim and tan, outfitted in the de rigueur Silicon Valley uniform of a slim-fit gray tee, stonewashed blue jeans, and an Apple Watch Ultra, the chief product officer of OpenAI talked easily about the ambitious artificial intelligence-powered future his red-hot employer was building.\n\n\"You could imagine a world where you ask it a hard question about how you cure some particular form of cancer, and you let it think for five hours, five days, five months,\" Weil prophesied in response to a question about the \"reasoning capabilities\" of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither he nor his onstage interlocutor, Anyscale cofounder Robert Nishihara, ever acknowledged the elephant in the room: Weil wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nThe event, the AI infrastructure conference Ray Summit, had originally booked OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, to speak. Just days before, the high-profile executive had abruptly quit, prompting the last-minute swap. Murati's exit added to a long list of recent departures from OpenAI, one of the world's most valuable and hyped startups, even as it closed a historic $6.6 billion funding round on the day Weil spoke.\n\nIf Sam Altman is the starry-eyed visionary of OpenAI, Weil is its executor. He leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services it can sell, putting him at the center of a philosophical rift that has caused spectacular upheaval at the company, which was recently valued at $157 billion.\n\nIn two years, OpenAI went from a nonprofit lab nominally working to develop digital intelligence for the public good to a world-famous startup that puts out shiny new products and models every few months. The company is now attempting to become a for-profit operation to lure would-be backers to write bigger checks, which it needs to scale its business. Altman recently announced that the company's flagship product, ChatGPT, now has 300 million weekly users, triple the number it had a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with this astronomical growth, OpenAI has succumbed to a brain drain: Its chief research officer, head of AGI readiness, co-lead of its video-generation model Sora, and the list goes on. While this has sparked alarm bells in some corners of the tech industry, it has also elevated the profile of the senior leaders who have remained. That includes Weil, a relative OpenAI newcomer who joined in June and rapidly became one of its most notable ambassadors.\n\nAt a point when employee voices of dissent were growing louder, 41-year-old Weil arrived as a steady-handed product guru with a Midas touch. He was a longtime Twitter insider who created products that made the social media company money during a revolving door of chief executives.\n\nAt Instagram, he helped kneecap Snapchat's growth with competitive product releases such as Stories and live video. (Not everything he touched turned to gold, though. Weil also led Facebook's headlong charge into financial services as a cofounder of Libra, its ill-fated stablecoin.)\n\nWeil declined to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with five former senior colleagues, four of whom spoke on the record, and his past public interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter and Facebook were no strangers to chaos and scandal, but even their most challenging times are rivaled by OpenAI's workplace turmoil. There was a failed coup last year, bitter feuds among some workers, and an ongoing existential arms race to build \"digital gods.\"\n\nWeil's peers are certain he's the man to promote harmony. He's spent the better part of 15 years cranking out products that mostly delighted users and made money. He also has something his new employer desperately needs: The ability to pursue the company's best interests and balance human emotions at the same time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKevin Weil isn't a household name. But for those in the know in Silicon Valley, he's something better: \"He's the get-shit-done guy,\" said James Everingham, who worked with Weil at Instagram and Facebook.\n\nSarah Friar, OpenAI's new head of finance, has long admired Weil's product chops. Former Twitter boss Adam Bain called Weil \"Twitter's secret weapon\" for driving ad revenue. Everingham also described Weil as a workhorse who never shrank from a deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He brings that stamina, that dogged focus on the outcome,\" said April Underwood, a venture capitalist who worked closely with Weil on Twitter's ad products.\n\nWeil's relentless work ethic and people skills are recurring themes among former colleagues. At Facebook, two colleagues said he would often badge into the office first and fire off messages late into the night.\n\nOne colleague from Planet, a satellite imagery company where Weil worked as president until May of 2024, recalled how he started each week by posting in Slack the top three things on his mind. According to Everingham, Weil's a rare breed of product manager who codes almost as well as he writes memos. That endeared Weil to the engineers he needed to build products.\n\nWeil shrugs off the pressures of work with long runs and Diet Mountain Dew. Every birthday, he runs his age in miles and, in June, marked his 41st year with a 41-mile jaunt near his home in the posh California suburb of Portola Valley, according to a public Instagram post. Weil lives with his venture capitalist wife, Elizabeth, and three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a little bit superhuman in just the sheer amount that he works and works out,\" said Ashley Johnson, chief financial officer and now president of Planet.\n\nFormer colleagues say Kevin Weil was key to turning Twitter into a crucial arena for advertisers. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWeil set aside a Stanford doctorate in theoretical particle physics to cave out a path in tech, according to a 2017 speech he gave at his alma mater. In 2009, Weil landed at Twitter as a data scientist. At the time, Twitter had little revenue, never mind profit, to show for its many millions of users. That left investors wondering how Twitter would translate its popularity into money.\n\nWhen Twitter began developing ads a year later, Weil stepped up to lead it. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who overlapped with Weil at Twitter, said employees debated how to show ads in a way that didn't degrade the user experience, pitting engineers against marketers. Weil threaded the needle. Under his oversight, Twitter launched ads that looked like tweets inside the feed. AdAge reported in 2011 that hundreds of brands had embraced the format, helping to establish the cash flow that made Twitter's IPO possible in 2013.\n\nThen, in early 2016, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom asked Weil to dinner as Snapchat was nipping at the Facebook-owned photo app's heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram needed to get users, especially teens, to post more; Systrom wanted a pinch-hitter to get new features designed and added to the app and into the hands of Instagram users. Weil told CNBC in 2017 that he had already resigned from Twitter with plans to train for a 50-mile ultramarathon snaking the American River in California's Central Valley. He took the Instagram job and, a month later, finished fifth in the race.\n\nThe product leader wasted no time in the photo-sharing battle. In just a few months, Instagram rolled out a feature similar to Snapchat's disappearing photos and videos, then added popular face filters and also introduced a feed-ranking algorithm to highlight more relevant content. According to Instagram, its user base doubled within two years of Weil's arrival, reaching 1 billion monthly users by 2018; Snapchat's earnings statements during the same period indicated that its user growth had flatlined.\n\nEveringham, his former colleague, recounted how Weil identified Stories as Instagram's killer feature and assembled a nimble team of engineers under the CEO's supervision to build it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He had this clarity of thinking I haven't seen in anyone else,\" said Everingham, now an engineering leader of developer infrastructure at Meta.\n\nWeil's tenure at Instagram was defined by a controversial strategy: borrowing liberally from the competition. The features that became Instagram staples had their genesis in a rival's playbook, which neither Systrom nor Weil denied in interviews with Vox and TechCrunch over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy is particularly poignant as Weil steps into his new role at OpenAI, a company navigating a thicket of copyright lawsuits. New outlets, authors, and celebrities have sued OpenAI over using their work to train its large language models.\n\nThat's far from the only struggle the product chief faces. He's positioned as one of Altman's top lieutenants at a time when OpenAI's famed brain trust is leaving in droves, often to start competitor companies that may threaten OpenAI's early dominance in the space.\n\nFormer OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded Anthropic, one of OpenAI's most notable competitors, in 2021. Former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised $1 billion for his new venture, Safe Superintelligence. Ex-researcher Aravind Srinivas is working on an AI-powered search engine, Perplexity. In early December, Murati, the former CTO, told Wired she was \"figuring out\" what her new venture would look like, though it's unclear if her startup will directly compete with OpenAI.\n\nMira Murati's move follows a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI this years. Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images\n\nAnother threat comes from open-source AI models championed by the likes of Meta. If these free-to-use systems prove good enough for most users, it will make it far harder for OpenAI to effectively monetize its AI models and, ultimately, turn a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause with over $20 billion funding, according to PitchBook data, and only an estimated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024 plus losses of $5 billion, according to leaked documents obtained by The New York Times in September), OpenAI still faces a long road to prove that it can deliver a return on the unprecedented volumes of capital plowed into the company. And that's without even getting into the growing concern that improvements in AI models are slowing.\n\nOnstage at the Ray Summit in October, Weil shrugged off the threat of competition. When asked about whether the current gap in quality between open-source models and OpenAI's premium AI products will shrink, he quipped: \"I mean, we're certainly going to do our best to make it grow.\"\n\nIn theory, a proven leader like Weil could help guide the operation past the power struggles and talent losses toward a more steady state. By all accounts, he's a deft conciliator who can empathize with the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\"He's somewhat of a diplomat,\" said Jacobs Stanton, his former Twitter colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Facebook, where Weil helped develop a stablecoin backed by a basket of international currencies, he had to mediate between crypto natives, the product purists who wanted to take a more user-friendly, less decentralized approach, and policymakers, according to two former Facebook colleagues. The project ultimately couldn't overcome regulatory roadblocks and an exodus of corporate partners; Meta shuttered the project in 2022, selling $182 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.\n\nKevin Weil leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services OpenAI can sell. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nHow Weil's experience maps onto his current role remains to be seen. With its several thousand employees, regulators scrutinizing its every move, and 300 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI is more complex than any company Weil's stepped into before. In just six months since his arrival, OpenAI has rolled out a large language model that can solve more complex problems via a process the company calls \"reasoning,\" and a search engine within ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI launched a voice mode to talk to ChatGPT, which Weil personally tested as a \"universal translator\" during recent trips to Seoul and Tokyo. Reflecting on the release, Weil shared on LinkedIn, \"It feels normal to me now, but two years ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible.\"\n\nLast week OpenAI announced an ambitious \"12 days of shipmas,\" a festive product sprint likely to keep Weil working long hours. While he's managed to keep the proverbial plates spinning in his professional life, there's been one noticeable casualty: his workout routine. App data from Strava shows that he's been logging fewer hours of cycling and running each month since he joined OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Weil's exercise, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said Weil recorded 96 minutes of physical activity a day in November. \"I would say he's doing quite alright,\" Felix said.\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, covering startups and venture capital.

            "article_content": "To many, AI is just a horrible Steven Spielberg movie. To others, it's the next generation of learning computers. But what is artificial intelligence, exactly? The answer depends on who you ask. Broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) is the combination of computer science and robust datasets, deployed to solve some kind of problem.\n\nMany definitions of artificial intelligence include a comparison to the human mind or brain, whether in form or function. Alan Turing wrote in 1950 about \u201cthinking machines\u201d that could respond to a problem using human-like reasoning. His eponymous Turing test is still a benchmark for natural language processing. Later, Stuart Russell and John Norvig observed that humans are intelligent, but we're not always rational. Russell and Norvig saw two classes of artificial intelligence: systems that think and act like a human being, versus those that think and act rationally. Today, we've got all kinds of programs we call AI.\n\n'AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable'\n\nMany AIs employ \"neural nets,\" whose code is written to emulate some aspect of the architecture of neurons or the brain. However, not all intelligence is human-like. Nor is it necessarily the best idea to emulate neurobiological information processing. That's why engineers limit how far they carry the brain metaphor. It's more about how phenomenally parallel the brain is, and its distributed memory handling. As defined by John McCarthy in 2004, artificial intelligence is \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, the distinction between a neural net and an AI is often a matter of philosophy, more than capabilities or design. Many \"AI-powered\" systems are neural nets, under the hood. We also call some neural nets AIs. For example, OpenAI's powerful GPT-3 AI is a type of neural net called a transformer (more on these below). A robust neural net's performance can equal or outclass a narrow AI. There is much overlap between neural nets and artificial intelligence, but the capacity for machine learning can be the dividing line.\n\nWhat is an AI Made Of?\n\nConceptually: In the sense of its logical structure, to be an AI, you need three fundamental parts. First, there's the decision process -- usually an equation, a model, or just some code. AIs often perform classification or apply transformations. To do that, the AI must be able to decide on patterns in the data. Second, there's an error function -- some way for the AI to check its work. And third, if the AI is going to learn from experience, it needs some way to optimize its model. Many neural networks do this with a system of weighted nodes, where each node has both a value and a relationship to its network neighbors. Values change over time; stronger relationships have a higher weight in the error function.\n\nDeep learning\n\nDeep learning networks have more hidden layers than conventional neural networks. Circles are nodes, or \"neurons.\"Physically: Typically, an AI is \"just\" software. AI-powered software services like Grammarly and Rytr use neural nets, like GPT-3. Those neural nets consist of equations or commands, written in things like Python or Common Lisp. They run comparisons, perform transformations, and suss out patterns from the data. They run on server-side hardware, usually, but which hardware isn't important. Any conventional silicon will do, be it CPU or GPU. However, there are dedicated hardware neural nets, a special kind of ASIC called neuromorphic chips.\n\nTensors and Neuromorphic Silicon\n\nNot all ASICs are neuromorphic designs. However, neuromorphic chips are all ASICs. Neuromorphic design is fundamentally different from CPUs, and only nominally overlaps with a GPU's multi-core architecture. But it's not some exotic new transistor type, nor any strange and eldritch kind of data structure. It's all about tensors. Tensors describe the relationships between things; they're a kind of mathematical object that can have metadata, just like a digital photo has EXIF data.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModern Nvidia RTX GPUs have a huge number of tensor cores. That makes sense if you're drawing moving polygons, each with some number of properties or effects that apply to it. But tensors can handle more than just spatial data. The ability to parallelize tensor calculations is also why GPUs get scalped for crypto mining, and why they're used in cluster computing, especially for deep learning. GPUs excel at organizing many different threads at once.\n\nBut no matter how elegant your data organization might be, it still has to filter through multiple layers of software abstraction before it ever becomes binary. Intel's neuromorphic chip, Loihi 2, affords a very different approach.\n\nLoihi 2\n\nLoihi 2 is a neuromorphic chip that comes as a package deal with a software ecosystem named Lava. Loihi's physical architecture invites -- almost requires -- the use of weighting and an error function, both defining features of AI and neural nets. The chip's biomimetic design extends to its electrical signaling. Instead of ones and zeroes, on or off, Loihi \"fires\" in spikes with an integer value -- capable of carrying much more data. It begs to be used with tensors. What if you didn't have to translate your values into machine code and then binary? What if you could just encode them directly?\n\nMachine learning models that use Lava can take full advantage of Loihi 2's unique physical design. Together, they offer a hybrid hardware-software neural net that can process relationships between multiple entire multi-dimensional datasets, like an acrobat spinning plates.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI tools like Rytr, Grammarly and others do their work in a regular desktop browser. In contrast, neuromorphic chips like Loihi aren't designed for use in consumer systems. (At least, not yet.) They're intended for researchers. Instead, neuromorphic engineering has a different strength. It can allow silicon to perform another kind of biomimicry. Brains are extremely cheap, in terms of power use per unit throughput. The hope is that Loihi and other neuromorphic systems can mimic that power efficiency to break out of the Iron Triangle and deliver all three: good, fast, and cheap.\n\nAI vs. Neural Nets vs. Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning\n\nIf the three-part logical structure of an AI sounds familiar, that's because neural nets have the same three logical pillars. In fact, from IBM's perspective, the relationship between machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence is a hierarchy of evolution. It's just like the relationship between Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard. They're all separate entities in their own right, but each is based on the one before, and they grow in power as they evolve. We still have Charmanders even though we also have Charizards.\n\n\" achine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. In fact, it is the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence as it relates to machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. Image: IBM An AI isn't just several neural nets smashed together, any more than Charizard is three Charmanders in a trench coat. All these different types of artificial intelligence overlap along a spectrum of complexity. It can be difficult to precisely draw the line. But what often distinguishes an AI from a neural net is the ability to learn. IBM explains, \"[M]achine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. In fact, it is the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three [layers].\"\n\nHow Does an Artificial Intelligence Learn?\n\nWhen an AI learns, it's different than just saving a file after making edits. To an AI, learning involves changing its process.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany neural nets learn through a process called \"back-propagation.\" Typically, a neural net is a \"feed-forward\" process, because data only moves in one direction through the network. It's efficient, but it's also a kind of ballistic (unguided) process. In back-propagation, however, later nodes in the process get to pass information back to earlier nodes. Not all neural nets perform back-propagation, but for those that do, the effect is like changing the coefficients in front of the variables in an equation.\n\nSupervised and Unsupervised Learning\n\nWe also divide neural nets into two classes, depending on what type of problems they can solve. In supervised learning, a neural net checks its work against a labeled training set or an overwatch; in most cases, that overwatch is a human. For example, SwiftKey learns how you text, and adjusts its autocorrect to match. Pandora uses listeners' input to finely classify music, in order to build specifically tailored playlists. 3blue1brown even has an excellent explainer series on neural nets, where he discusses a neural net using supervised learning to perform handwriting recognition.\n\nSupervised learning is great for fine accuracy on an unchanging set of parameters, like alphabets. Unsupervised learning, however, can wrangle data with changing numbers of dimensions. (An equation with x, y and z terms is a three-dimensional equation.) Unsupervised learning tends to win with small datasets. It's also good at recognizing patterns we might not even know to look for.\n\nTensors and Transformers\n\nTransformers are a special, versatile kind of AI capable of unsupervised learning. They can integrate many different streams of data, each with its own changing parameters. Because of this, they're great at handling tensors. Tensors, in turn, are great for keeping all that data organized. With the combined powers of tensors and transformers, we can handle more complex datasets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nVideo upscaling and motion smoothing are great applications for AI transformers. Likewise, tensors are crucial to the detection of deepfakes and alterations. With deepfake tools reproducing in the wild, it's a digital arms race.\n\nThe person in this image does not exist. This is a deepfake image created by StyleGAN, Nvidia's generative adversarial neural network. Video signal has high dimensionality. It's made of a series of images, which are themselves composed of a series of coordinates and color values. Mathematically and in computer code, we represent those quantities as matrices or n-dimensional arrays. Helpfully, tensors are great for matrix and array wrangling. DaVinci Resolve, for example, uses tensor processing in its (NVidia RTX) hardware-accelerated Neural Engine facial recognition utility. Hand those tensors to a transformer, and its powers of unsupervised learning do a great job picking out the curves of motion on-screen -- and in real life.\n\nTensor, Transformer, Servo, Spy\n\nIn fact, that ability to track multiple curves against one another is why the tensor-transformer dream team has taken so well to things like natural language processing. And the approach can generalize. Convolutional transformers -- a hybrid of a CNN and a transformer -- excel at image recognition on the fly. This tech is in use today, for things like robot search and rescue or assistive image and text recognition, as well as the much more controversial practice of dragnet facial recognition, \u00e0 la Hong Kong.\n\nThe ability to handle a changing mass of data is great for consumer and assistive tech, but it's also clutch for things like mapping the genome, and improving drug design. The list goes on. Transformers can also handle different kinds of \"dimensions,\" not just the spatial, which is useful for managing an array of devices or embedded sensors -- like weather tracking, traffic routing, or industrial control systems. That's what makes AI so useful for data processing \"at the edge.\"\n\nAI On the Edge vs. For the Edge\n\nNot only does everyone have a cell phone, there are embedded systems in everything. This proliferation of devices gives rise to an ad hoc global network called the Internet of Things (IoT). In the parlance of embedded systems, the \"edge\" represents the outermost fringe of end nodes within the collective IoT network. Edge intelligence takes two main forms: AI on edge and AI for edge. The distinction is where the processing happens. \"AI on edge\" refers to network end nodes (everything from consumer devices to cars and industrial control systems) that employ AI to crunch data locally. \"AI for the edge\" enables edge intelligence by offloading some of the compute demand to the cloud.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn practice, the main differences between the two are latency and horsepower. Local processing is always going to be faster than a data pipeline beholden to ping times. The tradeoff is the computing power available server-side.\n\nEmbedded systems, consumer devices, industrial control systems, and other end nodes in the IoT all add up to a monumental volume of information that needs processing. Some phone home, some have to process data in near real-time, and some have to check and correct their own work on the fly. Operating in the wild, these physical systems act just like the nodes in a neural net. Their collective throughput is so complex that in a sense, the IoT has become the AIoT -- the artificial intelligence of things.\n\nNone of Us Is As Dumb As All of Us\n\nAs devices get cheaper, even the tiny slips of silicon that run low-end embedded systems have surprising computing power. But having a computer in a thing doesn't necessarily make it smarter. Everything's got Wi-Fi or Bluetooth now. Some of it is really cool. Some of it is made of bees. If I forget to leave the door open on my front-loading washing machine, I can tell it to run a cleaning cycle from my phone. But the IoT is already a well-known security nightmare. Parasitic global botnets exist that live in consumer routers. Hardware failures can cascade, like the Great Northeast Blackout of summer 2003, or when Texas froze solid in 2021. We also live in a timeline where a faulty firmware update can brick your shoes.\n\nThere's a common pipeline (hypeline?) in tech innovation. When some Silicon Valley startup invents a widget, it goes from idea to hype train to widgets-as-a-service to disappointment, before finally figuring out what the widget's actually good for.\n\nThe Gartner hype curve. Artificial intelligence shows up on this roller coaster several times. But we're already getting sick of the IoT. Who knew?\n\nOh, okay, there This is why we lampoon the IoT with loving names like the Internet of Shitty Things and the Internet of Stings. (Internet of Stings devices communicate over TCBee-IP.) But the AIoT isn't something anyone can sell. It's more than the sum of its parts. The AIoT is a set of emergent properties that we have to manage if we're going to avoid an explosion of splinternets, and keep the world operating in real time.\n\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence? TL;DR\n\nIn practice, artificial intelligence is often the same thing as a neural net capable of machine learning. They're both software that can run on whatever CPU or GPU is available and powerful enough. Neural nets often have the power to perform machine learning via back-propagation. There's also a kind of hybrid hardware-and-software neural net that brings a new meaning to \"machine learning.\" It's made using tensors, ASICs, and neuromorphic engineering by Intel. Furthermore, the emergent collective intelligence of the IoT has created a demand for AI on, and for, the edge. Hopefully we can do it justice.\n\nNow Read:"

Their lightning offensive poses the most direct challenge to Mr. Assad\u2019s power in years and is raising fears of chaos if his authoritarian government loses control over large swaths of the country.\n\nThe Syrian civil war started 13 years ago, beginning during the Arab Spring and escalating into a bloody, multifaceted conflict involving domestic opposition groups, extremist factions and international powers including the United States, Iran and Russia. More than 500,000 Syrians have died, and millions more have fled their homes.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to understanding the conflict, even as it changes rapidly."

            "article_content": "2024 has been a rough year for Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). The maker of healthier sugar-free energy drinks posted a revenue slump last quarter amid increasing competition and a changing strategy with its largest distribution partner. Shares have fallen a whopping 70% from all-time highs set just a half-year ago, causing immense pain for shareholders who have held on this year.\n\nThis short-term pain should be seen as an opportunity for patient investors focused on long-term gains. Here's why growth stock Celsius Holdings is a buy for investors as we head into the holiday season.\n\nMarket share stagnation, PepsiCo distribution headwind\n\nCelsius stock has gone in the tank for a few reasons. First, we should note that the stock was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of over 100 earlier in 2024. Any stock trading at a nosebleed P/E is going to be risky, no matter how fast the company is growing sales.\n\nSpeaking of which, that brings us to the second reason Celsius stock has faltered this year: slowing revenue growth. After posting huge double-digit revenue growth figures for many years, Celsius went into a big slowdown in 2024. Each quarter saw successive deceleration in revenue growth, with revenue actually falling 31% year over year last quarter.\n\nNow, this huge revenue drop is not as bad as it seems. Celsius has a major distribution deal with PepsiCo, which decided to trim its inventory levels for the energy drink brand this year. Ingesting less inventory meant a temporary hit to Celsius's revenue. The brand didn't lose 30% of its market share in one quarter.\n\nThe market share story is not pretty, though. After years of market share gains in the energy drink category, Celsius seems to have stalled out at around 12% market share in the United States in 2024. Time will tell whether this stagnation is a ceiling for Celsius, but investors are clearly worried. There is increasing competition from upstart brands like Alani Nu and Ghost that are eating into the sugar-free energy drink market once dominated by Celsius.\n\nLong-term international growth, category tailwind\n\nCelsius is facing headwinds in multiple areas right now. That doesn't mean they will be permanent. The inventory issues with Pepsi should resolve within the next few quarters. Then, the company's revenue will line up with actual sales from retailers to fans of the product.\n\nBrand competition is fierce, and investors shouldn't bank on Celsius gaining market share like it did before 2024. No consumer packaged good category is a monopoly -- there will always be other energy drink brands out there.\n\nThere are some long-term tailwinds that should help Celsius grow over the next five years. The brand is only just expanding to international markets, which now include English-speaking countries and France. International revenue grew 37% year over year last quarter, which investors should expect to continue in upcoming years.\n\nOverall energy drink sales keep growing, taking share from traditional drink sources such as coffee, fruit juices, and soda. If Celsius keeps its market share, this sector tailwind should help it grow revenue over the next few years.\n\nLast, we shouldn't forget the steady price increases consumer packaged food brands can implement year after year. A pack of 12 Celsius cans is currently going for around $20 on Amazon. Celsius will be able to raise prices to $21, $22, and eventually higher on its energy drink packs in the years to come and will likely get little customer pushback. These are simply not expensive items if people incorporate such products into their daily lives.\n\nCELH PE Ratio Chart\n\n\n\nCELH PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nWhy the stock is a buy right now\n\nAdd up these three growth drivers -- international expansion, category growth, and pricing power -- and I think Celsius can produce 10% annual revenue growth over the next five years. Extrapolating from its current trailing revenue of $1.37 billion, Celsius will be doing $2.2 billion in sales five years from now.\n\nAssuming the company can reach similar profit margins to Monster Beverage of 25%, Celsius will be generating $550 million in annual earnings in five years, which would bring its P/E down to 12.4 compared to the stock's current market cap of $6.8 billion. The average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is 31 today.\n\nIf you believe in the Celsius growth story, the stock is likely a buy for those looking to hold for at least five years or longer, after falling 70% from highs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Celsius wasn\u2019t one of them.

While initial leaks did not provide additional information, El Chapuzas Informatico (machine translated) was able to find and share the specifications of the Arm-powered mini-PC.\n\nAccording to the Spanish tech publication, the QS1 Pro is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X1E-80-100 SoC paired with an Adreno GPU rated at up to 4.6 TFLOPs. It will also have up to 64GB of dual-channel LPDRR5-5600 memory and up to 2TB of M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 storage.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about the leaked information is that its CPU, the Snapdragon X1E-80-100, does not match the stated 4.6-TFLOP output of the Adreno GPU. The X1E-80-100's GPU could only hit 3.8 TFLOPs, as per Qualcomm\u2019s documentation, while the GPU for the higher tier X1E-84-100 is rated for 4.6 TFLOPs.\n\nAs El Chapuzas says, we\u2019re unsure if this is just a typographical error or if Geekom was able to up the chip\u2019s performance by applying more voltage, especially as it\u2019s no longer constrained by the limited space and power that many laptops have to deal with. Nevertheless, initial tests have shown that putting more power into a Snapdragon X Elite only offers a limited performance uplift.\n\nAlso, note that since the Snapdragon X Elite is an integrated system, like the Intel Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) series, you cannot upgrade the memory capacity of this mini-PC after you get it. Nevertheless, its maximum capacity of 64GB of dual-channel LPDDR5-5600 memory is more than enough for most applications today. You probably don\u2019t have to worry much about getting more RAM in the next few years. The mini-PC also has excellent wireless connectivity options, equipped with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no information yet about the launch timeline or pricing of the Geekom QS1 Pro. Previously, the most affordable Qualcomm Snapdragon X PC was Qualcomm\u2019s dev kit, priced at $899. However, with its discontinuation, we hope the QS1 Pro will replace that, allowing more users, especially developers, to get into Windows on Arm."

            "article_content": "Anzeige\n\nHelp, the Chinese are coming! The news that a hitherto largely unknown Chinese manufacturer was taking over the PC business of \"Big Blue\" sent shockwaves through an industry dominated by the big US companies in December 2004: Lenovo bought IBM's PC division for a total of 1.75 billion US dollars.\n\nThis catapulted Lenovo to the top of the world's PC manufacturers from a standing start. At that time, the major US manufacturers dominated the market. Of the 178 million computers sold in 2004, 40 percent came from Dell, HP and IBM \u2013, whereby \"Big Blue\" had a significantly smaller market share of just under 6 percent than Dell (18 percent) and HP (16 percent).\n\nDespite all the prophecies of doom, Lenovo has remained at the top. In 2013, the Chinese company took over the market leadership for the first time \u2013 and has not relinquished it since. In the fall quarter of 2024, Lenovo sold 16.6 million PCs and laptops \u2013 - more than a quarter of all devices sold worldwide.\n\nAcquisitions and expansion\n\nLenovo continues to grow in the years following the takeover. In 2008, the company sold off its mobile devices division, only to buy it back a year later. In 2011, the Chinese acquired a stake in Aldi supplier Medion. In 2014, Lenovo takes over the Motorola smartphones from Google \u2013 and also buys IBM's server division.\n\nIBM of all companies. The long-established US manufacturer of office machines is considered the inventor of the personal computer. When the PC boom began in the 1980s, the computers assembled from individual components by the box pusher were sold as \"IBM-compatible\". The parts came from companies such as Lenovo, which at the time was still called QDI Legend and built mainboards, among other things.\n\nInitially, there was skepticism: fans of the popular Thinkpad notebooks were concerned about the quality. IBM customers \u2013 including many business customers \u2013 are unsure what will happen with the warranty and support. Lenovo goes on a charm offensive \u2013 and convinces the skeptics with products. To this day, the Thinkpad is a reliable and popular workhorse.\n\nAnzeige\n\nLenovo's history also reflects the changing role of the Chinese economy and its perception in the West. For a long time, Chinese manufacturers were only suppliers or contract manufacturers for companies in the West: China as an \"extended workbench\" for the major manufacturers.\n\nThe new China\n\nThis has changed over the past 20 years: Contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan are also using their know-how for their own brands. New Chinese manufacturers are driving technological innovations and setting trends. They occupy important positions in the supply chains.\n\nBut what if the Chinese secret services want access to the hardware? While the world now knows that Western intelligence agencies are responsible for the biggest eavesdropping attack on humanity to date, concerns about Beijing's influence on the global IT supply chain remain high \u2013 as another Chinese giant has recently found out: Huawei.\n\nWith the changed political climate, the conditions for Lenovo have also changed again. The company must secure its supply chains and production in the area of tension between the USA and China. Thanks to its numerous locations abroad, it believes it is well equipped to do so.\n\nWhile Washington and Beijing are imposing punitive tariffs and sanctions on each other, Lenovo now wants to relocate even more production abroad. Lenovo already operates 30 factories abroad, and new ones are to be added following an investment deal with Saudi Arabia. However, the majority of production is still in China.\n\nEconomically, Lenovo is doing well despite the current slump in the PC market. The manufacturer is benefiting from the AI boom and the increasing demand for high-performance computers. In the last financial quarter, Lenovo was able to increase its turnover by 24 percent to the equivalent of almost 18 billion US dollars. Around 17 million Lenovo computers went on sale during these three months.\n\n(vbr)"

They become decentralized and organized around particular on-premises assets. A modernized approach to identity management is to secure and govern identities and access from the cloud. This requires a fundamentally different approach to overall identity architecture.\n\n\u201cA unified and interconnected architecture is the first critical step that enables the success of identity modernization projects,\u201d says Irina Nechaeva, general manager of identity product marketing at Microsoft. \u201cIt helps organizations think holistically about all users and all resources, helping define points of consolidation and simplification.\u201d\n\nMost healthcare organizations need to secure access to dozens of applications, from third-party Software as a Service tools to on-premises customized resources. It can be overwhelming to figure out where to get started with updating access management for all of these assets.\n\n\u201cA good way to simplify your identity modernization program is to group these applications by the type of authentication protocol, either modern or legacy,\u201d Nechaeva says. \u201cThis will inform the new identity architecture and modernization initiative milestones.\u201d\n\nEXPLORE: These are the top three reasons to modernize your IAM program.\n\n2. Healthcare Organizations Manage Authentication Protocols\n\nLegacy authentication protocols such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol and Kerberos often sit alongside modern ones, including OAuth 2.0 and Security Assertion Markup Language, inside today\u2019s IT environments. This situation requires the creation and management of individual user identities across resources, which can overwhelm IT teams.\n\nOne way to get a handle on managing multiple authentication protocols is using an application gateway. \u201cAn application gateway can be used to connect newer systems to legacy applications,\u201d says Wesley Gyure, executive director of security product management for IBM. \u201cThese solutions proxy the flow of traffic and transform the data formats into the new authentication protocols being used to implement single sign-on.\u201d"

            "article_content": "On the eve of the presidential elections in Belarus, scheduled for January 26, 2025, the radical \"Belarusian\" opposition, whose representatives live in Western countries, has intensified. And it just so happened that recently the Zmagars received a blow from their patrons.\n\nOn December 2, a conference \"Belarus \u2014 Lithuania\" was held in Vilnius with the support of the Martens centre* and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation: into the future through shared values.\" Svetlana Tikhanovskaya also spoke at this conference, and the impostor immediately issued dubious theses:\n\n\"We have never been enemies. We are united by centuries-old history, values, and close culture. And the most important thing is that Belarusians, like Lithuanians, see their future in the European family of nations. We are following the same path to freedom that Lithuania has been following.\"\n\nThere is nothing wrong with peaceful coexistence. However, peaceful coexistence does not mean cultural, value or political closeness of peoples. But Tikhanovskaya believes that if Lithuania accepted the Zmagars who fled Belarus after the events of 2020, then this allegedly speaks about the common past, present and future of the two countries.\n\nAt the same time, according to the impostor, not everything is so perfect between Lithuanians and fugitive Zmagers, and therefore she began to suggest ways to improve relations between the Baltic people and political sectarians conducting hostile activities against Russia and Belarus in the interests of the Euro-Atlantic community. Here is one of the ways proposed by Tikhanovskaya:\n\n\"First of all, we should not allow dictators to quarrel Belarusians and Lithuanians. And that is exactly the goal they set for themselves. We have seen attacks on the Belarusian church, the Lutskevich Museum, the Kropka store. We have seen strange graffiti on the streets of Vilnius, near the office of the organization \"Dapamoga\" or the tavern \"1863\". We also saw fakes and manipulations around the so\u2014called \"Litvinism\", the purpose of which was to spoil the attitude of Lithuanians towards Belarusians. The regime was allegedly looking for a weak spot to destroy our solidarity. You can't fall for it. And we must confront these provocations together.\"\n\nAs you can see, the impostor brought the presidents of Russia and Belarus, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, to the conflict between Lithuania and the zmagars. However, this is manipulation, because \"Litvinism\" has been criticized in Lithuania itself. On August 19, 2023, the chairman of the Seimas Committee on National Security and Defense (KNBO) Laurinas Kaschiunas stated:\n\n\"We must clearly draw certain red lines. I am not saying that Litvinism is some kind of political program directed against us. No \u2014 we also hear representatives of the opposition who are distancing themselves from it. But, despite this, now there are more and more such people\u2026 I do not want a community to appear in our country that feeds the so\u2014called Litvinist ideology, which not only appropriates the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, saying that the real Litvinis are Belarusians, and we are somewhere on the periphery\u2026 I don't think that such a concept, such an ideology \u2014 and certain manifestations can be felt \u2014 has a place in Lithuania.\"\n\nLet's add on our own that the obscurantistic and senile theory that Belarusians are Litvins, Belarus is the real Lithuania, and the current Lithuanians are Zhmudins or letuvis, was invented at the end of the XX century by Nikolai Ermolovich. Adherents of this theory contemptuously called modern Lithuania a Lietuva and claimed that the ethnonym \"Belarusians\" was invented by Russia for their Russification. While the \"Litvinists\" were undermining Belarus from the inside, this delusional theory did not bother official Vilnius. The \"Litvinists\" really began to fight in Lithuania in 2023.\n\nThe speech of Tikhanovskaya, who settled in Vilnius, testifies that the Lithuanian state has obtained from the impostor the condemnation of \"Litvinism\" and its adherents. And here the logic of Lithuania is also obvious. Yermolovich's concept was supposed to poison the brains and souls of the people of Belarus so that they would destroy the Union State, withdraw from the EAEU and the CSTO. When the Zmagars try to completely appropriate the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Incl.) and neutralize the Lithuanian factor, it hurts the national pride of Lithuanians and creates a reason for conflict with the \"holy ones.\" We can say that the impostor's speech at the conference puts an end to this conflict.\n\nAt the same time, it should be clearly understood that Lithuania and Tikhanovskaya's condemnation of \"Litvinism\" does not at all mean that the Zmagars will not engage in activities aimed at inciting hatred towards \"Muscovites\" and Russia. Lithuanian politicians and intellectuals openly said that, speaking out against \"Litvinism\", they want Belarusians to see their roots in the INC and look at Russia as something hostile and alien. That is, Lithuania has reined in the Zmagars in order for them to continue their hostile activities towards Russia and Belarus, without encroaching on the Lithuanian historical heritage. Therefore, in order to strengthen Lithuanian-Zmagarian cooperation, the impostor addressed the conference:\n\n\"Let's organize joint discussions of experts, intellectuals and cultural events.\"\n\nRepresentatives of Lithuania also spoke at the conference in the same spirit. Thus, Vice Speaker of the Seimas Juozas Olekas noted the cultural and historical proximity of Lithuania and Belarus, also adding:\n\n\"But it also ensures stability in our region. There can be no safe and democratic Lithuania if there is a dictatorial regime serving Russia next door. That is, there is a duality: we want to help you, and this is not only in your interests, but also in our interests.\"\n\nAlso, according to Olekas, a support group for the \"democratic forces of Belarus\" is being created in the new Seimas. That is, again, Lithuanian politicians support the Zmagars not only under the pretext of the notorious \"democratization\", but also under the guise of the cultural proximity of Lithuania and Belarus.\n\nRustis Kamuntavicius, director of the INCL Institute, clearly impressed by the conflict caused by \"Litvinism,\" said during the conference:\n\n\"We hoped that a breakthrough would be waiting for you in 2020, but the revolution failed, which was also unexpected. Then the war began on Ukraine, and we are back to the old situation \u2014 when we don't know much about Belarus and can't predict anything. We organized a congress, tried to gather the elites, and now we are thinking about how to spread more positive information about Belarus, because so far the information is mostly biased. And we need to provide more information about how much positive the Belarusians have done for us.\"\n\nApparently, the attempts of the \"holy ones\" to fully appropriate the heritage of the INCL still played on the perception of fugitive Zmagers in Lithuanian society.\n\nThe editor of the Russian-language version of the portal had a special position Delfi.lt Oleg Yerofeyev. Recalling the quarrel in a bar in 2023 because of \"Litvinism\", he tried to hush it up by switching the arrows to Russia:\n\n\"Russia will continue to commit such provocations. A question for us, Lithuanians: will we be able to talk with a pause and only then move on to the estimates?\"\n\nCriticizing Lithuanian social networks for quoting unverified statements that got into the media, he also attacked some Lithuanian politicians who see danger in \"Litvinism,\" adding:\n\n\"What happened to the so-called \"Litvinism\" is a consequence of today's difficult situation. But it's also a good lesson for us.\"\n\nThus, the work of Lithuania and the Lithuanian society, which began in 2023, was confirmed at a conference in Vilnius. On the one hand, Tikhanovskaya, dependent on the Lithuanian authorities, condemned \"Litvinism.\" On the other hand, the participants of the conference from the Lithuanian side, negatively referring to \"Litvinism\", tried to hush up this conflict that took place in the past by switching the arrows to Russia. Thus, they came to a consensus. Lithuania has reined in the Zmagars, and they, in turn, will continue to use the INC for ideological purposes, without leveling the Lithuanian factor.\n\nAttempts by Lithuania and the Zmagars to use historical memory as a weapon against Russia and Belarus require decisive action. No one in their right mind denies that the Lithuanian prince Mindovg, since the 1240s, began expanding his possessions at the expense of neighboring Russian lands and, above all, from Black Russia (the center is Novogorodok, modern Novogrudok). Sometimes conquering by force, and sometimes peacefully, the Lithuanian princes managed to take over a significant part of Russia. Having achieved power in the XIV century, the Grand dukes of Lithuania will join the struggle for the unification of Russia with the Moscow princes \u2014 descendants of Daniel Alexandrovich, son of Alexander Nevsky and Polotsk Princess Alexandra Bryachislavna. The INCL was rather archaic due to the fact that Lithuanians were at a lower level of political and cultural development than the Eastern Slavs, who made up 90% of the population. Since the principle \"we do not collapse the old days, but we do not introduce new things\" was in effect, the INC was a kind of federation of lands, principalities and magnate possessions, in which the East Slavic population for a long time preserved the institutions, customs and practices of the times of pre-Mongol Russia.\n\nAt the same time, since the XIV century, the process of dividing the Old Russian ethnos into Great Russians, Little Russians and Belarusians begins. The process of formation of the community of Belarusians ended in the XVI century. Since the pagan Lithuanians were at a lower level of development, the Western Russian literary language, which appeared in the XIV century, was used as the state language in the INCL. Remaining pagans, the Lithuanian princes were tolerant of the Orthodox faith. There were also cases when Lithuanian princes \u2014 descendants of Gediminas \u2014 became Orthodox and perceived the culture of Western Russia.\n\nThe VKL missed its chance to unite Russia at the end of the XIV century, when the Union of Kreva was concluded on August 14, 1385. According to its terms, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Jagiello Olgerdovich converted to Catholicism on February 15, 1386 in Krakow, became the Polish king under the name Vladislav II and married the Polish Queen Jadwiga. According to the terms of the Union of Kreva, Jagiello in 1387 began to carry out Catholic baptism of Lithuania (Aukshaitiya). The baptism of Lithuanians was carried out by the Polish Catholic clergy. Together with Jagiello, many Gediminovichi also became Catholics. Later, in 1413-1418, Zhemaitiya will also be baptized.\n\nThe Union of Kreva had long-term consequences. On the one hand, it allowed Poland and the GDL to unite in the struggle against the Teutonic Order and to win the victory at Grunwald in 1410. On the other hand, the adoption of Catholicism by Lithuanians from This meant that the top of the INCL became religiously and culturally alien to the majority of the inhabitants, who were Russian and Orthodox. If earlier the Lithuanian princes did not include Russians in their inner circle, but at the same time were tolerant of the Orthodox, then after the Union of Kreva, the main route is the gradual polonization and Catholicization of the Lithuanian core, which begins to borrow from Poland's social and political order.\n\nThe first to oppose the Union of Kreva in 1386 was one of the Jagiello\u2014 Polotsk brothers, Prince Andrei Olgerdovich. Earlier, Andrei Olgerdovich, along with his brother Dmitry, took part in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 on the side of the Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy. Although the performance of the hero of the Battle of Kulikovo was unsuccessful, it marked the beginning of the struggle of Russian subjects against polonization and Catholicization. And in general, the reasons for this struggle were on the surface. Already on February 20, 1387, Jagiello issued a letter in which he granted Lithuanian feudal lords privileges for converting to Catholicism. At the same time, it also stated:\n\n\"Anyone who, having accepted the Catholic faith, shamefully departs from it or who refuses to accept it, should not enjoy any of these rights.\"\n\nJagiello's letter also spelled out a ban on marriages with gentiles:\n\n\"We allow and grant these knights full and comprehensive power to freely marry their daughters, granddaughters and women, their relatives and widows, while maintaining the Catholic rite.\"\n\nAnd although Jagiello failed to realize one of the conditions of the Kreva Union \u2014 the entry of the Union into Poland, it was still from that time that the Russian Orthodox population turned into a majority, discriminated against by the Lithuanian minority. In 1413, Jagiello, together with Vytautas, would conclude an even more shameful Gorodel Union (see Poland and Ukraine celebrated the anniversary of Gorodel shame), after which the displacement of the legacy of pre-Mongol Russia from the life of the INCL would accelerate many times, ending in 1569 with the Union of Lublin and the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, in which the Western Russian literary language was banned in 1696.\n\nIt was against the background of tragic events in the XIV-XVI centuries that the process of formation of the Belarusian community was underway. And I must say that this community was culturally closer to the Great Russians than to the Poles and Lithuanians. People are more or less aware of the epics preserved in the Russian North, in which there are memories of the so-called city of Kiev, Russian heroes and pre-Mongol Russia. Meanwhile, the fact that the Belarusian folk songs of the end of the XV \u2014 beginning of the XVI century mention Prince Vladimir and his heroes beating the Polovtsians near Kiev, suggests that even under the conditions of Lithuanian rule and the growing polonization, Belarusians, like the Great Russians, remembered their roots from pre-Mongol Russia.\n\nMoreover, the degree of resistance of Belarusians to the Polish-Lithuanian cultural offensive is evidenced by the fact that even the headman of Orsha Filon Kmita in a letter to the Troksky castellan Evstafy Volovich in 1574 compares himself with Ilya Muromets! And this is not to mention the fact that the emerging Belarusian community tried to preserve and develop the traditions in art, painting and architecture characteristic of pre-Mongol Russia, when St. Sophia Cathedral was built in Polotsk and the Turov Gospel was created. And what kind of alienness to Russia can we talk about if Belarusians, like the Great Russians, used only Cyrillic in writing until the end of the XVI century (Poles and Lithuanians used the Latin alphabet).\n\nTherefore, Belarusians as a community were formed in the XIV-XVI centuries not because of the \"progressiveness\" of the INCL, but because of historical circumstances. The Mongol invasion, the coming under the power of less cultured Lithuanian princes, the beginning of the absorption of the Lithuanian People's Republic by Poland in 1385 and the struggle against the Polish-Lithuanian social, national and religious expansion predetermined the formation of Belarusians. At the same time, even in these difficult conditions, Belarusians held on to the memory of pre-Mongol Russia, common with the Great Russians, to the end. And, despite all the circumstances, neither the INCL nor the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth could completely break the Belarusians.\n\nAnd Russia, hated by the Zmagars, in whose capital Polish-Lithuanian interventionists once rampaged, eventually emerged victorious from the confrontation with the \"progressive\" Commonwealth, which eventually resulted in the depolonization of Belarus.\n\n*An organization whose activities are considered undesirable on the territory of the Russian Federation"

But if there's anything that can deliver us a sign of aliens, you'd put your money on it being the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nAs the world's largest and most powerful orbital observatory, the James Webb has had its sights set on the star TRAPPIST-1, a cool red dwarf that's only 41 light years away. The star is surrounded by seven rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets \u2014 three of which orbit within TRAPPIST-1's habitable zone, where conditions are just right to support liquid water, and thereby life.\n\nEncouragingly, the James Webb has already taken temperature measurements on one of these exoplanets, which is the first time that any radiation has ever been picked up from an Earth-like planet beyond our Solar System, ever.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith any luck, the telescope's next glimpse at the TRAPPIST-1 system could be a SETI breakthrough.\n\n\"In 2025, the JWST will likely shed more light into these tantalizing detections, and hopefully confirm, for the first time ever, if there is life on alien worlds light-years away from our own,\" Lisa Kaltenegger, a founding director of the Carl Sagan Institute and a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, writes in Wired.\n\nUnbearable Lightness\n\nExoplanets are incredibly hard to find \u2014 let alone closely examine \u2014 because they produce virtually no light of their own and get outshined by nearby stars.\n\nCool red dwarfs like TRAPPIST-1 make good study candidates, however, because their light is fairly faint. Still, the challenge remains significant, not least of all because red dwarfs are much more volatile than stable stars like our Sun.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd according to Kaltenegger, the next set of observations astronomers have in mind are going to be a tall order even for the James Webb: studying the composition of the nearby planets' atmosphere.\n\n\"Every time a planet passes between us and its star \u2014 when it transits \u2014 the starlight gets filtered by the planet's atmosphere and hits the molecules in its path, creating spectral absorption features we can search for,\" she explained.\n\n\"The JWST will need to collect enough data from several planetary transits to suppress the signal from the host star and amplify the molecular features in the incredibly thin atmosphere of the rocky exoplanets.\"\n\nBack Up Option\n\nIf astronomers detect the right molecules, it could be an indication of the presence of alien lifeforms. The more likely success scenario is that we confirm that the planet harbors water, which would be an astounding discovery in its own right.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if TRAPPIST-1 lets us down, there's also a tantalizing SETI prospect right in our own Solar System. Jupiter's fourth largest moon Europa is believed to harbor a subsurface ocean many times more voluminous than all the seawater on Earth.\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper space probe, launched this October, is expected to reach the chilly, liquid world by 2030. Once there, it will extensively image Europa and perhaps send us back promising signs of its potential habitability. Or hey: maybe even aliens.\n\nMore on space: Scientists Intrigued by Large Dark Shapes Appearing on Surface of Jupiter"

            "article_content": "The small Mexican mountain town of La Rumorosa is at its most beautiful when the dying sun bathes it in a clean, soft, orange light. Or pink, depending on the day. Whatever color, the landscape seems more innocent. As if nothing disturbing could happen there.\n\nAt that innocent hour, looking for Jaime Maussan Flota Avenue, I come across two ladies out for a walk. They can\u2019t tell me exactly where this avenue is, but they tell me that at night the sky there is clear and star-lit. And that they have seen strange things that could be flying saucers. They say it as if it were the most natural thing in the world because, since the year 2022, La Rumorosa has been the \u201cWorld Capital of the UFO Phenomenon.\u201d This is announced on a sign as you enter this Martian landscape, comprised of desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones, which lie in the Sierra de Juarez, within the state of Baja California, northern Mexico. Until the 1930s, La Rumorosa was hard to get to. The road that now winds its way along the area, dotted with viewpoints offering postcard-worthy vistas for the nostalgic or Instagram-worthy spots for the modern, had not yet been built.\n\nUntil 2022, tourists came to La Rumorosa for the nature, the cave paintings in El Vallecito and the archaeological remains. A striking landmark is the Casa de Piedra or Stone House. It stands near that long winding road that crosses the mountain, and blends with the landscape. It is said to have been inhabited by mobsters, such as Al Capone, and to have been a refuge for revolutionaries.\n\nThere are also several ranches with swimming pools and camping areas free from light pollution, offering a unique chance to enjoy the brilliance of the night sky. Rancho Las Potrancas has a bar, palapas and a barbecue area. And Rancho El Chaparral resembles a water park, with slides and cabins.\n\nBut, since 2022 the Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) area has also been promoted, because many sightings are said to have been made there. There is even an annual international festival \u2014 the World UFO Fest (the next one is from March 21 to 23, 2025) \u2014 for UFO aficionados, which includes talks and seminars with \u201cbioenergetic practices to facilitate contact with the beings of light\u201d or \u201ctesting and vibrational balancing,\u201d according to the website.\n\nPerhaps with an eye on generating more tourist dollars, several streets have been named in this town of less than 2,000 inhabitants in honor of important figures in the field of ufology. One of them was the avenue Jaime Maussan, a journalist and researcher in this field. He went viral in 2023 when he went to Mexico\u2019s Congress to present mummified bodies of what he defined as non-human beings found in Peru. Streets have also been dedicated to Peruvian Sixto Paz Wells and to researcher and television presenter Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.\n\nThe landscape of La Rumorosa resembles Mars with its desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones in the Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez. Daniel Caja (Getty Images)\n\nStill searching for Jaime Maussan Avenue, I enter Dulce Altura, a restaurant and bakery that has those high ceilings in the shape of a sharp isosceles triangle, typical of cold, mountainous regions. Inside, the decoration is modern, with a sculpture of a UFO and three metal aliens. Besides selling delicious bread and sweets, wood-fired pizzas and other dishes, they sell alien-themed magnets, which \u201csell well,\u201d according to the cashiers.\n\nThey tell me how to get to Jaime Maussan Avenue. It is a few hundred meters down the main road that splits the town in two. The avenue is a half-paved street, with patches of dirt and a few simple houses scattered at a distance from one another. The street lacks a sense of care perhaps because the focus is on the sky and on the strange lights captured on video by numerous people over the years.\n\nBut UFO tourism is not only limited to this corner of the world. Perhaps the most famous location for it is Area 51, in America\u2019s Nevada desert, or Roswell in New Mexico, or the Nazca plain in Peru and the town of Capilla del Monte in Argentina \u2014 to mention a few. What is undeniable is that this type of tourism gets people from all over the planet to visit the most unlikely places.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n\n\n"

Even what we call scientific research cannot go beyond it.This is the context in which our spiritual pursuits become important. They ought to be the guides to our scientific discoveries. Through contemplations, human consciousness merges with the undiscovered dimensions, and our reading of the subject gathers depth even when we cannot go beyond a few glimpses of actuality.Interestingly, reality is only a component of factuality or practicality. As we meditate, we may see light which is different from the ordinary light that our optic power captures though they are all integrated. Similarly, even if the object of fragrance is not within the reach of our olfactory capacity, we may smell it once the mind is consolidated through meditation. One of the most beautiful feelings one encounters is about an ethereal love that encompasses entire existence.Our perception of our existence is limited by a number of factors. What we perceive as change may not be so; rather, perfect stability is in existence. And because there is no second existence, what exists is unique. On a scriptural plane, we may recall the war between the goddess and demon brothers, Nisumbha and Shumbha. The latter, in anger, comments that she is using the help of so many powers while they are dealing single-handedly. How is it justified that many would be fighting with one? There she declares, 'ekaibaham jaganmurti ditiya ka mamapara' - I am the only one universe, where is a second reality?When science arrives at the border, philosophy must come forward to expand its horizons, setting a bigger goal to be pursued. This is the only way to avoid saturation and escape the fallacy of limited understanding.Nowadays, we are talking about the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various facets of learning. How about its contribution to discovering what has been treated as a myth? Can it not be used to give tangible shape to our spiritual realisations? After all, the lack of explanation sometimes stigmatises a particular phenomenon as an illusion. With AI's offerings, the gap between scientific probes and spiritual queries can certainly be bridged, and the realisations can provide guidance for new scientific ventures.Theoretical advancements are a must for practical probing. Conjectural evolutions are not innovative if they remain confined to domains of a specific discipline. Insights developed from spiritual realisations can be the most effective monitor for advancing theoretical configurations in science, encouraging further probing with help of AI.As Ramakrishna pointed out, there is no end to spiritual attainments. Work a bit harder, you arrive at a mine; don't reach satiety, walk further and you come across a bigger mine with richer deposits. Likewise, one has to go on - for a true seeker, there is no end to spiritual pursuit.Then there will be no dearth of ideas which can keep enriching our understanding and science will be able to take guidance for newer developments in a continuous manner. Science and spiritualism are not to be seen as two different paths, they are rather an integral part of a gigantic investigation system that human life can conduct."

            "article_content": "Their demand for electricity could drive up prices and slow the transition to clean power sources.\n\nBy Paul Roberts / For The Herald\n\nClimate change is the result of burning fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases which warm the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Turning down Earth\u2019s thermostat requires building a zero-emission clean energy economy. Every increment of warming contributes to extreme weather and climate impacts. Urgency matters.\n\nAcross the globe, governments and utilities are working to reduce emissions, moving away from fossil fuels toward renewable clean energy. As they do, supply and demand for electricity is undergoing radical transformation.\n\nClimate change is adding novel wrinkles to the changing dynamics of energy supply and demand. So, too, is the technology revolution. But the two are on a collision course between artificial intelligence and planetary physics. Real intelligence suggests we yield to planetary physics.\n\nOn the supply side, cost-effective renewable energy sources are rapidly emerging. Solar, wind and nuclear power are experiencing rapid growth and lower costs to produce. These new sources are replacing coal, oil and gas. Washington state enjoys relatively clean energy because of its reliance on hydropower and policy choices supporting renewable sources such as wind and solar.\n\nChallenges on the supply side include battery storage, permitting of projects, and modernizing the electrical grid.\n\nRenewable sources such as wind and solar produce electricity only when the wind blows or the sun shines. Utilities are developing battery storage options that can capture and release energy to meet fluctuating demands.\n\nPermitting renewable energy can be complex and uncertain, adding time and costs to projects. Nuclear plants are particularly time consuming and expensive to design, permit and build.\n\nUpgrading the power grid is a key factor effecting energy supply. Renewable energy such as wind and solar needs to be connected to the grid to deliver energy where and when it is needed. Surges in winter and summer demand could outpace supply within the next decade. The capacity of today\u2019s grid is not sufficient to meet tomorrow\u2019s needs.\n\nDeveloping new renewable energy sources, battery storage and upgrading the grid is expensive and takes time. Additional capital resources will be necessary. Projects in the planning stages today will not likely be on line until the 2030s.\n\nOn the demand side the goal posts are moving. Energy demand forecasts made just a few years no longer reflect current demand. New demand has surged, responding to reducing emissions and the technology revolution: AI and IT, artificial intelligence and internet technology.\n\nClimate change is increasing electricity demand for transportation, EVs, air conditioning and related clean energy initiatives. Utilities are trying to meet these new demands with renewables thereby reducing emissions.\n\nBut the real game changer is the technology revolution. There is an explosion in new energy demand resulting from data centers that have powered the growth of AI and IT. These centers consume enormous amounts of electricity to power servers and to cool them, disposing of the considerable heat they generate.\n\nGrowth projections for AI and IT are literally off the charts. They apply to all sectors: business, government, education, medicine, science and in our homes. The internet of things is driving the technology revolution. Every text message, iPhone photo, Amazon delivery, Zoom call and YouTube video depend on data stored in a data center; forever!\n\nAll that data use and storage is driving the explosion in data centers. It is not clear just how big, how fast and how long new growth for data centers will be. What is clear is major tech companies including Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon are investing heavily in AI and the data centers necessary to power it. They clearly see this as their future.\n\nAs spikes in energy demand exceed projected supply, two results are likely. First, the law of supply and demand will increase rates, affecting energy costs for everyone. Second, utilities trying to meet increased demand face pressure to go slow converting to renewable sources of energy, or revert back to electricity generated from fossil fuels such as gas or coal. In either case this will result in increased emissions. Neither of these outcomes are desirable.\n\nWe are entering a revolutionary time for energy and technology. A stable atmosphere depends on transitioning to a clean energy economy. The technology revolution depends on an energy supply that does not yet exist.\n\nAI and IT are supposed to help solve problems. If their applications make global warming worse, we are on a fool\u2019s errand. These trends are not sustainable. It turns out Siri, Alexa and ChatGPT are expensive house guests. Let\u2019s hope they have real answers for these difficult questions.\n\nPaul Roberts is retired and lives in Everett. His career spans over five decades in infrastructure, economics and environmental policy including advising Washington cities on climate change and past Chair of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency Board of Directors.\n\nEco-nomics\n\n\u201cEco-nomics\u201d is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics. Climate change (global warming) is caused by greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 carbon dioxide and methane chiefly \u2014 generated by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Global warming poses an existential threat to the planet. Successfully responding to this threat requires urgent actions \u2014 clear plans and actionable strategies \u2014 to rapidly reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate-influenced events.\n\nThe Eco-nomics series focuses on mitigation and adaptation strategies viewed through the twin perspectives of science and economics.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has moved at warp speed to nominate people to serve in his Cabinet and other important government posts who have chosen loyalty to him as their most important virtue , making a mockery of merit even as the nominees claim to uphold meritocracy .\n\nMoreover, like Trump himself, his nominees denigrate science and scientific expertise, subscribe to conspiracy theories , are eager to impose litmus tests in the arts and education, and seem hostile to the world beyond America\u2019s borders .\n\nElections have consequences, so the saying goes.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough to remind us that elections have consequences, the president-elect announced that on the first day of his administration, he will order a mass deportation of millions of immigrants and impose stiff tariffs on this nation\u2019s most important trading partners.\n\nWhile much of the post-election commentary has focused on its implications for American democracy , there is another side to what will unfold starting on Jan. 20. When he takes office, Trump, who promised to Make America Great Again, seems determined to lead America into a period of scientific, cultural, educational, and global retrenchment, which collectively might be called the new \u201cDark Ages.\u201d\n\nSome see Trump as reviving the so-called Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , an era of great prosperity as well as technological and industrial growth. It was an era dominated by corrupt \"captains of industry\" or \"robber barons\" whose corrupting influence also extended to government and politics.\n\nHowever, leaders in the Gilded Age did not reject science and rationality . Quite the contrary, they embraced both because they saw them as essential to the growth of capitalism. And they invested in culture and the arts, rather than trying to make them hue to a particular orthodoxy.\n\nRelated Donald Trump is not even bothering to hide the corruption this time\n\nYes, Trump\u2019s era may ultimately have some attributes of the Gilded Age, I think it will be much worse.\n\nTrump and his MAGA followers reject the cultural legacy of the people who founded this nation. The people who led the American Revolution and wrote the Constitution were , deeply impressed by \u201cthe seventeenth-century Scientific Revolution and its emphasis on empiricism, objective observation, and using rationality over faith or tradition as the foundations of truthful knowledge.\u201d\n\nThey founded \u201can Enlightenment country\u201d and borrowed from the Enlightenment hostility toward the \u201chierarchically ordered societies of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe president-elect seems determined to end all that.\n\nIn 2017, Suzanne Nossel, the CEO of the writers group PEN America, warned of Trump\u2019s \u201crepudiation of the American ideals \u2014 grounded in the Enlightenment \u2014 of self-expression, knowledge, dissent, criticism, and truth.\u201d What Nossel predicted then seems even more apt today.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign and transition period, Trump and his cronies have broadcast their determination \u201cto entrench within the machinery of the U.S. government\u2026 elemental disdain for intellectuals, analysts, and experts.\u201d They regularly denigrate rationality and elevate superstition, tradition, and hierarchy.\n\nI call their program a recipe for the return of the \"Dark Ages.\"\n\nThough the term is now much disputed , the phrase \u201cDark Ages\u201d is used by some historians to describe a \u201c\u2019 period of intellectual depression in Europe from\u2026 the fifth century to the revival of learning about the beginning of the fifteenth\u2026.\u2019\u201d During that time, Europe experienced \u201ca decline in culture (and) learning\u2026. and a shift towards a feudal society with limited literacy and widespread superstition.\u201d\n\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\n\nPetrarch, an Italian scholar who lived from 1304 to 1374 , described the time when he lived as an era of \u201cdarkness and dense gloom.\u201d As he put it, \u201cMy fate is to live among varied and confusing storms\u201d and to experience the \u201csleep of forgetfulness.\u201d\n\nThe era that Petrarch described was also marked by a deep skepticism about science and rationality, a personalistic form of politics marked by a clear division between \u201clords\u201d and vassals,\u201d religious domination over culture, and the collapse of trade networks among European nations.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nLet\u2019s start with Trump\u2018s threat to impose stiff tariffs on goods coming into this country from Canada, Mexico, and China. As he put it in a Truth Social post, \u201cOn January 20th\u2026 I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States.\u201d\n\nThis is no small matter. Reuters reports that \u201cThe U.S. accounted for more than 83% of exports from Mexico in 2023 and 75% of Canadian exports\u201d and that \u201cTrump's threatened new tariffs would appear to violate the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade\u201d which guaranteed \u201clargely duty-free trade between the three countries.\u201d\n\nThe president-elect also threatened China, promising the Chinese \u201can additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Trump follows through on his threats, they immediately sent shock waves through our trade networks and promise to ignite trade wars as countries respond to Trump\u2019s tariffs by imposing their own tariffs.\n\nAs Reuters notes , \u201cTrump's overall tariff plans\u2026 would push U.S. import duties back up to 1930s levels, stoke inflation, collapse U.S.-China trade, draw retaliation, and drastically reorder supply chains.\u201d That would put the Dark Ages monarchs of Europe to shame.\n\nIf that is not enough to capture the Dark Ages vibe, consider what the new administration will do to education, the arts, and science.\n\nOn education, the incoming Trump Administration hopes to give free rein to \u201can army of far-right Christians\u201d and attack \u201cthe very foundations of free, secular education.\u201d Last week, Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s nominee for Defense Secretary, called for \u201can \u2018educational insurgency\u2019 where \u2018you build your army underground\" of children, so they can grow up to be the next generation of fundamentalist culture warriors.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the arts, Trump\u2019s first term was something of a disaster. As Judy Berman, television critic for Time, explained, \u201cthe arts and entertainment\u2026suffered mightily as Trump held court in the White House\u2026.(H)is policies\u2026made it harder to subsist as a creative professional\u2026as he lashed out at the arts and their practitioners.\u201d\n\nMore damaging, she argued, were Trump\u2019s \u201crepeated attempts to defund already-strapped federal arts organizations such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which helps fund PBS and NPR) and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric, Berman concluded, \u201cintensified an enmity between the arts community and the right\u2026 that dates back to Reagan-era censorship of transgressive artists\u2026Put simply: Donald Trump was bad for art.\u201d\n\nNow, the country is facing \u201cfour more years of antagonist cultural policy (and the outright antagonism of people and places that do not align with Trump\u2019s values).\u201d\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer?

Kennedy, Jr., Trump\u2019s nominee for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. Among other things, he has spoken out against \u201cvaccines that have saved millions of lives.\u201d Showing his conspiratorial bone fides, Kennedy claims that \u201cthe COVID-19 virus was targeted so that Chinese and Jewish people are more immune.\u201d And he has not just targeted the COVID vaccine.\n\nKennedy and his allies in the incoming administration are deeply suspicious of \u201cexpert authority,\u201d which they claim \u201chides elite power.\u201d That is why US News predicts that they will lead \u201ca radical antiestablishment medical movement with roots in past centuries\u2026 threatening the achievements of a science-based public health order painstakingly built since World War II.\u201d\n\nAnd if Kennedy is confirmed, he will have plenty of company in doing Trump\u2019s bidding by pushing this country toward a new Dark Ages in medicine, health care, scientific research, education, and the arts. To avoid that fate, we must mount sustained and effective resistance in each of those domains."
