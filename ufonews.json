            "article_content": "Australians have looked at the skies around southeast Queensland with awe after a giant UFO appeared to descend from the heavens.\n\nIt was, in fact, a storm cell - though images show its uncanny shape that eerily resembles a flying saucer.\n\n'We received several pics of this really cool UFO looking storm this morning. This is a lenticular storm cloud and its not that common to see,' Higgins Storm Chasing wrote to their Facebook page on Thursday morning.\n\nThe weather page explained the cloud formation was a hailstorm that was moving across the Darling Downs towards Oakey and north of Toowoomba around sunrise with the light from the early morning sun 'helping ignite the eastern side of the storm, turning it pink and orange'.\n\nCommenters on the post said the phenomenon was a particularly impressive display from nature and said that 'our sky never fails to be amazing'.\n\n'You can see the ''Beam me up Scotty'' rays,' one said.\n\n'Omg! Thankyou for sharing this storm cell is it so stunning,' said a second.\n\n'Who needs drones and aliens when you can have this in the sky,' added a third.\n\nA hailstorm in southeast Queensland at sunrise on Thursday formed this spectacular cloud formation that some mistook for a 'UFO'\n\nIt is actually a lenticular cloud which can often form smooth circular shapes\n\nThe spectacular display follows a similar 'spaceship' cloud appearing in Sydney.\n\nThe bizarre natural phenomenon formed over the ocean in Cronulla, in Sydney's southern suburbs, with many sharing snaps and videos of the cloud to social media.\n\nBut Weatherzone meteorologist Felix Levesque assured Daily Mail Australia the strange cloud was nothing to be worried about.\n\nSome guessed the 'spaceship' was a lenticular cloud, which the forecaster said is formed when moist winds are forced over a barrier, such as a mountain.\n\n'This rising motion over the barrier causes the air to cool and condense into a stationary cloud,' Mr Levesque explained.\n\n'This stationary cloud will have a smooth oval appearance, hence why it's often mistaken as a UFO.'\n\nSome said they could see the 'beam me up Scotty' rays, referring to Star Trek\n\nResidents of Cronulla in Sydney's south were shocked by the unusual appearance of a cloud formation that resembled a spaceship in December\n\nMr Levesque said the Cronulla cloud was in fact a roll cloud, a different species to the lenticular cloud which is caused by a similar process.\n\n'Roll clouds form when a cooler, denser airmass pushes under another airmass, causing this rising and 'rolling' motion on the leading edge of the airmass \u2013 hence the name,' he continued.\n\n'Southerly busters, like on Tuesday, can bring roll clouds, and these can occur about three to five times a year in Sydney.'\n\n'A common location for roll clouds is over the Gulf of Carpentaria \u2013 so common it's been given the name Morning Glory Cloud', Mr Levesque said."

Another company is Razer, which has only gone so far as creating Android handhelds like the Razer Edge, or controllers for phones like the Razer Kishi.\n\nBut even if Alienware isn't alone, it's an especially fascinating case considering the company showcased a handheld gaming prototype all the way back in 2020, making it five years now since we've seen the Alienware UFO.\n\nCredit: Future\n\nDuring CES 2020, we were blown away by Alienware's Concept UFO, as the device promised to let gamers play PC games from the comfort of a handheld device. To be clear, this was two years prior even the Steam Deck was announced back in January 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Turchin, who's currently Dell Director of Product Development, but at the time of the Alienware Concept UFO's unveiling was Dell Director of Engineering, claimed \"We actually view [the UFO] as the first of its kind.\" He continues \u201cWhen we look at the balance that we've achieved between performance and portability it does allow [us] to have a product that we view can be potentially viable in the market looking forward.\"\n\nTurchin was correct, as he predicted the explosive growth in popularity that handheld gaming PCs would see in the years to come.\n\nAt the time of the Alienware UFO Concept, Dell Consumer Product Reviews Manager, Raymond Watkins, claimed \"We want to take it further, and how it's received at CES I think will help shape that conversation.\" He later said \"If we got a thumbs up today I don't think it'd be eighteen months for us to get it on the shelves.\" Watkins is now Senior Manager of Marketing at AMD.\n\nOf course, the Alienware UFO never got off the ground. Eighteen months went by without any updates on its existence, and three and a half years after CES 2020, the Asus ROG Ally launched in June 2023.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what about now? Alienware just unveiled all of its CES 2025 announcements, and the Alienware UFO was nowhere to be seen. It's been five years now, but Alienware still hasn't brought the UFO back. So what gives?\n\nCredit: Future\n\nJackie Thomas at IGN asked General Manager of Alienware, Matt McGowan, why the company has no handheld. McGowan claims that \"We're continuing to look at that category,\" but he claims \"there are deficiencies,\" specifically highlighting battery life and the want for better graphics. He claims \"When that inflection point comes, we want to be there.\"\n\nIt seems as if the UFO wasn't good enough to match the company's standards, and even now, the technology isn't at a strong enough point to satisfy Alienware. Hopefully that will change in the next few years, but at the very least, lots of exciting developments are happening from companies like Asus, Lenovo, Acer, and more.\n\nAlienware has a chance to monitor the market, learn from the mistakes of its competitors, and then swoop in with the ultimate gaming handheld when the time is right. Until then, be sure to check out more of our CES 2025 coverage to get the latest on all things tech."

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "There's some positive news in advanced battery science thanks to hydrogen ions, or protons.\n\nThese positively charged particles can work inside a power pack to carry energy, similar to lithium ions but sans the expensive supply chain and invasive mining needed to gather the metal, according to a lab report from Australia's UNSW Sydney.\n\nA linchpin to the invention is the development of an organic anode material called tetraamino-benzoquinone, or TABQ, which can store the protons.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen batteries operate, ions move between the anode and cathode through a substance called electrolyte.\n\n\"Using this material, we successfully built an all-organic proton battery that is effective at both room temperature and sub-zero freezing temperatures,\" professor Chuan Zhao said.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are effective and cleaner than dirty fuels. When powering an electric vehicle, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that the rides are cleaner during their lifespans than gas cars, even when considering the costly and dirty supply chain for the hard-to-gather power pack parts.\n\nBut alternatives, from potassium to salt, sometimes have cheaper, safer, and even better-performing potential in greater temperature ranges.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing hydrogen ions is among the latest innovations from an expert lab. The UNSW Sydney team touted its tech as addressing fast charge and even safety concerns; lithium-ion packs are susceptible to rare yet serious fire risks.\n\n\"To enhance the usage of renewable energies, we have to develop some more efficient energy integration technologies and our proton battery design is a promising trial,\" doctoral candidate Sicheng Wu, who helped to develop TABQ, said.\n\nShould the U.S. invest more in battery innovations?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nTABQ was found in testing to support \"rapid proton movement using hydrogen-bond networks.\" The motion bodes well for energy density, or storage capacity per pound, as well as power output.\n\nThe anode research started with tetrachloro-benzoquinone, or TCBQ, according to the experts. The team modified some of its chemistry to create the useful TABQ anode. They combined it with a TCBQ cathode, garnering great results. The battery is reported to be able to last for 3,500 charge-discharge cycles and is well-suited for renewable energy storage, per the experts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cost savings are set to be realized as the concept is commercialized.\n\n\"If you just look at the TABQ material that we have designed, it's not necessarily cheap to produce at the moment,\" Zhao said. \"But because it's made of abundant light elements, it will be easy and affordable to eventually scale up.\"\n\nStoring intermittent energy from the sun, wind, and waves is necessary to transition to a cleaner power system, a switch already well underway. In the United States, renewables generate more than 20% of electricity, according to the government. Leveling off and reducing planet-warming fumes impacts our future in many ways, including education. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed overheating and other concerns in a fact sheet about the climate and young learners.\n\nCooling things down can start at home with some simple changes. Unplugging unused chargers and devices can prevent air pollution and save you upward of $165 a year, as one example.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt UNSW Sydney, the team said its hydrogen-ion battery can also provide a way to ship hydrogen as stored protons, an improvement on other more difficult transport methods.\n\n\"Our discovery has made this concept a possible reality,\" Zhao said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Despite its upbeat subtitle, How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science, David Sobel\u2019s widely praised new study of Marie Curie and the 45 women who worked in her laboratory reveals the persistent bias, discouragement and institutional barriers that marginalized these pioneering women scientists.\n\nRather than illustrating a clear path to gender equity in science, Sobel\u2019s work reveals how systemic discrimination continued to thwart their progress, despite their significant contributions to groundbreaking research.\n\nIn her 2023 study, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Kate Zernike illustrates the entrenched sexism that persisted in science to the end of the 20th century. As recently as 1999, even the most accomplished women in fields like molecular genetics, geology, neuroscience and cancer research were routinely denied the recognition and resources granted to their less qualified male colleagues.\n\nZernike demonstrates that it was only through persistent advocacy and fighting against these discriminatory practices that these women began to chip away at the pervasive sexism of elite scientific institutions. Their struggle not only brought attention to the inequities they faced but also helped pave the way for future generations of women in science, slowly transforming the landscape of an often exclusionary and hierarchical system.\n\nThe history of women in science is littered with examples of women whose contributions were either minimized or outright attributed to male colleagues. The historian of science Margaret W. Rossiter termed this the \u201cMatilda effect\u201d\u2014the systematic tendency to downplay or erase women\u2019s contributions to scientific discoveries, with credit often being given to their male colleagues instead.\n\nNettie Stevens made groundbreaking discoveries about sex determination in 1905, demonstrating that sex is determined by chromosomes\u2014specifically the XY system. However, her male colleague Edmund Beecher Wilson received much of the credit for this work. Despite Stevens\u2019s foundational contributions to genetics, her role was overshadowed, illustrating how women\u2019s scientific achievements have often been attributed to men.\n\nLise Meitner, a physicist who played an essential role in the discovery of nuclear fission, similarly saw her contributions minimized. While her theoretical work provided crucial insights into nuclear reactions, it was her colleague Otto Hahn who received the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Meitner\u2019s exclusion from the prize, despite her significant contributions, reveals how systemic bias has long denied women their due recognition in science.\n\nIn a similar case, Chien-Shiung Wu, a Chinese American physicist, conducted a pivotal experiment that disproved the conservation of parity, a fundamental law of physics. Wu\u2019s experimental findings were crucial in confirming the theoretical work of Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, who went on to receive the Nobel Prize in 1957. Despite Wu\u2019s central role, she was not included in the Nobel honors, reflecting the pervasive bias against acknowledging women\u2019s contributions.\n\nThe field of bacterial genetics also saw women\u2019s contributions marginalized. Esther Lederberg made important discoveries, including the identification of lambda phage, a virus that infects bacteria, and the development of the replica plating technique, which revolutionized bacterial research. Nevertheless, her then-husband, Joshua Lederberg, was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, while her critical contributions were minimized.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of the Matilda effect is Rosalind Franklin, whose work on X-ray diffraction was crucial in elucidating the structure of DNA. However, James Watson and Francis Crick received most of the credit, culminating in the 1962 Nobel Prize. Franklin\u2019s role was largely overlooked until later historical reappraisals recognized the depth of her contributions to one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century.\n\nAnother telling case is that of Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who as a graduate student in 1967 discovered pulsars, a type of rotating neutron star. Her supervisor, Antony Hewish, received the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery, with Bell Burnell\u2019s pivotal role in the research going largely unacknowledged.\n\nThese stories illustrate the systemic barriers that have historically marginalized women in science. Misogyny in the scientific community manifests not only in denying women opportunities but also in rewriting the narrative of discovery to exclude or downplay their achievements. Addressing this bias requires an ongoing effort to reshape how scientific recognition is awarded, ensuring that all contributors are fairly acknowledged.\n\nThe underrepresentation and marginalization of women in science are not merely byproducts of personal gender bias but are deeply embedded within the structures, cultures and systems that govern the scientific community itself.\n\nHistorian Margaret Rossiter\u2019s three-volume Women Scientists in America explores how systemic sexism has historically shaped the landscape of science. She recounts the overlooked stories of women scientists whose contributions were either erased or downplayed, revealing patterns of institutionalized misogyny that extend beyond individual prejudice. This institutionalized bias encompasses educational barriers, discriminatory hiring practices, exclusion from professional networks and credit denial.\n\nRossiter shows that cultural narratives suggested women were biologically unsuited for scientific careers or that they would eventually prioritize family over work. However, misogyny went beyond cultural narratives. Women were often denied access to advanced education and academic appointments, restricted to subordinate roles such as laboratory assistants and excluded from leadership positions. These practices were reinforced through discriminatory tenure and promotion practices, where women were often denied career advancement even when their research output equaled or surpassed that of their male peers.\n\nKey mechanisms of this institutionalized misogyny include:\n\nInvisible barriers that discouraged women from pursuing advanced education and research roles through societal expectations of gender roles.\n\nCredit denial, where women scientists frequently found their contributions minimized or attributed to male colleagues, reinforcing the myth of women\u2019s inferiority in scientific innovation.\n\nInstitutional exclusion from the informal male networks that enabled men to advance their careers through mentorship, collaborations and opportunities from which women were excluded.\n\nSocial and professional isolation in male-dominated cultures in scientific institutions that left women without supportive peer communities, further hindering their career advancement.\n\nTokenism, where women scientists were viewed as exceptions, expected to conform to male norms rather than being seen as equal contributors in their fields.\n\nRossiter\u2019s research reveals that misogyny in science is the result of both overt discrimination and deeply entrenched cultural and institutional practices that perpetuate gender hierarchies.\n\nThe concept of systemic misogyny challenges the idea that science is purely meritocratic and objective. Although science is often portrayed as a field where talent and hard work dictate success, it has long been shaped by institutional and cultural biases that have disproportionately favored white men over women and marginalized groups.\n\nAcknowledging these systemic biases requires rethinking the history and practice of science, a shift that often sparks resistance. Many view science as an arena of merit, and questioning how gender bias has influenced scientific recognition and resource distribution raises uncomfortable questions about what constitutes achievement in science. If key contributions have been overlooked or misattributed, it forces us to reconsider how success and excellence in science have been defined and challenges the historical record of discovery. Recognizing these biases can feel like an attack on the integrity of science itself.\n\nHowever, addressing systemic bias is not about discrediting past achievements. Rather, it\u2019s about recognizing the structural inequities that have marginalized women and prevented them from receiving due credit for their work. Only by acknowledging and dismantling these institutional barriers can the scientific community create a more inclusive environment where merit, not gender, determines success. This shift is essential to ensuring that future generations of scientists, regardless of gender, have equal opportunities to contribute to and shape the future of science.\n\nThe recent revelations of fraudulent scientific research, particularly in studies of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer, have shaken public trust in the scientific community. These incidents expose underlying issues within the culture of science that go beyond isolated cases of misconduct. While it is easy to point to individual bad actors, the problem appears to be more systemic, involving distorted incentives, pressure to publish and gaps in the peer review process.\n\nScience, ideally, is rooted in objectivity, rigor and self-correction. Yet, the reality is that scientific research occurs within a competitive environment that prioritizes publication in high-impact journals, securing funding and advancing one\u2019s career. These pressures can push researchers toward unethical behavior, such as manipulating data or misrepresenting findings, in order to meet their expectations.\n\nOne of the major factors contributing to this problem is the publish-or-perish culture. Under constant pressure to produce significant, novel results, this can lead researchers to cherry-pick data or fabricate results to meet those demands. The incentive structure in science often rewards breakthroughs over incremental progress, leading some to take shortcuts or manipulate results to present more groundbreaking findings. Additionally, securing grants often requires presenting promising or positive outcomes, further incentivizing researchers to skew their data.\n\nThe peer-review system, designed to be a safeguard for ensuring the validity of scientific work, is not without its flaws. While peer review does catch some issues, it can be inadequate in thoroughly verifying data integrity or identifying fraudulent practices. Peer reviewers, often overburdened and undercompensated, may not have the time or resources to deeply investigate the data or methodologies presented in a paper. Moreover, peer review tends to rely on trust and assumes that researchers are reporting their findings honestly, making it challenging to detect fraudulent work unless whistle-blowers or postpublication scrutiny reveal discrepancies.\n\nThese systemic issues within the culture of science highlight the need for reforms that go beyond individual accountability. Solutions could include implementing more rigorous checks in the peer-review process, creating systems that promote transparency and data sharing and revisiting the incentive structures in scientific research to prioritize integrity and reproducibility over sensationalism and careerism. Funding bodies and academic institutions could also play a role by fostering a culture that values long-term, incremental progress and discourages the pressure to publish flashy, groundbreaking results at any cost.\n\nThe cases of fraudulent research remind us that while science has the tools for self-correction, those mechanisms must be strengthened to protect the integrity of research, especially in areas as critical as dementia and cancer treatment. Ultimately, addressing the deeper structural issues that encourage unethical behavior is key to restoring trust in scientific research.\n\nThe revelations about systemic and structural bias in science\u2014whether related to gender, race or class\u2014are part of a much broader reckoning with history. As we confront past injustices and inequalities, it\u2019s natural to ask whether we should repudiate this history entirely or find more nuanced ways to engage with it. Clearly, we must call out past evils, but this does not necessarily require a wholesale repudiation of scientific progress.\n\nInstead, these revelations offer an opportunity for a more constructive dialogue\u2014one that allows us to learn from our mistakes while appreciating the complexity of progress. Recognizing bias in science doesn\u2019t discredit scientific achievements as a whole, but it does demand an honest acknowledgment of how those achievements unfolded within exclusionary frameworks. The exclusion of women and people of color from the scientific canon does not invalidate scientific discoveries but reminds us that these accomplishments came at the cost of marginalizing others.\n\nOne of the most productive ways to engage with these historical injustices is by treating history as a teaching tool. Rather than rejecting the past, we can examine how bias shaped institutions and knowledge systems. This perspective helps identify and dismantle ongoing inequalities. For example, understanding how structural sexism marginalized women in science can guide efforts to create more inclusive environments in today\u2019s academy.\n\nHistory is not static; our interpretations evolve as new information comes to light. Scientific figures who were once celebrated for their discoveries are now understood within a more complex context, one that reveals the societal and structural forces that shaped their successes while excluding others. This evolving understanding helps us refine our values and institutions without erasing the positive contributions that were made.\n\nInstead of repudiating the past, we can focus on reconciliation. This involves not just acknowledging historical wrongs but taking active steps to address present-day inequities. In science, this might mean increasing diversity, fostering mentorship for underrepresented groups and ensuring access to research and discovery for a wider range of people. Addressing historical injustices can create a more inclusive and innovative scientific community for the future.\n\nThe German-Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin, in his 1940 Theses on the Philosophy of History, argued that one of history\u2019s essential functions is to \u201credeem the past.\u201d He believed history must rescue and give meaning to the voices of the oppressed, those silenced by dominant narratives of progress and power. Benjamin\u2019s metaphor of the \u201cAngel of History\u201d reflects this: As the angel is blown into the future, it helplessly faces the wreckage of the past\u2014symbolizing the devastation and suffering often erased by histories of triumph.\n\nRedeeming the past means confronting the unfinished business of historical wrongs and recognizing how they shape the present. By facing these historical injustices directly, we don\u2019t discredit the past, but rather enrich it with a fuller understanding\u2014ensuring that progress is built on a foundation of truth and inclusivity."

            "article_content": "ABOVE: A newly discovered type of cartilage tissue makes tips of noses and ears bouncy and pliable. The fat-laden cells in this tissue are like individual bubbles in bubble wrap. \u00a9iStock, ediebloom\n\nThe smooth functioning of the body\u2019s joints, the flexibility of the ears and nose, and the shaping of bones are all made possible by the skeletal tissue known as cartilage.1 According to popular medical textbooks, cartilage is made up of only one type of specialized cell called a chondrocyte, which is small and secretes large quantities of extracellular matrix, giving cartilage its biomechanical properties.2 But now, new research makes these textbooks outdated.\n\nMore than a decade ago, while studying fat cells in the mouse ear skin, Maksim Plikus and his colleagues observed a puzzling pattern in dye uptake. \u201cThere were some fat cells that stained, which were the true adipocytes,\u201d said Plikus, a developmental biologist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThen there was another group of fat cells that didn't [stain], no matter which marker.\u201d Initially, he thought these odd adipocytes could simply be a type that stubbornly resisted dyes. However, upon digging deeper, Plikus realized that they were a completely new type of fat-laden cartilage cells that formed the pliable lipo-cartilage in body parts like the nose, ear and throat. \u201cAt first we really had to pinch ourselves because it made no sense,\u201d Plikus exclaimed.\n\nThey called these newly-identified cells lipochondrocytes (LCs), and after a decade of investigation into their structure and function, the team published their report today in Science.3 These findings will expand the current understanding of skeletal biomechanics and open new avenues in regenerative medicine.\n\n\u201cThis is ground-breaking research,\u201d said Mark\u00e9ta Kauck\u00e1, a developmental biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThey found that the cells have different morphology, gene expression profiles, functions, and biomechanical properties. It really is a new cell type.\u201d\n\nResearchers have discovered a new type of cartilage cell called lipo-chondrocyte, that is filled with large fat droplets (shown here in green) and is found in many mammalian species. Maksim Plikus, University of California, Irvine\n\nDespite its prevalence in the body, researchers have overlooked LCs and lipo-cartilage for many decades. Lipochondrocytes were first observed in 1854 by Franz Leydig in rat ear cartilage and then largely forgotten for nearly a century.4 Even research groups that stumbled upon the cells later did not study them or the tissue in detail.5 So, when Plikus and his team came across these cells that looked like fat cells but were present in the cartilage, they knew they had to examine them from every possible angle.\n\nThe authors started by cataloging the presence of LCs in the mouse body. Using different genetic drivers, they identified LCs in the cartilage of the nose, larynx, sternum, and ear. Upon tracking the growth of LCs through development, the team found that these cells live for a long time and have limited turnover. LCs were even present in the nose and ears of aged mice.\n\nDepending on the location, the stiffness and pliability of cartilage varies. The team wanted to understand how the lipid vacuoles inside LCs modified these biomechanical properties of lipo-cartilage. After collecting lipo-cartilage, knee cartilage, and groin adipose tissue from one-month old mice, the researchers used different tests to measure how easily the tissue deformed and how much stress it could withstand. They observed that lipo-cartilage had a greater ability to resist tearing and deformation than adipose tissue but was less stiff than knee cartilage. This ability of lipo-cartilage to spring back to its original structure is what gives the ear and tip of nose their bounciness.\n\n\u201cLipochondrocytes are like the bubbles in bubble wrap,\u201d Plikus explained. \u201cIf you make a tissue out of the bouncy, non-compressible liquid-filled balloons, you will have elastic properties arising with analogy to the bubble wrap.\u201d When the team stripped LCs of the lipid vacuoles, the tissue became more rigid than normal lipo-cartilage and similar in biomechanical properties to the matrix-rich knee cartilage.\n\n\u201cThis will expand our understanding of skeletal biomechanics. Right now, people only think about the matrix,\u201d Plikus said. \u201cBut in lipo-cartilage, biomechanics derive from the organelles inside of the cells, not from the extracellular matrix. And that is paradigm shifting.\u201d\n\nWhile LCs looked like adipocytes, whole-tissue lipidomics performed on ear lipo-cartilage and groin adipose tissue revealed that the composition of the different fats varied between the two cell types. Adipocytes absorb and accumulate dietary fat molecules to feed their fat vacuoles, while Plikus observed that LCs had a relatively higher concentration of saturated fatty acid chains, which are produced during de novo lipogenesis, when carbohydrates are converted into lipids. When the team analyzed the levels of various genes in these cells, they noticed that, unlike adipocytes, LCs either did not express or expressed only low levels of genes encoding proteins responsible for transporting fatty acids into cells. Instead, the cells expressed genes involved in glucose transport, de novo lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis, strongly indicating that LCs produce their own fat vacuoles.\n\nAdipocytes can swell up or shrink down based on the available dietary fats. Since LCs did not express the genes to absorb external lipids, Plikus and his team were curious about their fate in the face of dietary fluctuations. They tested groups of mice on one of three different diets: a normal diet, a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, or a restricted-calories diet for 72 hours. While the animals\u2019 weight and fat tissue showed the expected increase or decrease based on the diet, the size of the ears and the lipid vacuoles in the ear LCs remained unchanged. When the team injected the mice with fatty acids labeled with a fluorescent marker, they found no accumulation in the LCs.\n\n\u201cIt's really brilliant how these mechanisms could be decoupled from the normal systemic lipid production and metabolism,\u201d Kauck\u00e1 said. \u201cYou don't want the locations which are in the ear and in the larynx to swell and enlarge when there\u2019s an influx of excess calories.\u201d\n\nRaul Ramos and Maksim Plikus, developmental biologists at the University of California, Irvine, discovered and characterized the lipo-cartilage tissue. Ethan Perez, University of California, Irvine\n\nFinally, Plikus wanted to know if lipo-cartilage is present in other species too. The team first examined human fetal cartilage at gestational week 20 to 21 and observed numerous lipid vacuoles in the ear, nose, thyroid, and epiglottal cartilage tissue. They also noted fat droplets in the cartilage organoids that they generated from human embryonic stem cells. RNA sequencing revealed that the cartilage organoids expressed de novo lipogenesis genes, but not fatty acid uptake genes.\n\nExpanding their study, the authors examined 65 other mammalian species and observed lipo-cartilage in many of them. \u201cThis makes a lot of sense. Mammals underwent a lot of adaptations and have novelties like the outer ear and the flexible tip of the nose,\u201d said Kauck\u00e1. \u201cThese are all locations which correlate with the presence of lipocartilage.\u201d Notably, the team found lipid-filled cartilage cells in species with thin, membranous ears, such as bats, suggesting a role for these cells in sound perception. The team did not identify lipo-cartilage in any of the non-mammalian species they tested.\n\nNext, Plikus plans to expand this research in several directions. Unlike LCs, when lipid droplets accumulate in chondrocytes within joints, these cells become sick, resulting in osteoarthritis. A deeper understanding of how LCs manage to stay healthy can aid the development of novel treatments for the disease. He also plans to use lipid vacuoles as biomarkers for purifying cartilage grown from patient cells and morphing them into desired shapes to advance regenerative medicine and surgeries such as rhinoplasties. Lastly, Plikus is curious to find out when lipo-cartilage evolved. As for Kauck\u00e1, she is curious how lipo-cartilage contributes to shaping facial features and why LCs and this fat-filled skeletal tissue seem to be restricted to mammals."

We remain focused on our mission and work,\" OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. The startup previously said the valuation of its charitable assets will be determined by independent financial advisors. Financial Times reported the letter earlier in the day.\n\nSam Altman co-founded OpenAI alongside Musk and others, and became one of the technology world's biggest names after the 2022 launch of the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT. Backed by Microsoft, OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in October after raising $6.6 billion from investors.\n\nReuters first reported the ChatGPT maker's plan to revamp its corporate structure so its for-profit business would be independent from non-profit control in September. The company outlined the plan in detail late December, saying it would create a public benefit corporation to make it easier to \"raise more capital than we'd imagined\" and the plan would result in \"one of the best resourced non-profits in history.\"\n\nMusk, who owns AI startup xAI, is suing OpenAI in courts in an effort to block OpenAI's conversion, which it had argued as a departure of the mission he funded the company on. The court is likely to rule on the preliminary injunction Musk's lawyers had applied for later this month.\n\nDelaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings weighed in on the case by sending the court an amicus brief on Dec. 29, stating she is currently reviewing OpenAI's proposed changes.\n\n\"That Delaware is on record asserting that it is closely monitoring the situation should definitely undercut a judge's willingness to enjoin a transaction Musk and Encode characterize as dangerous, unwise, or the product of fiduciary violations,\" Darryll Jones, Professor of Law at Florida A&M University wrote in a blog. Encode is an AI safety non-profit that joined Musk's efforts to block OpenAI's for-profit transition.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta, who also has jurisdiction, has not commented on the case, despite a letter from Meta urging him to block it.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru and Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

            "article_content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company developed ChatGPT and thus brought artificial intelligence into countless households and businesses around the world, is being accused by his younger sister of childhood sexual abuse at their family home in Clayton, Missouri.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Monday with the U.S. Eastern District Court of Missouri, Ann Altman said the alleged \u201cacts of rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse, molestation, sodomy, and battery\u201d began around 1997 when she was 3 years old and continued for nine years.\n\nSam Altman, who was 12 when the alleged abuse began, denied any wrongdoing Tuesday in a joint statement on X alongside his mother, Connie, and two brothers, Max and Jack \u2014 who attributed Ann Altman\u2019s claims to \u201cmental health challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue,\u201d they wrote in the shared statement. \u201cThis situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe family added that they\u2019ve tried to \u201chelp her find stability\u201d over the years \u201cwithout enabling harmful behaviors,\u201d but they claimed that despite their monthly financial support and help finding employment, Ann Altman, 30, \u201ccontinues to demand more money from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child,\u201d the family wrote Tuesday, adding: \u201cHer claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.\u201d\n\nAnn Altman\u2019s suit cited Missouri\u2019s Childhood Sexual Abuse law in claiming he committed his \u201clast acts of rape\u201d as an adult in 2006 when she was still a minor. She alleges the abuse began when they were both kids, and she was \u201cforced to touch his penis and perform oral penetration.\u201d\n\nSam Altman denied wrongdoing in a statement Tuesday alongside his mother and brothers. Markus Schreiber/Associated Press\n\nAnn Altman further alleged her brother started penetrating her \u201cwith his penis both vaginally and anally\u201d around 1999 or 2000. Her family claimed Tuesday they initially hoped to resolve this matter privately.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this,\u201d they wrote, claiming she previously accused family members of \u201chacking her wifi, and \u2018shadowbanning\u2019 her from various websites including ChatGPT\u201d and X.\n\nAnn Altman\u2019s attorney, Ryan Mahoney, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that his client has endured trauma but that \u201cthere is no evidence that her own mental health has contributed to her allegations.\u201d\n\nSam Altman was ousted as CEO in November, but three days later, after a series of negotiations, OpenAI reinstated him.\n\nNeed help?

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

I\u2019ve seen plenty of strong opinions about Nvidia\u2019s CES announcements online, but even ignoring the bloated price of the new RTX 5090, Nvidia won this year\u2019s show. And it kind of won by default. Between Intel\u2019s barebones announcements and an overstuffed AMD presentation that ignored what might be AMD\u2019s most important GPU launch ever, it\u2019s not surprising that Team Green came out ahead.\n\nBut that\u2019s despite the insane price of the RTX 5090, not because of it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nNvidia introduced a new range of graphics cards, and the impressive multi-frame generation of DLSS 4, but its announcements this year were much more significant than that. It all comes down to the ways that Nvidia is leveraging AI to make PC games better, and the fruits of that labor may not pay off immediately.\n\nThere are the developer-facing tools like Neural Materials and Neural Texture Compression, both of which Nvidia briefly touched on during its CES 2025 keynote. For me, however, the standout is neural shaders. They certainly aren\u2019t as exciting as a new graphics card, at least on the surface, but neural shaders have massive implications for the future of PC games. Even without the RTX 5090, that announcement alone is significant enough for Nvidia to steal this year\u2019s show.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nNeural shaders aren\u2019t some buzzword, though I\u2019d forgive you for thinking that given the force-feeding of AI we\u2019ve all experienced over the past couple of years. First, let\u2019s start with the shader. If you aren\u2019t familiar, shaders are essentially the programs that run on your GPU. Decades ago, you had fixed-function shaders; they could only do one thing. In the early 2000s, Nvidia introduced programmable shaders that had far greater capabilities. Now, we\u2019re starting with neural shaders.\n\nIn short, neural shaders allow developers to add small neural networks to shader code. Then, when you\u2019re playing a game, those neural networks can be deployed on the Tensor cores of your graphics card. It unlocks a boatload of computing horsepower that, up to this point, had fairly minimal applications in PC games. They were really just fired up for DLSS.\n\nNvidia has uses for neural shaders that it has announced so far \u2014 the aforementioned Neural Materials and Neural Texture Compression, and Neural Radiance Cache. I\u2019ll start with the last one because it\u2019s the most interesting. The Neural Radiance Cache essentially allows AI to guess what an infinite number of light bounces in a scene would look like. Now, path tracing in real time can only handle so many light bounces. After a certain point, it becomes too demanding. Neural Radiance Cache not only unlocks more realistic lighting with far more bounces but also improves performance, according to Nvidia. That\u2019s because it only requires one or two light bounces. The rest are inferred from the neural network.\n\nSimilarly, Neural Materials compresses dense shader code that would normally be reserved for offline rendering, allowing what Nvidia calls \u201cfilm-quality\u201d assets to be rendered in real time. Neural Texture Compression applies AI to texture compression, which Nvidia says saves 7x the memory as traditional block-based compression without any loss in quality.\n\nThat\u2019s just three applications of neural networks being deployed in PC games, and there are already big implications for how well games can run and how good they can look. It\u2019s important to remember that this is the starting line, too \u2014 AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all have AI hardware on their GPUs now, and I suspect there will be quite a lot of development on what kinds of neural networks can go into a shader in the future.\n\nMaybe there are cloth or physics simulations that are normally run on the CPU that can be run through a neural network on Tensor cores. Or maybe you can expand the complexity of meshes by inferring triangles that the GPU doesn\u2019t need to account for. There are the visible applications of AI, such as through non-playable characters, but neural shaders open up a world of invisible AI that makes rendering more efficient, and therefore, more powerful.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the sauce of CES. If you were to believe every executive keynote, you would walk away with literally thousands of \u201cground-breaking\u201d innovations that barely manage to move a patch of dirt. Neural shaders don\u2019t fit into that category. There are already three very practical applications of neural shaders that Nvidia is introducing, and people much smarter than myself will likely dream up hundreds more.\n\nI should be clear, though \u2014 that won\u2019t come right away. We\u2019re only seeing the very surface of what neural shaders could be capable of in the future, and even then, it\u2019ll likely be multiple years and graphics card generations down the road before their impact is felt. But when looking at the landscape of announcements from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel, only one company introduced something that could really be worthy of that \u201cground-breaking\u201d title, and that\u2019s Nvidia."

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Despite its upbeat subtitle, How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science, David Sobel\u2019s widely praised new study of Marie Curie and the 45 women who worked in her laboratory reveals the persistent bias, discouragement and institutional barriers that marginalized these pioneering women scientists.\n\nRather than illustrating a clear path to gender equity in science, Sobel\u2019s work reveals how systemic discrimination continued to thwart their progress, despite their significant contributions to groundbreaking research.\n\nIn her 2023 study, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Kate Zernike illustrates the entrenched sexism that persisted in science to the end of the 20th century. As recently as 1999, even the most accomplished women in fields like molecular genetics, geology, neuroscience and cancer research were routinely denied the recognition and resources granted to their less qualified male colleagues.\n\nZernike demonstrates that it was only through persistent advocacy and fighting against these discriminatory practices that these women began to chip away at the pervasive sexism of elite scientific institutions. Their struggle not only brought attention to the inequities they faced but also helped pave the way for future generations of women in science, slowly transforming the landscape of an often exclusionary and hierarchical system.\n\nThe history of women in science is littered with examples of women whose contributions were either minimized or outright attributed to male colleagues. The historian of science Margaret W. Rossiter termed this the \u201cMatilda effect\u201d\u2014the systematic tendency to downplay or erase women\u2019s contributions to scientific discoveries, with credit often being given to their male colleagues instead.\n\nNettie Stevens made groundbreaking discoveries about sex determination in 1905, demonstrating that sex is determined by chromosomes\u2014specifically the XY system. However, her male colleague Edmund Beecher Wilson received much of the credit for this work. Despite Stevens\u2019s foundational contributions to genetics, her role was overshadowed, illustrating how women\u2019s scientific achievements have often been attributed to men.\n\nLise Meitner, a physicist who played an essential role in the discovery of nuclear fission, similarly saw her contributions minimized. While her theoretical work provided crucial insights into nuclear reactions, it was her colleague Otto Hahn who received the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Meitner\u2019s exclusion from the prize, despite her significant contributions, reveals how systemic bias has long denied women their due recognition in science.\n\nIn a similar case, Chien-Shiung Wu, a Chinese American physicist, conducted a pivotal experiment that disproved the conservation of parity, a fundamental law of physics. Wu\u2019s experimental findings were crucial in confirming the theoretical work of Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, who went on to receive the Nobel Prize in 1957. Despite Wu\u2019s central role, she was not included in the Nobel honors, reflecting the pervasive bias against acknowledging women\u2019s contributions.\n\nThe field of bacterial genetics also saw women\u2019s contributions marginalized. Esther Lederberg made important discoveries, including the identification of lambda phage, a virus that infects bacteria, and the development of the replica plating technique, which revolutionized bacterial research. Nevertheless, her then-husband, Joshua Lederberg, was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, while her critical contributions were minimized.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of the Matilda effect is Rosalind Franklin, whose work on X-ray diffraction was crucial in elucidating the structure of DNA. However, James Watson and Francis Crick received most of the credit, culminating in the 1962 Nobel Prize. Franklin\u2019s role was largely overlooked until later historical reappraisals recognized the depth of her contributions to one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century.\n\nAnother telling case is that of Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who as a graduate student in 1967 discovered pulsars, a type of rotating neutron star. Her supervisor, Antony Hewish, received the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery, with Bell Burnell\u2019s pivotal role in the research going largely unacknowledged.\n\nThese stories illustrate the systemic barriers that have historically marginalized women in science. Misogyny in the scientific community manifests not only in denying women opportunities but also in rewriting the narrative of discovery to exclude or downplay their achievements. Addressing this bias requires an ongoing effort to reshape how scientific recognition is awarded, ensuring that all contributors are fairly acknowledged.\n\nThe underrepresentation and marginalization of women in science are not merely byproducts of personal gender bias but are deeply embedded within the structures, cultures and systems that govern the scientific community itself.\n\nHistorian Margaret Rossiter\u2019s three-volume Women Scientists in America explores how systemic sexism has historically shaped the landscape of science. She recounts the overlooked stories of women scientists whose contributions were either erased or downplayed, revealing patterns of institutionalized misogyny that extend beyond individual prejudice. This institutionalized bias encompasses educational barriers, discriminatory hiring practices, exclusion from professional networks and credit denial.\n\nRossiter shows that cultural narratives suggested women were biologically unsuited for scientific careers or that they would eventually prioritize family over work. However, misogyny went beyond cultural narratives. Women were often denied access to advanced education and academic appointments, restricted to subordinate roles such as laboratory assistants and excluded from leadership positions. These practices were reinforced through discriminatory tenure and promotion practices, where women were often denied career advancement even when their research output equaled or surpassed that of their male peers.\n\nKey mechanisms of this institutionalized misogyny include:\n\nInvisible barriers that discouraged women from pursuing advanced education and research roles through societal expectations of gender roles.\n\nCredit denial, where women scientists frequently found their contributions minimized or attributed to male colleagues, reinforcing the myth of women\u2019s inferiority in scientific innovation.\n\nInstitutional exclusion from the informal male networks that enabled men to advance their careers through mentorship, collaborations and opportunities from which women were excluded.\n\nSocial and professional isolation in male-dominated cultures in scientific institutions that left women without supportive peer communities, further hindering their career advancement.\n\nTokenism, where women scientists were viewed as exceptions, expected to conform to male norms rather than being seen as equal contributors in their fields.\n\nRossiter\u2019s research reveals that misogyny in science is the result of both overt discrimination and deeply entrenched cultural and institutional practices that perpetuate gender hierarchies.\n\nThe concept of systemic misogyny challenges the idea that science is purely meritocratic and objective. Although science is often portrayed as a field where talent and hard work dictate success, it has long been shaped by institutional and cultural biases that have disproportionately favored white men over women and marginalized groups.\n\nAcknowledging these systemic biases requires rethinking the history and practice of science, a shift that often sparks resistance. Many view science as an arena of merit, and questioning how gender bias has influenced scientific recognition and resource distribution raises uncomfortable questions about what constitutes achievement in science. If key contributions have been overlooked or misattributed, it forces us to reconsider how success and excellence in science have been defined and challenges the historical record of discovery. Recognizing these biases can feel like an attack on the integrity of science itself.\n\nHowever, addressing systemic bias is not about discrediting past achievements. Rather, it\u2019s about recognizing the structural inequities that have marginalized women and prevented them from receiving due credit for their work. Only by acknowledging and dismantling these institutional barriers can the scientific community create a more inclusive environment where merit, not gender, determines success. This shift is essential to ensuring that future generations of scientists, regardless of gender, have equal opportunities to contribute to and shape the future of science.\n\nThe recent revelations of fraudulent scientific research, particularly in studies of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer, have shaken public trust in the scientific community. These incidents expose underlying issues within the culture of science that go beyond isolated cases of misconduct. While it is easy to point to individual bad actors, the problem appears to be more systemic, involving distorted incentives, pressure to publish and gaps in the peer review process.\n\nScience, ideally, is rooted in objectivity, rigor and self-correction. Yet, the reality is that scientific research occurs within a competitive environment that prioritizes publication in high-impact journals, securing funding and advancing one\u2019s career. These pressures can push researchers toward unethical behavior, such as manipulating data or misrepresenting findings, in order to meet their expectations.\n\nOne of the major factors contributing to this problem is the publish-or-perish culture. Under constant pressure to produce significant, novel results, this can lead researchers to cherry-pick data or fabricate results to meet those demands. The incentive structure in science often rewards breakthroughs over incremental progress, leading some to take shortcuts or manipulate results to present more groundbreaking findings. Additionally, securing grants often requires presenting promising or positive outcomes, further incentivizing researchers to skew their data.\n\nThe peer-review system, designed to be a safeguard for ensuring the validity of scientific work, is not without its flaws. While peer review does catch some issues, it can be inadequate in thoroughly verifying data integrity or identifying fraudulent practices. Peer reviewers, often overburdened and undercompensated, may not have the time or resources to deeply investigate the data or methodologies presented in a paper. Moreover, peer review tends to rely on trust and assumes that researchers are reporting their findings honestly, making it challenging to detect fraudulent work unless whistle-blowers or postpublication scrutiny reveal discrepancies.\n\nThese systemic issues within the culture of science highlight the need for reforms that go beyond individual accountability. Solutions could include implementing more rigorous checks in the peer-review process, creating systems that promote transparency and data sharing and revisiting the incentive structures in scientific research to prioritize integrity and reproducibility over sensationalism and careerism. Funding bodies and academic institutions could also play a role by fostering a culture that values long-term, incremental progress and discourages the pressure to publish flashy, groundbreaking results at any cost.\n\nThe cases of fraudulent research remind us that while science has the tools for self-correction, those mechanisms must be strengthened to protect the integrity of research, especially in areas as critical as dementia and cancer treatment. Ultimately, addressing the deeper structural issues that encourage unethical behavior is key to restoring trust in scientific research.\n\nThe revelations about systemic and structural bias in science\u2014whether related to gender, race or class\u2014are part of a much broader reckoning with history. As we confront past injustices and inequalities, it\u2019s natural to ask whether we should repudiate this history entirely or find more nuanced ways to engage with it. Clearly, we must call out past evils, but this does not necessarily require a wholesale repudiation of scientific progress.\n\nInstead, these revelations offer an opportunity for a more constructive dialogue\u2014one that allows us to learn from our mistakes while appreciating the complexity of progress. Recognizing bias in science doesn\u2019t discredit scientific achievements as a whole, but it does demand an honest acknowledgment of how those achievements unfolded within exclusionary frameworks. The exclusion of women and people of color from the scientific canon does not invalidate scientific discoveries but reminds us that these accomplishments came at the cost of marginalizing others.\n\nOne of the most productive ways to engage with these historical injustices is by treating history as a teaching tool. Rather than rejecting the past, we can examine how bias shaped institutions and knowledge systems. This perspective helps identify and dismantle ongoing inequalities. For example, understanding how structural sexism marginalized women in science can guide efforts to create more inclusive environments in today\u2019s academy.\n\nHistory is not static; our interpretations evolve as new information comes to light. Scientific figures who were once celebrated for their discoveries are now understood within a more complex context, one that reveals the societal and structural forces that shaped their successes while excluding others. This evolving understanding helps us refine our values and institutions without erasing the positive contributions that were made.\n\nInstead of repudiating the past, we can focus on reconciliation. This involves not just acknowledging historical wrongs but taking active steps to address present-day inequities. In science, this might mean increasing diversity, fostering mentorship for underrepresented groups and ensuring access to research and discovery for a wider range of people. Addressing historical injustices can create a more inclusive and innovative scientific community for the future.\n\nThe German-Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin, in his 1940 Theses on the Philosophy of History, argued that one of history\u2019s essential functions is to \u201credeem the past.\u201d He believed history must rescue and give meaning to the voices of the oppressed, those silenced by dominant narratives of progress and power. Benjamin\u2019s metaphor of the \u201cAngel of History\u201d reflects this: As the angel is blown into the future, it helplessly faces the wreckage of the past\u2014symbolizing the devastation and suffering often erased by histories of triumph.\n\nRedeeming the past means confronting the unfinished business of historical wrongs and recognizing how they shape the present. By facing these historical injustices directly, we don\u2019t discredit the past, but rather enrich it with a fuller understanding\u2014ensuring that progress is built on a foundation of truth and inclusivity."

When powering an electric vehicle, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that the rides are cleaner during their lifespans than gas cars, even when considering the costly and dirty supply chain for the hard-to-gather power pack parts.\n\nBut alternatives, from potassium to salt, sometimes have cheaper, safer, and even better-performing potential in greater temperature ranges.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing hydrogen ions is among the latest innovations from an expert lab. The UNSW Sydney team touted its tech as addressing fast charge and even safety concerns; lithium-ion packs are susceptible to rare yet serious fire risks.\n\n\"To enhance the usage of renewable energies, we have to develop some more efficient energy integration technologies and our proton battery design is a promising trial,\" doctoral candidate Sicheng Wu, who helped to develop TABQ, said.\n\nShould the U.S. invest more in battery innovations?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nTABQ was found in testing to support \"rapid proton movement using hydrogen-bond networks.\" The motion bodes well for energy density, or storage capacity per pound, as well as power output.\n\nThe anode research started with tetrachloro-benzoquinone, or TCBQ, according to the experts. The team modified some of its chemistry to create the useful TABQ anode. They combined it with a TCBQ cathode, garnering great results. The battery is reported to be able to last for 3,500 charge-discharge cycles and is well-suited for renewable energy storage, per the experts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cost savings are set to be realized as the concept is commercialized.\n\n\"If you just look at the TABQ material that we have designed, it's not necessarily cheap to produce at the moment,\" Zhao said. \"But because it's made of abundant light elements, it will be easy and affordable to eventually scale up.\"\n\nStoring intermittent energy from the sun, wind, and waves is necessary to transition to a cleaner power system, a switch already well underway. In the United States, renewables generate more than 20% of electricity, according to the government. Leveling off and reducing planet-warming fumes impacts our future in many ways, including education. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed overheating and other concerns in a fact sheet about the climate and young learners.\n\nCooling things down can start at home with some simple changes. Unplugging unused chargers and devices can prevent air pollution and save you upward of $165 a year, as one example.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt UNSW Sydney, the team said its hydrogen-ion battery can also provide a way to ship hydrogen as stored protons, an improvement on other more difficult transport methods.\n\n\"Our discovery has made this concept a possible reality,\" Zhao said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Company recognized by global analyst firm for empowering enterprise security teams and citizen developers to address vulnerabilities in LCNC applications\n\nNEW YORK & TEL AVIV, Israel, January 09, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nokod Security, the security company for no-code application development, today announced that it has been profiled in global analyst firm Omdia\u2019s On the Radar series of research notes for its ability to address emerging security risks associated with the rapid enterprise adoption of low-code/no-code (LCNC) platforms. A full copy of the report is available here.\n\nAccording to Omdia\u2019s Senior Principal Analyst, Rik Turner, \"Nokod provides visibility into the LCNC applications already in use within an organization and the vulnerabilities that they contain. The company\u2019s platform enables security teams to oversee the remediation process by routing alerts back to the original creators and monitoring the resolution of issues, empowering organizations to safely harness the benefits of LCNC development.\"\n\nTurner emphasized the growing importance of Nokod\u2019s offering, adding, \"Omdia sees a clear requirement for the technology this vendor offers,\" particularly as the rise of LCNC adoption introduces a phenomenon known as \"shadow engineering,\" where LCNC applications are created without IT oversight, increasing enterprise risk.\n\nAddressing Security in LCNC Development\n\nThe On the Radar report highlights the increasing use of LCNC platforms in enterprise environments. Some forecasts project that up to 70% of business applications could be LCNC-based by 2025. The rapid adoption of LCNC has also led to the rise of shadow engineering, expanding the attack surface in ways that traditional security methods struggle to address. Nokod\u2019s SaaS platform fills this critical gap by offering the following features and capabilities:\n\nAutomatic Discovery and Inventory : Identifies all LCNC apps operating within an organization, including those created outside formal IT processes.\n\nComprehensive Vulnerability Assessment : Detects security issues such as hardcoded secrets, data leakage risks, and untrusted dependencies.\n\nPrioritized Remediation Guidance : Provides actionable insights and step-by-step instructions to citizen developers and IT teams.\n\nSeamless Integration: Delivers an agentless connection to leading LCNC platforms via APIs\n\nThe report highlights Nokod\u2019s inspection engine, which effectively addresses the \"low-hanging fruit\" of LCNC vulnerabilities.

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

CNBC reports that sources familiar with the situation said layoffs are part of a broader performance evaluation strategy, aiming to optimize its workforce without major upheavals.\n\nFor context, this is the latest development in a round of layoffs coming after Microsoft's restructuring announcements. In early 2023, it made the news with a record layoff of 10,000 employees alongside office lease consolidation.\n\nWhen Microsoft post-acquired Activision Blizzard in January 2024, its gaming unit witnessed 1,900 job losses due to position overlap. Though the present layoff is small, they do draw attention in the context of Microsoft's overall performance.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Microsoft's Market Performance\n\nWhile Microsoft continues to record great financial performance, the stock performance of the company in 2023 trailed its tech peers. Although a near-record net income margin of 38%, its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft's stock only rose by 12% compared to 29% in the Nasdaq for the same period. It has triggered speculation on the company's future course and its potential to continue with growth in a competitive technology market.\n\nMicrosoft's Ties with OpenAI\n\nThe gargantuan rise of Microsoft's market cap last year was in significant part as a result of its relationship with the artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has invested over $13 billion into the firm and will now play a significant role in a new revolution in AI. At the close of 2024, there seems to be increasingly increasing tensions between the two.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently spoke on this \"cooperation tension\" in which he admitted OpenAI, an already formidable rival in its own right, had the potential to upset Microsoft's market position with its AI plays. The stakes are high and at a turning point for the company's AI strategy, considering the company's current role within the fast-moving AI sector.\n\nSlow Rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot Worrisome to Investors?\n\nOne area of focus for Microsoft's future growth is its Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which leverages OpenAI's technology to integrate artificial intelligence into the company's productivity suite. However, early feedback suggests that the rollout of Copilot has been slower than expected.\n\nAnalysts from UBS recently noted that Microsoft's presentation at its Ignite conference in late 2023 left them with the impression that Copilot's adoption in the business world had been \"underwhelming.\"\n\nAs businesses increasingly look for AI-driven tools to improve productivity, Microsoft's ability to scale Copilot and similar offerings will be critical to its long-term success.\n\nThe company is under pressure to prove that its AI investments will yield substantial returns, particularly as it faces growing competition from other tech giants.\n\nHowever, despite the obstacles, Microsoft looks at the bright side of things. Its finance chief, Amy Hood, stressed that revenue growth in its Azure cloud services will increase in 2024 because of the rise in the expansion of AI infrastructure capacity.\n\nAzure's cloud platform is an integral part of Microsoft's long-term strategy, and it's setting up for the speedy expansion of AI and cloud-based services in the years ahead.\n\nWhile the recent job cuts may be seen as a short-term adjustment, Microsoft's focus on AI and cloud services indicates that it is preparing for a huge transformation in the tech landscape."

            "article_content": "Two people ride past a burning house off Enchanted Way in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood of Pacific Palisades on Tuesday. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe destruction caused by the Los Angeles-area wildfires, possibly the worst ever in California, is almost certain to rank as one of the most costly natural disasters in U.S. history, with the total economic toll well into the tens of billions of dollars.\n\nOne preliminary estimate calculated by AccuWeather, the weather forecasting service, put the damage and total economic loss at $52 billion to $57 billion \u2014 a sum that could rise if the fires continue to spread.\n\nJ.P. Morgan on Thursday doubled its expectations of economic losses from a day earlier, saying they would be closer to $50 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: 10 dead, more than 9,000 homes, structures damaged or destroyed in L.A. County fires\n\nFive fires have already scorched thousands of acres in and around Los Angeles, forcing at least 130,000 people to be evacuated and damaging or destroying about 2,000 buildings. Five people have died.\n\nWhile it may be days before the full extent of the cost is known, the sheer number of expensive homes and businesses affected suggests that the overall economic damage will likely be greater than the $30-billion loss caused by the Camp fire across California in 2018, considered the state's most expensive wildfire to date.\n\nThe Maui wildfires in 2023, by comparison, caused $5.6 billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Tiny burning embers flew miles, causing L.A. fire destruction on historic scale\n\nBy the NOAA estimates, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 is the most expensive U.S. natural disaster, costing an estimated $200 billion.\n\nOn Thursday, experts at Moody\u2019s said that they expected the insured losses stemming from the L.A. County fires to run in the billions of dollars given the high value of properties in coastal Pacific Palisades, where the first blazes broke out on Tuesday.\n\nFires burning around Santa Monica and Malibu have torched homes that are among the most expensive in the country, with a median value of over $2 million, said AccuWeather.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJ.P. Morgan on Thursday raised its earlier estimate of insured losses to $20 billion.\n\nBut many affected homeowners reported that their insurance had been dropped. The insurance industry has been walloped by hurricanes and other harbingers of climate change in recent years, and some of the biggest insurers have ceased writing or stopped renewing policies in high-risk coastal and wildfire areas like Pacific Palisades.\n\nRead more: California exodus of home insurance companies continues\n\nCalifornia has had one of the highest rates of homeowner policy non-renewals in the country in recent years, based on government reports.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fires moving through Los Angeles County highlight the intensifying risk that wildfires pose to significant areas of the State of California,\u201d said Denise Rappmund, senior analyst at Moody\u2019s Ratings.\n\nRead more: A fire is forcing you to evacuate. What do you pack?\n\n\u201cIt is too early to evaluate potential impacts to property valuations or other credit implications for individual local governments,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, these events will continue to have widespread, negative impacts for the state\u2019s broader insurance market \u2014 increased recovery costs will likely drive up premiums and may reduce property insurance availability.\u201d\n\n\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."

            "article_content": "The leading PC manufacturer used the Consumer Electronics Show to showcase their latest line-up of AI PCs powered by neural processing units (NPU). HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer and Asus all demoed new AI PC offerings at the Las Vegas event.\n\nHP unveiled the Z2 Mini and ZBook Ultra, which the company claims enables users to engage in 3D design, render graphics-intensive projects simultaneously, and work locally with LLMs.\n\nThe new HP hardware is powered by AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO processor. HP said the ZBook Ultra offers features up to 16 desktop-class CPU cores, discrete-like integrated graphics, and up to 128GB of innovative unified memory architecture, and the ability to assign up to 96GB RAM to the graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nLenovo used the event to demonstrate the enhanced user experience available on the Intel Core Ultra-powered Lenovo AI Now and Lenovo Aura Edition PCs.\n\nLenovo AI Now on the company\u2019s flagship ThinkPad X9 offers what Lenovo calls \u201can advanced on-device AI assistant\u201d to deliver real-time intelligence to users. Built on a local large language model (LLM) using Meta\u2019s Llama 3.0, Lenovo AI Now stores and processes all user data locally, which Lenovo said safeguards user information while delivering powerful, real-time AI capabilities. Lenovo said it can be used to automate and simplify tasks such as document organisation and device management, supporting AI applications such as natural language queries across locally stored documents.\n\nThe company said it will be expanding Lenovo AI Now\u2019s capabilities with the ability to search for information across PCs and supported tablet devices, and an intelligent search capability for retrieving relevant information from selected portions of images or documents.\n\nDell has focused on simplifying AI development on PCs. Its new Dell Pro AI Studio offers an AI toolkit with validated tools, frameworks, templates and models, to help developers and IT administrators build and manage AI software independent of the underlying silicon. Dell claims this can reduce development and deployment time by as much as 75%, going from six months to as little as six weeks.\n\nAcer\u2019s new Copilot+ lineup includes the Swift Go 16 AI and Swift Go 14 AI laptops and the Aspire C AI AIOs. These are powered by AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors. The hardware uses the AMD XDNA 2 NPU architecture, which Acer said delivers up to 50 TOPS (tera operations per second) of AI performance and includes AMD Radeon 800M graphics. According to Acer, the new Swift Go AI laptops are able to run efficiently and reliably for all-day use with a battery life of up to 24.9 hours of video playback. It has also introduced the Intel Core-powered Aspire S AI and Revo Box AI devices.\n\nBeyond x86-based AI PCs, Asus unveiled its Snapdragon-powered Zenbook A14. This device uses the Snapdragon X Series Processors and offers up to 45W TDP performance along with a neural processing capability of 45 TOPS. Asus claims it offers up to 32 hours of battery life, which can be further extended or customised with MyASUS Battery Care Mode. The device includes 2 USB 4.0 ports, an audio jack, a type-A port and an HDMI port."

            "article_content": "SEAN GLADWELL/Getty Images\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is when brands make major announcements for product releases and unveil cool concepts and mockups for future projects. So it's no surprise that Genki -- a third-party gaming and PC accessories manufacturer -- showed off some new devices.\n\nAlso: CES 2025: The 15 most impressive products you don't want to miss\n\nWhat caught us off guard, however, was Genki's alleged mockup of a Nintendo Switch 2 console and Joy-Con controllers. Just how much does this confirm previous leaks? And is there any new information about the upcoming console ahead of Nintendo's official announcement later this year? Here's everything we know -- and don't know -- about Genki's Switch 2 mockup.\n\nWhat we know\n\nGenki (aka, Human Things Inc.) is a third-party manufacturer of gaming accessories.\n\nGenki's accessory focus is power and storage solutions (cases, SSDs, wall chargers).\n\nGenki showed up to CES 2025 with an alleged mockup of the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nGenki claims the Switch 2 will be released in April.\n\nNintendo plans to officially announce the Switch 2 sometime before the end of Q1 2025\n\nWhat we don't know\n\nHow did Genki get a hold of a fully 3D-printed mockup?\n\nWhy would the company risk Nintendo's notoriously litigious wrath by leaking significant details ahead of an official announcement?\n\nIs this a viral marketing stunt for their accessories?\n\nWhen will the Switch 2 be released?\n\nHow much will the Switch 2 cost at release?\n\nIn typical fashion, official Nintendo channels have neither confirmed nor denied any of the details provided by Genki and its mockup of the Switch 2. But that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from going into high gear. A few things seem to corroborate, if not confirm, previous leaks -- such as the potential for magnetic Joy-Con controllers and the console itself being bigger than the current Switch OLED.\n\nExciting as all this is, however, something feels off. First, Genki's mockup looks remarkably like some debunked CAD files leaked to Reddit in 2024. The source of those files claimed to have obtained console information from a third-party manufacturer \"at great cost\" and \"reverse-engineered\" the CAD files.\n\nWith Nintendo being such a hot commodity, it's not outside the realm of possibility that this could be an elaborate attempt to drum up interest in Genki's (frankly) run-of-the-mill accessories, which consist mostly of USB-C cables and video capture cards that look sourced from other manufacturers and branded with the Genki logo.\n\nAlso: This low-cost Lenovo PC is the desktop I recommend to most people - even though its made for gamers\n\nI wasn't able to find any details on Human Things Inc. other than a suspiciously empty LinkedIn page with a URL that leads directly back to the Genki retail page. Their blog is woefully sparse, with just four posts; the first in 2019, one in 2023, and two from 2024. None make mention of any company operations, but the site's front page proudly tells you they were successfully backed on Kickstarter by over 50,000 people.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, the alleged Switch 2 leak feels more like a poorly planned viral marketing effort. And Genki isn't the first vendor to take this approach. In December 2024, Canadian company Dbrand claimed to have obtained official 3D scans of the Nintendo Switch 2 from an unspecified source to promote their Killswitch 2 case.\n\nIn the end, this alleged leak doesn't add any significant new information and doesn't confirm anything we didn't already hear before. Nintendo is set to make an official announcement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2's release date, retail price, and tech specs sometime before April 2024."

This is a lenticular storm cloud and its not that common to see,' Higgins Storm Chasing wrote to their Facebook page on Thursday morning.\n\nThe weather page explained the cloud formation was a hailstorm that was moving across the Darling Downs towards Oakey and north of Toowoomba around sunrise with the light from the early morning sun 'helping ignite the eastern side of the storm, turning it pink and orange'.\n\nCommenters on the post said the phenomenon was a particularly impressive display from nature and said that 'our sky never fails to be amazing'.\n\n'You can see the ''Beam me up Scotty'' rays,' one said.\n\n'Omg! Thankyou for sharing this storm cell is it so stunning,' said a second.\n\n'Who needs drones and aliens when you can have this in the sky,' added a third.\n\nA hailstorm in southeast Queensland at sunrise on Thursday formed this spectacular cloud formation that some mistook for a 'UFO'\n\nIt is actually a lenticular cloud which can often form smooth circular shapes\n\nThe spectacular display follows a similar 'spaceship' cloud appearing in Sydney.\n\nThe bizarre natural phenomenon formed over the ocean in Cronulla, in Sydney's southern suburbs, with many sharing snaps and videos of the cloud to social media.\n\nBut Weatherzone meteorologist Felix Levesque assured Daily Mail Australia the strange cloud was nothing to be worried about.\n\nSome guessed the 'spaceship' was a lenticular cloud, which the forecaster said is formed when moist winds are forced over a barrier, such as a mountain.\n\n'This rising motion over the barrier causes the air to cool and condense into a stationary cloud,' Mr Levesque explained.\n\n'This stationary cloud will have a smooth oval appearance, hence why it's often mistaken as a UFO.'\n\nSome said they could see the 'beam me up Scotty' rays, referring to Star Trek\n\nResidents of Cronulla in Sydney's south were shocked by the unusual appearance of a cloud formation that resembled a spaceship in December\n\nMr Levesque said the Cronulla cloud was in fact a roll cloud, a different species to the lenticular cloud which is caused by a similar process.\n\n'Roll clouds form when a cooler, denser airmass pushes under another airmass, causing this rising and 'rolling' motion on the leading edge of the airmass \u2013 hence the name,' he continued.\n\n'Southerly busters, like on Tuesday, can bring roll clouds, and these can occur about three to five times a year in Sydney.'\n\n'A common location for roll clouds is over the Gulf of Carpentaria \u2013 so common it's been given the name Morning Glory Cloud', Mr Levesque said."

This relates to the design and development of cities and communities in a way that achieves a balance between human needs and the preservation of the environment and natural resources, and the provision of a healthy, educational, and living environment for city residents to improve their quality of life.In this context, Qatar has been keen to pay attention to this vital aspect in all its dimensions, and to launch several ambitious national initiatives that aim to increase green spaces, including planting 1mn trees by the end of 2022, and launching the initiative to plant 10mn trees by the beginning of 2023, in order to improve the quality of life in cities and achieve sustainable development, as well as transforming various areas and cities into an urban model for sustainable and environmentally-friendly planning, while identifying environmental controls and basic indicators that should be taken into account when carrying out sustainable planning for green cities to ensure a healthy and sustainable environment.In turn, all of this contributed to eight Qatari cities receiving the title of Healthy City from the World Health Organisation, as well as seven Qatari cities joining the Unesco Global Network of Learning Cities.The Qatari cities that have successfully joined the Unesco Global Network of Learning Cities include Al Wakrah in 2017, Al Shamal in 2019, Al Sheehaniya in 2020, Doha, Al Rayyan, and Al Daayen in 2022 and finally Umm Salal in 2024. Work is currently underway on the eighth city, Al Khor and Al Thakhira.The accession of Qatari cities to the Unesco Global Network of Learning Cities is a culmination of the state's efforts to adopt a strategy to spread the concepts of sustainability and integrate society into it by implementing programmes, projects, and initiatives in cooperation and partnership with civil society institutions, providing a suitable environment for current and future generations, contributing to the development of society, and spreading awareness of sustainability and green buildings.The fact that seven Qatari cities have joined the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) Global Network of Learning Cities under the umbrella of the Unesco Institute for Lifelong Learning demonstrates Qatar's endeavours, which were made possible thanks to the efforts of the Ministry of Municipality's strategy of promoting sustainability and involving the community by launching relevant programmes, projects, and initiatives.This achievement was also the result of a collaboration and partnership fostered together with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, represented by the Qatar National Commission for Education, Culture and Science and civil society organisations, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030, to provide future generations with a suitable environment, contribute to community development, and raise awareness about sustainability and green buildings.Both Al Wakrah and Doha won the Unesco Learning City Award; the former won it in 2021 after competing with 60 other cities and making it to a list of top 10 cities recognised for outstanding achievements in the field of lifelong learning, whereas Doha won it in 2024 during the 6th International Conference on Learning Cities held recently in Jubail, Saudi Arabia.These global achievements reflect Qatar's strong commitment to promoting lifelong learning and its foresight with regards to education as being a fundamental tool for sustainable development and forming adaptable communities capable of facing future challenges, in addition to being a fulfillment of the Qatar National Vision 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals, namely Goal 4 on quality education for all and Goal 11 on building sustainable and resilient cities and communities.Qatar gives special attention to infrastructure projects, investing in renewable energy, increasing green spaces in cities, improving waste management systems, recycling, and converting waste into energy, in line with global sustainability standards."
