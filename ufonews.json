            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, developed a reputation for folksy candor about issues that politicians often shy away from \u2014 including acknowledging that he once personally observed a UFO, though he remained a skeptic about the possibility that aliens had landed on Earth.\n\n\u201cI saw an unidentified flying object,\u201d Carter told GQ magazine in 2005, recounting a story he first publicly shared in the early 1970s before he became Georgia\u2019s governor and then US president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never believed that it came from Mars. I know enough physics to know that you can\u2019t have vehicles that are tangible in nature flying from Mars, looking around, and then flying back. But I saw an object one night when I was preparing to give a speech to a Lions Club,\u201d he said.\n\n5 President Jimmy Carter said he personally saw a UFO in southwest Georgia in the late 1960s. Getty Images\n\nThe sighting occurred in 1969 in southwest Georgia and the ex-president said he dictated the incident into an audio tape recorder.\n\n\u201cThere were about 25 of us men standing around. It was almost time for the Lions Club supper to start, which I would eat and then I would give a speech,\u201d Carter recalled.\n\n\u201cAnd all of a sudden, one of the men looked up and said, \u2018Look, over in the west!\u2019 And there was a bright light in the sky. We all saw it. And then the light, it got closer and closer to us. And then it stopped, I don\u2019t know how far away, but it stopped beyond the pine trees. And all of a sudden it changed color to blue, and then it changed to red, then back to white.\u201d\n\nCarter said: \u201cI dictated my observations. And when I got home, I wrote them down. So that\u2019s an accurate description of what I saw. It was a flying object that was unidentified. But I have never thought that it was from outer space.\u201d\n\nThe 39th president poured cold water on the possibility that aliens had landed anywhere on Earth \u2014 including at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947 in an incident that conspiracy theorists say was followed by a government cover-up featuring the recovery of alien bodies.\n\n\u201cAs far as covering up possible flights from distant satellites or distant heavenly bodies, I don\u2019t believe in that, and there\u2019s no evidence that it was ever covered up. Or extraterrestrial people coming to Earth, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened,\u201d Carter said.\n\n5 Bettmann Archive\n\n5 Bettmann Archive\n\nAsked about his 1976 campaign pledge to look into Roswell, Carter told GQ that \u201cin a way\u201d he did \u2014 and in probing the encounter, learned that the government once used a California psychic to learn the location of a plane lost in Africa.\n\n\u201cI became more aware of what our intelligence services were doing. There was only one instance that I\u2019ll talk about now,\u201d Carter said.\n\n\u201cWe had a plane go down in the Central African Republic \u2014 a twin-engine plane, small plane. And we couldn\u2019t find it. And so we oriented satellites that were going around the Earth every 90 minutes to fly over that spot where we thought it might be and take photographs. We couldn\u2019t find it. So the director of the CIA came and told me that he had contacted a woman in California that claimed to have supernatural capabilities. And she went in a trance, and she wrote down latitudes and longitudes, and we sent our satellite over that latitude and longitude, and there was the plane.\u201d\n\n5 Carter was president from 1977 to 1981. ZUMAPRESS.com\n\nPresidents from Harry S. Truman to Donald Trump have publicly addressed UFOs and popular theories involving aliens \u2014 and Carter\u2019s successor, President Ronald Reagan, also said he had personally observed a UFO while flying in a Cessna above Bakersfield, Calif., in 1974.\n\n\u201cIt was a fairly steady light until it began to accelerate. Then it appeared to elongate. Then the light took off. It went up at a 45-degree angle at a high rate of speed. Everyone on the plane was surprised,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cThe UFO went from a normal cruise speed to a fantastic speed instantly. If you give an airplane power, it will accelerate \u2014 but not like a hot rod, and that\u2019s what this was like. It went straight up into the heavens.\u201d\n\nCarter\u2019s reputation for candor extended to other subjects, with the longtime Sunday school teacher even sitting for five hours of interviews with Playboy magazine while running for president in 1976 and memorably commenting on his own impure thoughts.\n\n5 Carter died Sunday at age 100. POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked on a lot of women with lust. I\u2019ve committed adultery in my heart many times. This is something that God recognizes I will do \u2014 and I have done it \u2014 and God forgives me for it,\u201d Carter said.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I condemn someone who not only looks on a woman with lust but who leaves his wife and shacks up with somebody out of wedlock. Christ says, \u2018Don\u2019t consider yourself better than someone else because one guy screws a whole bunch of women while the other guy is loyal to his wife.'\u201d"

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nAt some point, the truth about all of these UFO and drone sightings has to start being revealed. There are just too many eyewitness reports and videos being shared online for governments to just keep pretending like nothing is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the United States either (though that is where a majority of the reports are originating). They have also been happening in places like the United Kingdom, Germany, and now, in Brazil.\n\nWhile orb-shaped UFOs are perhaps the most common type of UFO that has been seen over the years, triangular-shaped crafts have also been reported being seen quite often.\n\nThe latest triangular-shaped UFO to be reported, and in this case filmed, occurred recently in the Barigui Park, in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.\n\n\u201cI came across the video yesterday while browsing reels on Instagram,\u201d a report written for Ovniologia in Brazil read. \u201cThe account published the footage, called Paranadrone , is a page dedicated to aerial images to with drones and has no connection to the UFO theme.\n\n\u201cI contacted you and requested the original footage, which was sent to me. The video was forwarded them by a follower who requested anonymity. The images were recorded around 8 pm, while the witness was in a trade in the park region.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the video, it is possible to see that the person filming was apparently close to a wall, inside a residence or business, the Paranadro told me. Then, we see a large, luminous point coming from the left, reveals its which triangular shape when the witness zooms in,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cThe object crosses the sky at a considerable and constant speed until it disappears from the author\u2019s field of vision behind the trees. See below.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have what appears to be beautiful footage of a triangular UFO. The fixed, unwavering lights at the bottom seem to match reports of these craft. One worth thing noting is the number of lights. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, three to four lights are usually reported on these objects. However, in the footage, in addition to the three lights at the ends, we can see two more luminous points near the larger central light.\n\n\u201cThis led me to question if it was actually a solid object or just a formation of orbs. While the footage is quite clear, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say that another witness to the same UFO claimed it had \u201ctwo lights at a considerably low altitude that same day. One of them was in front of her house, with a green and red coloration, while the other, located behind the house, was orange in color and considerably larger.\u201d\n\nHer neighbor also saw the UFO and also filmed it.\n\nThe report by Ovniologia went on to explain, \u201cI spoke to other people who reported strange activity in the skies over Curitiba this month. The reports describe some anomalous sightings and experiences. It is possible that that some incidence of the phenomenon is occurring in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the video of the triangular UFO, the first thing thing that came to mind was the wave of drones on American soil. Could there be any possible connection? Could it be starting to spread to other regions of the Americas? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo far, no definitive explanation has been revealed."

            "article_content": "Smaller artificial intelligence stocks have seemingly gone parabolic at the close of 2024, especially those that have been backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the form of an investment. Although Nvidia invested a mere $3.7 million in voice-AI start-up SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) about a year ago, that investment put SoundHound squarely on the map as a potential AI winner.\n\nAfter making several accretive acquisitions and racking up an impressive customer list, SoundHound's stock has soared in recent weeks.\n\nIs this price increase a signal that SoundHound could be the next \"killer app\" AI platform? Or is it a sign of a bubble waiting to burst?\n\nWhy SoundHound has made a big noise lately\n\nSoundHound appears to have achieved escape velocity as the go-to voice-enabled AI system outside big tech, especially within the automotive and quick-serve restaurant (QSR) verticals. SoundHound has landed seven of the top 20 QSR brands, including heavyweight Chipotle, for things like phone and drive-through ordering. In automotive, SoundHound's voice AI is now embedded in many leading auto brands such as those owned by car giant Stellantis, as well as four major electric vehicle manufacturers as of last quarter.\n\nIn addition to those two big verticals, this past summer's acquisition of Amelia, another voice-based start-up for enterprises, has boosted SoundHound's enterprise platforms both for customer service applications and employee-facing IT AI applications.\n\nWhy SoundHound has an early lead in voice AI\n\nWhile the generative AI craze has only been happening for two years, SoundHound has actually been around since 2005, and first released its Houndify voice AI platform 10 years later in 2015. So, the company has been developing this technology for a long time.\n\nWhile SoundHound does incorporate other third-party large language models into its products when necessary, it has distinguished itself by building its own proprietary model called Polaris. Polaris is built on its two decades of experience spanning billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio in dozens of languages.\n\nSoundHound has only been building Polaris since LLM training was available, but the platform is already in use for one-third of the company's restaurant ordering transactions, while management aims to eventually use Polaris in all of SoundHound's interactions across its platform.\n\nIn the age of AI, having proprietary data to build one's own model or augment a general-purpose LLM -- in this case, SoundHound's billions of voice transaction data going back decades -- should be a competitive advantage.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai outlined the 2025 strategy, emphasizing consumer-focused AI, rapid development of agentic apps, a Chrome AI prototype called Project Mariner, and upgrades to Gemini and Project Astra, signaling a shift toward AI apps as the user interface for search.\n\nAlthough Pichai did not say Google is de-emphasizing the Google Search box, he did emphasize that 2025 will increase the focus on AI apps as the main point of contact between users and how they interact with Google.\n\nFor example, Project Mariner is a Chrome AI extension that can do things like take a top ten restaurants list from TripAdvisor and drop it into Google Maps.\n\nThis focus on AI shows that Google is in transition toward an AI-based user experiences that represent a larger interpretation of what Search means, a search experience that goes far beyond textual question and answering.\n\nSundar Pichai Did NOT Say ChatGPT Becoming Synonymous To AI\n\nContrary to what\u2019s being misreported elsewhere, Sundar Pichai did not say that ChatGPT is becoming synonymous to AI. An employee made that comparison in a question that was asked. That\u2019s a big difference between Pichai making that observation (he did not) and an employee suggesting that in a question.\n\nThe context of the phrase about ChatGPT becoming synonymous with AI was that it was asked in a question that Pichai answered.\n\nHere is how CNBC reported a comment submitted by an employee (emphasis mine):\n\n\u201cOne COMMENT read aloud by Pichai suggested that ChatGPT \u2018is becoming synonymous to AI the same way Google is to search,\u2019 with the QUESTIONER asking, \u2018What\u2019s our plan to combat this in the upcoming year? Or are we not focusing as much on consumer facing LLM?'\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s Future Hinges On AI\n\nGoogle CEO, Sundar Pichai, outlined a vision for 2025 that emphasizes an urgency to go back to its roots as a company that innovates quickly, what Pichai referred to as being \u201cscrappy\u201d which means being tough and resourceful, able to accomplish a lot in a quick amount of time (and fewer resources). Most importantly he emphasized solving real-world problems.\n\nHe also prioritizes \u201cbuilding big, new business\u201d which could mean creating new business opportunities with AI, reflecting a strong focus on AI as the engine for innovation in 2025.\n\nGemini App\n\nPichai also cited Gemini App as a central focus for 2025, commenting that they\u2019re experiencing growth with Gemini and that scaling broader adoption of Gemini will be a focus in 2025. This aligns with the observation that Google is increasingly focusing on a Search-adjacent approach to consumer focused AI products and services.\n\nWhat this means for SEO is that we really need to start thinking in terms of a bigger picture of what Search means. Perhaps 2025 will be, after over 15 years of Google\u2019s departure from the ten blue links paradigm, that the SEO community thinks deeper about what search means when it\u2019s multimodal.\n\nPichai was quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cWith the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months\u2026 But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well. \u2026Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year.\u201d\n\nAI Products Will \u201cEvolve Massively\u201d\n\nThe co-founder of Google Deep Mind was quoted as saying that Google was going to \u201cturbo charge\u201d the Gemini app, saying that:\n\n\u201c\u2026the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two.\u201d\n\nThat means that the Gemini app is going to gain more functionalities in a bid to make it more ubiquitous as the interface between potential website visitors and Google Search, a significant departure from interfacing with the search box.\n\nThis is something that publishers and SEOs need to think really hard about as we enter 2025. Google is focusing on increasing user adoption of the Gemini app. If that happens then that will mean more people interfacing with that instead of the Google Search box.\n\nUniversal Assistant (Project Astra)\n\nAnother thing that the SEO industry seriously needs to consider is Google\u2019s universal assistant that\u2019s code-named Project Astra. The Deep Mind co-founder is reported to have discussed their Universal Assistant, which what Project Astra is referred as.\n\nHe\u2019s quoted as saying that it can:\n\n\u201c\u2026seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device.\u201d\n\nWhat that word \u201cdomain\u201d means is that it can function across any subject, like answering questions about healthcare, directions, entertainment, over any topic. The part about modality is a reference to text, voice, images, and video.\n\nThis is a serious situation for SEO. Google\u2019s new Deep Research agentic search is an example of a disruptive technology that may have a negative impact on the web ecosystem.\n\nOne of the Google Deep Mind researchers cited as working on Project Astra is also listed as a co-inventor on a patent about controlling interactive AI agents through multi-modal inputs.\n\nThe patent is titled, Controlling Interactive Agents Using Multi-Modal Inputs. The description of the invention is:\n\n\u201cMethods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for controlling agents. In particular, an interactive agent can be controlled based on multi-modal inputs that include both an observation image and a natural language text sequence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just one of dozens of researchers cited as having worked on Project Astra. Astra is another one of the projects that Google is working on that replaces the traditional search box as people\u2019s point of contact for interacting with web data.\n\nTakeaway About Google\u2019s Plans For 2025\n\nThe takeaway from all this is that publishers and SEOs need to take a break from focusing solely on the search box and give some time to considering what\u2019s going on in multimodal AI. In 2025, AI is not just AI Overviews. AI is Gemini, it\u2019s new features coming to Gemini and possibly the release of features developed from Project Astra, a multimodal universal agent. Agentic Search is already here in the form of Gemini Deep Research. All of these are a departure from the traditional search box as the point of contact between users, Google and websites.\n\nRead the report on CNBC\n\nGoogle CEO Pichai tells employees to gear up for big 2025: \u2018The stakes are high\u2019\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Rokas Tenys"

            "article_content": "The new year is almost here, so the BGR staff named our favorite iPhone apps of 2024. Instead of fancy awards, we thought sharing the apps we used the most this year would be a great idea.\n\nWhile most of them were included in our coverage, there are also a few hidden gems to be found. Now, it\u2019s time to spread the word and share our favorite apps of the year so you can check them out for yourself.\n\nJonathan Geller, the Boy Genius himself, reveals his favorite app of 2024\n\nImage source: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\n\nBGR\u2018s founder, Jonathan Geller, knows a thing or two about the web. Our favorite leaker for the prime days of the iPhone is always ahead of the curve when discovering new trends and technologies. Interestingly, he believes the best iPhone app for 2024 is a well-known software for all of us tech enthusiasts, X.\n\nEasily the best news and social media app on the planet, X is raw and unfiltered. And so is life. In a world where curated narratives often dominate, I believe that you should be able to access information directly, filter, analyze, and think critically \u2014 qualities that are more important now than ever.\n\nZach Epstein, executive editor, loves Arc Search\n\nImage source: Arc\n\nZach is all about AI (my words, not his). He has tested every AI app he could find, even the sketchiest ones (also my words). None of them compare to Arc Search, his go-to app in 2024. He tells me:\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nGoogle search has become a disjointed mess that almost never returns useful results for me. I\u2019ve tried every alternative there is, and Arc Search is the best app I\u2019ve found for my needs. Each search basically returns an AI-generated webpage with concise bullet points and sources that are prominently displayed. Then, for things like local business searches, where conventional search still offers the best experience, you can configure a backup search engine of your choosing and switch to it with a single tap.\n\nIn addition to Arc Search, he wanted to give a shout-out to a news aggregator he loved using in 2024. It\u2019s called Particle News, and it\u2019s the one you should be using:\n\nI\u2019ve tried just about every AI news aggregator app that crawled out of the woodwork in 2024. There are a few good ones out there like Shades, but Particle News is a cut above the rest for me. It does a great job of generating AI summaries for each story, and source articles are a tap away when you want more info. It also lets you fine-tune your feed with more granular settings than any other AI news app I\u2019ve found.\n\nJacob Siegal, associate editor, knows there\u2019s only one right answer\n\nImage source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nIf you tested as many games and consoles as Jacob has, there\u2019s only one right answer for the best iPhone app of 2024: The Delta app.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple shocked the world by opening the App Store up to retro game emulators for the first time. Dozens of apps have sprung up in the months since, but none offer a more sleek, simple, or reliable solution than Delta. The emulator plays games from all of your favorite classic Nintendo consoles, from NES to DS, and supports popular wireless controllers, save states, custom controller skins, and even the ability to sync your games between devices. No other app had as big an impact on my iPhone in 2024.\n\nTo be fair, Jacob also tells me he\u2019s using Countdown for the official Nintendo Switch 2 release; I wonder if he knows when to expect the Nintendo Switch successor. He told me not to forget our favorite game of 2024: Pok\u00e9mon TCG Pocket.\n\nChris Smith, senior writer, is an aficionado for the Health and Fitness apps\n\niPadOS 17 brings a new Health app for iPad. Image source: Apple Inc.\n\nNot even the EU can stop Chris Smith from loving Apple apps. After a year focused on covering the European Commission\u2019s requirements for the App Store to become more competitive and less of a monopoly, Chris still thinks some of the best iPhone apps of 2024 are the Health and Fitness apps.\n\nChris is the runner I want to become someday, and it makes sense why these are his top choices:\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s default Health and fitness apps might not immediately come to mind when thinking about the best apps of the year, but they certainly tick that box for me. I\u2019m pairing them as they go hand in hand for my needs. I use an Apple Watch Series 10 with the iPhone not just to track all the health parameters the wearable supports but also to train for running marathons. The Health app tracks all the health data, while the Fitness app handles the workout data that comes from that. As a result, I check both of them routinely on the iPhone, even more so than other useful apps, like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT app, which now supports Advanced Voice Mode. The apps are all the more useful after the iOS 18 and watchOS 11 updates, which bring over the Vitals functionality. Vitals integrates with the Health and Fitness app to keep track of key parameters over time: Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Temperature, Blood Oxygen (in non-US markets), and Sleep Duration. The aggregated data can help you determine whether you should keep working out or take a rest day. Also, the Vitals algorithm can predict sickness or at least keep track of it. Finally, the new Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features deserve a mention. If you own AirPods Pro 2 and these features are available in your region, you can already use the new Health features in iOS 18. Even without an Apple Watch or AirPods Pro, the Health app can give you plenty of useful information about your activity, as the iPhone can still track some workout parameters.\n\nJos\u00e9 Adorno, tech news reporter, always chooses Gentler Streak\n\nImage source: Jos\u00e9 Adorno for BGR\n\nHey, it\u2019s me. Another year is over, but Gentler Streak is forever. I didn\u2019t let Chris choose Gentler Streak because I always love the opportunity to talk about how this app changed things for me. So let\u2019s quote me:\n\nI discovered Gentler Streak a few winters ago when Apple first promoted this app during American Heart Month. Since then, I\u2019ve been using and watching Gentler Streak grow season by season. The app evolved from a simple workout tracker, which by the time it was already doing an amazing job, to an all-in-one Wellbeing hub for Apple Watch users. The magic behind Gentler Streak, besides the lovely Yorhart, is the care with your wellbeing. It\u2019s not about closing your rings, but about how you can take care of yourself and your body. Every day, you can check your Activity Path and discover if it\u2019s a good day to workout or to rest. If you\u2019re undecided, Gentler Streak always recommends you to follow the latter. When you need guidance, the app offers Go Gentler tips with the practices you love the most. The app is always adding new features, and it has been praised by Apple a few times. If you want to make your New Year\u2019s resolutions something permanent, you can start by downloading Gentler Streak.\n\nI also need to mention my go-to hydration app, HidrateSpark. I\u2019ve been using it for two years, and it\u2019s the best combination of hardware and software. I just have to drink water from the bottle, and the app records my hydration throughout the day.\n\nJoshua Hawkins, science writer, is all about Clarymind\n\nImage source: Clarymind\n\nWhen he\u2019s not with his head on the stars and the Space, Josh loves to be on his phone. I mean, he used to. Clarymind has been one of his top apps of 2024 to end with his doom scrolling habit:\n\nA couple of months ago, I decided to try Clarymind to tackle my doomscrolling habit, and let me just say\u2014it\u2019s been a total game-changer. Seriously, this app has transformed how I spend my time on my phone. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through nonsense, I\u2019m more mindful and in control of my screen time. It\u2019s cut down SO much of the wasted \u201cbullshit\u201d time, and I feel so much better for it. Highly recommend giving it a shot if you\u2019re trying to reclaim your time and sanity!\n\nWrap up\n\nThese were our favorite iPhone apps of 2024. In a year marked by AI and fitness focus, the BGR team reflects on what developers are also focusing on. What\u2019s your favorite app of 2024? Send me a message at jose@bgr.com."

            "article_content": "A woman vanishes into thin air with a man who does not exist, a dreary village visited by a police party disappears the next day, a burly man suspected of murdering his wife dies mysteriously, and the police officer who witnesses this all is transported 30 years back to his class of 1986 as he steps inside the old building of his alma mater.\n\n\n\nThese are some of the stories in retired IPS officer and ex-chief of the National Security Guard (NSG) M.A. Ganapathy\u2019s debut book Whispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman. The book is unusual in more ways than one. Unlike most ex-cops who would write of tales of bravery, achievements, administrative ills, or insider info, Ganapathy detours towards a path less taken and fictionalises a policeman\u2019s life and gives it a paranormal twist, as if to make sense of many puzzling events he must have witnessed in his long and illustrious career.\n\nThis is an interesting choice given his writing about his work at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Ministry of Home Affairs, Central Industrial Security Force, and as the DGP of Uttarakhand before hanging his boots as the chief of the NSG earlier this year, could have made for a juicy read.\n\nHowever, the ex-cop takes the Ruskin Bond route of paranormal tales, who also serves as an inspiration. \u201cRuskin Bond\u2019s stories in this genre became my staple at one point, which I read several times over,\u201d Ganapathy writes about the much-loved writer, who, in turn, reviews the book as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy interest in the paranormal was fuelled in no small measure by the stories of certain odd events narrated by my grandfather, a retired forester, who had served in remote corners of South India,\u201d the author writes in the introduction, and it shows. While every short story in this quick-to-read book spanning just over 100 pages is engrossing, the tales where he absolutely shines are those set against forests with spirits and wildlife appearing periodically to seek redemption for the victims through a paranormal route.\n\nThe stories are told through the eyes of Avinash, a diligent and low-profile cop. The first book of any writer is an autobiography of sorts, they say, and it\u2019s evident in Ganapathy\u2019s work as he takes the readers through India\u2019s varied landscapes where he grew up and worked, from his native home in the Western Ghats and alma mater in Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the Naxal-hit regions of central India.\n\nUnlike how policemen are generally showcased in popular culture as either god-sent or pure evil, Ganapathy doesn\u2019t portray them as either but rather shines the light on the victims. And in the process, he also humanises his lot by focusing on what they experience on the field and their relationship with their work, colleagues, families, teachers, alma mater, and even the victims and the offenders. \u201cWhy do human beings inflict such unspeakable atrocities on other human beings, that too for an outdated ideology, he (Avinash) wondered,\u201d he writes, giving a peak into a policeman\u2019s psyche.\n\nWhispers in the Shadow isn\u2019t your typical horror read. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even use horror to spook the reader but to make sense of the difficult-to-comprehend events and offer closure where none exists. From spooky forest spirits to post-death experiences and time travel, Ganapathy employs just enough elements to make his debut book an interesting and captivating read.\n\nWhispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman\n\nAuthor: M.A. Ganapathy\n\nPublisher: Srishti Publishers and Distributors\n\nPages: 120\n\nPrice: Rs 299"

The next 12 months won\u2019t just bring audiences terrifying sequels like M3GAN 2.0 and 28 Years Later. Audiences will also witness new IPs being brought to life in films like The Monkey and Companion.\n\nNext year should present a healthy balance of familiar and original stories to cinemas and streaming, and these seven movies currently stand out as the most highly-anticipated horror movies of 2025.\n\n7. The Black Phone 2 \u2014 October 17, 2025\n\nUniversal Pictures / Universal Pictures\n\nThe Black Phone, the hit supernatural horror film from director Scott Derrickson, continues its chilling story with this long-awaited sequel. The Black Phone 2 will see the return of stars Mason Thames, Madeline Graw, and Ethan Hawke, the latter of whom played the terrifying serial killer, the Grabber.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering the Grabber\u2019s death at the end of the first film and the ending its young protagonists had, it seemed like the franchise couldn\u2019t go any further. However, since ghosts are an important part of the story, the sequel seems prime to bring the Grabber back to unleash another haunting on Finney and Gwen.\n\n6. Companion \u2014 January 31, 2025\n\nNew Line Cinema / New Line Cinema\n\nProduced by Zach Cregger, writer/director of the horror film Barbarian, Companion features a romance that goes straight to hell when a group of friends get together at a lavish lakeside estate. The film\u2019s darkly humorous trailer shares very little about the plot but does suggest plenty of blood and scares.\n\nIt also hints at a tense and disturbing look into the toxic relationship shared by its two leads, igniting a powder keg of death and terror that must be seen to be believed. The film also features a lead performance from rising Scream Queen Sophie Thatcher, which should attract horror fans\u2019 attention after her riveting performance in 2024\u2019s Heretic.\n\n5. The Monkey \u2014 February 21, 2025\n\nNeon\n\nFresh off the viral success of his chilling horror film Longlegs, director Osgood Perkins will release his adaptation of author Stephen King\u2019s short story The Monkey. This Neon and James Wan-produced film revolves around the titular cursed toy, which unleashes a series of bizarre and gruesome deaths, forcing two brothers to try and destroy it once and for all.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trailers for this film tease a wild but terrifying blend of Annabelle and Final Destination, making for one of the most unique and over-the-top King adaptations in recent memory.\n\n4. The Conjuring: Last Rites \u2014 September 5, 2025\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures / Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one of the most popular horror movie franchises in modern cinema, The Conjuring Universe will have all eyes on it as it closes the book on its fictionalized accounts of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The story surrounding this frightening fourth film is still unknown \u2014 however, the Warren family\u2019s several real-life cases exploring the supernatural allow for multiple creative possibilities.\n\nIn previous films, the Warrens have faced all sorts of possessions brought on by ghosts, demons, witches, and cursed dolls. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what The Conjuring franchise will unleash next with Last Rites, but it will surely be a fright fest for the ages.\n\n3. M3GAN 2.o \u2014 June 27, 2025\n\nUniversal Pictures / Universal Pictures\n\n2025 will be another big year for killer dolls, particularly due to the upcoming release of M3GAN 2.0 and the return of its titular dancing, slashing robot. It\u2019s unknown what this sci-fi horror sequel will present after the hit original film, which ended with Gemma and Cady destroying M3GAN\u2019s body and the evil AI transferring her consciousness to another machine.\n\nNevertheless, M3GAN seems geared toward exacting bloody vengeance on her former caretakers, making for another gruesome and satirical horror blockbuster for fans to enjoy.\n\n2. Frankenstein \u2014 2025\n\nUniversal Pictures / Universal Pictures\n\nLegendary filmmaker Guillermo del Toro returns to the director\u2019s chair with his adaptation of one of the horror genre\u2019s most popular stories ever. Considering del Toro\u2019s reverence of both Mary Shelley\u2019s source novel and the many films it spawned, 2025\u2019s Frankenstein will likely breathe new life into this iconic tale, adding to the resurgence of classic horror movies brought on by The Invisible Man, Nosferatu, and The Wolf Man.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, with an all-star cast including Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Mia Goth, and Christoph Waltz, this Netflix-exclusive film will surely electrify the internet once it premieres on streaming.\n\n1. 28 Years Later \u2014 June 20, 2025\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment / Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\nAfter over 20 years of waiting, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland have returned with their threequel to their iconic zombie movie 28 Days Later. Shot entirely on iPhones, 28 Years Later built up tremendous hype with its haunting teaser trailer, featuring glimpses of evolved zombies and a huge, post-apocalyptic war breaking out decades after the franchise\u2019s film.\n\nThis third movie won\u2019t just include new stars like Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes. It will also feature the return of actor Cillian Murphy, fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer. 28 Years Later even sets up a fourth movie set to premiere in 2026, reinvigorating this groundbreaking zombie franchise for modern audiences as one of the most hotly-anticipated horror blockbusters of 2025."

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

Simone is proving that the holiday season is more of an occasion than any to go all out in the outfit department.\n\nSharing a selection of wholesome yet overly stylish sartorial snaps to her Instagram over the weekend, the 29-year-old actress wore two enviable cosy outfits which we think would be perfect for NYE and beyond.\n\n\u00a9 @simoneashley A dramatic sleeve moment is quickly becoming a fashion statement\n\nThe first ensemble in the round-up was a matching white knit look, complete with over-the-top fluffy sleeve fringing, chunky silver buttons and symmetrically placed buttons. The snow-bunny-approved look screamed Martha May Whovier in the best way possible and was completed with a set of dainty silver earrings and her voluminous brunette locks worn out in a sweeping side part style.\n\nThe next high-fashion look on her style agenda took cues from one of the fashion-sets most notable trends this year- the \u2018no trousers\u2019 aesthetic.\n\n\u00a9 @simoneashley We will most definitely be recreating this look for NYE\n\nPosing in front of a fireplace hung with red stockings, Simone sat on the floor, a glass of red wine in hand (the only appropriate prop for some holiday downtime) wearing a set of sheer black tights, a set of pointed-toe slingbacks, a chunky grey knitted turtleneck and not much else. She scooped her naturally wavy tresses into a messy bun with a few face-framing strands left out to compliment her subtle fresh-faced makeup look.\n\n\u00a9 @simoneashley Simones matching pyjama set is just as chic as her previous looks\n\nFear not, if you thought Simone was all about dressing to the nines for the festive period, she also proved that she\u2019s just like us when it comes to lounging at home.

            "article_content": "Web scraping and data engineering can turn that wish into a reality. With these two, you can automate the process of gathering data from different websites and sources, processing, and organizing that data into useful actionable insights for your business. This facilitates faster and better decision-making, giving your business a competitive edge \u2013 all without the hassle of having to visit websites to manually collect, process, and organize data every now and then.\n\nEmploying web scraping services and solutions from a trusted web scraping company can help you save time, cut down manual labor, and obtain accurate, up-to-date data to allow your company to make better business decisions that would keep you ahead of the competition.\n\nWhat is web scraping?\n\nWeb scraping uses software tools to automate the process of extracting data from different websites and sources, including emerging market trends, customer reviews, stock prices, contact information, sentiment analysis, and competitor pricing. After it is extracted, the data is then converted from unstructured HTML content to structured information, making it easier to store, analyze, and use for market research, price intelligence, lead generation, or any other intended purpose. This structured format can be in the form of CSV, PDF, DOC files, or Excel spreadsheets.\n\nEssentially, web scraping provides businesses with an efficient way of collecting vast data from the web, making it a key tool for corporations in the current digital era.\n\nFor example, partnering with a data scraping company can provide access to advanced tools and expertise for extracting structured data efficiently and ethically.\n\nSo how does web scraping work?\n\nThere are a number of techniques that can be used to scrape data from the web; for instance:\n\nAPI scraping \u2013 this method uses an API (Application Programming Interface) provided in a specific website to access and extract data. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon, among others, include APIs that can be used to scrape and access data more easily and in a structured format.\n\nDOM parsing \u2013 in this method, the required data is retrieved from nodes on the webpage using DOM (Document Object Model), which transforms HTML code into a tree-like structure to make it easy to scrape the information.\n\nHTML parsing \u2013 in this web scraping approach, the HTML code is broken down into basic elements like classes, attributes, tags, and text content, making it easier to locate and scrape the relevant data.\n\nRegardless of the web scraping technique, each of these methods allows you to extract information from a website, process it, and create a data file (like a PDF or Excel spreadsheet) containing the scraped data. In general, the process includes requests being sent to a specific site\u2019s server using a bot, script, or program. After the HTML code is retrieved, the program then parses it to find specific data elements using \u201clocators\u201d like XPath, class names, or tags. Finally, the identified elements are used to get the necessary information, which is stored in a structured format like a PDF or CSV file.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say that your company wants to know the pricing of your competitors\u2019 products or services. Instead of going through the hassle of visiting their websites or social media pages to check individual products or services, you can employ the services of a web scraping company to automate the process. This includes special programs being used to analyze various web content and extract the specific data needed to eliminate the need for manually entering data. This way, the relevant data is automatically extracted across different sources, including social media platforms, blogs, e-commerce websites, and review aggregator sites, among others, and then organized in a structured format like PDF to make it easier to read, compare, and analyze.\n\nBenefits of web scraping and data engineering\n\nThe explosion of information on social media, e-commerce websites, and other websites in the past two decades has led to vast volumes of data. And with more and more organizations adopting data-driven approaches, web scraping has become a key tool for businesses to gain valuable insights. In fact, a recent Statista report shows that over 149 zettabytes of data have been generated, extracted, copied, and consumed in 2024 and projects that this figure will increase to over 394 zettabytes in the next 5 years. And with such exponential growth, data engineering and web scraping techniques are preferable over manual collection for a number of reasons, for example:\n\nCustomer analysis \u2013 web scraping allows you to study and understand customer behavior and sentiment based on reviews from different platforms, including social media and review aggregator sites like Yelp, Google My Business, and Capterra, among others.\n\nLead generation \u2013 employing web scraping services allows you to easily collect contact information from different platforms and create a list of potential clients that can also be used to create marketing campaigns.\n\nData aggregation \u2013 by automatically visiting and extracting relevant content from different sources and platforms, web scraping techniques make it easy to create a comprehensive database that can be used to provide key insights by a business to give them a competitive edge.\n\nPrice intelligence \u2013 using web scraping tools and programs, you can track real-time changes in products and services\u2019 pricing from different competitors\u2019 websites or social media platforms.\n\nMarket research \u2013 the data collected using web scraping and organized using data engineering techniques can be used to inform your company of the best business strategies to take based on the current market trends and competitor products and pricing.\n\nTo outsource or not to outsource web scraping services\n\nYou might think that web scraping is a simple process. After all, it only includes the few steps of identifying the target site, collecting the target pages\u2019 URL, making requests to the server to extract the relevant content, and saving the information in PDF or CSV files. However, you would be largely mistaken. While the process might be clear-cut for small web scraping tasks, it gets rather complex if you need to scrape data on a large scale or in other sophisticated situations.

(CRM) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 Noam Galai / Getty Images Entertainment via Getty Images\n\nOne colloquial phrase from the business world that has uniquely developed in the 21st century is \u201cCustomer Relationship Management\u201d or CRM, which was coined by the Gartner Group in the late 1990s. Both CRM, as well as \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d (SaaS), have since become synonymous with a San Francisco software management company that has become an industry behemoth, even taking \u201cCRM\u201d as its stock ticker.\n\nSalesforce Inc. (NYSE: CRM) is the world\u2019s largest provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services. Its SaaS platforms bridge the gap between companies and customers around the world, facilitating and personalizing sales management, customer service, and marketing. Its acquisitions of complementary software companies have filled gaps demanded by its customers, and have subsequently fueled Salesforce\u2019s extraordinary growth over the past decade.\n\nGrowth History Summary\n\nMUNGKHOOD STUDIO / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (January 2024), Salesforce\u2019s revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24%. Although a good part of the growth came from organic, big acquisitions \u2014 including Demandware, Mulesoft, Tableau, and Slack. These additions contributed substantially to expand the Salesforce ecosystem. After going into the black in fiscal 2017, Salesforce\u2019s net income continued to expand, notching a 44% CAGR from 2017 to 2024. The company also announced a $10 billion stock buyback and its first-ever dividend in 2024.\n\nChallenges\n\nRed Fox studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it was one of the earliest players in the CRM and SaaS arena, Salesforce would inevitably see competition, and not just from start-ups, as well as internal issues.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Dynamics 365 software for CRM challenges Salesforce head-to-head. Other rivals include Oracle\u2019s NetSuite, SAP, HubSpot, Zendesk, Insightly, and a dozen more.\n\nAs Salesforce has also entered the rapidly shifting AI rodeo, it has to devote considerable resources to its development and synchronous compatibility with its current products while keeping an eye on any industry of rivals\u2019 breakthroughs.\n\nActivist investors are pressuring management to cut costs and pause its big acquisitions.\n\nRegardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it\u2019s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on Salesforce Inc.\u2019s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers\u2019 own research.\n\nKey Points In This Article\n\nSalesforce sees currently untapped international emerging markets as fertile ground for future growth.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Einstein AI solutions suite, its DataCloud, and other new tech developments are foundational platforms and future developments are anticipated.\n\nQuantum Technology is also in Salesforce\u2019s R&D purview. Salesforce made an investment in quantum technology as a part of quantum sensing vendor Q-CTRL\u2019s $27.4 million series B extension funding in Jan. 2023.\n\nSalesforce also invested in Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC), a UK-based company specializing in quantum software and quantum computing, in May 2023.\n\n24/7 Wall Street has a free report to read on what may be \u201cthe next Nvidia\u201d if you click here . It features a software stock we\u2019re confident has 10X potential.\n\nSalesforce Stock News and Updates\n\n12/16/2024\n\nKeyCorp upgraded Salesforce\u2019s stock from a \u201csector weight\u201d to \u201coverweight\u201d in a recent report. The upgrade was largely drive by KeyCorp\u2019s enthusiasm for Agentforce, Salesforce\u2019s new AI offering for customer and employee support.\n\n12/9/2024\n\nWedbush analysts upgraded their projections for Salesforce\u2019s performance in the first quarter of 2026. They\u2019ve increased their earnings per share (EPS) estimate from $1.88 to $1.90. Wedbush maintains an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on Salesforce and has a price target of $375.\n\n12/3/2024\n\nSalesforce has lowered its earnings and revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025. The company now expects to earn between $2.57 and $2.62 per share (below the consensus estimate of $2.65). Revenue is projected between $9.9 billion and $10.1 billion (below the consensus estimate of $10.1 billion). Salesforce also lowered its full-year 2025 earnings guidance to a range of $9.98 to $10.03 per share.\n\n11/25/2024\n\nSalesforce is set to report its third-quarter earnings next week. After a mixed first half, the company is expected to deliver strong results. The recent launch of Agentforce AI has generated positive feedback and renewed interest in Salesforce\u2019s core products.\n\n11/18/2024\n\nToday, Salesforce finalized its acquisition of Own, an Israeli cloud backup company. This is Salesforce\u2019s biggest purchase since 2021 when the company acquired Slack in a $28 billion deal.\n\n11/11/2024\n\nSalesforce was one of the top performers in the enterprise software sector today. The company\u2019s shares surged 6%, driven by Salesforce\u2019s recent announcement to hire 1,000 employees to bolster its new generative AI platform, Agentforce.\n\n11/7/2024\n\nSalesforce India has surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark. The company experienced a 36% growth in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Much of this growth has been attributed to the rapid economic expansion in India, as well as the increase of digital technologies across industries in the country. India is a major hub for Salesforce, with over 2 million skilled professionals making it the second-largest Salesforce community in the world (after the United States).\n\n5 to 10 Year Review\n\nJerod Harris / Getty Images for i.amPULS\n\nSalesforce\u2019s phenomenal growth over the past decade has been fed by strategically savvy acquisitions that have filled critical gaps in their SaaS package offerings. Starting in mid-2013, the company spent $2.5 billion for ExactTarget, which supplied cloud marketing tools to integrate Salesforce management technology with digital marketing campaigns.\n\n2016 saw the $2.8 billion purchase of Demandware, now rebranded as Salesforce CommerceCloud. It is the company\u2019s e-commerce platform, fully integrated with Einstein AI. The need to sync the different cloud based operations and data metrics was satisfied by the $6.5 billion acquisition of MuleSoft for digital integration in 2018. Analytics software platform Tableau followed in 2019 for $15.7 billion. Finally, intraoffice and company personnel collaboration and communication platform Slack was added to Salesforce in 2021 for the sum of $27.7 billion.\n\nThe large expenditures have benefitted Salesforce\u2019s growth but have understandably made earnings erratic, which has raised the ire of some activist investors.\n\nFiscal Year (Jan. 31) Price Revenues Net Income 2016 $68.08 $6.667B (-$47.4M) 2017 $79.10 $8.437B $323M 2018 $113.91 $10.540B $360M 2019 $151.97 $13.282B $1.110B 2020 $182.31 $17.098B $126M 2021 $225.56 $21.252B $4.072B 2022 $232.63 $26.492B $1.444B 2023 $167.97 $31.352B $208M 2024 $281.09 $34.857B $4.136B 2024 (LTM) $252.90 $36.465B $5.632B\n\nKey Drivers for Salesforce Inc.\u2019s Future\n\nTippaPatt / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancial Health : Salesforce has a strong $8.24 billion net cash surplus position relative to debt.\n\nBrand Strength : Salesforce is the current CRM \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d and commands strong brand recognition in the CRM space (including its stock ticker). This brand strength is leveraged with its newest products, which subsequently bring in customers to subscribe to the entire Salesforce ecosystem, rather than the more expensive and cumbersome option of piecemealing different software platforms for CRM.\n\nR&D : Salesforce\u2019s continued R&D with AI, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing Technology should help it maintain its \u201cleader of the pack\u201d position in the CRM space.\n\nInternational Marketing and Sales : This demographic will be the next big growth target for Salesforce. This will help to offset its focus on primary market large players, which necessitate longer sales cycles and are subject to more competition from rivals.\n\nStock Price Prediction for 2025\n\nAndriy Onufriyenko / Moment via Getty Images\n\nA consensus taken from 44 different Wall Street analysts predicted Salesforce\u2019s price target in 12 months to be $310.00. This calculates as a loss of -8.41% from today\u2019s stock price of $338.45. The overall average recommendation was \u201coutperform\u201d.\n\nBased on our assessment of the financials, 24/7 Wall Street projects a somewhat more conservative target price of $302.00. The departure of the highly regarded CFO, Amy Weaver, is a negative. Her enviable track record managing restructuring efforts and the level of respect she commands on Wall Street cannot be disregarded. Although she will remain as an advisor once her successor has been selected, the comfort of a smooth transition is not guaranteed.\n\nSalesforce Inc.\u2019s Next 5 Years\u2019 Outlook\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nAs Salesforce\u2019s Fiscal Year 2026 ends January 31, 2026, the events that drive its stock performance occur predominantly throughout 2025. 24/7 Wall Street projects a stock price of $333.90, a gain of -1.34% from today\u2019s stock price of $338.45.\n\nThe integration of blockchain technology into Salesforce\u2019s product offerings is expected to be a key driver sometime in 2025. With cybersecurity breaches multiplying by the month, the ability to repel CRM platform hackers is vitally important to enterprise customers. FY 2026 should also see the start of the rewards from its international initiatives, which will likely manifest writ large throughout 2026 for FY 2027.\n\nFY 2027 will likely begin to see the primary fruits from the international sales and marketing initiated during the latter part of FY 2024 and all of 2025. A target price of $380.70 would represent a 12.48% gain from today\u2019s stock price of $338.45.\n\n\n\nEuropean business accounted for roughly 23.5% and Asia Pacific 10.1%. It is predicted by several analysts to grow to 21.6% of total revenues by or before FY 2027. Salesforce\u2019s expansion into emerging markets is also likely to accelerate, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa. This is untapped territory which can be a deep source of new revenue streams that can offset risks from established markets due to geopolitical and economic factors.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce\u2019s investments in edge computing solutions should enhance its competitive advantage in the IoT space. Integration of Einstein AI for hybrid workers who spend half or more of their work time from home may likely become early converts to these additional digital tools.\n\nThe 2028 stock price target is anticipated to be $412.80.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s focus on customization towards vertical-specific CRM solutions is expected to bear fruit in 2027. By tailoring its offerings to industries such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing, the company expects to capture a larger market share and increase customer retention.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s continued development of low-code and no-code platforms will likely also contribute its part to attracting a broader customer base.\n\nFY 2029 is projecting the completion of its integration of advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities into Salesforce\u2019s products. This technology may significantly enhance customer service automation and data analysis, providing an additional competitive edge. Salesforce\u2019s R&D in quantum computing research, building on its investments in Q-CNTRL and CQC, should also begin to yield practical applications, thus potentially opening new avenues for growth and innovation.\n\nDigital twin technology with VR is another new vista for Salesforce currently in R&D, but may possibly be prepared to launch during 2028-29. By creating virtual replicas of physical systems, the company may offer unprecedented insights and optimization capabilities to its customers.\n\n$451.50 is 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s projected stock price for FY 2029, a 33.40% gain from today\u2019s stock price of $338.45.\n\nSalesforce Inc. Stock in 2030\n\nJasonDoiy / iStock Unreleased via Getty Images\n\nIn FY 2030, we predict Salesforce can hit a stock price of $493.80, a 45.90% increase from today\u2019s stock price of $338.45.\n\n\n\nBy 2029-2030, Salesforce\u2019s R&D investments in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies may be ready for prime-time commercialization.\n\nThese immersive technologies could revolutionize customer engagement and data visualization, potentially opening new revenue streams. As Salesforce expands its offerings, it may face increased competition from other enterprise software providers like ServiceNow.\n\nOne other aspect of Salesforce not yet mentioned, since when its impact may become manifest is unknown, is its venture capital work in tech startups. Salesforce Ventures has a $500 million Generative AI Fund that includes a $200 million investment in Hugging Face, the largest open-source AI community on Earth. Salesforce\u2019s presence in Hugging Face is strategically intended to expose Hugging Face using entrepreneurs to Salesforce\u2019s CRM products in a soft sell approach that can potentially reap billions as these startup companies take off.\n\nFiscal Year Normalized EPS P/E Ratio Projected Stock Price 2025 $10.06 30 $302.00 2026 $11.13 30 $333.90 2027 $12.69 30 $380.70 2028 $13.73 30 $412.80 2029 $15.05 30 $451.50 2030 $16.46 30 $493.80\n\nWant to Retire Early?

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nTime and again, Data Science has made its mark on human society. It is repeatedly making headlines in newspapers and magazines. It mainly involves getting insights from huge datasets and making decisions based on the analysed data.\n\nData Science is significant as it helps companies to optimise their process. Companies can also predict trends and find answers to difficult questions with the help of it. Machine Learning plays an important part in this whole process.\n\nMachine Learning transforms Data Science processes by automating repetitive and boring tasks. It also helps in identifying patterns in data and improving the accuracy of prediction. The aim of this article is to explore how Machine Learning enhances each stage of the Data Science process.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Machine Learning, then you need to enrol in free Data Science courses and learn Data Science free. Hence, you can focus on your learning without worrying about financial limitations.\n\nCore Components of Data Science Processes\n\nNow, we\u2019ll look at the core components of Data Science processes. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, Data Science focuses on getting insights from raw data. It follows a systematic approach in this process. There are several steps involved, and each step plays an important role. Let\u2019s explore these steps in detail.\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nData collection and preprocessing is the first step in the Data Science process. Data collection involves getting relevant and appropriate data. The data can come from various sources like databases, APIs and manual inputs. It is important to collect data appropriately as it lays down the foundation for correct analysis.\n\nWhen raw data is collected, it has inconsistencies like missing values, duplicates, or outliers. Here comes the role of data preprocessing. It involves cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.\n\nSeveral techniques like imputation, normalisation, and feature engineering are also used in this step. These techniques make the data ready for later stages of the Data Science process. It is important to invest time in preprocessing as it reduces errors and improves the accuracy of the model.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the second step in the Data Science process. It helps in discovering patterns in the data. It also helps in uncovering the trends and relationships within the data. In this step, statistical methods and visualisation tools are used. These help in better understanding the characteristics of data.\n\nEDA gives you the roadmap for modelling by plotting distributions and identifying correlations. It\u2019ll also help you with detecting anomalies in the data. With the help of EDA analysts can make crucial decisions like selecting appropriate features. It also helps in handling uneven data.\n\nMany tools are used in this process like Pandas and Matplotlib library of Python. Other than this, Tableau and PowerBI are also used to make this process effective.\n\nModelling, Evaluation, and Deployment\n\nModelling, evaluation and deployment is the third step in the Data Science process. Let\u2019s look at them briefly one by one.\n\nModelling is like the heart of Data Science. It uses Machine Learning algorithms to transform data into actionable insights. In this step, Data Scientists will select and train models. These models will then be tuned to achieve optimal performance.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the next step i.e. the evaluation process. It ensures that the model is performing well on both trained and untrained data. You might not know this, but various metrics are also used in this step.\n\nFor example, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score are used to measure the effectiveness of a model.\n\nFinally comes the deployment process. In this process, the model is integrated into real-world systems. It enables automated predictions and decision-making. It ensures that the project gives value and enables ongoing improvements.\n\nHow Machine Learning Optimises Each Step\n\nNow, in this section, I\u2019m going to tell you how Machine Learning is revolutionising each step of the Data Science process. I\u2019m going to tell you how ML improves efficiency and accuracy at every stage. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nAutomating Data Preprocessing and Cleaning\n\nAlthough data preprocessing is a crucial step in Data Science, it\u2019s also a time-consuming process. Machine Learning algorithms play the magic here by simplifying this process. ML algorithms automate tasks like missing value imputation and outlier detection. Not only this, but data normalisation is also automated by these algorithms.\n\nFor instance, Machine Learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) estimate missing values based on patterns in the data. On the other hand, clustering algorithms identify and handle outliers in the data.\n\nMoreover, advanced tools like AutoML streamline feature scaling and encoding. It makes sure that your data is ready for analysis. Thus, all this automation helps in reducing manual work and improving the quality of input data. Thus, it directly impacts the reliability of downstream models.\n\nEnhancing EDA with ML-Driven Insights\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously mentioned, EDA helps in uncovering trends and correlations in data sets. It also helps you with finding anomalies in the data. The traditional EDA process uses visualisation and basic statistics. But here, Machine Learning takes it one step further.\n\nIf used, unsupervised Machine Learning techniques will be very fruitful. For instance, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) find dominant patterns. On the other hand, clustering algorithms will reveal natural groupings in the data.\n\nDo you know that ML-powered tools can also generate automated insights? These tools will highlight relationships in the data that might not be immediately noticed. Thus, ML enhances the EDA process and allows Data Scientists to focus on strategic problem-solving instead of manual exploration.\n\nImproving Prediction Accuracy and Model Selection\n\nYou might be surprised to know how Machine Learning improves prediction accuracy. To make this work, it uses advanced algorithms like ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and neural networks.\n\nAutoML frameworks are used to analyse multiple models. It also evaluates the model\u2019s performance and recommends the best one for the task. Besides this, hyperparameter tuning using ML techniques is used to ensure more optimal performance. Thus, Machine Learning maximises the model\u2019s predictive power with minimal manual intervention by streamlining model selection and optimisation.\n\nWrapping up\n\nData Science is making innovations daily, and Machine Learning plays an important role in this process. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques are used in every stage of the Data Science process. It automates repetitive tasks, enhances the EDA process and improves the prediction accuracy of the model.\n\nIn fact, the Data Science field is booming as of now and generating many career opportunities for individuals. Salaries are also lucrative for those who have the right knowledge and skills. It is high time for you to learn Data Science now. You will be surprised to know that you can also learn Data Science for free.\n\nI highly recommend you to join Pickl.AI as it offers one of the best free Data Science courses for beginners and professionals.

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Apple\u2019s new Enhanced Visual Search in Photos uses machine learning to recognize things like landmarks.\n\nThe service works by sharing encrypted data from your pictures with Apple, and includes privacy safeguards.\n\nSome users are still concerned that Enhanced Visual Search is enabled by default, rather than having you opt in.\n\nThere are a million different ways to think about privacy, evaluating the balance between how much of it we want to cede, and what benefits we get for doing so. With our devices, and our increasing reliance on AI tools like machine learning, a convenient line to draw when making such evaluations is that between processes that occur fully locally, and those that require working on data remotely in the cloud. Right now, Apple users are raising the alarm about the privacy implications of the new Enhanced Visual Search in Photos, and the data it shares with Apple by default.\n\nOver the weekend, software engineer Jeff Johnson got this ball rolling by sharing his concerns about the presence of a new Enhanced Visual Search option that appears in both iOS 18 and on macOS 15 (via 91mobiles). The tool attempts to add value to your photos by identifying stuff like landmarks, matching elements of their construction with a database Apple\u2019s compiled. Apple describes the feature and outlines its privacy practices as such: Enhanced Visual Search in Photos allows you to search for photos using landmarks or points of interest. Your device privately matches places in your photos to a global index Apple maintains on our servers. We apply homomorphic encryption and differential privacy, and use an OHTTP relay that hides IP address. This prevents Apple from learning about the information in your photos. While the company goes on to provide instructions for turning Enhanced Visual Search off, Johnson is quick to point out that this service comes enabled by default on both iOS and macOS. That means that unless you take positive steps to the contrary, information from the pictures you shoot will end up being sent to Apple.\n\nNow, before we start getting too paranoid here, it\u2019s clear that Apple is taking some legitimate steps to mitigate the possible privacy impact. The homomorphic encryption the company mentions, for instance, means that this is a system that allows Apple\u2019s cloud servers to work on your data while it\u2019s still encrypted, rather than having to decrypt it (and potentially expose private location details) first.\n\nEven if we\u2019re to assume that system works flawlessly, some users are just not going to be comfortable having a tool like this involve sending their data to the cloud. But what feels like the greater offense may be the way it\u2019s been enabled for everyone by default, rather than asking user to opt in.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about Enhanced Visual Search and would rather just turn it off, you can find the toggle under Photos settings on your iPhone or in General settings on Macs.\n\nGot a tip?

            "article_content": "In the ferocious civil war between ethnic rebel groups and the junta (military) in Myanmar, the Arakan Army, the biggest of all the rebel groups, is now in control of large parts of the Rakhine province. The security dynamics along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh have considerably altered in the second week of December as the junta lost control over the area.\n\nThis uncertainty is bound to have a spillover effect along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, raising concerns of a fresh wave of Rohingya refugees attempting to escape the region. Myanmar has been consumed by civil war after the military coup in 2021, which ousted the democratically-run government.\n\nFor the world grappling with wars in Europe and West Asia, Myanmar's strife is forgotten. Except as the looming reality for its neighbours, the world doesn't seem to remember the disastrous events unfolding within Myanmar and the volatile politics consuming it. India is closely watching the developments as there may be implications.\n\nWhy the continuing strife?\n\nDeprived of fair play, various ethnic armed organisations like the Arakan Army have been battling the military since independence for autonomy and control of beneficial resources.\n\nThe Arakan Army is part of the anti-junta group called Three Brotherhood Alliance (the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army are the other two). The same alliance had initiated an assault in October 2023, gaining several considerable wins along Myanmar's border with China.\n\nIn August this year, the alliance gained command of the north-eastern town of Lashio, indicating the first capture of a regional military command in Myanmar's history.\n\nThere are even reports that the Arakan Army now commands areas inside Bangladesh along the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and that may lead to a fight between Bangladesh Army and the Arakan Army and exacerbate the security crisis in the region.\n\nExperts say the Arakan Army operates as the military wing of the ULA (United League of Arakan), the political organisation of the Buddhist people in Myanmar's western Rakhine state.\n\nIn the last 15 months, the Arakan Army has gained ground, capturing dozens of townships and military outposts. The group's continuous capture of regions in its fold have raised questions about its motive.\n\nMyanmar has never recognised the Rohingya community residing in the Rakhine province as its citizens. In 2017, after a brutal crackdown on Rohingya villages by Myanmar's military, hundreds of thousands Rohingya fled across the border into neighbouring Bangladesh to escape the atrocities. India has faced an influx of Rohingya refugees since then.\n\nAs of now, keeping a larger picture of Rakhine province's autonomy, the Arakan Army wants to project the Rohingya as their own, but in the past, the organisation is known to have committed deadly atrocities against the community.\n\nHighlighting the events of the region, Sripathi Narayanan, foreign and security policy analyst, said, \"The Rohingya have been used as cannon fodder by both the junta and the rebels. Much of the supplies of the AA (Arakan Army) come from across the western border of Myanmar. The communities across the border also share fraternal ties with one another.\"\n\nIndia's interests\n\nIndia's attitude towards Myanmar has been mixed as it has been facing its own problems in the northeast, particularly in Manipur, for the past 20 months, and the arrival of Christian and Buddhist refugees from Myanmar have further complicated the issues.\n\nThere are fears about advanced weaponry in the hands of Myanmar's rebel groups reaching terrorist groups operating in India's northeastern states. Also, there are reports of Myanmar's rebel groups increasing drug trafficking activities to raise funds, which is another major concern for India.\n\nSensing the risks, the Centre recently tightened the rules for the movement of people from either side of the border in India and Myanmar. The new rules further restrict the movement of people from 16 km under the free movement regime (FMR) to 10 km now, on either side.\n\nA common trait of the ever-altering political scenario of India's neighbourhood - be it Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Myanmar - is their growing reliance on China. This offers Beijing with chances to further contain India's influence in the Global South as a part of its known strategy.\n\nThe political turmoil in Myanmar and Bangladesh can be used by China to its advantage to foment further internal troubles in the northeastern border states of India.\n\nChina has been engaging with the junta and the rebel groups to derive the maximum protection of its own interests in Myanmar. Beijing has invested billions into the country's oil and gas sector, as well as other physical infrastructure. The Myanmar military controls Kyaukphyu, a major town in Rakhine state that is the terminus of a $1.5 billion oil pipeline and a parallel natural gas pipeline running to Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province in southwestern China.\n\nThe pipelines are a major part of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which is an important part of Beijing's ambitious BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).\n\nWith the help of the Arakan Army, China also wants to keep an eye on India's Kaladan project in Rakhine, which is meant to connect the Bay of Bengal with India's northeast. However, the Kaladan project, which entails building new port facilities at Sittwe (Rakhine province capital), a river transit system and a road to India's Mizoram state, seems to be delayed. It would have also reduced India's dependence on Bangladesh for its transit routes. Now, India may have to engage with the Arakan Army, a non-state actor, for starting the delayed project work.\n\nIndia is engaging both with the rebel group and the military government, and has initiated other diplomatic channels.\n\n\"In the past few months, India has started benign engagement with the rebel groups/EAOs (also called Ethnic Armed Organisations) in the regions bordering India because we want to keep our strategic interests of protecting the northeast region at priority,\" says Cchavi Vasisht, senior research associate, Chintan Research Foundation.\n\n\"We need to make further efforts to increase our engagements with AA. To protect our bordering areas as well as the Kaladan project which crosses through the Rakhine state,\" she adds.\n\nAs a way out, there is a need to facilitate dialogue between the rebel groups and junta for initiating an inclusive democratic process where all communities have a say. \"India has been vocalising its concerns with respect to Myanmar, it wants a smooth transition of the country into a federal and democratic setup,\" says Ms Vasisht."

            "article_content": "The big picture: A combination of buyer strategies and market conditions are expected to drive DRAM prices down across the board in the first quarter of 2025. As outlined in TrendForce's latest market report, PC OEMs accelerated inventory reduction efforts in Q4 2024. The strategy is expected to persist into the first quarter of next year, further suppressing bit procurement volumes.\n\nDDR4 price declines, in particular, are expected to accelerate due in part to sluggish consumer demand, increased production from Chinese suppliers, and low-priced chips flooding the market. As a result, PC DRAM prices are expected to drop by eight to 13 percent.\n\nServer DRAM pricing \u2013 both DDR4 and DDR5 \u2013 is expected to weaken in part because of slow seasonal demand. Manufacturers have also started shifting DDR4 capacity to DDR5 production, while others are moving HBM production to focus on DDR5. As a result, server DRAM prices as a whole could fall by five to 10 percent in Q1 as DDR4 price declines accelerate.\n\nMemory for mobile solutions and graphics products will also be impacted. Smartphone manufacturers have spent the past two quarters adjusting DRAM stockpiles, which will allow them to maintain a passive procurement strategy in Q1 2025 in hopes of attaining more favorable contract pricing. As such, TrendForce expects contract pricing for LPDDR4X and LPDDR5X to fall by eight to 13 percent and three to eight percent, respectively, in Q1 2025.\n\nGDDR7 stockpiling for next-gen GPUs will help graphics DRAM pricing but even still, broader DRAM market weakness and heightened inventories will impact the market. TrendForce expects to see graphics DRAM market prices decline by an average of five to 10 percent in Q1.\n\nRelated reading: Cheap vs. Premium DDR5: Stock vs. EXPO/XMP Memory\n\nFor the average consumer looking to pick up a new kit of DDR4 or DDR5 memory for a new build or an existing rig, now is a great time to do so. Prices are low and with post-holiday sales, you can save even more. This 32GB kit of G.Skill DDR4, for example, is under $50 over on Newegg."

            "article_content": "The global technology sector is at a crossroads of innovation and environmental responsibility. As digital transformation continues, the sector is redefining its role in solving climate concerns, transitioning from a major energy consumer to a potential builder for global sustainability.\n\nThe Transformative Invisible\n\nUnder the modern gadgets and slick user interfaces is a significant change in the architecture of technology. This move, according to Mr. Praveen Joshi, Managing Director of RSK Business Solutions, is a basic rethinking of technology advancement rather than a choice.\n\n\"We're no longer talking about sustainability as a peripheral concern,\" says Mr. Praveen Joshi, with three decades of experience. \"It's now embedded in the core DNA of technological innovation.\"\n\nEnergy Efficiency: Not Just Buzzwords\n\nA significant change has occurred in modern data centres. Sophisticated cooling systems, enhanced power management algorithms, and renewable energy integration have all significantly decreased carbon footprints. Machine learning now optimises energy consumption in real time, resulting in intelligent systems that adapt and reduce waste.\n\n\"The use of AI plays an important part in this transformation,\" Mr. Praveen continues. Energy consumption trends are analysed by complex algorithms, which find inefficiencies and provide quick solutions. These ideas have the effect of lowering energy consumption across the world's technological infrastructure.\n\nThe Circular Economy in Technology Manufacturing\n\nThe old sequential \"produce, use, discard\" paradigm is going out of style. Technology manufacturers are adopting extensive recycling and refurbishment operations. Modular architecture simplifies component replacement, increasing device lifespans and omitting electronic waste.\n\nInnovative material science has resulted in biodegradable and recyclable components. Semiconductors, traditionally considered environmental hazards, are increasingly being constructed with recyclable use in mind. With this method, electronic waste is converted from a resource that might damage the environment to a probable resource.\n\nCloud Computing's Green Revolution\n\n\u201cGreen cloud computing is about reimagining data centres with energy-efficient technologies like SSDs, DVFS, and AI-driven cooling systems, transforming them into hubs of sustainability while driving the digital future.\u201d Mr. Varinder Singh Jawanda, CEO of Millennium Automation Systems Limited (MASL). Shared infrastructure means reduced individual energy consumption, with sophisticated load-balancing techniques minimizing wasted computational power.\n\nVirtualization technologies have been instrumental in this transformation. A single physical server now hosts multiple virtual environments, dramatically reducing the hardware footprint and associated energy requirements.\n\nSoftware: The Invisible Sustainability Champion\n\nSoftware engineering has emerged as an unexpected hero in sustainability efforts. Developers are now integrating energy efficiency directly into code architecture. Programming languages and development frameworks increasingly include tools that measure and optimize energy consumption.\n\n\"Energy-efficient software is redefining sustainability through smarter coding and architecture. By optimizing algorithms, adopting energy-efficient programming languages, and reducing unnecessary data transfers, developers can significantly lower power consumption. Efficient architectures that minimize data exchange, optimize caching, and integrate low-power hardware further enhance energy savings. Lifecycle assessments and refactoring unused code ensure ongoing environmental benefits, making software a key driver of green innovation.,\" explains Mr. Jawanda.\n\nThe Human Element\n\nSustainability in technology isn't just about infrastructure\u2014it's about people. Training programs are equipping technology professionals with skills in green computing, creating a new generation of environmentally conscious innovators.\n\nCorporate cultures are shifting, with performance metrics now including environmental impact alongside traditional financial indicators. This holistic approach ensures that sustainability becomes more than a department\u2014it becomes an organizational philosophy.\n\nEconomic Implications\n\nThe transition to sustainable IT practices is not a cost centre but an economic opportunity. Reduced energy consumption translates to significant financial savings. Companies investing in green technologies are seeing improved operational efficiency and enhanced market reputation.\n\nVenture capital is increasingly flowing into technologies that promise both environmental and economic returns. This financial ecosystem is accelerating innovation, creating a positive feedback loop of sustainable technological development.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe journey towards truly sustainable technology is ongoing. Challenges remain, but the momentum is undeniable. Technological innovation is no longer just about what can be created but about how it can be created responsibly.\n\nMr Jawanda concludes, \"The road ahead for sustainability in IT lies in harmonizing innovation with responsibility, embracing energy-efficient software, green data centres, and AI-driven optimizations, while aligning every digital advance with measurable environmental impact.\"\n\nThe technology sector has transformed from a potential environmental challenge to a critical part of the global sustainability solution. Each innovation, each line of code, and each design choice now carries the potential to reshape our environmental future."

You brother, are also completely insane :).\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nAnother penned: \u201cThere isn't enough money in this world that could make me crawl through these caverns. Props to all content creators for risking their lives for this kind of footage <3.\u201d\n\nSomeone else said: \u201cThis is absolutely wild. Cavers are a whole different breed. The amount of second hand claustrophobia I had watching this was insane. Awesome video.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

More info\n\nAn orange ball of light in the skies over a Scots town has been recorded on a database of potential UFO sightings.\n\nOne user took to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) \u2013 a US-based non-profit organization composed of civilian volunteers who study reported UFO sightings \u2013 to share the details of the alleged sighting over Alva, Clackmannanshire, just days before Christmas.\n\nAccording to the report filed with the MUFON database, the person witnessed a \u201chuge bright object\u201d that moved slowly, from north to south.\n\nThe report on the database reads: \u201cOrange colour, regular ball. No sounds. No position lights \u2013 like red and green in a plane. Maybe 200-300-feet above ground level.\n\n\u201cVisible for minute or two at 11.23pm. Disappeared in a second. My son took a photo, but the camera was on 1 second exposure and you can\u2019t see a ball but a direction of movement.\u201d\n\nHowever no photo was published along with the report.\n\nThe sighting took place shortly before 11.30pm on Sunday, December 22, and was reported to MUFON two days later, on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe Forth Valley area has become a hotbed for UFO activity in recent years.\n\nIn June 2017, a Bannockburn woman claimed that she spotted a UFO that had left her unable to sleep at night. The then 42-year-old, who did not wish to be named, detail her jaw-dropping sighting in Hillpark, Bannockburn. She said: \u201cThe size of it was unreal. It was about 20ft away from and I\u2019d say it was about 100ft in diameter.\n\n\u201cEven if it was a military thing, why was it coming down a quiet street?\n\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I would say it was a spaceship.\n\n\u201cI could see writing on the top of it as well, like Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\n\u201cIt has been a few sleepless nights for me since it.\u201d\n\nClick here for more news and sport from the Stirling area.\n\nIn September 2018, a video surfaced online apparently showing an unidentified aircraft on fire and in distress in the skies above Kippen. The video was posted by a Youtube channel titled UFO Today and was submitted by an anonymous female subscriber who lives near the village.\n\nThe video was captured on Saturday, September 1, 2018, after the woman heard a loud bang outside. She rushed to her balcony with her camera and she noticed what she described as \u201ca UFO flying erratically near a hill\u201d.\n\nIn the video, the object can be seen to be seemingly on fire, with flames and sparks emitting from it. The object was rapidly changing altitude and direction before tailing off and seemingly disappearing.\n\nIn October 2019, an eagle-eyed UFO hunter claimed to have seen the strange phenomenon over Stirling. The anonymous spotter noted that there had been fireworks being set off in the area around the time but said that the glowing object appeared in the sky for several minutes.\n\nIn the incident report of the sighting, they said: \u201cThere was also fireworks on at the time but the white kind of circle shapes (were) moving fast and diagonal, left and right, moving away fast and coming back to the spot in sky that was visible to this. (It) lasted about five minutes.\u201d\n\nJust days later, another man claimed to have seen mysterious lights in the sky just days after report The stargazer claims to have been on Tak Ma Doon Road, near to the Carron Valley Reservoir, when he and a friend spotted \u201cvery strange\u201d, quick moving white oval lights flying over head. He told how the lights moved without making a sound and said that they were \u201cmost definitely not any sort of thing that has been man-made\u201d.\n\nIn September 2020, a Dunblane man claimed to have come into close contact with a UFO in the town in a late-night encounter. The man, who did not wish to be identified, said that he was awoken in the dead of night by a bright, glowing light shining in his bedroom window. He had been fast asleep when he was roused at around 2am.\n\nHe said: \u201cI walked over to the window and looked out. I saw a bright white ball of light, which measured about 15 feet across. It couldn\u2019t have been any more than 15 feet from me. It made a low humming noise, but oddly there was absolutely no heat coming from it, which I thought was strange for something shining so bright.\u201d\n\nThe man, who has a background in engineering, says that the ball of light was soon joined by two others and they then set off, moving slowly, estimated to be around 5mph, over his house off in the direction of Doune.\n\nOn the bizarre encounter the man said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly frightened, I was more interested in what I was seeing. I don\u2019t know exactly what it was, but it certainly seemed to have been being controlled.\u201d"

            "article_content": "People often wonder why bad things happen to good people. Or, why bad things happen at all, really.\n\nSome use this as part of their basis for atheism, saying that they don\u2019t understand why God would allow bad things to happen. Others have not let this deter them from seeking out and finding religion.\n\nBut, if these questions could be answered, wouldn\u2019t everyone feel at least a bit more satisfied?\n\nOne pastor thinks he knows why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening.\n\nA man named Jeremy, who identified himself as \u201ca deep skeptic [and] also a pastor,\u201d believes that quantum physics holds the age-old answer to why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe shared his theory on TikTok.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pastor began by explaining the basics of quantum physics.\n\n\u201cSo we exist in four dimensions, which is really interesting \u2018cause most people think we exist in three dimensions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, uh, it\u2019s actually four, and Einstein may have been the first person to actually label it this way.\u201d\n\nJeremy said that those four dimensions consist of length, width, height, and time.\n\n\u201cBut Einstein said that our experience of time is interesting because we don\u2019t experience all of time; we just experience time as duration,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs, like, this progression from where we are to wherever we are next. So, he actually said that we exist in three and a half dimensions.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jeremy, each dimension builds on the previous one, which gives us the three-dimensional world that we know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeremy admitted that this was \u201ca little nerdy\u201d and difficult to understand. After all, the average person did not take a quantum physics class in high school. But he promised that if you stuck with him, he would prove his point.\n\nThe pastor explained that the concept of time in quantum physics explains his theory.\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s just say that God occupies all of the four dimensions that we occupy and occupies them fully,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat means that God experiences all of time, as what one philosopher called an \u2018eternal now.\u2019 That everything in time is now to God. And so when God acts within those four dimensions, it actually is not acting in duration, but in all of them at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Jeremy said, \u201cthat you can\u2019t use terms like before or after with God. Terms like before or after don\u2019t make sense because God doesn\u2019t experience time as duration in this sort of philosophical framework.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJESHOOTS.com | Pexels\n\nBasically, what Jeremy meant was that we experience time as \u201cduration\u201d or how we get from point A to point B. God does not. Instead, he experiences it all at once. It is all \u201cnow\u201d to him.\n\n\u201cSo when you think about that question, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t God stop bad things from happening?\u2019 it\u2019s very much related to time, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why did God not act before this thing happened? But when you talk about God existing in all the dimensions, there is no before, there is no after with God. God is experiencing the eternal now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is, quite frankly, all really confusing.\n\nCould this be an answer to why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening? It\u2019s possible. Then again, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s just the ramblings of someone who\u2019s a little too geeky for their own good.\n\nAs for the Biblical perspective, Pastor William L. Kynes, the Senior Fellow for Pastoral Theology at the C.S. Lewis Institute, wrote, \u201cThough we can never give a full explanation of evil in this world, we do have God\u2019s response to it.\u201d\n\n@ashleyhetherington to the girl who may be wondering why God is allowing this to happen\u2728\ud83d\udc97#christiantiktok #relatable #christiangirl #jesus #christian #bibleverse #bibleverse #gospel #trending #motivation #viral #God #dailybible #fyp #Godisgood #testimony \u266c original sound- ashley hetherington\n\nKynes cited the scripture Revelation 21:4, which says in part, \u201cHe will wipe every tear from their eyes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that there are some things we will simply never understand, although we try to make sense of it.\n\nMary-Faith Martinez is a writer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and Journalism who covers news, psychology, lifestyle, and human interest topics."

            "article_content": "Photo: VCG\n\nThroughout the year of 2024, there has been no shortage of posts and videos on social media platforms by bloggers from home or abroad, sharing how they were captivated by China's surging scientific revolution tide, ranging from real-time food delivery by hotel room service robots, driverless artificial intelligent (AI) robots delivering parcels to spherical robots patrolling the street side by side with police officers.In a recent milestone, a group of four-legged \"Made in China\" robotic dogs, designed for tunnel inspections and maintenance tasks, have been put on duty and are now operating in a 6-kilometer underground power tunnel inspection project in Singapore - the first overseas deployment of a Chinese robotic solution in such an application scenario.These unique creatures have wooed thousands of netizens after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian shared a video of them on social media in mid-December, calling them \"cool.\"The \"cool\" wave of the tech revolution has been unlocking more exciting possibilities across multiple Chinese industries in 2024, a year that is deemed critical for the rapid advancement of China's robotics technology. It, in a broader picture, underscored the explosive progress of new quality productive forces -an emerging key term in China's economic and social axis that is playing an expanding role in driving the country's high-quality development.A walk-in into manufacturing bases across various Chinese localities also provides insights into how the development of new quality productive forces has been transforming traditional industries while injecting new impetus into driving the country's industrial upgrade.To date, a flurry of auto-makers and logistics providers including Geely, BAIC New Energy, and SF Express have been integrating humanoid robots, considered at the forefront of the development of new quality productive forces, into their facilities, the Global Times learned from Hong Kong-listed UBTech Robotics. These robots are being trialed on factory floors to perform tasks like assembly, transportation, testing, and maintenance, making remarkable progress in automation and industrial efficiency improvement in the world's second-largest economy.In December, the just-concluded Central Work Economic Conference set priorities for economic work in 2025, including ensuring that scientific and technological innovation drives the development of new quality productive forces and builds a modernized industrial system.As China is steadily marching toward the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026-30), industry insiders expect that the development of new quality productive forces will serve as a cornerstone of China's long-term strategic vision in the face of a more complicated geopolitical landscape, rising protectionism and global tech supply chain \"decoupling.\" Meanwhile, China's build-up of a host of emerging industries like AI and 5G would also create a new type of global supply and value chains that injects strong momentum and brings more development opportunities to the Global South, analysts stressed.During this year's national two sessions in March, the phrase new quality productive forces has become a buzzword among Chinese officials, national lawmakers, and political advisors, with \"developing new quality productive forces at a faster pace\" listed among the major tasks for 2024 in the Government Work Report for the first time.More elaborations on the concept, as well as detailed plans and coordinating measures, were released in follow-ups, further highlighting its profound ramifications in the country's economic policymaking and future development course.In early December, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting to analyze and study the economic work of 2025, during which it was noted that new quality productive forces have developed steadily this year.According to industry insiders, scientific and technological innovation is the core of the new quality productive forces. In this regard, China has achieved numerous monumental milestones in sci-tech innovation this year in a variety of sectors, such as semiconductor, quantum computing, telecom technology, AI, low-altitude economy, biomedicine, new energy, and large aircraft manufacturing.It is important to sustain this homegrown technological climb-up momentum, according to analysts, and they expect the 15th Five-year Plan (2026-2030) to continue prioritizing the development of new quality productive forces, listing it as both an urgent task and a long-term vision.Pan Helin, a member of the Expert Committee for the Information and Communication Economy under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told the Global Times that the accumulation of these technological edges is crucial to fueling China's ongoing industrial transformation and upgrading. It is also conducive to the formation of new economic drivers and new business models, which are all decisive elements in buttressing China's high-quality development course in the years to come.The accelerated efforts in the development of new quality productive forces also come as Western countries show no sign of retreating from technological suppression against China.Against the backdrop, industry insiders called for more inputs in independent innovation and a strong spirit of self-reliance in core technologies, so that the country will be less vulnerable to any malicious attempts to curb its development and will have a greater say in international technological standard-setting.In terms of humanoid robots which integrate a wide range of cutting-edge full-stack AI technologies, Chinese players may start late as the technology and products were initially developed in countries like the US and Japan a decade ago. But this year, Chinese humanoid robot companies have achieved remarkable innovations, establishing themselves as global leaders in both robot products and applications, UBTech Robotics told the Global Times.The Government Work Report delivered in March 2024 stressed that China will pool the country's strategic scientific and technological strength and non-governmental innovation resources to make breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields and step up research on disruptive and frontier technologies.Highlighting the country's institutional advantage, Hua Rongqi, a Beijing-based AI entrepreneur, told the Global Times that China is perhaps the most efficient in mobilizing resources nationwide to enhance its capacity for innovation across the board. He said that this advantage is particularly palpable in the generative AI industry which is in a white-hot global race.At the same time, China excels in applying these technologies to real-world scenarios, and also is home to the world's most efficient and cost-effective supply chain alongside a deep pool of talent, which will all propel the development of new quality productive forces, Hua added.Zhou Hongyi, founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology, told the Global Times that China's stepped-up efforts are poised to make greater contributions to global technological progress and economic development, with its innovation-driven development model offering valuable experience for other countries to draw upon.\"On the one hand, industrial digitalization will create more new business models and growth dynamics, thereby generating great opportunities for global investors to tap into the country's expanding market. On the other hand, more and more countries will show great interest in engaging with technological cooperation taking account of China's growing technological prowess,\" Zhou explained.Chinese industries related to the development of new quality productive forces have increasingly risen to become a magnet to foreign investors this year.In the first 11 months, foreign direct investment in the country's high-tech manufacturing reached 82.53 billion yuan, accounting for 11 percent of the national total, data released by the Ministry of Commerce showed.According to UBTech Robotics, China's fast-lane development of new quality productive forces has also elevated the global standing and influence of Chinese enterprises and rendered them with more business opportunities in the global market. The company to date has collaborated with local partners to apply robotics solutions in countries such as Thailand, Dubai, South Korea, Japan, and Germany.Huang Lingxiao, overseas marketing manager of DEEP Robotics, the Chinese company that provides robotic dogs for tunnel maintenance tasks in Singapore, told the Global Times on Thursday that as developed nations like Singapore upgrade their industrial infrastructure through automation and digitization, this creates enormous opportunities for innovative solutions from Chinese robotics companies."
