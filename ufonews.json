            "article_content": "Leroy Chiao told a recent interview how he was 'dumbstruck' by the sighting\n\nUnexplained 'metallic orbs' once buzzed past a former NASA astronaut's plane as he was flying at around 9,000 feet, he said. American Leroy Chiao, who was the 196th NASA astronaut to fly in space and the 311th human in space, served on multiple missions during an illustrious career after qualifying in 1991. Mr Chiao, who is also a keen light aircraft pilot, said he was flying his plane back to Houston in Texas when something odd suddenly whizzed past. Revealing the encoutner to broadcaster NewsNation, he said saw the \"two metallic spherical orbs\" which were around three-feet in diameter and 20-feet away in August this year.\n\nHe added: \"It's just kinda dumb luck that they didn't hit me. It could've been a bad result, if they had actually hit me. It happened so quick, there wasn't even a chance to get scared.\n\nA 'metallic sphere' weather balloon included in a 2023 report by NASA's UFO panel\n\n\"It wasn't on radar, air traffic control certainly didn't alert me. \"[And] it wasn't on my display that shows other airplanes that are participating with the [Federal Aviation Administration] FAA-required transponders. I don't know what it was.\" Mr Chiao, who has received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and two NASA Exceptional Service Awards, explained to the US broadcaster that he only saw the objects for \"a second\". Discussing what he thought the objects might be, Mr Chiao pondered: \"My first guess is that it's some kind of military program, a drone of some kind, but you know it's hard to say, right?' \"Frankly, I think whoever was operating the drone wasn't aware that I was there.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "In a previous post, we covered Microsoft\u2019s plans to rebrand the Microsoft 365 app to Microsoft 365 Copilot. It\u2019s obvious that Copilot will take center stage in the upcoming version, and a recent Microsoft 365 roadmap seen by Windows Latest gives a brief idea of what\u2019s coming.\n\nFirstly, the Copilot page will automatically launch when clicking the Copilot keyboard key in the Microsoft 365 app. The next big change is retiring the top header to give a more clean look to the UI. It is a big change because the right part of the bar contains profile and account-related options.\n\nAll these options will now migrate to the bottom of the left-side menu. So, you\u2019ll need to expand the Settings and more section to access profile, feedback, and app settings.\n\nMicrosoft is also retiring the organization name header, which appeared in the top header. A valid reason for removing this is that Copilot is a tool to get the job done but not a crucial app like Word or Excel, which the organization uses most of the time.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019ll move the AI features like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages to the left sidebar in hopes of drawing more eyeballs than usual. To make space for Copilot, it\u2019s removing the My Day and Help me Create buttons, which have no need since Copilot is a polished version for queries, summarization, and generation tasks.\n\nYou\u2019ll also not see the Back button because Microsoft believes the tabbed interface is enough to switch between multiple apps or app pages.\n\nAlso, what about the search bar? It\u2019s now set to appear on the homepage so you can look for content across different sections, but there are no other changes to the search bar. Only the position is changing.\n\nAll these app changes apply to both the web and desktop versions of the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. You can expect these changes to be reflected in the service from the third week of January 2025.\n\nBut are these changes helpful for the end user?\n\nCopilot is omnipresent\n\nRebranding an already confusing name like Microsoft 365 to Microsoft 365 Copilot makes little sense. With all the hype this AI assistant has received for the last year or so, rarely users or organizations don\u2019t know about it.\n\nEven worse is renaming the simple Copilot service to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat for enterprise users. That\u2019s a too-long name and based on the little help that it offers, it\u2019ll find very less adoption in the enterprise scenario. The URLs have also changed to reflect the name change, so users don\u2019t get confused.\n\nWe hope that Microsoft sticks to the Copilot name until the service is discontinued (less likely as AI is omnipresent now)."

            "article_content": "by Jayantha Perera\n\nI retired from ADB in April 2011. ADB appointed me as a staff consultant without waiting for the mandatory \u2018cooling off\u2019 12-month period expired. A memo signed by the President, a Vice President, and two Directors Generals of ADB stated why I should be re-recruited immediately. It stated, \u201cMr. Perera\u2019s experience as a senior and highly respected member of ADB as a safeguard specialist makes him ideal for this position \u2026 He is a well-respected ADB staff and was one of ADB\u2019s leading experts in the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s development issues; he was the only international staff member at ADB who had technical knowledge and expertise in all three safeguard areas\u2026\u2026..\u201d\n\nOne of my major assignments as a consultant was to conduct training in 10 Pacific countries for senior government officials on how to address social and environmental issues to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy standards. Fiji, Samoa, Pohnpei, Tonga, Cook Islands and Marshall Islands were among the countries chosen. Each country offered its rich culture, natural beauty, and the opportunity to meet people with vivid personalities and experience paranormal encounters. Pohnpei, an island state in the Pacific, etched a dazzling world I will never forget.\n\nPohnpei and three island states form the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the western Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei is the largest island in FSM, with a land area of 335 sq. kilometres. The other three states are Yap, Chuuk, and Kosrae. Pohnpei State also owns several small islands in the vast Pacific Ocean.\n\nPohnpei means \u2018stone altar.\u2019 Presumably, it refers to a large stone platform on the island. The island\u2019s population is about 37,000. Its terrain is mountainous and jungle-covered. It is one of the wettest places on Earth, with an annual rainfall exceeding 7,600 mm. A circular, tarred, narrow road connects dispersed towns. Access to the interior, especially to hilly areas, is challenging.\n\nThe people are proud of their history and boast about Nan Madol, an ancient city-kingdom. Its civilisation flourished for 700 years, from the 10th century to the 17th century. Its downfall began with the arrival of Spanish sailors in the early 19th century, followed by whalers, traders, missionaries, educators, and colonisers. After the Spaniards, the Germans occupied it. During the Second World War, the Japanese captured it, and the USA took it from the Japanese in the late 1940s.\n\nLocals suffered severely when colonisers plundered their treasures and destroyed cultural artefacts. Spaniards brought cholera and smallpox to Pohnpei, nearly annihilating the local population. The Japanese not only looted local treasures but also enslaved people. During the Second World War, Japanese warlords used local slaves to move heavy cannons to strategic mountaintops. Most of the workers died because of starvation and illnesses.\n\nIn 1986, Pohnpei became an independent state within FSM. The five traditional small kingdoms on the island constitute independent Pohnpei, and the Pohnpei State Council represents them. Kolonia is the capital of Pohnpei State, and Palikir is the capital of FSM. The two cities are adjacent to each other. The local kingdoms occasionally clash with the State Council on matters of development. About 10 years ago, for example, the State Council tried establishing a casino complex in the territory of a traditional kingdom. Its king opposed the proposal and took his protest to an international forum for arbitration.\n\nEnglish is the official language, and people consider themselves non-immigrant citizens of the United States. In other words, the USA guarantees they can become US citizens whenever they want. The currency in the country is the US dollar. Postage is paid in US$, and postal stamps are US postal stamps. A taxi charges one dollar to travel within Kolonia.\n\nFortunately, I got a seat on United Airlines from Honolulu to Kolonia. The Filipino hotel manager told me to wait a few hours before occupying my room. When I asked him why, he said hotel guests who had left in the morning might return if their flight was cancelled. The hotel\u2019s policy is to accommodate such stranded travellers on a priority basis in the rooms they had occupied earlier.\n\nI was tired, hungry, and sleepy. The manager gave me a hot tuna sandwich and coffee at the restaurant. He told me he could give me a room with a door facing the jungle behind the hotel. I feared small insects and reptiles might creep into my room after sunset. The incessant rain added a gloomy atmosphere to my fear. I could hear water gushing down a drain. Rainwater trickled down from the eves of the roof, flooding the narrow corridor in front of the room and making it slippery.\n\nI moved into the room and slept several hours. When I woke up, it was dark and still raining. I did not know how to go to the restaurant. There was no telephone in my room. I was nervous about going to the bathroom. When I opened the tap in the bathroom, it took about five minutes to see clear water. I was reluctant to pull the shower curtain. When I pulled it, a six-legged, black, long, gecko-like creature was in the bathtub. The bathtub was cracked and dirty and covered with dead leaves. The room\u2019s light bulb was weak, and the bathroom was not lit up to see what else was waiting there to meet me. I regretted my decision to occupy an outer room.\n\nThe manager came to take me to dinner. He had a strong flashlight and a large umbrella. I asked him about possibly moving to a room inside the hotel. But by then, the hotel was fully occupied. The manager told a Filipina woman to clean my room again and to keep a heater in it. I insisted that the bedsheets and pillows should also be changed. When I returned to my room after supper, it looked neat and smelled good. The gecko-like creatures had disappeared.\n\nI had a free weekend in Pohnpei before leaving for Honolulu. The hotel manager suggested I hire his four-wheel drive Jeep and travel around the island. He charged me $100 for the trip, which included a driver-cum-guide, a lunch box, snacks, and soft drinks. He advised me to carry one-dollar bills with me to pay local taxes. I changed a 50-dollar note for one-dollar and five-dollar bills. The bills were dirty and discoloured; some were as hard as cardboard.\n\nThe Jeep was a rickety old van without a spare wheel. It spluttered dark, unburned diesel, and its engine noise was unbearable. Roger, the jeep driver, was a local young man with long hair and a ferocious-looking black beard. He carried a big, heavy knife. The hotel manager handed him food boxes and an umbrella.\n\nI thought Roger might sacrifice me to a native god by cutting my neck at a remote place. I had read on Google about human sacrifices to gods on the island. I wished I had invited another hotel guest to accompany me, but it was too late. Roger promised to show me places that foreign visitors rarely visit. His offer made me more nervous. I told him that I should return to the hotel before 5 p.m.\n\nRoger drove the old Jeep with care. He stopped the Jeep in front of churches to talk to his friends who came for the Sunday mass. Sometimes, he offered them a ride in the Jeep without asking me. At a church, at least 10 people entered the Jeep, and two sat next to me in the front seat, pushing me onto the gear shift. They were fat people dressed in large white shirts and baggy blue jeans. They had unshaven faces and unwashed mouths. They spoke English. They invited me to visit their church and to join them for a communal lunch. I politely declined the offer by saying I was on a tight travel programme and should return to Kolonia early.\n\nLater, I visited a small Christian church. The church had a neat front yard, and a local artist had painted beautiful murals of the genesis and the crucifixion. I could see some well-thumbed prayer books and hymn books on a small table covered with an embroidered white tablecloth. The small board on the table invited donations. One could donate money by dropping dollar bills or cents into a small glass box, which a small padlock secured.\n\nSeveral people were in the church, wearing their Sunday best. Men wore European clothes, and women wore long white dresses with beautiful shoes. Some of them had heavy makeup. All adult women wore head covers. Many devotees, especially the women, carried rosaries in their hands.\n\nPeople sat in circles by the road and ate from large metal pots. Roger explained that Christians do not work on Sundays except for attending mid-morning service. They cook on Saturday and partook of it on Sunday after the church service. Pork was the main dish. Raw tuna fish competed with fried pork to be the best food item. Someone told me they had learned how to raise pigs and cook pork dishes from Filipino friends whose ancestors came with the Spaniards as cooks and servants.\n\nSuddenly, Roger drove off the main road, saying he wanted to show me the statue of Henry Nanpie. The figure was about 100 metres from a protestant church and was on an elevated stone dais. I thought it was built of steel with a hollow interior. Henry was in an elite tailcoat with a walking stick in his right hand. Roger told me that Henry had lived in Pohnpei in the late 19th century and early 20th century. He was the son of a local army commander. His mother was an English woman \u2013 the daughter of an English beachcomber.\n\nHenry inherited lots of land from his powerful father. Then, he wanted to acquire land from another local kingdom. Henry visited the kingdom\u2019s palace carrying a loaded gun and a bag of goodies. He took the weapon to kill the king and the goodies to bribe palace servants to get their allegiance. When he saw the king in an inner palace chamber, he tried to kill the king. But his gun misfired. Then Henry aimed the weapon at a flowerpot and pulled the trigger. The bullet went through the flowerpot and damaged the wall behind it.\n\nHenry cunningly claimed that he had supernatural powers and could stop a gun from firing a bullet. He explained to the king that before he aimed the weapon at the king, he had \u201ccharmed\u201d the gun. Because of the charm, the gun misfired. After removing the charm from the gun, a bullet fired from it smashed the flowerpot. The king was amazed and convinced himself of Henry\u2019s supernatural powers. The king asked him to be the kingdom\u2019s protector offering him a mansion and a vast stretch of land.\n\nHenry opened a large supply shop to supply food, water, oil, and labour to whaling ships in the Pacific. He used his new wealth to add more land to his estate. In Pohnpei, he established protestant groups and spread Western cultural practices and beliefs among the locals through them. Even today, local people consider him a semi-god who brought wealth and salvation to them and connected them with the outside world. Roger sang a folk song about Henry, which depicted Henry as a local god. A copper plaque beside his statue indicates that he still has admirers to spread, invent and reinvent myths about him.\n\nRoger was hurrying me to go to the ruined capital of Nan Madol Kingdom. He told me that the kingdom was on the banks of a large lagoon connected to the eastern shoreline. It was the only ancient city ever built atop a coral reef. In 2016, the UN declared it a World Heritage Site. We drove on a narrow gravel road and parked the Jeep. From there, we walked about two kilometres to Nan Madol. We walked through private lands, and landowners charged a fee for crossing their land. Some landlords collected a dollar or two, but one landlord demanded seven dollars.\n\nWe entered a rocky trail from the last property. The land rapidly became marshy, and we walked on an elevated narrow bund. Both sides of the bund were inundated, and walking on it was risky. Henry dexterously cut down weeds and plants that obstructed the path. He wanted me to follow him closely but did not say why. The thought that he might sacrifice me to a local god began looming in my mind. I did not look around as I wanted to keep my eyes on him and the bund. He walked fast, brandishing his knife as if in a frenzy.\n\nThe narrow bund that stretched through a grotesque jungle of mangroves looked never-ending. I thought that spirits were watching and following me. I tried to avoid looking at large trees because I thought they were beckoning me. Some tree trunks, I thought, turned into hobgoblins. I remembered reading how funny elves resort to mischievous acts towards human beings who encroach on their territories.\n\nSuddenly, I felt some invisible force pulling me back. I could not see Roger. I thought that I got lost among the mangroves forever. I saw the shallow water in marshy fields swelling to engulf me. I stopped walking. I thought how silly I was to think about bizarre things. Then Roger returned and asked me whether I had seen anything or anybody. I told him that some trees had tried to talk to me and were making faces at me. He said that many visitors had similar supernatural encounters. Roger explained that Pohnpiens treated the ruins at Nan Madol as sacred. They also knew various spirits haunt the place. The spirits came out at night, but a few hovered around during the daytime to harass visitors. Roger gave me several small, polished stones connected in a string. It reminded me of the rosaries that churchgoers had in their hands. He said that the string would fend off evil spirits. I then remembered my grandmother, who gave me my first rosary when I was seven, advising me to carry it with me to protect myself from evil forces.\n\nWe arrived at a stagnant shallow canal from where we could see the temple entrance. To reach the temple, we crossed a shallow canal. There were several decayed logs in the canal, and we had to push them aside to cross it. About 50 metres from the canal were the elegant stone walls three to five metres high. Just under a stone arch was a conduit from a table-flat wall top where, presumably, human sacrifices were conducted. According to Roger, the blood of those victims trickled down from the wall top to the main entrance through the conduit, where priests performed rituals to appease gods. Many city outer walls remain intact, although mangroves have engulfed them.\n\nLocal people believe twin brothers, who were sorcerers, built Nan Madol. They came to Pohnpei from another island in a large canoe to build an altar where they could perform ancestor worship. The legend is that the two brothers levitated large stones with the help of a flying dragon and built the entire city in three years. They transported basalt columns from a faraway island. Most of the columns are now under shallow water in the lagoon.\n\nThe temple consists of about 90 rectangular islets linked by narrow channels. Each islet had a coral-filled platform. Nan Madol means \u201cwithin the intervals,\u201d and the \u201cintervals\u201d are the complex canal grid. It is unclear who lived on islets, but locals believe priests who performed rituals at the altar lived in single-house units built on islets.\n\nThere were reserved locations among the islets for priests to feed turtle innards to a sacred eel who lived in a deep well. After feeding the eel, priests shared the rest of the turtle as a sacrament. To this day, eels are considered holy and are never killed or eaten.\n\nThe main enclosure is a large stone chamber with hundreds of human bones. About 15 years ago, several German archaeologists dusted and rearranged the bones to examine their age. That night, one archaeologist died in his hotel room in Kolonia, and the other fell gravely ill. Roger said his ancestors were unhappy when foreigners excavated and labelled their bones. They, as spirits, protect the monuments and punish anyone who disturbs them.\n\nRoger\u2019s father and two uncles had seen several light beams starting from the temple\u2019s main altar late one night. The light beams travelled across the sea to faraway islands and large stars. When I asked Roger if he would camp at Nan Madol after sunset to watch the light beams, he said he would not risk meeting his ancestors! He advised me not to talk about them as they were holy spirits with enormous powers and could harm us in their domain.\n\nWe spent two hours walking around the temple. The shallow sea and the lagoon behind the ruins were very picturesque. We tried to count the heaps of basalt rafts submerged in the lagoon. When we decided to leave Nan Madol, I felt I could not move. I was unsure whether the feeling came from my fear of hobgoblins or the perplexity in my mind. I told Roger to walk with me to the Jeep. He walked ahead of me, occasionally checking whether I was following him. I tried to walk fast without looking at the trees I had seen earlier. I felt a powerful, unseen force pulling me backwards. I imagined a tree with strange roots moving towards me. The gushing winds created a bizarre atmosphere. I felt I had not left the ruins, so I called Roger and asked him to walk with me. We plodded to the Jeep from the ruins. He reassured me that the spirits would not follow us. I was glad to leave Phonpei the following day."

            "article_content": "High Court reporters\n\nA mother has told the High Court that the council home she has been transferred to has made her fear for the safety of her five young children due to \"paranormal activity\" that has caused tables and chairs to move and objects to be flown around.\n\nThe High Court action was taken by Thomas and Louise Stokes, with an address listed at Mount Temple, Carrick on Shannon, Co Leitrim, claiming that the family could not stay at that address due to concerns for their children's health arising from a mould problem.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons on Friday that a new property the family has been moved into has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \"paranormal activity\".\n\nThe Stokes\u2019 original complaint to the High Court was that the local authority did not classify them as \u2018homeless\u2019, even though, it was alleged, the mould in the first property was so bad it involved hospital visits and forced the entire family to sleep downstairs rather than in their own bedrooms.\n\nThe claim against the council alleged that works were carried out to alleviate the situation by improving ventilation and removing the mould caused by dampness but the problem returned.\n\nThose works were insufficient, the family claimed in arguing that the property was not fit for human habitation and emergency accommodation was needed.\n\nThe family claim that in the five-year period they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard that the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Simons that since she has moved there, \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d.\n\nShe claims that while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter that the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d.\n\nMs Stokes claims she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids. I just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the High Court on Friday, Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and that \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes that he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but that a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "Despite Max\u2019s pivot to purging films and TV shows from its programming library, the platform still has plenty of excellent new releases to check out during this year\u2019s holiday season. Whether you\u2019re into live-action dramas, sci-fi spectacles, or animated epics, the streamer has a little bit of everything to offer. Naturally, we\u2019ve put together a handy list of some of our favorites we think you might get a kick out of.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nIt sounded like Warner Bros. and DC were having a laugh when they started referring to The Penguin\u2019s central mobster as \u201cOz Cobb,\u201d as if that has ever been that character\u2019s name. It also seemed odd that the studios were bullish about airing a series spun off from Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman when all signs have suggested that those characters won\u2019t make it into James Gunn\u2019s new universe of DC films. Somehow, though, The Penguin proved to be a surprisingly compelling return to Gotham as it explored the inner workings of Oz Cobb\u2019s (Colin Farrell) mind and reframed him as a twisted underdog fighting to keep up with fellow crimelord Sofia Gigante (Cristin Milioti).\n\nBy largely removing Batman from the equation, The Penguin was able to present its murderous gangsters as people (rather than costumed weirdos) who were really just trying to get by in a city that was all too ready to throw them away. And by the show\u2019s season 1 finale, The Penguin establishes itself as one of the better Batman stories that DC has produced in recent years \u2014 one that definitely deserves a second chapter.\n\nInvincible Fight Girl\n\nThere\u2019s nothing fun about getting punched in the face, but in Invincible Fight Girl\u2019s world, where everyone is a superpowered professional wrestler, it\u2019s the kind of thing that lights a fire within young brawler Andy \u200b\u200b(Sydney Mikayla). Even though her parents would rather she live a quiet life of accounting, Andy knows in her heart that she\u2019s a born wrestler who just needs a trainer who can bring out her inner greatness. And while Quesa Poblana (Rolonda Watts) is none too pleased about the idea of taking on a newbie mentee, she, too, can see that Andy has what it takes to become a legend.\n\nThe way Invincible Fight Girl borrows elements of classic shonen shows like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Pok\u00e9mon, and Hajime no Ippo feels like it could almost be too much at first. But the show blends its influences together brilliantly to tell its own unique story and create fight sequences that are cool as hell.\n\nLike Water for Chocolate\n\nBy easing up on the magical realism of Laura Esquivel\u2019s novel, Francisco Javier Royo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s new adaptation of Like Water for Chocolate makes it somewhat easier to appreciate the depth of its central love story set during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nThere is still something otherworldly about Tita de la Garza\u2019s (Azul Guaita) ability to channel her emotions into the food she cooks. Tita\u2019s sisters Rosaura (Ana Valeria Becerril) and Gertrudis (Andrea Chaparro) and her forbidden love Pedro Muzquiz (Andr\u00e9s Baida) can attest to the way her culinary creations leave people overwhelmed as they experience whatever feelings were roiling inside of her. But that detail is really just one small ingredient the new Like Water for Chocolate adaptation uses to enhance its rumination on the ways that class conflict and war have shaped the arc of Tita\u2019s life.\n\nDune: Prophecy\n\nIn Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune films, the Bene Gesserit order is so shrouded in mystery that it\u2019s hard to tell whether their strange abilities are rooted in the supernatural. But Dune: Prophecy dives into the Sisterhood\u2019s ancient history to unpack the many ways in which secret science rather than sorcery is what turned them into one of the most influential forces in the entire spice-addicted Imperium.\n\nThe show\u2019s exploration of how Valya (Emily Watson / Jessica Barden) and Tula (Olivia Williams / Emma Canning) Harkonnen reestablished their family as one of the galaxy\u2019s Great Houses adds new depth to the Dune franchise\u2019s larger story about the rise of a long-awaited messiah. Through the Harkonnen sisters, Prophecy demystifies some of the legend of the Kwisatz Haderach and reveals how ruthless the fight to control spice has always been. And it makes for an excellent way to get your sandworm fix while we wait for the next Dune feature to premiere.\n\nCreature Commandos\n\nThough James Gunn and Peter Safran are mostly starting over fresh for Warner Bros.\u2019 new cinematic universe of DC films, a tiny portion of the old DCEU is being reborn through the animated Creature Commandos series. After the events of The Suicide Squad and season 1 of Peacemaker, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) can no longer force teams of superhumans to covertly do her bidding under threat of death. But there are no laws forbidding her from recruiting a squad of supernatural monsters like Nina Mazursky (Zo\u00eb Chao), Eric Frankenstein (David Harbour), the Bride (Indira Varma), and Circe (Anya Chalotra) to go on suicidal missions that Waller would rather the public not know about.\n\nPart of what\u2019s intriguing about the show is the way characters like Waller, Weasel (Sean Gunn, who will also voice G.I. Robot), and Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) will establish a narrative continuity between DC\u2019s old films and many of its upcoming live-action projects. And with Gunn going all in on actors reprising their roles across different mediums, Creature Commandos seems like it might be the start of an era worth tuning in to.\n\nCivil War\n\nThough there\u2019s a certain degree of absurdity to the political details of Alex Garland\u2019s Civil War, its depiction of the United States descending into chaos after a tyrannical president refuses to leave office feels like a haunting vision of a future that isn\u2019t as improbable as we\u2019d hope. As a respected war reporter, Lee Smith (Kirsten Dunst) feels she has a duty to document the reality of what has become of her country in the time since the president (Nick Offerman) came into power.\n\nLee\u2019s years of reporting from the front lines of conflicts all over the world have taught her how important it is for people to be able to see how war ruins lives and pushes societies to (if not over) the brink of collapse. But as Lee sets out to secure the interview of a lifetime, she quickly realizes that no amount of reporting has prepared her to see war unfolding in the place she calls home. And with rookie journalist Jessie (Cailee Spaeny) by her side, the only thing that keeps Lee grounded is her hope that she can pass her skills on to the next generation.\n\nI Saw the TV Glow\n\nOne doesn\u2019t need to be queer or a Buffy fan to appreciate the neon-drenched strangeness of Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s I Saw the TV Glow. But the movie\u2019s story about two lonely teens bonding over a cheesy sci-fi show might hit differently for anyone who grew up in the \u201990s feeling like they would be more at home in Sunnydale than living their own humdrum lives.\n\nEven though young outcasts Owen (Justice Smith / Ian Foreman) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) don\u2019t initially have the words to articulate what it is that makes them different from other kids, there\u2019s something about The Pink Opaque that speaks to them both. The teens don\u2019t understand why they feel such a powerful, instinctive kinship to the TV show\u2019s monster-fighting heroines or how the program is influencing the way they see the world. But by the time they\u2019ve both grown up a bit, they can\u2019t shake the feeling that The Pink Opaque has changed something within them \u2014 something that might mean everything they\u2019ve been raised to believe is a lie.\n\nTrap\n\nIn any other M. Night Shyamalan movie, you would expect the big twist to come closer toward the end in order to leave audiences reeling, but Trap does something much more intriguing with its story about the cops tracking down a famous serial killer. Family man Cooper (Josh Hartnett) prides himself on the way he\u2019s able to keep his double life secret from his loved ones. His daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) and wife Rachel (Alison Pill) have no idea that he has other houses than the one they live in. And they would never guess that he spends much of his free time watching a livestream feed of a man he has tied up in a secret basement.\n\nCooper seems like exactly the sort of Good Guy\u2122 who would surprise his daughter with a trip to see her favorite singer Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) in concert because that\u2019s what he wants people to see. But what Cooper doesn\u2019t realize is that the concert is an elaborate trap and the centerpiece of one of Shyamalan\u2019s most fun thrillers yet.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nThere are only a few choice scenes in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice that achieve the kind of horror-comedy brilliance that made Tim Burton\u2019s original 1988 film such a batshit revelation. Those fleeting moments and a pitch-perfect performance from Michael Keaton just manage to make the sequel feel like a film that has something to offer fans beyond nostalgia for the Deetz family and their favorite incorporeal dirtbag.\n\nYears after Lydia Deetz\u2019s (Winona Ryder) first encounter with Beetlejuice (Keaton), she has become the host of a paranormal television show and mother to a sullen teenager of her own. Though Astrid (Jenna Ortega) is certain her mom can\u2019t actually see ghosts, Lydia knows that her eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on her when she spots Beetlejuice during one of her tapings. And when Lydia\u2019s overbearing boyfriend Rory (Justin Theroux) tries to prove that she\u2019s just imagining things, his thrice-over utterance of Beetlejuice\u2019s name sends them all straight to the afterlife for an unhinged reunion of sorts that none of them are prepared for.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\n\nIn the grand scheme of Warner Bros.\u2019 decision to greenlight a gritty, Batman-free Joker film that had nothing to do with its core cinematic universe of DC films, there\u2019s a certain kind of poetry to the way things played out with Todd Phillips\u2019 Folie \u00e0 Deux. At first blush, the idea of a jukebox musical about the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) falling in love with Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) while they\u2019re both doing time in Arkham Asylum sounded inspired. And you could see how, with the right story, a song-filled take on the iconic criminals might make for an enjoyable change of pace from WB\u2019s previous forays into Gotham."

Compared to C and C++, Rust guarantees programmers can write fast and safe code. This makes it ideal for performance-critical applications such as embedded systems , operating systems, and web assembly. As key players in the industry start recommending Rust for security, it remains a growing language for both business and pleasure. Open-source projects. With more developers joining the Rust ecosystem and more focus on safety and quality, Rust has become a top choice for developers. The usage of Rust has great growth potential, and we will see that in the next few years."

This could reignite acquisition activity by strategic buyers, which would allow funds to distribute proceeds from those deals to their own investors, or limited partners, and raise new funds to invest in the next generation of startups, said Brian Garrett, managing director at Crosscut Ventures.\n\nIn recent years, startups weren't the only ones facing a cash crunch. Established funds raised the lion's share of funding dollars, while many newish and boutique funds struggled to raise. A torrent of dealmaking, combined with Trump's return to the White House and an end to the political uncertainty, could mobilize investors in these funds who had been sitting on the sidelines to whip out their checkbooks, said Ivan Nikkhoo, a managing partner at Navigate Ventures.\n\n\"Uncertainty breeds defense, optimism breeds offense,\" said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures and early Anthropic investor. \"We're going into a cycle where acquirers are feeling they need to play offense and startups feel like it's time to invest in leadership. And the IPO market is open for best-in-class assets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom IPOs to robotaxis, these are the tech trends to watch in 2025, according to venture capitalists."

            "article_content": "Software development is a dynamic field where programming languages, frameworks, and technologies may live and die within a few years, and job market needs constantly change. However, developers remain among the most in-demand tech professionals, and learning the right programming languages and other skills can help you find a high-paying job in the field.\n\nA report from Pluralsight identified the most popular software development technologies of the past year, along with those with the most growth.\n\nThe most popular software development technologies in 2025\n\nHere are the top 10 most popular software development technologies in 2025, according to the report:\n\nAI Agents and LangChain RAG and Agentic RAG Python AWS and Azure Kubernetes and Docker Angular, React, and Blazor SQL Linux\n\nSEE: Python is today\u2019s most popular programming language, according to the TIOBE Programming Community index.\n\n\u201cWe predict in 2025 the biggest disrupter to tech in general will be the adoption of AI agents,\u201d wrote Adam Ipsen, lead content strategist at Pluralsight. The LangChain software framework can be used to create and direct those agents.\n\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re not in a technical role, or don\u2019t want to become an AI specialist because you\u2019re working as something like a Cloud Architect or a programmer, knowing AI is becoming an essential skill in 2024 and beyond (For cloud specialists, it\u2019s especially important, as these spaces are quickly intersecting with services like Amazon Q),\u201d Ipsen wrote in last year\u2019s report.\n\nThat still holds true going into 2025, even though the focus has shifted from large language models in general to semi-autonomous AI agents.\n\nSEE: NVIDIA added more AI processing power to its small Jetson Orin developer kit.\n\nMeanwhile, Python is still the world\u2019s most popular programming language. Pluralsight picked Python skills as the most popular software development skill last year.\n\n\u201cPython dominates data science and machine learning libraries, and over the last few years this fact alone has dramatically increased its popularity and industry relevance,\u201d Ipsen wrote.\n\nThe big takeaways for tech leaders\n\nLarge language models, agents, and RAG all interconnect to form a melange of the most in-demand AI skills.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, we predict organizations will be seeking specialists who can combine these two techniques [agentic AI and RAG] to create highly autonomous AI agents who are empowered by your business data or other relevant information sources, known as Agentic RAG,\u201d Ipsen said.\n\nEmployees who know more than one of these skills will be valuable, and team leaders should give employees time and encouragement to learn them.\n\nWorking in multi-cloud environments, especially AWS and Microsoft Azure, is another skill set that will benefit organizations and employees looking to upskill into higher-paying positions."

New users can unlock a $150 sportsbook bonus when they place a winning $5 wager. The best part is there are no odds restrictions on that first wager so you have some cushion. To claim this offer, follow these instructions:\n\nClick on our FanDuel promo code and tap the \u2018Join\u2019 button. Answer the questions in the fields that follow. If you register using one of our links, no code is required. Choose a deposit method and deposit at least $5 into your new account.

You can use the bonus bets in increments or on one big bet. You can edit the amount in your betslip after choosing your wager and before locking it in.

The second most important thing is that the odds for your qualifying wager don\u2019t matter. For instance, if you think Tennessee will win the game, you don\u2019t have to bet on the moneyline with +220 odds. You don\u2019t even have to bet on the Vols\u2019 point spread (+7.5) with -110 odds.\n\nIf you think Ohio State will win, you don\u2019t have to wager on the Buckeyes to win by eight points (and covering the 7.5-point spread). You could bet on the Buckeyes on the moneyline (-280 odds). If you want something safer, there are more options at FanDuel. The sportsbook offers alternate point spreads and totals.\n\nYou can wager on Tennessee +33.5 or Ohio State +18.5. The over/under is 46.5 points, but FanDuel offers a total as low as 17.5 points so you could bet Over on that. You can go as high as 76.5 points for the total and bet Under. You won\u2019t get much of a profit on your $5 wager if you bet one of those extremes, but that isn\u2019t important. You just want to win so you can grab your $150 welcome bonus."

            "article_content": "Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images\n\nRookie quarterback Spencer Rattler and the New Orleans Saints took a bizarre approach to prepare for his upcoming start against the Green Bay Packers in Wisconsin on Monday.\n\nLambeau Field is notorious for its chilly games and with Monday's forecast calling for low 30s and potential snow, Rattler and the other Saints' quarterbacks took to the team's cafeteria walk-in freezer to run through their plays.\n\n\"This morning, (Andrew) Janocko took us in the cafeteria freezer, where it was like 10 degrees, and we're just going through the whole script in there, and so just doing that, that helped a lot,\" Rattler said, according to ESPN's Katherine Terrell. \"So hopefully it's not 10 degrees, but we'll be ready.\"\n\nQuarterbacks coach Janocko joked that the movie Cool Runnings inspired his decision, per Terrell. The film features a scene where a character sits in an ice cream truck to prepare for freezing temperatures as an Olympic bobsledder.\n\nJanocko, who spent eight years coaching in the NFC North with the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears, has plenty of experience preparing his players for cold conditions.\n\n\"I think there's something we said about just preparing for [the cold], so you're not shocked and it's not something surprising,\" Janocko said, per Terrell. \"It's something that you deal with as far as you prepare for the opponent and prepare for the venue. So I just thought it was good to do something a little different. At this time of the year, it's fun to do different stuff. It's a long season and sometimes other than just sitting in a meeting day after day after day, just doing something different, changing up the scene. Guys thought it was hilarious. The cafeteria workers think I'm out of my mind.\""

            "article_content": "As 2024 ends, the world faces significant challenges. Ongoing wars, shifting alliances, and Donald Trump's return as U.S. President mark this period. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, Middle East turmoil, and new power dynamics raise questions about the future. Is World War III inevitable, or can diplomacy prevent it?\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war continues with no end in sight. Now in its third year, the conflict shows no signs of slowing down. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia's goals in Ukraine are far from complete. This suggests no rush to end the war.\n\nThe human cost is high, with both sides fighting for territory. The United Nations reports 39,081 civilian casualties from February 2022 to October 2024. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismisses peace talks from Putin as fantasies.\n\nWestern support for Ukraine remains strong, while Russia stands firm. This suggests the conflict will continue into 2025 without a clear resolution. Meanwhile, the Middle East is also in turmoil. Israel has military victories against Hamas but faces tension with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe death of Hezbollah's leader has worsened the situation. Reports say 44,554 people died from violence involving Israeli forces last year. Despite Israel's dominance, a fragile peace might emerge. Iran's influence is weakening as its alliances crumble.\n\nThe collapse of Syria's regime has shifted power in the Middle East. Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis face setbacks. Iran's role as a regional power is diminishing. In Yemen, the Houthis have increased attacks on Israel with drones and missiles.\n\nThese cross-border assaults threaten regional stability and global shipping routes. Israel's retaliatory airstrikes have escalated tensions further. In the U.S., Donald Trump's election as president marks a major political shift.\n\nHis victory has affected global markets, causing stock indices to fall. Trump's return could change U.S. foreign policy significantly. His unpredictable nature raises concerns about relations with China and Russia.\n\nWhile his economic policies may appeal to his supporters, it's unclear if tensions with adversaries will rise or if a more isolated approach will be taken. Regardless, his victory is pivotal in global politics.\n\nWith conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and instability elsewhere, many wonder if World War III is near. While the situation is tense, a global war seems unlikely for now.\n\nGlobal powers are still engaged in diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation. However, regional conflicts could spill over into a global war if not contained.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia continue their proxy battle in Ukraine while the U.S. remains involved in the Middle East with military assets there.\n\nChina's growing presence in Asia adds complexity to the geopolitical landscape. The world stands on edge, and future choices by leaders will determine whether chaos ensues or peace prevails.\n\nAs 2024 ends and we look to a new year, one thing is clear: the political landscape is changing, and power balances are shifting.\n\nVideo Published On: Saturday, Dec 21, 2024, 08:24 [IST]"

            "article_content": "REUTERS/Dario Cantatore/NYSE Euronext\n\nUS stocks soared Friday after tame inflation data and dovish comments from the Fed's Austan Goolsbee.\n\nGoolsbee said he expects interest rates to continue to decline over the next 12-18 months.\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring a potential government shutdown and a big triple-witching day for the options market.\n\nUS stocks surged on Friday, recovering some of the week's losses sparked by a hawkish Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 500 points, giving back some of its intraday gains after being up over 800 points. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up over 1%.\n\nThe market opened lower, though it reversed course later in the morning. The gains accelerated after Fed president Austan Goolsbee told CNBC that he expects interest rates to decline \"a fair bit\" over the next 12-18 months.\n\nGoolsbee, along with the broader market, was encouraged by recent inflation data, which came in below economist estimates.\n\nA slide in bond yields also helped stocks through the day, with the 10-year Treasury yield down four basis points to 4.528%.\n\nThe PCE index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.1% month-over-month in November, compared to economist estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, the gauge rose 2.4% versus expectations of 2.5%.\n\n\"We're still on path to get to 2% and at least for this new month you don't want to make too much out of any one month, but I'm hopeful that this suggests that the couple of months of firming were more of a bump than a change in path,\" Goolsbee said of the recent inflation data.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4:oo p.m. closing bell on Friday:\n\nConcerns of an imminent government shutdown have also driven recent market volatility. Congress has until midnight on Friday to pass a deal to avert a shutdown.\n\nWhile Congress had a stopgap funding bill in place a few days ago, President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk torpedoed it, complaining about unnecessary spending measures within the bill.\n\nA second attempt to pass a government funding bill endorsed by Trump failed in the House of Representatives late Thursday evening, with a final vote of 174 for and 235 against.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has since proposed a new plan that would temporarily keep the government open and fund disaster aid. The bill reportedly has support from Republicans, and is set for a vote later on Friday."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nExperimental physicist Daniela Angulo poses with an apparatus in the physics lab at the University of Toronto.\n\nScientists have long known that light can sometimes appear to exit a material before entering it\u2014an effect dismissed as an illusion caused by how waves are distorted by matter.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Toronto, through innovative quantum experiments, say they have demonstrated that \"negative time\" isn't just a theoretical idea\u2014it exists in a tangible, physical sense, deserving closer scrutiny.\n\nThe findings, posted on the preprint server arXiv but not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, have attracted both global attention and skepticism.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these perplexing results highlight a peculiar quirk of quantum mechanics rather than a radical shift in our understanding of time.\n\n\"This is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor specializing in experimental quantum physics.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp channel! Stay up-to-date on the latest science news from Science X.\n\nWhile the term \"negative time\" might sound like a concept lifted from science fiction, Steinberg defends its use, hoping it will spark deeper discussions about the mysteries of quantum physics.\n\nLaser experiments\n\nYears ago, the team began exploring interactions between light and matter.\n\nWhen light particles, or photons, pass through atoms, some are absorbed by the atoms and later re-emitted. This interaction changes the atoms, temporarily putting them in a higher-energy or \"excited\" state before they return to normal.\n\nIn research led by Daniela Angulo, the team set out to measure how long these atoms stayed in their excited state. \"That time turned out to be negative,\" Steinberg explained\u2014meaning a duration less than zero.\n\nTo visualize this concept, imagine cars entering a tunnel: before the experiment, physicists recognized that while the average entry time for a thousand cars might be, for example, noon, the first cars could exit a little sooner, say 11:59 am. This result was previously dismissed as meaningless.\n\nWhat Angulo and colleagues demonstrated was akin to measuring carbon monoxide levels in the tunnel after the first few cars emerged and finding that the readings had a minus sign in front of them.\n\nRelativity intact\n\nThe experiments, conducted in a cluttered basement laboratory bristling with wires and aluminum-wrapped devices, took over two years to optimize. The lasers used had to be carefully calibrated to avoid distorting the results.\n\nStill, Steinberg and Angulo are quick to clarify: no one is claiming time travel is a possibility. \"We don't want to say anything traveled backward in time,\" Steinberg said. \"That's a misinterpretation.\"\n\nThe explanation lies in quantum mechanics, where particles like photons behave in fuzzy, probabilistic ways rather than following strict rules.\n\nInstead of adhering to a fixed timeline for absorption and re-emission, these interactions occur across a spectrum of possible durations\u2014some of which defy everyday intuition.\n\nCritically, the researchers say, this doesn't violate Einstein's theory of special relativity, which dictates that nothing can travel faster than light. These photons carried no information, sidestepping any cosmic speed limits.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.
