Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\"\n\nAn official for the Department of Defence stated that while there is no suggestion 'malicious intent' in regards to the mysterious sightings, they 'don't know' the origin.\n\nNally has also shared his belief that aliens are able to quickly enter and exit Earth's atmosphere via a series of 'portals', with one of these being situation between the Irish towns of Athlone and Slane.\n\nAdvert\n\nCarl Natty claims the sightings are for another reason (The Morning Show)\n\nWhich certainly contradicts the widely held idea that aliens would make first contact with mankind by plonking themselves down on the White House lawn, but hey, the real world doesn't always revolve around the US.\n\nHowever before you start stockpiling tins of beans and multipacks of loo roll, Nally is keen to remind us that there are greater threats to humanity than aliens.\n\n\"f you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nAdvert\n\nGlad to see we've all got our priorities in order."

            "article_content": "The rising panic over mystery drones swarming the skies of Mid-Atlantic states reminds us that, in the centuries-long hunt to identify UFOs, humans are usually the weakest link. America has real national security challenges in the new era of unmanned aerial vehicles in warfare. But an invasion of mystery drones over New Jersey isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAs it turns out, just as eyewitnesses often bungle the details of, say, a car accident on the corner, we are notoriously unreliable when it comes to identifying and reporting UFOs. A huge percentage of \u201csightings\u201d turn out, upon investigation, to be the planet Venus or other surprisingly bright astronomical phenomena; people on the ground regularly misjudge distances in the sky so that even objects miles away are perceived to be close by.\n\nThe UFO mistaken-identity problem is a big part of the reason that the military and scientists now refer to such sightings more precisely as UAP, or unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 a label meant to capture that many sightings might not be \u201cobjects\u201d at all but are more likely to be known, or as yet unknown, astronomical and atmospheric phenomena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven skilled aviators make mistakes. On Oct. 1, 1948, Lt. George Gorman, a World War II veteran and pilot in the North Dakota Air National Guard, gave chase in his P-51 fighter after spotting the bright light of a UFO race past him in the skies over Fargo. At speeds of over 400 mph, he engaged it in a dogfight for nearly 30 minutes, the ball-shaped UFO bobbing and weaving around him as it executed turns that he felt were aerodynamically impossible. He finally broke off the engagement, never identifying the bogey. \u201cJust when we were about to collide, I guess I got scared,\u201d he told investigators, adding later: \u201cIt is hard to believe your own eyes when something with no wings walks off and leaves you standing still.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later determined that Gorman had been chasing a weather balloon launched about 10 minutes before he spotted it. The balloon had simply been floating along in the night sky, and he\u2019d been diving and racing all around it.\n\nJ. Allen Hynek, the astronomer and godfather of \u201cufology,\u201d who spent a quarter-century working with the Air Force on its UFO studies and coined the phrase \u201cclose encounters of the third kind,\u201d told an interviewer late in his career, \u201cPilots have been known to swerve their planes violently when they suddenly encounter a very bright meteor they think is on a collision course, but which later proves to have been 50 to 100 miles away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people who are serious about studying UAP are trying to get humans out of the reporting loop: At a congressional hearing last summer, Ryan Graves \u2014 a former Navy aviator who had his own experiences encountering UAP and now leads an advocacy organization called Americans for Safe Aerospace \u2014 proposed a more reliable alternative to the grainy, black-and-white (but supposedly revealing) photos that dot the internet: sensors. Similarly, Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb, one of the leading voices in UAP studies, argues that we need to far better understand what a \u201cregular\u201d sky looks like before trying to determine what\u2019s \u201canomalous.\u201d As Loeb told me last year: \u201cTrust in data. People are a waste of time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the self-centered confidence that underlies so many UFO reports, that people\u2019s first instinct upon spotting a bright, moving light in the night sky is not to assume the obvious \u2014 say, a star, meteor, satellite or faraway jetliner \u2014 but instead to imagine that, after an alien craft journeyed thousands of light-years across interstellar space to visit Earth, the aliens would pick that moment on a random Tuesday night to reveal themselves to someone on a dark, rural road or in a suburban backyard. Occam\u2019s razor, the useful medieval theory that argues the simplest explanation is usually the best, would tell you that the sound of hoofbeats more likely means horses than zebras.\n\nPartly, that instinct stems from something fundamental. The question \u201cAre we alone?\u201d is one of the three most basic questions that have fascinated humans since the first caveman campfires, a question that ranks alongside \u201cWhat happens after death?\u201d and \u201cIs there a God?\u201d as the most profound and potentially life-altering mysteries we wrestle with. Who wouldn\u2019t want to knock out an answer to one of the Big Three while taking out the garbage late at night?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, our cultural fascination with UFOs stems from the fact that it is a rare area where we can all gaze upon the deepest frontier of knowledge. As an ordinary person, I can\u2019t add much to the already-advanced scientific and mathematical questions of our time: I\u2019m not liable to crack string theory wide open during a weekend barbecue, nor is my tinkering in the garage likely to deliver to humanity the secret to nuclear fusion."

These words reportedly add more details and context to the query, and can act as a filter to show more targeted results. Notably, this feature is not available in either the global version of the app or its beta version, hinting that the company is still developing it.\n\nGoogle App for iOS Could Get a New AI Feature\n\nAccording to an Android Authority report, Google is testing a new AI suggestions feature for its iOS app. The publication found the feature during a teardown of the Google app. A new pencil icon was reportedly added next to the camera and microphone icon in the text field of the app.\n\nAI suggestions feature in Google app for iOS\n\nPhoto Credit: Android Authority\n\nThis pencil icon is said to open the AI suggestions interface for users. In a video recording, the publication showcased how the feature could work. On tapping the pencil icon, a larger full-screen interface with a larger text box opens. When a user begins typing their search query in it, the Gemini icon appears below with the text \u201cGenerate AI suggestions\u201d.\n\nAs per the publication's video, once enough words have been typed to let the AI understand the context, it begins showing related words in three rows (thematically separated) that users can select to filter their search results.\n\nFor instance, if a user types \u201cbuying a birthday gift\u201d, Gemini might generate suggestions where the first row will be words for different budgets, the second row could be words for occasions, and the third could be about the relationship with the person. So, users can select \u201cless than Rs. 5,000\u201d, \u201canniversary\u201d, and \u201cwife\u201d and see search results from websites that offer information on these specific keywords.\n\nAs mentioned above, the feature is reportedly under testing and the publication was not able to get it to work, likely due to the server side of the feature not being active. There is no word on when the feature might be released on iOS, and if an Android version is also in the works."

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nThe messaging app where millions of office workers share memes and coordinate projects is quietly transforming into something far more ambitious: A platform where AI agents work alongside humans as digital coworkers.\n\nAs part of Salesforce\u2019s sweeping AI initiative announced Tuesday, Slack is evolving from a communication tool into what company officials call a \u201cwork operating system\u201d \u2014 one where AI agents can attend your meetings, summarize your conversations, create presentations and even negotiate with other AI agents on your behalf.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been on a journey to become what we call a work operating system \u2014 one that simplifies the complexity of all the systems you use daily,\u201d Slack CPO Rob Seaman, who oversees the company\u2019s AI integration, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \u201cWhile messaging and human interaction remain at its core, the system now provides access to automation and all the apps you need to do your job, plus AI agents, which we believe will be crucial players in the workplace.\u201d\n\nThe new digital workplace: AI Agents as your always-on colleagues\n\nThe transformation is already visible at companies like Accenture, where client executives are using AI agents within Slack to dramatically reduce time spent on administrative tasks. These agents can prepare for meetings, summarize discussions and even draft proposals \u2014 all within the familiar Slack interface where employees already spend their workday.\n\n\u201cTo ensure these AI agents are both widely adopted and continuously improving, it\u2019s critical to integrate them where people are already working,\u201d Seaman explained.\n\nInside Slack\u2019s game-changing AI integration: What you need to know\n\nUnlike traditional chatbots or AI assistants that require users to visit separate websites or apps, Slack\u2019s AI agents will be integrated directly into existing workflows. They appear in channels alongside human colleagues and can be called upon through natural conversation.\n\nThe system is designed to be accessible to non-technical users. \u201cThere\u2019s actually no code involved,\u201d said Seaman. \u201cFrom an end user perspective, there really is no technical work for you.\u201d\n\nBut the implications for workplace dynamics are profound. In demonstrations, AI agents showed they could independently schedule meetings, analyze documents, create visualizations and even collaborate with other AI agents on complex tasks.\n\nFor example, during Tuesday\u2019s presentation, an AI agent helped an Accenture executive returning from vacation quickly get up to speed on client activities, prepare for upcoming meetings and draft a proposal \u2014 tasks that would typically take hours of human effort.\n\nBuilding trust and control: How Slack\u2019s AI safeguards protect your data\n\nWhile Salesforce will provide template agents for common business tasks, Seaman expects most organizations will customize their AI workers for specific needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll provide ready-to-use templates that will meet about 80% of most needs, but we expect organizations will customize their AI agents for specific purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this pattern with Slack already \u2014 companies tend to significantly customize the platform to fit their needs.\u201d\n\nThe company has built extensive safety measures into the system. \u201cThe agents execute on your behalf with no greater permissions than what you have,\u201d Seaman explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t have God permissions or admin permissions\u2026 we don\u2019t create any holes for the AI to see things that it should not be able to.\u201d\n\nThe human-AI partnership: Redefining workplace collaboration\n\nFor many employees, the prospect of AI colleagues raises concerns about job displacement. But Salesforce executives frame it as an augmentation of human capabilities rather than a replacement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about handing over the data,\u201d said Claire Cheng, VP of machine learning and engineering at Salesforce. \u201cIt\u2019s about unlocking the full potential in the data to enable Agentforce to deeply understand your business and your customer and empower the agents to take more effective actions.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Salesforce envisions even more sophisticated collaboration between human and AI workers. Future versions will enable multiple AI agents to work together on complex tasks, with specialized agents handling different aspects of projects.\n\n\u201cRight now there is a human evoking different agents,\u201d Silvio Savarese, who leads Salesforce\u2019s AI research, told VentureBeat. \u201cThe future will have an orchestrator agent which will be calling out different specialized agents that will be talking, working together, performing tasks.\u201d\n\nThis vision of the workplace \u2014 where humans and AI agents collaborate seamlessly through platforms like Slack \u2014 represents a fundamental shift in how office work gets done. And while the full implications remain to be seen, one thing is clear: The office chat app where you\u2019ve been sharing cat GIFs is about to become much more powerful.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of the beginning,\u201d said Marc Benioff, Salesforce\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at the beginning of the beginning, you see these little things, and then you try to extrapolate what this is going to be. This is an incredible moment.\u201d"

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nA UFO expert, Carl Nally of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), claims the spate of recent mysterious drone sightings could be a precursor to an alien invasion. He also says they will be conducting this invasion using an invasion portal located here on Earth.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Mirror, Nally believes that the unexplained drone sightings that have been proliferating all over the United States and abroad would have been positively identified as drones by the American government if they were, in fact, nothing more than unmanned aircraft. Especially since many of these sightings have occurred near military bases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them, but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nHe believes that one explanation for all of these supposed drones not being properly identified by governments may have to do with the use of portals. A similar theory has also been applied to cryptids like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d Carl Nally continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nOne portal Nally believes exists is located over Athlone, Slane, Boyle, Wicklow, and West Cork in Ireleand.\n\nHe cites research being conducted by a astronomer Dr. Eamonn Ansbro and New Zealand airline pilot Dr. Bruce Cathie as possible evidence that these portals are being used by aliens. \u201c\u201dThey are entering earth at an increasingly rapid pace, and the fact that the entry coincides with sightings over military bases \u2013 that is concerning,\u201d Nally told the Westmeath Independent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge number of reports from people in the Midlands who report seeing orb or tic tac shaped UFOs,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cDr. Ansbro and Dr. Cathie have developed a theory that UFOs operate on tracks which they can enter and exit the Earth from,\u201d Nally explained. \u201cThey have been working on this theory for the past 12 to 15 years. They have been researching sites where UFOs are most often seen. Their mathematical theory is proven to be 92% accurate.\u201d"

            "article_content": "CHICAGO \u2013 A group of middle school-aged scientists have made a groundbreaking and possibly cancer-fighting discovery after collecting goose poop in an Illinois park.\n\nIt was all thanks to a unique partnership with the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The young learners from the Boys and Girls Club in Chicago collected and analyzed environmental samples to find new antibiotic candidates.\n\nHow To Watch Fox Weather\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle did they know, one seemingly ordinary sample of goose poop taken from Garfield Park Lagoon in Chicago held a hidden treasure. The mundane material contained a novel bacterium, Pseudomonas idahoensis, which produced a never-before-seen compound.\n\nThis compound, named orfamide N, has shown promising results in laboratory tests, inhibiting the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells.\n\nThe American Chemical Society (ACS) said the students' achievement showed the power of early science education and addressed STEM inequities.\n\n\"The researchers say that this work proves that it\u2019s possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research, and it emphasizes the importance of a strong relationship between universities and their local communities,\" the congressional nonprofit said in a written statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload The Free Fox Weather App\n\nThe 14-week applied science program was led by UIC associate professor Brian Murphy, whose lab is focused on discovering antibiotics from natural sources.\n\nHowever, the students didn't just collect samples. They got their hands dirty, becoming bonafide biomedical scientists.\n\n\"They stayed actively involved throughout the scientific discovery process by programming a specialized robot to scoop up bacterial colonies from growth plates and test them for antibiotic activity,\" the ACS said.\n\nWhile orfamide N may hold medical promise, the discovery highlights nature's untapped potential, the ACS said. Future research could uncover additional benefits of the molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Chicago middle schoolers discover cancer-fighting compound in goose poop"

            "article_content": "As OpenAI and Google joust this December, with the former\u2019s 12 Days of Innovation challenge, and the latter countering it with its Gemini 2 AI model, I look beyond these skirmishes to predict my Twelve Trends for AI going into 2025 and beyond.\n\nI will describe them over three columns. Each of these has a theme, and today\u2019s four predictions are around how humans and AI will draw closer to each other\u2014in work, life and relationships.\n\nAlso read: Indian software majors need a clear strategy to ride the AI wave\n\nPrediction One of Twelve\u2014English is the new coding: As our generation was growing up, we were told that learning English was the passport to success. We did that and were arguably successful in our careers and businesses. Our children in turn are told that learning how to code is the passport to success, thus coding is the new English.\n\nThis led to 10-year-olds being dragged to code camps to learn Python and JavaScript. With Generative AI, this changes: Every time we write an English prompt for ChatGPT or any of its ilk, we are actually \u2018coding: i.e., giving it a set of instructions to perform some task for us, whether it\u2019s a summarization, video-creation or a write-up.\n\nExcept that now we are doing it in our natural human language rather than the language of the machine. This is profound, as it has the potential to democratize coding and make eight billion of us code. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella declaimed that instead of learning the machine\u2019s language, machines would have to learn ours.\n\nJensen Huang of Nvidia joined the chorus saying that the true potential of AI is that none of us would have to learn how to code. Thus, English, or any other natural language, becomes the new coding language.\n\nPrediction Two of Twelve\u2014AI is the new UI: AI will become the new user interface. Bill Gates presciently wrote in November 2023 (bit.ly/3tSMNkB): \u201c\u2026you won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do.\"\n\nA UI has been how humans and machines have interacted with each other, as the difficult UIs of machine language and DOS (disk operating system) gave way to a GUI (graphical user interface), search bars, browsers and apps. Simpler UI led to a faster, intuitive and more productive interaction with a machine.\n\nThe AI-driven shift will lead to voice UI as the spoken word becomes the new way to interact with machines, similar to our interactions with other humans. We will chat with ChatGPT or Gemini to work with them on our day-to-day tasks.\n\nOur devices will morph, with voice becoming the primary interface rather than a large screen. The first proto-devices are already out, though not terribly successful, like the Rabbit R1 and AI Pin. An AI assistant becomes the UI.\n\nPrediction Three of Twelve\u2014AI and humans are the new creators: GenAI is a cognitive technology and can do creative tasks like writing, creating art and composing poetry. This has left many human creators deeply worried about their jobs as creativity was supposed to be a uniquely human skill. I believe, however, that Generative AI will boost human creativity.\n\nTake OpenAI\u2019s Sora, for instance, released last week. When Sam Altman had teased it a year back, he had invited creative prompts on X to instantly generate videos with it. Indian entrepreneur Kunal Shah famously gave \u2018A bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view\u2019 and Sora produced a spectacular video (bit.ly/3ZgGnHD).\n\nHowever, it was not Sora that was being creative, but Kunal, who would not have imagined a creation like this unless he had a tool like Sora or Runway to manifest his innate human creativity. Thus, I believe that a combination of humans and AI will give rise to a new era of creativity.\n\nPrediction Four of Twelve\u2014AI creates a new customer: The Industrial revolution brought with it the transactional Industrial customer who rarely used technology, and the internet brought the digital comparison-driven and social customer who searched and clicked her way through brands.\n\nAlso read: These 4 AI stocks could see incredible growth in 2025\n\nA new kind of customer will emerge in this age of AI\u2014someone who lives in the era of infinite hyper-personalized choice and has immersive and conversational interaction with brands, AI that anticipates her needs and brand relationships that are collaborative rather than functional or emotional (bit.ly/4ffrueN).\n\nThis will mean a big change in business and marketing as they adjust to this reality.\n\nThe next set of predictions will be around what I consider the biggest trend of 2025\u2014Agentic AI. Here is a video (bit.ly/4fnaJ1h) that offers more."

Marts will also close next week for Christmas holidays.\n\nCows\n\nAs with prime cattle, there is plenty of demand for good-quality cull cows, especially younger animals.\n\nBase quotes have moved up 4p/kg to 400p/kg for O+3 grading animals, with deals of 410p to 430p/kg on offer for good-quality suckler types.\n\nNI sheep: deals at 700p/kg for lambs\n\nThe live trade for fat lamb remains strong, with exporters and agents for Irish factories very active for heavy lots, pushing prices well above \u00a3160 and topping \u00a3171.\n\nAt the plants, the best quote is 680p/kg, but deals are being reported at 700p/kg to match the live ring.\n\nIn Gortin, heavy lambs were a strong trade, with 25kg to 27kg making \u00a3163 to \u00a3170, 24kg to \u00a3155.50 and 23kg to \u00a3143.\n\nKilrea sold a big show of 1,850 lambs from 630p to 684p/kg, no change on last week. Light lambs at 19kg made \u00a3130, 18.5kg at \u00a3126.50, 24kg sold to \u00a3161.50 and 23kg to \u00a3154.50.\n\nIn Markethill, 1,160 lambs sold from 630p to 687p/kg, little change on last week. Saintfield sold 600 lambs from 620p to 700p/kg in a steady trade. Texels at 32kg made \u00a3171, with 25.5kg Charolais at \u00a3160. There was a big run from \u00a3147 to \u00a3160. Lighter sorts at 20kg made \u00a3124.\n\nIn Ballymena, store lambs were a strong trade. Mules hit \u00a3162 and \u00a3140, with a run of Texels from \u00a3125 to \u00a3137.\n\nA big sale of 1,800 fat lambs were also a steady trade. Lambs at 24.5kg made \u00a3162.50, 24kg at \u00a3159.50, 22kg made \u00a3148 and 21kg at \u00a3147.\n\nFat ewes\n\nThe trade for fat ewes is strong this week. In Gortin, ewes topped \u00a3248, with a run from \u00a3134 to \u00a322. In Kilrea, top was \u00a3250. In Saintfield, the best Texels made \u00a3270 and \u00a3260, with a big run from \u00a3168 to \u00a3238.\n\nRead more\n\nSuckler cows in freefall as 50,000 gone"

Since then, it has been rising steadily, with just one or two small reductions.\n\nThe overall index remains in a very good place, with prices historically high relative to 2023 and the pre-pandemic years.\n\nIn Europe, prices seemed to settle this week, particularly for butter, with the market nudging up by \u20ac55/t. When considering the decline in prices in recent weeks this is a really good result.\n\nAverage butter prices are now \u20ac7,185/t and while significantly lower than they were three weeks ago, it\u2019s a good price if it extends into the new year and beyond.\n\nWMP and cheddar are much more stable in Europe, with WMP up \u20ac10/t and cheddar down \u20ac10/t. SMP has been under a bit more pressure in the European market and at the GDT, as it fell by \u20ac30/t this week in Europe and is currently trading at \u20ac76/t behind the GDT price, indicating limited appetite in Europe for skim.\n\nAs dairy markets wind down for Christmas, next year\u2019s outlook is less certain, but futures are predicting prices to come down for almost all categories."

            "article_content": "What\u2019s Ahead in Generative AI in 2025? (Part One)\n\nPredictions for AI in the coming year.\n\nThe generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom will continue unabated over the next several years. As 2025 approaches, I predict the following key trends in generative AI.\n\nPrediction #1: Expanding Generative AI Usage\n\nAdoption of generative AI will accelerate across business and consumer markets in 2025 and beyond. Already, generative AI features are becoming a key differentiator in enterprise applications in the form of conversational user interfaces, embedded digital assistants, natural-language chatbots, task-oriented copilots, and other large language model (LLM)-powered productivity augmentations.\n\nTDWI research shows that productization of generative AI is starting to gain traction in enterprises. A recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness showed that 30% of organizations have already deployed the technology or have expressed a significant interest in adopting it in the coming year. By the same token, 46% are discussing how generative AI could be useful in their businesses.\n\nPrediction #2: More Transformative Experiences\n\nGenerative AI will transform the experience of more devices, applications, and services in 2025. Already, voice chatbots powered by generative AI are becoming a popular choice for the self-service experience of every app, including no-code business analytics tools.\n\nTDWI research shows that generative AI is rapidly changing how enterprises get work done. A recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that 37% of organizations have already built or are planning to deploy generative AI chatbots for customer support applications, 28% for marketing content generation, 26% for onboarding new employees, and for many other use cases. Over the next several years, we predict that generative AI will democratize many professions as knowledge workers adopt tools that enable them to single-handedly produce sophisticated deliverables that once required highly skilled teams and expensive, time-consuming production processes.\n\nTDWI research also shows that the generative AI application experience will grow more multimodal. In 2025 and beyond, multimodal LLMs will proliferate as developers create more generative AI apps that work with text, image, video, audio, and other data modalities. In the recent TDWI survey on achieving success with modern analytics, 46% of enterprises report either using generative AI text prompting now to generate images and other modalities or plan to do so over the next few years.\n\nPrediction #3: More Sophisticated Platforms and Tools\n\nGenerative AI will be a principal driver in the evolution of enterprise data foundations in 2025.\n\nDemand for multimodal applications of generative AI will drive evolution of enterprise data lakes, data pipelines, data governance, and much more. Likewise, adoption of generative AI will bring such platforms and tools as vector databases, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation into the enterprise mainstream.\n\nIn the coming year, prompt engineering will continue its rapid maturation into a substantial body of proven practices for eliciting the correct output from LLMs and other foundation models.\n\nWithin generative AI development tool sets, embedding libraries will become an essential component for developers to build increasingly sophisticated similarity searches that span a diverse range of data modalities. The recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness shows that 28% of organizations already use or are deploying vector databases to store vector embeddings for use with AI models, while 32% plan to adopt those databases in the next few years.\n\nIn addition, generative AI developers in 2025 will have access to a growing range of tools for no-code development of \u201cagentic\u201d applications that provide autonomous LLM-driven copilot, chatbot, and other functionality and that can be orchestrated over more complex process environments. Agentic workflows, leveraging a new phenomenon known as a \u201clarge action model,\u201d will be a growing focus of intelligent process automation.\n\nPrediction #4: More Diverse Models and Data\n\nDevelopers will have access in 2025 to a growing range of sophisticated models and data for building, training, and optimizing generative AI applications\u2014including both commercial and open-source models.\n\nThe recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that around 25% of enterprises are experimenting with private or public generative AI models, while 17% are building generative AI apps that use company data with pretrained models. The survey also showed that 41% of enterprises are exploring how to use generative AI to build apps that use private data.\n\nOnline cloud marketplaces will become a favorite source of third-party training data for more enterprise AI developers. I also predict that enterprises will increasingly rely on synthetic data generation as an alternative for training generative AI in use cases where authentic source data is either too costly, restricted, or unavailable for their needs.\n\nRead more predictions about AI governance and ROI in Part Two of this article."

            "article_content": "Erica Hobbs\n\nSpecial to The Detroit News\n\nA new limited-time exhibit at the Cranbrook Institute of Science invites visitors of all ages to exclaim 'Eureka!' as they learn new ideas in math, science, and history. \u201cThe Science of Archimedes\u201d \u2015 running through June 1 \u2015 is a largely hands-on exhibit that delves into the life and discoveries of the ancient Greek mathematician and physicist, highlighting the lasting impact of his work on modern science. It features more than100 items, including 60 replicas of historical artifacts and interactive reconstructions of ancient machines and technologies, accompanied by explanatory panels that provide context for Archimedes' work.\n\nMichael Stafford, Ph.D., the Susan Flint Cooper Director of Cranbrook Institute of Science, said Archimedes was one of history\u2019s most innovative mathematicians and engineers in history whose work formed the basis of future discoveries.\n\n\u201cHe probably was the very first of what we think of as \u2018Renaissance\u2019 people, even though he didn\u2019t live anywhere near the time window of the Renaissance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis exhibit is designed to help learners of all ages\u2026 to be able to explore some of these themes [in math and science] on their own.\u201d\n\nArchimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BCE) is known for his discoveries and inventions in geometry, mechanics and hydrostatics. He is arguably most famous for the legend that he exclaimed \u201cEureka!\u201d (\u201cI have found it!\u201d) and ran naked through the streets of Syracuse upon discovering the principle of buoyancy, now known as Archimedes' Principle.\n\nSome of the concepts and contraptions featured in the exhibit include Archimedes\u2019 Ballista, the Claw of Archimedes, Archimedes\u2019 Heat Ray and the Archimedes\u2019 Screw. The exhibit is divided into themes of Archimedes\u2019 life, including \u201cMachines of the Ancient World,\u201d \u201cEnergy Machines\u201d and \u201cThe Power of Shapes.\u201d Visitors can play on contraptions that feature compound pulleys, levers and inclined planes to learn about principles in equilibrium and energy, as well as do puzzles with shapes to better understand geometry. One of the most popular activities is a pair of sound parabolas that allow visitors to communicate from opposite sides of the room that teach about sound waves.\n\n\u201cArchimedes\u2019 Legacy\u201d focuses on how Archimedes\u2019 work impacted the discoveries of later scientists, including Galileo and Da Vinci, which Stafford said is particularly important.\n\n\u201cArchimedes provided the building blocks and the building concepts that our modern technological world is based upon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what I want people to know, that science isn't just a moment of time, it's a continuum.\u201d\n\nLathrup Village resident Richard Harrison is a frequent visitor to the museum and brought his teenage niece and nephew to the exhibit. Although he said he knows the history and science of Archimedes already, he enjoyed experiencing the machines up close and echoed Stafford\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get the kids involved in science, you\u2019ve got to see the fundamentals working and see what you can do with even just a little bit of science knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause everything\u2019s obviously a lot more complex now, and you need to [work on] these basics, and it\u2019s fun to see maybe how you can build.\u201d\n\nSeven-year-old Charlie Hager visited the museum on a school field trip and said he liked playing with the machines.\n\n\u201cI think the pulleys where you like pull it down is really fun, and [there\u2019s a] thing where you can sit down on it, and then you go down up, down up.\u201d\n\nHis mother Amy Hager said she liked that the kids not only got to learn about the things around them, but also who invented them and when. She also liked how interactive the exhibit is.\n\n\u201cI love that the very few things that they can\u2019t put their hands on, they have a video to explain everything that\u2019s happening and all of the materials that are used,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a feeling that I\u2019m about to go to Walmart and have some unusual science experiments at home.\u201d\n\n'The Science of Archimedes'\n\nnow through June 1\n\nCranbrook Institute of Science\n\n1 Institute Way, Bloomfield Hills\n\nTickets: $8 for adults; $6 for children (ages 2-12) and seniors (65+) on top of general museum admission ($14 for adults, $10.50 for children and seniors).\n\nHours: 10 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays; 10 a.m. \u2013 10 p.m. Fridays; 10 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m. Saturdays; and noon \u2013 4 p.m. Sundays.\n\nVisit https://science.cranbrook.edu."

            "article_content": "As OpenAI and Google joust this December, with the former\u2019s 12 Days of Innovation challenge, and the latter countering it with its Gemini 2 AI model, I look beyond these skirmishes to predict my Twelve Trends for AI going into 2025 and beyond.\n\nI will describe them over three columns. Each of these has a theme, and today\u2019s four predictions are around how humans and AI will draw closer to each other\u2014in work, life and relationships.\n\nAlso read: Indian software majors need a clear strategy to ride the AI wave\n\nPrediction One of Twelve\u2014English is the new coding: As our generation was growing up, we were told that learning English was the passport to success. We did that and were arguably successful in our careers and businesses. Our children in turn are told that learning how to code is the passport to success, thus coding is the new English.\n\nThis led to 10-year-olds being dragged to code camps to learn Python and JavaScript. With Generative AI, this changes: Every time we write an English prompt for ChatGPT or any of its ilk, we are actually \u2018coding: i.e., giving it a set of instructions to perform some task for us, whether it\u2019s a summarization, video-creation or a write-up.\n\nExcept that now we are doing it in our natural human language rather than the language of the machine. This is profound, as it has the potential to democratize coding and make eight billion of us code. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella declaimed that instead of learning the machine\u2019s language, machines would have to learn ours.\n\nJensen Huang of Nvidia joined the chorus saying that the true potential of AI is that none of us would have to learn how to code. Thus, English, or any other natural language, becomes the new coding language.\n\nPrediction Two of Twelve\u2014AI is the new UI: AI will become the new user interface. Bill Gates presciently wrote in November 2023 (bit.ly/3tSMNkB): \u201c\u2026you won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do.\"\n\nA UI has been how humans and machines have interacted with each other, as the difficult UIs of machine language and DOS (disk operating system) gave way to a GUI (graphical user interface), search bars, browsers and apps. Simpler UI led to a faster, intuitive and more productive interaction with a machine.\n\nThe AI-driven shift will lead to voice UI as the spoken word becomes the new way to interact with machines, similar to our interactions with other humans. We will chat with ChatGPT or Gemini to work with them on our day-to-day tasks.\n\nOur devices will morph, with voice becoming the primary interface rather than a large screen. The first proto-devices are already out, though not terribly successful, like the Rabbit R1 and AI Pin. An AI assistant becomes the UI.\n\nPrediction Three of Twelve\u2014AI and humans are the new creators: GenAI is a cognitive technology and can do creative tasks like writing, creating art and composing poetry. This has left many human creators deeply worried about their jobs as creativity was supposed to be a uniquely human skill. I believe, however, that Generative AI will boost human creativity.\n\nTake OpenAI\u2019s Sora, for instance, released last week. When Sam Altman had teased it a year back, he had invited creative prompts on X to instantly generate videos with it. Indian entrepreneur Kunal Shah famously gave \u2018A bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view\u2019 and Sora produced a spectacular video (bit.ly/3ZgGnHD).\n\nHowever, it was not Sora that was being creative, but Kunal, who would not have imagined a creation like this unless he had a tool like Sora or Runway to manifest his innate human creativity. Thus, I believe that a combination of humans and AI will give rise to a new era of creativity.\n\nPrediction Four of Twelve\u2014AI creates a new customer: The Industrial revolution brought with it the transactional Industrial customer who rarely used technology, and the internet brought the digital comparison-driven and social customer who searched and clicked her way through brands.\n\nAlso read: These 4 AI stocks could see incredible growth in 2025\n\nA new kind of customer will emerge in this age of AI\u2014someone who lives in the era of infinite hyper-personalized choice and has immersive and conversational interaction with brands, AI that anticipates her needs and brand relationships that are collaborative rather than functional or emotional (bit.ly/4ffrueN).\n\nThis will mean a big change in business and marketing as they adjust to this reality.\n\nThe next set of predictions will be around what I consider the biggest trend of 2025\u2014Agentic AI. Here is a video (bit.ly/4fnaJ1h) that offers more."

It promises groundbreaking performances, including a better understanding of real-world physics, the movement of bodies and objects, and the nuances of human expression. According to Google, the model can adapt to a multitude of cinematographic effects (tight or wide shots, low-angle views, front or rear tracking, etc.) to create unprecedented sequences in ultra-high definition (4K) and up to several minutes long. On paper, this is even more impressive than what OpenAI offers with Sora, a tool that is certainly impressive, but which sometimes lacks fluidity and can also have difficulty coordinating certain movements. Moreover, Sora does not allow the creation of sequences longer than 20 seconds in high resolution (1080p). All videos generated by Veo 2 include a SynthID watermark that is invisible on screen, but which identifies the resulting videos as being generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nAlongside this, Google has unveiled Imagen 3, the latest version of its image generator. It guarantees brighter and generally better-composed images, in a wider variety of artistic styles, from photorealism to impressionism, abstract and animated.\n\nFinally, Google has released Whisk, an experimental tool capable of generating new images without prompts, but using other elements, photos or drawings, as sources of inspiration. By combining several visuals, such as a portrait and a landscape, for example, the tool creates new, unique and personalized images.\n\nVeo 2 and Imagen3 are currently reserved for YouTube creators and companies using Google Labs' VideoFX and ImageFX. Whisk is currently available as an experimental tool, also via Google Labs and only in the United States. \u2013 AFP Relaxnews"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA quantum circuit (left) is passed to an encoder (top) that creates a feature set for the ML model (right) based on the circuit and the quantum processor unit (QPU) targeted for execution. The executed noisy expectation values serve as the input to the model whose aim is to predict their noise-free value. To achieve this, the model is trained beforehand (bottom, blue highlighted path) against target values of example circuits. These are obtained either using noiseless simulations in the case of small-scale, tractable circuits or using the noisy QPU in conjunction with a conventional error mitigation strategy in the case of large-scale, intractable circuits. The trained model operates without the need for additional mitigation circuits, thus reducing runtime overheads. Credit: Liao et al. Execution and training for tractable and intractable circuits with ML-QEM\n\nQuantum computers have the potential of outperforming classical computers in some optimization and data processing tasks. However, quantum systems are also more sensitive to noise and thus prone to errors, due to the known physical challenges associated with reliably manipulating qubits, their underlying units of information.\n\nEngineers recently devised various methods to reduce the impact of these errors, which are known as quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques. While some of these techniques achieved promising results, executing them on real quantum computers is often too expensive or unfeasible.\n\nResearchers at IBM Quantum recently showed that simple and more accessible machine learning (ML) techniques could be used for QEM. Their paper, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, demonstrates that these techniques could achieve accuracies comparable to those of other QEM techniques, at a far lower cost.\n\n\"We started to think about how to depart from conventional physics-based QEM methods and whether ML techniques can help to reduce the cost of QEM so that more complex and larger-scale experiments could come within reach,\" Haoran Liao, co-first author of the paper, told Phys.org.\n\n\"However, there seemed to be a fundamental paradox: How can classical ML learn what noise is doing in a quantum calculation running on a quantum computer that is doing something beyond classical computers? After all, quantum computers are of interest for their ability to run problems beyond the power of classical computers.\"\n\nAs part of their study, the researchers carried out a series of tests, where they used state-of-the-art quantum computers and up to 100 qubits to complete different tasks. They focused on tasks that are impossible to complete via brute-force calculations performed on classical computers, but that could be tackled using more sophisticated computational methods running on powerful classical computers.\n\n\"This interesting 'paradox' is another motivation for us to think about whether careful designs can tailor ML models to find the complicated relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer to help quantum computations,\" said Liao.\n\nThe primary objective of the recent study by Liao and his colleagues was to accelerate QEM using widely used ML techniques, demonstrating the potential of these techniques in real-world experiments. The team first started experimenting with a complex graph neural network (GNN), which they used to encode the entire structure of a quantum circuit and its properties, yet they found that this model performed not very well.\n\n\"It surprised us to find that a simpler model, random forest, worked very well across different types of circuits and noise models,\" explained Liao.\n\n\"In our exploration of the ML techniques for QEM, we tried to shape and vary the noise to see how different techniques ML or conventional, perform in different scenarios, so we can better understand the capability of ML models in 'learning' the noise\u2013we are not passive bystanders, but active agents.\n\n\"We not only tried to benchmark but also demystify the 'black box' nature of the ML models in the context of learning relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a more powerful quantum computer. \"\n\nTop three panels: Average expectation values from 100-qubit Trotterized 1D TFIM circuits run on the ibm_brisbane QPU. Top panel corresponds to a Clifford circuit, whose ideal, noise-free expectation values are represented by the green dots. The random-forest-mimicking-ZNE (RF-ZNE) curve corresponds to training the random forest (RF) model on zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) and readout-error-mitigated hardware data. This approach enables efficient, low-overhead error mitigation in scenarios where ideal outcomes from classical simulation are infeasible. Bottom panel: The error between ZNE-mitigated and RF-ZNE mitigated expectation values. The approach achieves a 25% reduction in overall and 50% reduction in runtime deployment in terms of quantum resource overhead compared to ZNE, as shown in the inset. Credit: Liao et al.\n\nThe experiments carried out by Liao and his colleagues demonstrate that ML could help to accelerate physics-based QEM. Remarkably, the model that they found to be most promising, known as random forest, is also fairly simple and could thus be easy to implement on a large scale.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the future, they could help to enrich the present understanding of quantum errors, while also potentially improving the accessibility of QEM methods.\n\n\"Is the relationship between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer fundamentally unlearnable? We didn't know the answer,\" said Liao.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons why this would be impossible to determine. However, we showed this key relationship is in fact learnable by ML models in practice. We also showed that we are not passive bystanders, but we can shape the noise in the computation to improve the learnability further.\"\n\nLiao and his colleagues also successfully demonstrated that ML techniques for QEM are less costly, yet they can achieve accuracies comparable to those of alternative physics-based QEM techniques. Their experiments were the first to demonstrate the potential of machine learning algorithms for QEM at a utility scale.\n\n\"Even in the most conservative setting, ML-QEM demonstrates more than a 2-fold reduction in runtime overhead, addressing the primary bottleneck of error mitigation and a fundamentally challenging problem with a substantial leap in efficiency,\" said Liao.\n\n\"Most conservatively, this translates into at least halving experiment durations\u2014e.g., cutting an 80-hour experiment to just 40 hours\u2014drastically reducing operational costs and doubling the regime of accessible experiments.\"\n\nAfter gathering these promising results, Liao and his colleagues plan to continue exploring the potential of AI algorithms for simplifying and upscaling QEM. Their work could inspire other research groups to conduct similar studies, potentially contributing to the advancement and future deployment of quantum computers.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, and we're excited about the field of AI for quantum,\" added Liao. \"We would like to emphasize that at least in the context of QEM, ML is not to replace, but to facilitate physics-based methods, that they can build off each other.\n\n\"This opens the door for what's possible with ML in quantum and is an invitation to the community that ML can perhaps accelerate and improve many other aspects of quantum computations.\"\n\nMore information: Haoran Liao et al, Machine learning for practical quantum error mitigation, Nature Machine Intelligence (2024).

The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, fellow members of Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance.\u201d\n\nThe Houthi-controlled satellite channel al-Masirah said that some of the strikes targeted power stations in the capital, as well as the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea. The channel, citing its correspondent in the port city of Hodeida, said that at least seven people had been killed at the nearby port of Salif, while another two had been killed at the Ras Isa oil terminal.\n\nOthers suffered wounds at the Hodeida port as well, it said.\n\nAn Israeli military statement offered neither specifics on the targets hit, nor any damage assessment. But it alleged that the Houthis used the sites \u201cfor military purposes,\u201d including smuggling Iranian weapons.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said the strikes hit energy and port infrastructure, which he alleged the rebels \u201chave been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military action.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suggest the leaders of the Houthis to see, to understand and remember: Whoever raises a hand against the state of Israel, his hand will be cut off, whoever harms us\u2014will be harmed sevenfold,\u201d Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said.\n\nRebel-held Hodeida, about 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Sanaa, has been key for food shipments into Yemen as its decade-long war has gone on. There\u2019s also longstanding suspicion that weapons from Iran have been transferred through the port.\n\nThe strikes happened just after Israel\u2019s military said that its air force intercepted a missile launched from Yemen before it entered the country\u2019s territory.\n\n\u201cRocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling debris from the interception,\u201d the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded near Tel Aviv and the surrounding areas, and a large explosion was heard overhead at the time.\n\nIn Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, fragments from the missile collapsed a school there, without causing any injuries.\n\nBrig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack hours later in a prerecorded video statement, saying the rebels fired two of its \u201cPalestine\u201d ballistic missiles at Israel.\n\nIsrael previously struck Hodeida and its oil infrastructure in July after a Houthi drone attack killed one person and wounded 10 in Tel Aviv. In September, Israel struck Hodeida again, killing at least four people after a rebel missile targeted Israel\u2019s Ben Gurion airport as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was arriving back to the country.\n\nAmerican forces have also launched a series of strikes on the Houthis over nearly a year because of Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor. On Monday, the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command said that it hit \u201ca key command-and-control facility\u201d operated by the Houthis in Sanaa, later identified as the al-Ardi complex once home to the government\u2019s Defense Ministry.\n\nBut Israel appears to have carried out Thursday\u2019s strikes alone. A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the attacks, said that Washington had no part in them. While the U.S. has carried out strikes on the Houthis in the past, it\u2019s also balancing the desires of Saudi Arabia to reach a permanent ceasefire in its stalemated war with the rebels.\n\nThe Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage.\n\nIsrael\u2019s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn\u2019t distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.\n\nThe rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.\n\nThe Houthis have battled the Saudi-led coalition in the wider Yemen war, which has killed more than 150,000 people, including civilians. The conflict also has created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters that\u2019s believed to have killed tens of thousands more.\n\nBut the Houthis are still standing even as Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah has decimated those militant groups. Meanwhile, Israel and Iran have exchanged direct fire while the government of Syria, an enemy of Israel since its founding in 1948, collapsed in the face of a rebel advance as the region\u2019s wars have upended Iran\u2019s network of allied proxy groups.\n\nRead More: The Key Players to Know to Understand What\u2019s Happening in Syria"

            "article_content": "The Teamgroup T-Force Cardea Z540 (starts at $149.99; $299.99 for 2TB as tested) is among the fastest solid-state drives (SSDs) we have tested, lagging behind only two other PCI Express (PCIe) 5.0 drives, the Editors' Choice-award-winning Crucial T705 and the Corsair MP700 Pro SE. The Z540 turned in good performance numbers on our benchmarks and is available in capacities up to 4TB. Teamgroup sells a nifty, heavy-duty fan-based heatsink that can be used with it, or you can use your motherboard's heatsink instead. However, be forewarned that the hardware requirements for running PCIe 5.0 SSDs are rather rigorous. You may have to buy a recent boutique desktop that supports this standard\u2014or build a PC yourself with the latest components\u2014to get PCIe 5.0's speed benefits and make purchasing such an SSD worthwhile. But if you're geared up for 5.0, it's a good pick.\n\nDesign: Standard Gen 5 Innards, Optional Heatsink\n\nThe Z540 is a four-lane solid-state drive running the NVMe 2.0 protocol over a PCIe 5.0 bus. This internal SSD comes in the standard M.2 Type-2280 (80mm-long) \"gumstick\" format. The drive uses Micron 232-layer 3D TLC NAND chips and Phison's new Gen 5-optimized PS5026-E26 controller. If these core specs seem familiar, it's because we have seen them in almost all of the other Gen 5 SSDs we have thus far reviewed: the Gigabyte Aorus 10000, the Crucial T705, the Corsair MP700, and the Seagate FireCuda 540. (Stymied by some of these terms? Check out our handy guide to SSD jargon.)\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe Z540 comes with its heat spreader\u2014which doubles as a label bearing the Z540 name\u2014unattached. This reveals the SSD's Phison controller and chips on the drive's circuit board. The heat spreader and label will adhere to the top of the drive.\n\nPCIe 5.0 SSDs\u2014even ones with considerably lower throughput speeds than the Z540\u2014promise a major boost in peak speeds over PCIe 4.0 drives, but you can take advantage of PCIe 5.0 only if you have recent hardware that supports the standard. Only the latest boutique desktops are likely to be PCIe 5.0-ready off the shelf, so you may have to build your own PC from the ground up or update an existing system to gain the required connectivity. The oldest Intel and AMD platforms that are liable to have PCIe 5.0 support are Intel 12th Gen Core CPUs with motherboards based on Intel's Z690 or Z790 chipset; or AMD Ryzen 7000 processors with an AM5 motherboard built around an X670, X670E, or B650E chipset.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nHowever, just because you have one of those chipsets or a newer one doesn't guarantee that the motherboard maker actually implemented a PCIe 5.0-capable M.2 SSD slot. That's up to the board maker, so check your system's or motherboard's specs and documentation to make sure you actually have such a slot before investing in one of these drives. Some boards have PCIe 5.0 expansion slots for graphics cards and other PCI Express cards, but you need one or more PCIe 5.0-capable M.2 slots, specifically.\n\nGen 5 SSDs like the Z540 are capable of prodigious speeds, which means lots of excess heat must be shed to avoid throttling or long-term degradation. (Throttling is a protection mechanism built into most SSDs that prevents sustained overheating but reduces performance.) The Z540 comes with a graphene heat spreader, which Teamgroup stresses is not enough in itself to keep the drive suitably cool. That leaves two alternatives: to rely on your desktop's motherboard's heatsink for cooling, or to use a powerful, heavy-duty heatsink. We got good results with both methods.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nAlong with the Z540, Teamgroup sent us its T-Force Dark AirFlow SSD Cooler ($26.99), an optional active cooling (fan-based) heatsink built to handle massive SSD heat dissipation, such as that needed for a Gen 5 drive. The cooler has a cord with an end connector that fits a motherboard's four-pin fan header for power and control.\n\nIn addition to running our usual benchmarks, with the Z540 cooled by our testbed motherboard's heatsink (which yielded our official results, as seen in the charts below), we ran the PCMark 10 Storage Overall and 3DMark Storage tests with the Z540 paired with the Dark AirFlow heatsink. In PCMark 10, their results were effectively identical, while in the gaming-centric 3DMark Storage, the Dark AirFlow score was better by just over 2%, right at the threshold at which we consider a score difference to be significant.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThat might be enough for an ardent gamer to spend the extra money to spring for this device in an effort to eke out whatever small advantage they can. Another reason to get the Dark AirFlow is simply that it looks cool. The aluminum-finned array with double copper heat pipe, all painted matte black, has a rather steampunk aesthetic. (Of course, you can only admire it if you have a see-through PC case.) That said, you should be fine using the Z540 plus its heat spreader with your motherboard's heatsink.\n\nOur only quibble with the Dark AirFlow is that Teamgroup doesn't offer a bundle of it and the Z540, as the heatsink seems a natural fit for this hyperfast SSD. The prices in the table below are Teamgroup's list prices for the drive alone, but note that the Z540 frequently sells through major retailers at a substantial discount, particularly for the 1TB and 2TB capacities.\n\nAs for durability, expressed as lifetime write capacity in total terabytes written (TBW), the Z540 matches the Crucial T705 in its various capacities. Its durability rating is a notch below the Corsair MP700 Pro, the ADATA Legend 970, and the Aorus 10000, which are rated at 700TBW for 1TB and 1,400TBW for 2TB. And the Seagate FireCuda 540 is the reigning Gen 5 durability champ, with ratings of 1,000TBW for the 1TB stick and 2,000TBW for 2TB.\n\nThe TBW spec is a manufacturer's estimate of how much data can be written to a drive before some cells begin to fail and get taken out of service. Teamgroup covers the Z540 with a warranty of five years or until you hit the rated TBW figure in data writes, whichever comes first. But the drive's durability rating is such that unless you're writing unusually large amounts of data to the SSD, it's a safe bet that the Z540 will last the full warranty period and well beyond.\n\nOne key note: The Z540 lacks the AES 256-bit hardware-based encryption found on Gen 5 SSDs from Crucial and Corsair.\n\nTesting the Teamgroup T-Force Cardea Z540: Speedy, Especially for Gaming\n\nIn benchmarking the Z540, we used our latest testbed PC, designed specifically for benchmarking PCIe 5.0 M.2 SSDs. It is built around an ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard with an AMD X670 chipset, 32GB of DDR5 memory, one PCIe 5.0 x4 M.2 slot (with lanes that have direct access to the CPU), and three PCIe 4.0 slots. The system sports an AMD Ryzen 9 7900 CPU using an AMD stock cooler; a GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics card with 8GB of GDDR6 SDRAM; and a Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 Snow 750-watt power supply. The boot drive is an ADATA Legend 850 PCIe 4.0 SSD. (The reviewed SSD is tested as a secondary data drive.)\n\nWe put the Teamgroup drive through our usual slate of internal solid-state drive benchmarks: Crystal DiskMark 6.0, UL's PCMark 10 Storage, and UL's 3DMark Storage benchmark. The last measures a drive's performance in a number of gaming-related load and launch tasks.\n\nCrystal DiskMark's sequential speed tests provide a traditional measure of drive throughput, simulating best-case, straight-line transfers of large files. We use this test largely to see if our tested speeds are in line with the manufacturer's rated speeds.\n\nThe Z540 effectively matched its rated speeds; both read and write scores were within a fraction of a percent of their ratings. Only the Crucial T705 and the Corsair MP700 Pro SE have had meaningfully higher sequential read and write scores among the SSDs we have tested.\n\nCrystal DiskMark also measures a drive's 4K (small-file) read and write speeds; while the Z540's 4K read speed was in the middle of the pack, its write score was the highest (by a hair) among our comparison group of Gen 5 drives. Good 4K write performance is especially important for an SSD used as a boot drive, though we test them as secondary drives.\n\nAs impressive as the blistering raw speed of the Z540 and other PCI Express 5.0 drives is, it's of little use if your SSD can't quickly perform the tasks you need it for. The PCMark 10 Storage Overall test measures a drive's speed in performing a variety of routine tasks such as launching Windows, loading games and creative apps, and copying both small and large files. The Z540's Overall score was toward the top of the pack.\n\nThe PCMark 10 Overall score is an aggregate of the results of individual tests, which consist of a variety of simulated system tasks. The Z540's scores were in the middle of the pack on most of these, including two of the game-launching tasks (Battlefield 5 and Call of Duty Black Ops 4). However, it managed to eke out the high score in Overwatch launching, beating out the Crucial T705 by a hair.\n\nThe 3DMark Storage benchmark tests an SSD's proficiency in performing a variety of gaming-related tasks. In it, the Z540 was in the thick of a close pack of four SSDs that trailed the T705 by a large margin.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nVerdict: A Fast and Worthy Gen 5 Stick\n\nThe Teamgroup T-Force Cardea Z540 is a fast, capable Gen 5 internal SSD that performed well on nearly all of our benchmarks. It is competitively priced and available in capacities up to 4TB. To dissipate the heat from its sizzling speed, you'll need a heavy-duty heatsink, either the one included with your motherboard or a fan-based model sold separately by Teamgroup. Although the Editors' Choice-winning Crucial T705 outperformed it on most of our benchmarks, the Z540 is a worthy alternative if the price difference is right. Just be forewarned that to get prodigious speeds out of it, you'll need a late-model rig that has the right kind of M.2 slot, like you would with any PCI 5.0 SSD."

            "article_content": "Cybersecurity resilience is an organization's capacity to predict, withstand, and recover from cyberthreats and incidents in order to continue functioning normally even in the face of challenges. As businesses rely more and more on cloud services to conduct their operations, cyber resilience has become essential in the cloud era. Organizations must take a proactive stance that blends strong security measures with efficient recovery plans as cyber threats change and become more complex. Because cloud systems offer strong security features, advanced monitoring capabilities, and adaptable recovery options, they are essential for improving businesses' cyber resilience.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHow to Handle Resilience in Cybersecurity.\n\nCreate a thorough plan for cyber resilience\n\nDevelop a plan for the organization that integrates cybersecurity protections with business continuity planning. CEOs and operational staff at all organizational levels ought to be involved.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAdopt Cloud-Native Security Solutions\n\nUse cloud-native security solutions that offer automated threat detection, incident response, and monitoring. These technologies ought to be flexible enough to adjust to changes in the cloud environment and defend against new risks as they arise.\n\nUpdate and Test Disaster Recovery Plans Frequently\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMake sure that plans for disaster recovery are not only in place but are also updated and tested regularly. This entails simulations of cyber events and backing up critical data and apps.\n\nAdopt a Zero-Trust Security Framework\n\nAdopt a zero-trust architecture, assuming no device or user is intrinsically reliable. Before allowing access to resources, this paradigm necessitates ongoing user identity and device health verification.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nInvest in Staff Education and Awareness\n\nHold frequent training sessions to educate staff members on cybersecurity risks like ransomware attacks, social engineering, and phishing. Providing staff with information can significantly lower the likelihood that an assault would be effective.\n\nThe Importance of Resilience in Cybersecurity\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEffective cyber resilience plans enable businesses to recover quickly from emergencies by reducing downtime and maintaining continuous service delivery. Businesses that put flexibility first can manage emergencies with few problems, which helps them keep the confidence and trust of their clients. Cyber resilience strongly emphasizes flexibility, enabling companies to address new risks in the ever-evolving digital environment. Businesses can lower financial losses and safeguard their reputation by concentrating on data protection and breach remediation.\n\nFinding and fixing common setup mistakes in cloud systems that could lead to security issues and data breaches requires using Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools. Common misconfigurations that CSPM can help identify include the following:\n\nImportance of Recognizing Configurations\n\nAdvertisment\n\nBecause criminals frequently use these configuration errors to cause data breaches and security errors, it is essential to identify them. Organizations may monitor their cloud environments and ensure that settings follow security best practices and regulations by using CSPM solutions. CSPM solutions greatly enhance cloud security by identifying and resolving common configuration problems that could otherwise lead to significant vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Misconfiguration Description Overly Permissive Access Granting excessive permissions to users or service accounts, violating the principle of least privilege, which can lead to unauthorized access and actions. Open Storage Buckets Publicly accessible storage buckets (e.g., AWS S3) that expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, increasing the risk of data leaks. Misconfigured Network Security Groups Incorrect settings in network security groups that allow unwanted inbound or outbound traffic, making cloud resources vulnerable to attacks. Disabled Monitoring and Logging Turning off logging and monitoring features, which prevents organizations from detecting suspicious activities or breaches in real-time. Insecure Backup Configurations Backups stored without proper encryption or access controls, making them susceptible to unauthorized access and data breaches. Exposed Access Keys Hard-coded or improperly managed API keys and credentials that are publicly accessible, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources. Unrestricted Inbound/Outbound Ports Leaving ports open without restrictions, which can lead to exploitation by attackers through brute-force attacks or known vulnerabilities. Missing Alerts for Security Events Failure to set up alerts for critical security events, resulting in delayed responses to potential incidents and increased damage. Configuration Drift Changes in configurations over time that deviate from established security policies, often due to manual updates or automated processes not being monitored.\n\nAdvertisment\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "When Jeremiah and Laura Burke produced their documentary about Pastor David Platt, they never imagined it would reach a global audience. Released in fall 2023, the film has garnered more than 100,000 views on Conversations that Matter alone, with additional viewership across other platforms.\n\nAn earlier BNG article about the documentary \u2014 The Real David Platt: The Hijacking of McLean Bible Church \u2014 has drawn tens of thousands of readers.\n\nIt is unusual for a group of laypeople to lead such a public revolt against their own church and pastor as what has happened at McLean, a five-campus nondenominational megachurch in suburban Washington, D.C. It is more unusual for laity to take their own church to court. And it is unheard of to create a two-part documentary series outlining grievances against the pastor.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what has happened at McLean Bible Church, where the arrival of David Platt as pastor in 2017 set off a chain of events not unprecedented in American churches but absolutely unprecedented in the public nature of the dispute. The disaffected members have their own website to tell their story.\n\nOne reason for the public attention is that Platt came to the pastorate from the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention International Mission Board.\n\nSome longtime McLean members did not want anything to do with the SBC because they are proudly nondenominational.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Platt and other church leaders have denied any wrongdoing and have protrayed themselves as victims of a campaign by disgruntled church members.\n\nJeremiah and Laura Burke\n\nAmong those leading the charge against Platt are Jeremiah and Laura Burke. He is a self-described \u201ctypical layman\u201d who comes from a business background in wealth management.\n\n\u201cI was a member of McLean since 2005 \u2026 just a rank-and-file member. A Christian husband and father of four children, just a regular everyday guy, nothing unique,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who David Platt was until he started speaking at McLean and became the pastor of the church.\u201d\n\nHis awareness of church politics at McLean heightened only after Platt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cIt had come to my attention that he had written a couple of books because he spoke in the summer of 2015,\u201d Burke recalled. \u201cHe had come to the church and was a guest pastor for a weekend event, and that was my first exposure to David Platt. Then it wasn\u2019t again until 2016 or 2017, when the church started transitioning out of their prior senior pastor, that David\u2019s name started coming up as being the new pastor to replace long-time pastor Lon Solomon.\u201d\n\nWhile initially open to Platt\u2019s leadership despite his admiration for Solomon, Burke\u2019s perspective began to shift by 2020.\n\n\u201cThere was a series of issues that had come to light over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen David first came on, I guess there was a gloominess over the church in a sense, in that it didn\u2019t seem like everyone was aware of what was happening but you kind of just trust your leadership. It seemed like there were some things that were just not right in the whole transition process.\u201d\n\nBurke reflected on the sudden leadership change: \u201cFor the 10 years I was at McLean, you had a solid pastor. Lon Solomon was a stalwart leader and then all of a sudden, he was gone, David came in and Lon never came back. We had been in Israel on a trip with him, he does these tours to Israel. I remember him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die in the pulpit. I\u2019m not leaving this church.'\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by Baptist News Global, Solomon provided this statement: \u201cIf you have seen Part 2 of the video series, you will see that I was removed by the elders from all operational involvement at MBC early in 2017 as a part of my separation agreement. Also, as part of my separation agreement, I am not at liberty to comment on events at MBC or David Platt.\u201d\n\nThe summer of 2020\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked a turning point, as Platt addressed racial and social issues from the pulpit, following controversy from his 2019 prayer over former President Donald Trump. McLean historically had attracted political figures, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, but Burke perceived a shift in atmosphere: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to see famous political people there. David made a story out of it. I guess a lot of people interpreted it as an apology, and that kind of riled some people up.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further complicated matters.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when COVID came up, the shutting down the church was another huge exodus of people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was problematic because everybody started going to other churches. At McLean you had to register to attend, you had to let them know you were coming.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point for Burke came when he discovered the nondenominational church\u2019s connection to the SBC, which he believed violated church bylaws prohibiting denominational affiliation. His investigation revealed McLean\u2019s involvement with the SBC of Virginia and the North American Mission Board through church planting initiatives.\n\n\u201cI just started to research whether we were part of the SBC or not,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn December 2020, at the first congregational meeting they had in person, I remember a lady asking if we were part of the denomination and David said from the pulpit no. However, that\u2019s not what I discovered.\u201d\n\nSBC church planting partnerships\n\nNot only was Platt educated and ordained by Southern Baptists and served in Southern Baptist leadership, the Bible church got involved in church planting partnerships with the SBC North American Mission Board.\n\nChurch leaders contend this partnership with the SBC \u201cwas not a secret.\u201d The SBC connection predated Platt\u2019s tenure, coordinated primarily through Clint Clifton, who Burke identifies as \u201cseemingly the genesis of this SBC relationship.\u201d\n\nThe discovery left Burke feeling betrayed: \u201cI had no idea I was a Southern Baptist. I had no idea for years that I was a Southern Baptist.\u201d\n\nThe conflict escalated to the point where Burke and his family were charged with trespassing at their own church. Determined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nDetermined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nConflict remains, as does attention\n\n\u201cI feel like I have two jobs now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally grassroots, but the amount of people who have seen it is kind of mind boggling. It\u2019s all over the world at this point; people in Romania and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have seen it. There\u2019s a gentleman who reached out from Russia asking if he could have permission to translate it into Russian and distribute it through Russia. It\u2019s been overwhelming.\u201d\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nSeven years after Platt\u2019s arrival as pastor, the dispute is not resolved and Burke and other unhappy members and former members continue to press their case. Their next target is seeking to document where tens of thousands of dollars from NAMB went because they do not believe all the named church plants even exist.\n\nChurch leaders, meanwhile, released their own investigation that stated: \u201cAfter review of numerous financial transactions associated with this partnership, we are encouraged that no improper financial transactions were discovered either during annual external audits by an independent accounting firm or during the discovery process in the lawsuit. We can say, however, that the financial transactions for the church planting partnership were sometimes confusing.\u201d\n\nThat report also said: \u201cIt is unquestionably clear that MBC did not give up any independence or cede any authority over our local church to the SBC or any other denomination. We at MBC remain committed to maintaining our autonomy and independence as a local body of believers according to our understanding of what the Bible teaches about the authority of the local church, and we are grateful that we are moving closer and closer to a day when these kinds of legal updates will no longer be necessary.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nUnderstanding the David Platt story | Analysis by Maina Mwaura\n\nDavid Platt hopes for a biblical gospel instead of an American gospel\n\nFor now, David Platt has won the battle against internal critics at McLean Bible Church\n\nDavid Platt steps up schedule to step down at IMB"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA quantum circuit (left) is passed to an encoder (top) that creates a feature set for the ML model (right) based on the circuit and the quantum processor unit (QPU) targeted for execution. The executed noisy expectation values serve as the input to the model whose aim is to predict their noise-free value. To achieve this, the model is trained beforehand (bottom, blue highlighted path) against target values of example circuits. These are obtained either using noiseless simulations in the case of small-scale, tractable circuits or using the noisy QPU in conjunction with a conventional error mitigation strategy in the case of large-scale, intractable circuits. The trained model operates without the need for additional mitigation circuits, thus reducing runtime overheads. Credit: Liao et al. Execution and training for tractable and intractable circuits with ML-QEM\n\nQuantum computers have the potential of outperforming classical computers in some optimization and data processing tasks. However, quantum systems are also more sensitive to noise and thus prone to errors, due to the known physical challenges associated with reliably manipulating qubits, their underlying units of information.\n\nEngineers recently devised various methods to reduce the impact of these errors, which are known as quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques. While some of these techniques achieved promising results, executing them on real quantum computers is often too expensive or unfeasible.\n\nResearchers at IBM Quantum recently showed that simple and more accessible machine learning (ML) techniques could be used for QEM. Their paper, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, demonstrates that these techniques could achieve accuracies comparable to those of other QEM techniques, at a far lower cost.\n\n\"We started to think about how to depart from conventional physics-based QEM methods and whether ML techniques can help to reduce the cost of QEM so that more complex and larger-scale experiments could come within reach,\" Haoran Liao, co-first author of the paper, told Phys.org.\n\n\"However, there seemed to be a fundamental paradox: How can classical ML learn what noise is doing in a quantum calculation running on a quantum computer that is doing something beyond classical computers? After all, quantum computers are of interest for their ability to run problems beyond the power of classical computers.\"\n\nAs part of their study, the researchers carried out a series of tests, where they used state-of-the-art quantum computers and up to 100 qubits to complete different tasks. They focused on tasks that are impossible to complete via brute-force calculations performed on classical computers, but that could be tackled using more sophisticated computational methods running on powerful classical computers.\n\n\"This interesting 'paradox' is another motivation for us to think about whether careful designs can tailor ML models to find the complicated relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer to help quantum computations,\" said Liao.\n\nThe primary objective of the recent study by Liao and his colleagues was to accelerate QEM using widely used ML techniques, demonstrating the potential of these techniques in real-world experiments. The team first started experimenting with a complex graph neural network (GNN), which they used to encode the entire structure of a quantum circuit and its properties, yet they found that this model performed not very well.\n\n\"It surprised us to find that a simpler model, random forest, worked very well across different types of circuits and noise models,\" explained Liao.\n\n\"In our exploration of the ML techniques for QEM, we tried to shape and vary the noise to see how different techniques ML or conventional, perform in different scenarios, so we can better understand the capability of ML models in 'learning' the noise\u2013we are not passive bystanders, but active agents.\n\n\"We not only tried to benchmark but also demystify the 'black box' nature of the ML models in the context of learning relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a more powerful quantum computer. \"\n\nTop three panels: Average expectation values from 100-qubit Trotterized 1D TFIM circuits run on the ibm_brisbane QPU. Top panel corresponds to a Clifford circuit, whose ideal, noise-free expectation values are represented by the green dots. The random-forest-mimicking-ZNE (RF-ZNE) curve corresponds to training the random forest (RF) model on zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) and readout-error-mitigated hardware data. This approach enables efficient, low-overhead error mitigation in scenarios where ideal outcomes from classical simulation are infeasible. Bottom panel: The error between ZNE-mitigated and RF-ZNE mitigated expectation values. The approach achieves a 25% reduction in overall and 50% reduction in runtime deployment in terms of quantum resource overhead compared to ZNE, as shown in the inset. Credit: Liao et al.\n\nThe experiments carried out by Liao and his colleagues demonstrate that ML could help to accelerate physics-based QEM. Remarkably, the model that they found to be most promising, known as random forest, is also fairly simple and could thus be easy to implement on a large scale.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the future, they could help to enrich the present understanding of quantum errors, while also potentially improving the accessibility of QEM methods.\n\n\"Is the relationship between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer fundamentally unlearnable? We didn't know the answer,\" said Liao.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons why this would be impossible to determine. However, we showed this key relationship is in fact learnable by ML models in practice. We also showed that we are not passive bystanders, but we can shape the noise in the computation to improve the learnability further.\"\n\nLiao and his colleagues also successfully demonstrated that ML techniques for QEM are less costly, yet they can achieve accuracies comparable to those of alternative physics-based QEM techniques. Their experiments were the first to demonstrate the potential of machine learning algorithms for QEM at a utility scale.\n\n\"Even in the most conservative setting, ML-QEM demonstrates more than a 2-fold reduction in runtime overhead, addressing the primary bottleneck of error mitigation and a fundamentally challenging problem with a substantial leap in efficiency,\" said Liao.\n\n\"Most conservatively, this translates into at least halving experiment durations\u2014e.g., cutting an 80-hour experiment to just 40 hours\u2014drastically reducing operational costs and doubling the regime of accessible experiments.\"\n\nAfter gathering these promising results, Liao and his colleagues plan to continue exploring the potential of AI algorithms for simplifying and upscaling QEM. Their work could inspire other research groups to conduct similar studies, potentially contributing to the advancement and future deployment of quantum computers.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, and we're excited about the field of AI for quantum,\" added Liao. \"We would like to emphasize that at least in the context of QEM, ML is not to replace, but to facilitate physics-based methods, that they can build off each other.\n\n\"This opens the door for what's possible with ML in quantum and is an invitation to the community that ML can perhaps accelerate and improve many other aspects of quantum computations.\"\n\nMore information: Haoran Liao et al, Machine learning for practical quantum error mitigation, Nature Machine Intelligence (2024).

            "article_content": "Following the global success of Cunk on Earth, pioneering documentary-maker Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) returns with her most ambitious quest to date; venturing right up the universe and everything, to examine life itself. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of it all?\u201d is a question humans have been asking themselves since the dawn of time. But as we cling to our dying planet, working round the clock while we\u2019re slowly being replaced by machines, now more than ever, people are desperately looking to make sense of their lives \u2013 before someone invents a computer that makes sense of it for them. This one off special will see Philomena tackle some of the most complex concepts to have ever been discovered, including Quantum Physics, Existentialism, Nihilism, Hedonism \u2013 and at least four other isms \u2013 as well as exploring subjects from the big bang to biology, morals to meditation and art to artificial intelligence.\n\nWatch the trailer for Cunk on Life\n\nIn her search for answers, she\u2019ll also examine some of history\u2019s foremost thinkers and ground-breaking creatives, from Dostoyevsky to Van Gogh, from Nietzsche to whoever came up with those signs in kitchens that say, \u2018Live Laugh Love\u2019. Along the way, she\u2019ll be meeting leading experts and academics and not letting them leave until she\u2019s got to the bottom of such questions as: what is life, why are we bothering to find out and when\u2019s lunch? Watch Cunk on Life on BBC iPlayer and BBC Two on Monday 30 December from 9pm MJ\n\nInterview with Philomena Cunk\n\nPhilomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) (Image: BBC/Broke & Bones)\n\nPhilomena, tell us about your new documentary, Cunk on Life? The aim of this new documentary was very straightforward. My previous documentaries, like Cunk On Britain, have taken me to some very interesting but, ultimately, very cold places, like Britain. With Cunk On Life I wanted to go to somewhere warmer. The show is all about what it means to be human - I ask important questions about the meaningless of life. There\u2019s a lot in it about religion, but also quite a lot about sex. Partially because without sex they\u2019d be no life, but mainly because no one would watch a show about religion over Christmas, so we had to throw in the sex to make people tune in. What research did you do when searching for the meaning of life? I thought if I did a show about being human then I wouldn\u2019t have to do any research, because I already knew what it was like to be human. Sort of. But I did do a lot of research: I studied the work of all the major motivational fridge magnet makers and mixed it with some eastern philosophies I\u2019d learned about from tiktok.\n\nPhilomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) (Image: BBC/Broke & Bones)\n\nDid anyone or anything inspire you to make this show? Yes. All humans. I was looking at one of them one day through a window, and I thought: What does it mean to be human? What is the Human Conditioner? Do they sell it at Superdrug? And would humans watch a TV show about all this stuff if we put it on between Christmas and New Year when everyone is bored out of their tiny minds and just might watch a show that\u2019s not about celebrities dancing, or how to make the perfect roast potato? If you could interview anyone in the world who would it be and why? I think I\u2019ve interviewed everyone I\u2019ve ever wanted to. Because I don\u2019t actually really want to interview anyone. What advice would you give to anyone who wants to be a documentary film maker? I don\u2019t want to give any advice to other documentary makers because they might end up being better than me. You\u2019ll get no advice from me, I\u2019m pulling up the ladder mate.\n\nPhilomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) (Image: BBC/Broke & Bones)\n\nDid anyone ever give you any good advice on making these shows? Award-winning documentary maker Adam Curtis once gave me some very good advice but he said it in his doom-laden voice so I was too frightened to remember what it was. Something about \u201cthe very opposite happening\u201d I think. You\u2019ve travelled the five corners of the world when making your documentaries, where was the worst place you\u2019ve had to go? Actually the worst place I\u2019ve travelled to is Chieveley services on the M4 on Boxing Day. It\u2019s one of those terrible ones that trick you because it\u2019s actually 10 minutes drive from the motorway via loads of roundabouts. You should have seen the queue for the ladies. As well as being a landmark film maker, you\u2019ve also written two books, do you prefer writing books or making a tv show? Both are quite boring but in different ways. Writing books is being bored on your own. Making a TV show is being bored but with other people staring at their phones near you.\n\nPhilomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) and Brian Cox (Image: BBC/Broke & Bones)\n\nDo you have any new year\u2019s resolutions? I\u2019m vowing to try and have a Brat Winter. Also, I\u2019m going to get my wisdom teeth removed next year. Get them frozen in case I want them when I\u2019m older. What\u2019s next for Philomena Cunk? I\u2019ll probably just have a sit down, eat a Ritz biscuit and listen some ambient noise for a bit until me Ocado turns up. And I\u2019m thinking of going on tour where I lipsync to my audiobooks. Save my voice."
