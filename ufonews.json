The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

            "article_content": "LLMs. Co-pilots. Agents. Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the hype behind artificial Intelligence remains palpable. Major tech companies are pouring billions into sparkling new infrastructure for AI workloads. Utility companies in areas with dense data centers are seeing revenues and power consumption soar. Yet, outside of semiconductor and infrastructure players, few companies have seen significant revenue from AI products. Investors are increasingly left asking: When will these massive capital investments start benefiting software companies? What\u2019s causing the delay?\n\nWhere AI is showing up in our world today\n\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear: AI has been around in many industries for years, including financial services. Quantitative traders long ago embraced techniques that are now classified as \"AI\" including non-linear regressions and advanced optimization techniques. What excites us now are the rapid advancements in new areas like Generative AI, pattern recognition and deep learning. You\u2019ve likely noticed early use cases of GenAI like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot or Adobe\u2019s AI Assistant. These tools are being integrated into software platforms across industries with new use cases emerging at a rapid clip.\n\n\n\nAcross other industries, anecdotal datapoints of GenAI value creation are starting to stack up. Walmart recently shared that large language models helped them to \u201ccreate or improve more than 850 million pieces of data across its product catalog,\u201d completing the project with just 1% of the typical headcount. Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar datapoint when he disclosed that the use of Amazon\u2019s GenAI assistant saved 7,500 \u201cdeveloper-years\u201d of programming time in a recent major software update.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most salient example of AI generating value is hiding under our collective noses in social media, where algorithmic matching on posts like Instagram and TikTok optimizes the content and ads we see. This area has seen tremendous gains in recent years and has helped leading AI adopters in social media improve ad returns and gain market share.\n\n\n\nAt our firm, we\u2019ve adopted AI with care, led initially by eager adoption of various AI copilots and coding assistants. We have also explored alpha-generating use cases like pattern recognition and sentiment analysis. Looking further out, we are excited about developing custom assistants to superpower our investment and client teams. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more is yet to come.\n\nThe delay in benefits of AI for software investors\n\n\n\nSo, if AI is being leveraged across industries, why hasn\u2019t the software sector seen the uptick in growth that investors expected? New revenue streams for software firms haven\u2019t met the hype, leading to stark underperformance for the software industry with a few notable exceptions. We believe this partly reflects Amara\u2019s law: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The rapid adoption of ChatGPT, and the sense of magic many of us experienced when first using it, may have exacerbated elevated expectations.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that product development and adoption take time. AI development and testing alone can take months, if not years, before a project is ready for deployment. This timeline is further elongated by data governance challenges. As anyone who has worked at a massive conglomerate can likely attest, many large firms have poorly structured and poorly governed data policies, rife with operational silos and inconsistent rules. This complicates development. Compliance and cybersecurity can further stretch timelines. While many firms are seeing real and tangible benefits from AI, getting these projects into production is taking longer than anticipated, creating a mismatch between investor expectations and reality.\n\n\n\nWhile this delay has certainly led to disappointment among software investors, it has not been the only issue. The rapid pace of breakthrough innovation in AI has also sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the room for other technology projects. Some companies have paused major technology initiatives, hesitating to commit to multi\\year contracts while still developing their AI strategy. All of this has elongated sales cycles and created a temporary slowdown in software demand.\n\nA window of opportunity for longer-term investors\n\nSurveys have shown that corporations are seeing real, tangible value creation from AI, especially in cost reduction. But AI isn\u2019t just about optimizing existing business models \u2014 it\u2019s driving innovation in areas like autonomous cars, healthcare, clean energy, and even entertainment and media. These advancements have the potential to reshape industries and open up new markets. For long-term investors, this makes AI more than a short-term play \u2014 it\u2019s a foundation for future growth. Again, like many transformative technologies, AI\u2019s impact may have been overestimated in the short term, but its long-term potential will likely have been underestimated.\n\n\n\nWe believe the current market anxiety in software creates an opportunity for long-term investors. The project delays are largely temporary in nature and should be resolved as firms update their technological road map and set AI priorities. Recently, we\u2019ve noticed renewed enthusiasm in the software demand environment. As demand normalizes, we expect industry growth to re-accelerate, which should remove the wet blanket from valuations.\n\nBottom line\n\n\n\nA Gartner survey earlier this year found that 90% of CFOs expected increased AI budgets in 2024, with none planning cuts. Yet, it has been clear that many projects have faced delays due to complexity, data governance issues, security concerns, and a scarcity of talent. This has created an air pocket in an industry that is usually known more for \"eating the world\" than for booms and busts. Just as the internet didn\u2019t take off overnight, AI still has some development before it starts to deliver significant results for investors. We believe those returns are coming, and the impact is on the horizon if investors can remain patient. Now is the time for investors to position themselves for the shift from hype to impact. As AI projects move from development to deployment, those who stay the course or increase their exposure to the right opportunities are likely to see meaningful returns ahead.\n\nDave Smith is head of technology investing at Bailard.

            "article_content": "I\u2019ve spent the past year covering every major phone launch in the US, and each one loudly declared the same thing: AI is here, and ours is the AI phone you\u2019ve been waiting for. Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least.\n\nThe theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn\u2019t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you\u2019ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You\u2019ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you\u2019re free, and add it to your calendar. You\u2019ll ask it about something a friend said to you \u2014 maybe in an email or a text, you\u2019re not sure which \u2014 and it will go find the information for you.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini assistant has steadily improved since launch but still falls short of a true AI assistant.\n\nPersonally, all of the above sounds great to me. I\u2019d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone \u2014 and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos.\n\nThe (supposedly) AI smartphones of 2024\n\nAll of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn\u2019t call them AI smartphones.\n\nSupposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos \u2014 but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as \u201cI am eating my chair.\u201d (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off.\n\nSometimes AI gets it right \u2014 it correctly identifies an artificial plant here.\n\nLater in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company\u2019s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There\u2019s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools \u2014 from silly to seriously worrying.\n\nSome of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don\u2019t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly \u2014 and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you.\n\nApple Intelligence started shipping a month after the iPhone 16, but its blockbuster features won\u2019t arrive until 2025.\n\nLast but not least, we met the iPhones \u201cbuilt for Apple Intelligence\u201d in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple\u2019s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming.\n\nRight now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they\u2019re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There\u2019s more to come, but what\u2019s here now certainly doesn\u2019t add up to an AI smartphone.\n\nA messy year for AI\n\nIt\u2019s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that\u2019s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It\u2019s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it\u2019s so goddamn loud!\n\nAnd there really might be a signal in there \u2014 especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions \u2014 like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising \u2014 so they\u2019re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too.\n\nThe trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it\u2019s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon \u2014 before our collective patience starts to run out."

However, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons a new property they were moved to has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \"paranormal activity\".\n\nThe mum told proceedings how since they moved in \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d. She claims while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. She claimed she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting. She said: \u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids.\n\n\u201cI just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d the Irish Mirror reported.\n\nThe High Court heard how the mould in the first property was so bad the entire family had to sleep downstairs instead of their bedrooms. They also had to make several hospital visits. The couple claim in the five years they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October. At the High Court Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court. Mr Justice Simons said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "EJ Moreno and Flickering Myth honor the year in horror\u2026\n\nWelcome to the second Flickering Myth Horror Awards, the place to spotlight the best in our beloved spooky genre.\n\nFrom fan-favorite horror outings to prestige heavyweights, this year\u2019s landscape looks much different than the previous years. It\u2019s great to see the genre thrive like this. Our Flickering Myth Horror Awards include the standard fare like Best Picture, Actress, and Actor. But we\u2019ll also have special awards like Unexpected Horror Hit and Camp Classic of the Year.\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s kick things off with the second inductee into the Flickering Myth Horror Hall of Fame\u2026\n\nHorror Hall of Fame\n\nTim Burton\n\nDecades to his name, Tim Burton can still make a banger like this year\u2019s Beetlejuice Beetlejuice; that\u2019s how you earn a spot in the Hall of Fame. It\u2019s rare for a legacy sequel to work, but Burton is still that good.\n\nThere was a time when we doubted Burton. A string of films didn\u2019t match his classic work in the late 80s and early 90s, and it seemed like his brand of horror was a thing of the past. Then Wednesday dropped, starting his collaboration with Jenna Ortega, and that would lead to Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. The stars aligned perfectly.\n\nTim Burton introduced a whole generation to the macabre, including myself, and I can\u2019t deny how good it was to be reminded of his greatness this year. Whether it was the original Beetlejuice or its sequel, Edward Scissorhands, or Mars Attacks, Burton knows how to bring joy through some wild worlds, and for that, we are grateful.\n\nUnexpected Horror Hit\n\nLonglegs\n\nNeon had a wildly impressive year, with multiple films breaking into the mainstream. Indie horror had quite a great year in general, and a movie like Longlegs is precisely why.\n\nIn what I labeled \u201cthe scariest film of the decade,\u201d this Oz Perkins-helmed film stormed onto the scene and held no prisoners. We had one of the best viral marketing campaigns in years, the mystery of what Nicolas Cage\u2019s titular Longlegs actually looked like, and great buzz leading up to the release. Once it dropped, it made some mega bucks.\n\nAs it stands, Longlegs grossed $127 million worldwide on a budget of less than $10 million, becoming Neon\u2019s highest-grossing film domestically and the highest-grossing independent film of the year. That type of mainstream magic is hard for horror to capture, and we\u2019re so happy this fantastic film found a home with the right sickos.\n\nRunner-up: Terrifier 3\n\nCamp Classic of the Year\n\nThe Deliverance\n\nA Tubi movie featuring drag queens almost nabbed this spot, but that purposeful campy romp couldn\u2019t touch this. What makes The Deliverance so campy is that the film is seemingly 100% taking itself seriously.\n\nDirector Lee Daniels seemingly sought to make a serious horror film about a poverty-stricken family facing a demonic force. Still, the final product was not serious and only occasionally creepy. Where the film really shines is a bat-shit crazy performance from Glenn Close as the family matriarch. It starts at a ten and gets better when she\u2019s possessed.\n\nDaniels shows some power as a horror filmmaker, but there are bizarre choices after bizarre choices. Glenn Close delivers lines that will live with me for a lifetime, and the final act shows the wonderfully talented Andra Day doing the absolute most. It\u2019s not great, but as a lover of \u201cbad\u201d movies, this totally earns a spot on my list.\n\nRunner-up: Slay\n\nBest International Film\n\nExhuma\n\nSouth Korean horror has long been the go-to for genre fans seeking something different. Looking back to the genre-bending Oldboy, the horror community knows we\u2019re in for a treat, and Exhuma is a delight.\n\nAt the time of writing, this is the sixth highest-grossing South Korean film of all time and deserves so. It\u2019s a stunningly haunted film with all the signature we\u2019ve come to expect from the country\u2019s genre films, including film industry staple Choi Min-sik. Even with that, it still finds a way to be surprising with how it twists paranormal films.\n\nThe direction and writing are strong, but if there had to be one reason to see this, it would be Kim Go-eun. The actress steals this film and can\u2019t be missed when it comes to great horror performances this year. You must go out of your way to see this terrifyingly great South Korean export; the year is incomplete without this.\n\nRunner-up: The Devil\u2019s Bath\n\nBest Horror Director\n\nCoralie Fargeat (The Substance)\n\nAfter her debut in 2017 with Revenge, we knew we had a powerhouse brewing in Coralie Fargeat. She had a knack for tension, body horror, and femininity, all of which are on display with her latest, The Substance.\n\nFargeat has a distinct vision and is unafraid to add humor to even the most heinous moments. There\u2019s a fabulous look with the world she creates; The Substance has such a polished chic aesthetic captured perfectly through her cinematic language. The way she uses the camera to photograph these nasty visuals in beautiful places? Masterwork.\n\nFargeat nabbed a Best Director nomination at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice awards at the time of reporting. Could she make it all the way to the Academy Awards? It would be quite the moment for The Substance and Fargeat, but also for the horror genre. Much pressure is on, but we know the genre fans love what she did.\n\nRunner-up: Robert Eggers (Nosferatu)\n\nBest Horror Actor\n\nDavid Howard Thornton (Terrifier 3)\n\nIn the prestige space, Hugh Grant has been gaining nominations for his role in Heretic. While that\u2019s an excellent turn, I have to look at what horror fans are discussing: Art the Clown.\n\nTerrifier 3 dominated the fall of 2024, becoming quite the meme while also finding a way to turn its online chatter into box office success. It grossed big bucks at the box office and perfected its slasher formula. Everything lined up perfectly for the movie, and at the center is one brilliant turn by actor David Howard Thornton.\n\nEach time the actor has stepped into the role of Art the Clown, we\u2019ve seen horror magic. In my review of the film, when I call Thornton the \u201cCharlie Chaplin of Horror,\u201d I wholeheartedly mean that. He does so much with no dialogue and always knows the tone needed for this twisted madness. This generation finally has its horror icon.\n\nRunner-up: David Dastmalchian (Late Night With The Devil)\n\nBest Horror Actress\n\nDemi Moore (The Substance)\n\nSpeaking of prestige, Demi Moore has entered an awards season decades after her last run. Shockingly, it\u2019s with the year\u2019s most gnarly and visceral films, something unheard of during most years.\n\nMoore held nothing back in her daring performance, evoking Joan Crawford\u2019s camp work within the world of the nasty Cronenberg fever dream. The actress spends most of the film working alone, which you overlook at first, but it soon drives home the isolated nature that led her to take the titular substance.\n\nPrestige films have discussed aging before, and horror has used this metaphor for years, but something about Demi Moore at the center of the film brings out this new layer. As a tabloid figure during her career, Moore had fuel to add to this fire, and she masterfully became a vehicle for director Coralie Fargeat\u2019s work.\n\nRunner-up: Lily-Rose Depp (Nosferatu)\n\nBest Horror Sequel or Remake\n\nNosferatu\n\nRobert Eggers tackling his first IP had to be remarkable. When he chose to remake Nosferatu, we were all hyped. After seeing it, the horror community should know how lucky we are to have Eggers.\n\nTackling one of the seminal horror films of our lifetime is daunting enough, but capturing that time period accurately while maintaining what made the original Nosferatu is nearly impossible. Somehow, Robert Eggers not only does it but also does it with such power that we will be hailing this as his masterwork for years.\n\nFilled with great performances and some of the year\u2019s best production designs, every element of this film is firing on all cylinders. And you can\u2019t talk about this film without mentioning the powerful work of Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Count Orlock. The actor has his best turn since Pennywise in IT and is a significant part of why this is so perfect.\n\nBest Horror Film\n\nThe Substance\n\nIt\u2019s not often that a modern horror film can evoke the feelings we had when we saw the body horror work of Brian Yuzna or David Cronenberg. It\u2019s even rarer that the film makes the Oscars shortlist.\n\nOne of the most audacious projects in recent memory, The Substance by French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat, held space in 2024. It began with a solid marketing campaign, which led to some hilarious memes that will live with us. The film found its home with film critics and horror lovers alike, and the warm reception morphed into awards nominations.\n\nMainstream audiences, horror fans, and awards pundits gathered around this project. Fargeat bared her soul through her vivid filmmaking, allowing her actors to breathe life into the material perfectly. Add the spectacle of the makeup effects and that final act, and it\u2019s great to see how The Substance became the moment.\n\nRunner-up: Longlegs\n\nWhat do you think of the second Flickering Myth Horror Awards?

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered how malignancies like cancer grow, evolve, and, most importantly, how we can stop them? The answer may be hidden within the microscopic world of our cells.\n\nThis year, the World Health Organization has reported that cancer afflicted over 20 million people and claimed nearly 10 million lives. The search for an effective cure is a race against time, and two bright minds from Texas A&M University have brought us a step closer to the finish line.\n\nEnvironment around cancer cells\n\nGraduate students Samere Zade and Ting-Ching Wang from Texas A&M University, working under the guidance of the Lele Lab, have uncovered valuable insights into cancer\u2019s progression.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Communications, reveals how the stiffening of a tumor cell\u2019s environment influences the structure and function of its nucleus. This offers a new perspective on why cancer cells proliferate so aggressively.\n\n\u201cCancer has proven to be a difficult disease to treat. It is extremely complex, and the molecular mechanisms that enable tumor progression are not understood,\u201d explained Dr. Tanmay Lele, a joint faculty member in biomedical and chemical engineering.\n\n\u201cOur findings shed new light into how the stiffening of tumor tissue can promote tumor cell proliferation.\u201d\n\nStiffness and cancer cell proliferation\n\nThe study highlights how tumor cells respond to stiff surroundings. The nuclear lamina, which is like a support structure for the cell\u2019s nucleus, becomes smoother and tighter when the cell interacts with a stiff environment.\n\nThis happens because the cell spreads out on the rigid surface, causing changes in the nucleus\u2019s structure.\n\nAs a result, a specific protein called yes-associated protein (YAP) moves into the nucleus. YAP plays a crucial role in controlling how cells multiply. Once inside the nucleus, YAP activates processes that make the cancer cells grow and divide more rapidly, contributing to the aggressive spread of the tumor.\n\n\u201cThe ability of stiff matrices to influence nuclear tension and regulate YAP localization could help explain how tumors become more aggressive and perhaps even resistant to treatment in stiffened tissues,\u201d said Zade.\n\nStructural integrity of the cell nucleus\n\nThis discovery expands on earlier research by the Lele Lab, which showed that the cell nucleus acts similarly to a liquid droplet. Just like a droplet maintains its shape due to surface tension, the nucleus relies on a protein called lamin A/C in its nuclear lamina to preserve its structural integrity.\n\nIn the new study, researchers found that lamin A/C not only helps maintain the nucleus shape but also plays a key role in regulating cancer cell growth.\n\nWhen lamin A/C levels are reduced, it disrupts the ability of the yes-associated protein (YAP) to move into the nucleus.\n\nSince YAP is responsible for promoting cell multiplication, this reduction in lamin A/C limits YAP activity in the nucleus, slowing down the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. This finding suggests that lamin A/C could be a potential target for cancer treatments.\n\n\u201cThe protein lamin A/C plays a key role here \u2013 reducing it made cells less responsive to environmental stiffness, particularly affecting the localization of a key regulatory protein (YAP) to the nucleus,\u201d Zade explained.\n\nImplications for cancer treatments\n\nThe implications of this research extend beyond academic understanding. By uncovering how matrix stiffness drives nuclear changes and regulates pathways like YAP signaling, the findings open the door to innovative cancer treatments.\n\n\u201cUncovering how matrix stiffness drives nuclear changes and regulates key pathways, like YAP signaling, opens the door to developing therapies that target these mechanical pathways,\u201d said Zade.\n\n\u201cDrugs or treatments could be designed to soften the tumor environment, disrupting the physical cues that help cancer cells thrive. Lamin A/C and related nuclear mechanics could become targets for cancer treatments.\u201d\n\nFuture research directions\n\nThe Lele Lab plans to expand its research by investigating the extent to which these findings apply to tumors derived from patients. This step could bridge the gap between lab-based discoveries and practical treatments, bringing hope to millions affected by cancer.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, and the National Science Foundation. The Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station administered the funding, highlighting the institution\u2019s commitment to innovative cancer research.\n\nThrough their meticulous study of nuclear mechanics and tumor stiffness, the researchers at the Lele Lab have paved the way for new avenues in cancer treatment.\n\nThe findings highlight the importance of targeting the physical microenvironment of cancer cells, offering a fresh perspective in the fight against one of humanity\u2019s most challenging diseases.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Microsoft and OpenAI have had something of a symbiotic relationship, with the former giving billions of capital to a startup AI lab and in return gaining early access to cutting-edge models that are now baked into Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity software. The two companies have been headed in diverging directions, however, and Reuters reported today that Microsoft is looking to add more models to its 365 Copilot product that aren\u2019t built by OpenAI.\n\nThe reasoning, according to the report, is that Microsoft sees OpenAI\u2019s cutting-edge GPT-4 model as too expensive and not fast enough to satisfy its enterprise customers. Copilot 365 is an AI-powered assistant built into Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity applications including Word and PowerPoint. The tool is supposed to ingest all of a company\u2019s data and do a myriad of things, like give users the ability to quickly find information without needing to hunt through disparate apps; quickly generate a list of the company\u2019s most profitable business units; or instantaneously summarize meetings and emails.\n\nIt is supposed to do those things, but customers and insiders alike are still underwhelmed by Copilot 365, which costs an extra $30 per month per user on a team. In a recent Business Insider story, employees of Microsoft speaking anonymously called the tools \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cgimmicky,\u201d not working well 75% of the time. On the customer front, Business Insider cited a survey of 123 IT leaders published by management consultancy Gartner, which found only four said Copilot provided significant value to their companies. It should be noted some other stories have reported on companies that have found value in using large language models, such as by simplifying customer support.\n\nSome customers who spoke to Business Insider specifically noted that 365 Copilot is too expensive.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is a frontier, general model, meaning it is trained on vast swaths of data and can be more expensive and slow to run; that is why most models are offered in \u201clite\u201d versions that perform less intensive inference or \u201cthinking.\u201d Microsoft has been training its own in-house, smaller models like one called Phi-4, and Reuters reports that sources speaking to the outlet said the company is looking to \u201ccustomize other open-weight models to make 365 Copilot faster and more efficient.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, it makes sense that Microsoft would want to reduce its reliance on OpenAI. If the company is right and AI is going to be the next generational change in computing, relying on an independent company for the core technology is not a great idea.\n\nMicrosoft has plowed billions of dollars into OpenAI and will receive 75% of its profits until it makes it breaks even on its investment, and even then will still hold a large stake in the startup. The company in effect gets to hedge its bets\u2014build its own in-house models while keeping a lottery ticket in OpenAI in case it continues on its current skyward trajectory.\n\nDespite being the front-runner today, some skeptics of OpenAI say that we may not know a true winner in the AI race yet (should these technologies be as revolutionary as we are told to believe). In the same way that there were numerous search engines that came online in the \u201990s, only to be quickly trounced when the latecomer Google showed up. Microsoft is likely wise to hedge."

            "article_content": "New Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse just dropped: According to the Financial Times, major defense technology companies Palantir and Palmer Luckey\u2019s Anduril are in conversations with SpaceX and OpenAI (among other tech players) to form a consortium to bid for US government defense contracts.\n\nThe goal of the group, which reportedly plans to announce its membership as soon as January, is to disrupt the \u201cprime\u201d contractors who have a habit of scoring major deals with the Pentagon. In the crosshairs of the consortium, there\u2019s Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing.\n\nThere is little question that the legacy brands do well bidding on defense work. According to the Department of Defense\u2019s Fiscal Year 2023 review, Lockheed Martin took home $61.4 billion, RTX (n\u00e9e Raytheon) scored $24.1 billion, and Boeing got a cool $20.1 billion. In 2021, 71% of all of Lockheed Martin\u2019s revenue came from contracts with the US government. Just under 50% of all annual sales for Boeing and RTX went to the feds during the same time period. As The American Prospect has previously pointed out, these are basically state-funded companies but the government has no real control over operations or leadership.\n\nSo would the safety and security of the country improve by disrupting the big three\u2019s vice grip on the Pentagon? Probably, under the assumption that mass-producing weapons of war and supplying them to allies for conflicts that range from mostly just to genocidal is a net positive on national security, which, let\u2019s call that dubious.\n\nBut this particular collection of tech firms as the hammer to bash the oligopoly? It\u2019s not clear that this is an improvement upon the status quo.\n\nPalantir has carved itself out a niche as the Defense Department\u2019s go-to for AI systems. Just this year, it snagged a $100 million contract to build the military AI-powered targeting tools and $480 million to expand the Pentagon\u2019s data analysis and decision making tools. The company has been more than happy to lend its tech to programs that are at best ethically questionable, including being the technological backbone of the Trump administration\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helping lead to the breakup of migrant families and facilitating mass raids that led to the separation of children and parents. The company\u2019s technology has also been central to Israel\u2019s ongoing seige in Gaza that has killed over 45,000 people.\n\nAnduril, called \u201ctech\u2019s most controversial startup\u201d by Bloomberg, has built sensor towers for use on the US-Mexico border to track migrants and has explored the development of autonomous weapons. The company\u2019s big play is building drones for warfare, but it also has its eyes on building surveillance satellites, all of which carry some serious ethical questions attached.\n\nOpenAI recently announced a partnership with Anduril to work on anti-drone systems, but it seems likely that will be the first of many collaborations if the consortium comes together. The agreement, which has caused some upheaval among OpenAI employees who don\u2019t particularly want to be involved in doing defense work, comes after OpenAI quietly removed language from its usage policy restricting the use of its technology for military and warfare purposes.\n\nAnd on top of all that, It\u2019s Peter Thiel all the way down, baby. Thiel, the techno-libertarian lizard man who has not-so-quietly been trying to place his acolytes in as many branches of government as possible, has his hands in basically all of these firms. He founded Palantir, co-founded OpenAI, put major financial backing behind Anduril, and was an early-stage investor in SpaceX. He\u2019s proven himself to be a less-than-scrupulous person with an ideology that can far-too-generously be summed up as \u201ctechnological progress no matter the human cost.\u201d Thiel\u2019s biographer, Max Chafkin, told Time that Thiel is worth fearing, stating, \u201cWhen you combine the hostility to democracy and institutional norms with the bankroll of a billionaire you can potentially do some damage.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, maybe the malignant but status quo evil of the old school defense contractors doesn\u2019t seem quite as bad."

Take the 1973 financial crisis, for example. While the world panicked over inflation and market crashes, savvy investors scooped up undervalued assets and reaped massive rewards when the market rebounded. The lesson? Buy the dips and hold on tight.\n\nThe current bearish trend in the crypto market mirrors this scenario. Meme coins like BTFD Coin, Popcat, Brett, and Turbo offer the perfect chance to invest in low-cost, high-potential assets. Among these, BTFD Coin stands out as a beacon for those looking to turn turbulent times into exponential gains.\n\nHow to Buy BTFD Coin with the BIG50 Discount\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to join the BTFD Coin movement, here\u2019s how to do it.

            "article_content": "Observability, at its core, is about collecting and analyzing data generated from applications, cloud computing resources, and edge devices to ensure software and services are run smoothly, user experiences are optimized, and resources are managed cost-effectively. According to a recent Gartner report, 70% of companies that successfully apply observability will gain a competitive edge through faster problem identification and enhanced decision-making.\n\nHowever, as application development has progressed from monolith stacks to microservices, and user expectations have shifted toward instant digital experiences, companies have accumulated a mix of observability tools, each tailored to different parts of their tech stack. This hodgepodge raises costs, complicates data analysis, and slows issue resolution.\n\nThe Kloudfuse observability platform addresses these challenges by building on three foundational principles: unification, cost optimization, and intelligent automation. Here\u2019s a closer look at the observability landscape, the unique challenges organizations face today, and how Kloudfuse is designed to provide a unified, affordable, and intelligent approach to modern observability."

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"

The speedy flyby will make the probe the fastest human-made object in history, the agency shared December 16 during a NASA Science Live presentation on YouTube.\n\nThe mission has been building up to this historic milestone since it launched on August 12, 2018 \u2014 an event attended by the probe\u2019s namesake, Dr. Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics.\n\nDr. Eugene Parker is pictured with a model of the Parker Solar Probe on May 31, 2017. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nParker was the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him. The astrophysicist, whose research revolutionized humanity\u2019s understanding of the sun and interplanetary space, died at age 94 in March 2022. But he was still able to witness how the spacecraft could help solve mysteries about the sun more than 65 years after the mission was originally envisioned.\n\nThe probe became the first spacecraft to \u201ctouch the sun\u201d by successfully flying through the sun\u2019s corona, or upper atmosphere, to sample particles and our star\u2019s magnetic fields in December 2021.\n\nOver the last six years of the spacecraft\u2019s seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe has collected data to enlighten scientists about some of the sun\u2019s greatest mysteries.\n\nHeliophysicists have long wondered how the solar wind, a constant stream of particles released by the sun, is generated as well as why the sun\u2019s corona is so much hotter than its surface.\n\nAn animation shows the solar wind streaming away from the sun, across the solar system and encountering Earth. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nScientists also want to understand how coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, are structured.\n\nWhen these ejections are aimed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of the planet\u2019s magnetic field, that can affect satellites as well as power and communication infrastructure on Earth.\n\nNow, the time has come for Parker\u2019s closest and final flybys, which could complete the answers to these enduring questions and uncover new mysteries by exploring uncharted solar territory.\n\n\u201cParker Solar Probe is changing the field of heliophysics,\u201d said Helene Winters, Parker Solar Probe\u2019s project manager from Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement. \u201cAfter years of braving the heat and dust of the inner solar system, taking blasts of solar energy and radiation that no spacecraft has ever seen, Parker Solar Probe continues to thrive.\u201d\n\nA blisteringly close flyby of a fiery star\n\nParker\u2019s flyby at around 6:53 a.m. ET on Christmas Eve will be the first of the spacecraft\u2019s final three closest approaches, with the other two expected to occur on March 22 and June 19.\n\nThe spacecraft will be so close that if the distance between Earth and the sun were the length of an American football field, the spacecraft would be about 4 yards from the end zone, according to NASA.\n\nAt this proximity, the probe will be able to fly through plumes of plasma as well as within a solar eruption if one releases from the sun.\n\nThe spacecraft encountered a coronal mass ejection on September 5, 2022. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nThe spacecraft was built to withstand the extremes of the sun and has flown through coronal mass ejections in the past with no impact to the vehicle, said Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Rawafi.\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a carbon foam shield that is 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. On Earth before launch, the shield was tested and able to withstand temperatures near 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 1,400 degrees Celsius). On Christmas Eve, the shield could face temperatures up to 1,800 F (980 degrees C).\n\nMeanwhile, the spacecraft\u2019s interior will be at a comfortable room temperature so the electronics systems and science instruments can operate as expected. A unique cooling system designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory pumps water through the craft\u2019s solar arrays to keep them at a steady temperature of 320 F (160 C), even during close approaches to the sun.\n\nAn animation depicts Parker Solar Probe's close pass near the intense heat of the sun. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nThe spacecraft will conduct its flyby autonomously because mission control will be out of contact with the probe due to its proximity to the sun.\n\nAfter the closest approach, around midnight between Thursday and Friday, Parker will send a signal called a beacon tone back to mission control to confirm the success of the flyby, Rawafi said.\n\nThe beacon tone is a limited piece of data that relays the overall state of the spacecraft, he said.\n\nThe immense set of data and images gathered during the flyby won\u2019t become available to mission control until Parker has moved away from the sun in its orbit, which will occur about three weeks later in mid-January, Rawafi said.\n\nPerfect timing to see an active sun\n\nJust over a year after the Parker Solar Probe first launched, the sun entered a new solar cycle. Now, as Parker makes its closest approach, the sun is experiencing solar maximum, meaning that the mission has had a chance to witness most of a solar cycle and the transitions between its highs and lows, said Dr. C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nThe sun is much more active during solar maximum, as seen in this comparison of solar phases. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nScientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced in October that the sun has reached solar maximum, or the peak of activity within its 11-year cycle.\n\nAt the peak of the solar cycle, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip, causing the sun to transition from calm to active. Experts track increasing solar activity by counting how many sunspots appear on the sun\u2019s surface. And the sun is expected to remain active for the next year or so.\n\nThe sun\u2019s increasing activity became obvious this year during two major displays of auroras on Earth in May and October, when coronal mass ejections released by the sun were directed at our planet. The solar storms are also responsible for generating auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky.\n\nAn array of colors can be seen during an auroral display visible from the International Space Station. NASA\n\n\u201cBoth of those storms caused auroras to be visible down to the very bottom of the United States,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut the May storm was an especially strong storm. In fact, we think it could be a 100- to possibly 500-year event, and that caused auroras very close to the equator, which is extremely unheard of. It was a worldwide event that millions and, hopefully billions, of people, were able to see, and it may not happen again.\u201d\n\nThe data gathered by Parker Solar Probe could enable scientists to better understand solar storms and even how to predict them, Young said.\n\n\u201cThe sun is the only star that we can see in detail, but we can actually go to and measure it directly,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a laboratory in our solar system that allows us to learn about all the other stars in the universe and how all those stars interact with the billions and billions of other planets that may or may not be like our own planets in our solar system.\u201d\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will continue orbiting closely to the sun over the next six months. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nWith that in mind, Rawafi said he hopes that the sun puts on a spectacular show during the probe\u2019s close approaches, enabling scientists to gain insights into the sun\u2019s activity.\n\n\u201cSun, please do your best,\u201d Rawafi said. \u201cGive us the strongest event you can do, and the Parker Solar Probe can deal with it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Today, the push for efficiency is more than just a goal- it's a necessity. Organizations are accelerating efforts to streamline processes, empower teams, and boost productivity to stay ahead of the curve. When workflows are streamlined, productivity increases, enabling organizations to scale effectively and adapt to the demands of an evolving market. AI is fundamentally centered on data\u2014training on the right data, ensuring secure access, and continuously refining this data is critical to meaningful AI-driven insights and automation success. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 30% of enterprises will automate over half of their network activities, reflecting a shift toward automation-driven efficiency. This trend not only enhances daily operations but also fosters a culture of growth and innovation, essential for staying competitive in a data-centric landscape.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nData services are an essential part of this transformation. They are persistent data storage services that bring powerful no-code data modeling and storage capabilities to your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects. Whether it\u2019s managing large data sets, automating data analysis, or simplifying access across departments, data services streamline the flow of information throughout an organization. They fit seamlessly into automation strategies, helping to reduce the manual effort needed for data handling and providing a foundation for predictive analytics, personalized customer experiences, and process improvements.\n\nThe Role of No-Code Data Services in Modern Automation\n\nTraditionally, handling data required technical expertise and complex configurations, which became even more challenging amid a talent shortage in automation-ready skills. No-code data services address this gap by offering a user-friendly approach that empowers business users, or citizen developers, to drive automation projects independently. Through simple, drag-and-drop functionality, data sets, files, and resources can be seamlessly incorporated into workflows without coding, while security and data consistency are maintained automatically.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAs organizations increasingly adopt automation, a no-code approach in data services becomes pivotal. It enables seamless integration with existing automation tools, allowing teams to manage, analyze, and access data across departments without relying heavily on IT support. By simplifying data handling, no-code data services make information more accessible and actionable, equipping organizations to provide real-time insights and solutions.\n\nA Practical Example: Monthly Financial Reporting\n\nIn monthly financial reporting, data from multiple systems, including bookings, invoices, billings, and payments, must be gathered. Without a centralized solution, both attended and unattended workflows retrieve data individually, requiring users to access all backend systems, leading to delays and potential inconsistencies. By setting up an unattended workflow to gather data in Data Service, other workflows can access this information consistently and efficiently. This eliminates the need for multiple data pulls, streamlines the reporting process, and mitigates issues related to data changes during the reporting cycle. Moreover, it removes the need to store aggregated data locally, enhancing data security and consistency across systems.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHow Enterprises Benefit from No-Code Data Services\n\nUnified Data Integration for Seamless Access: These services simplify the process of integrating data from disparate sources. By consolidating data from legacy platforms, enterprise systems, and custom applications into a single, secure repository, businesses can maintain data consistency and reliability across automations.\n\nStreamlined Data Reusability Across Automations: No-code data services offer a centralized data hub that makes information accessible and reusable across multiple automation projects. This eliminates the need for building separate connections for each workflow, enabling consistent data schemas and shareable variables through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.\n\nScaling with Growth: As automation initiatives expand, the demand for scalable data solutions grows. No-code data services provide limitless capacity through secure platforms like Automation Cloud, allowing businesses to confidently scale their automation projects without sacrificing performance or security.\n\nEnhanced Security and Governance: Security remains a priority in a data-driven world. No-code data services help mitigate risks by transitioning sensitive information from local systems to a secure, centralized platform. With role-based access controls, organizations can manage data access and usage, ensuring that data governance remains intact.\n\nNo-Code as a Launchpad for Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nCitizen developers are crucial players in the digital transformation journey. Through no-code data services, employees in finance, marketing, HR, and customer service can independently create automated solutions, significantly enhancing productivity for themselves and their teams. With their deep understanding of daily operations and the potential impact of automation, they drive efficiency from the ground up, fostering continuous innovation and improvement.\n\nBy 2025, Gartner anticipates that 70% of new enterprise applications will harness low-code or no-code technologies\u2014a significant move reshaping the future of software development. This shift isn\u2019t just about innovation; it's a game-changer, empowering teams to drive transformation at pace, with greater flexibility and responsiveness. As organizations embrace these dynamic solutions, they\u2019re not only streamlining operations but also paving the way for transformative breakthroughs that redefine their impact.\n\nAttributed to Prashant Momaya, Senior Director of Sales Engineering, UiPath India"

            "date": "19h",
            "source": "ZDNet",
            "article_content": "ZDNET\n\nIt was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of wise development. It was the age of open-source business foolishness. It was the spring of AI hope. It was the winter of security despair.\n\nThe year 2024 saw major advances in Linux and open-source software development. However, it also witnessed some disturbing open-source business moves that raised concerns about its future.\n\nLet's start with the bad news.\n\n1. Businesses dump open source in search of profits\n\nCompany after company abandoned their open-source roots to seek money with prosperity licenses and trademarks.\n\nFor all practical purposes, all software is built using open source. By Synopsys' count, 96% of all codebases contain open-source software. But all too often in recent years, once a business has established itself with open source, it dumps its code's open-source licenses for semi-proprietary licenses such as the Server Side Public License (SSPL) and the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1.\n\nAlso: The open-source tools that could disrupt the entire IT incident management market\n\nThis trend has included companies such as Cockroach Labs, Confluent, MongoDB, Elastic, MariaDB, Redis Labs, and HashiCorp. The list goes on and on and grows ever larger.\n\nStill, other businesses compromise their open-source licenses by locking down their code with delayed open-source publication (DOSP). These companies include GitButler, Sentry, and Snowplow. Here, the name of the game is to promise that their code will be released under an open-source license at some point in the future.\n\nA new anti-open-source movement has been started by WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, who founded and is the CEO of Automattic. In this case, the code is still open source, but he's demanding that one WordPress hosting company, WP-Engine, must pay 8% of its net profits for using the WordPress trademark. Rumor is he'll be making similar demands on other WordPress companies. Just this last week, it appears that WordPress is threatening to cripple all new and updated third-party WordPress themes and plugins. This is not how open source is supposed to work.\n\nAlso: If ChatGPT produces AI-generated code for your app, who does it really belong to?\n\nWhat I find most annoying about all these efforts to squeeze profits from open source is there's no proof whatsoever of changing licenses or otherwise restricting them. Indeed, a study by Redmonk analyst Rachel Stevens, which examined several companies that made such license changes, found their growth rate remained the same as it was before the change. In addition, market capitalization results were mixed, with only MongoDB showing significant growth while valuations for others, such as HashiCorp, dropped.\n\nNow, open source has never been a business model, but it's essential for developing software. Companies that don't recognize its vital importance to their future efforts will find themselves unable to progress in tomorrow's markets.\n\n2. Major Linux security vulnerabilities avoided\n\nOn a more positive note, a potentially catastrophic security breach was narrowly avoided when Microsoft developer Andres Freund discovered a backdoor in XZ Utils, a widely used Linux data compression utility. The backdoor, which could have compromised millions of computers, was inserted by a malicious actor who had spent years gaining trust within the open-source community. This incident highlighted the sophisticated threats facing open-source projects and the importance of vigilant code review.\n\nAlso: Leaving Windows 10 for Linux? 5 security differences to consider first\n\nThis catch underlines, though, that we must spend a lot more time on securing open-source software development. The OpenSSF's Open Source Consumption Manifesto may serve as the foundation for establishing this approach. Something must be done. Open source is vital to all software now.\n\n3. CentOS replacements gain traction and Linux continues to rule\n\nFollowing Red Hat's withdrawal of support for CentOS, a host of CentOS replacements has arisen. In 2024, they came of age. AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux emerged as prominent replacements for the numerous businesses that had relied on CentOS. These businesses have filled the void left by CentOS by providing stable, community-driven enterprise Linux distributions.\n\nWith its CentOS-friendly replacement, Liberty Linux, SUSE is also doing well. SUSE's own Linux family, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), is growing. Liberty, Rocky, and Oracle Linux are also now built on the new Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA) codebase. This project's goal is to create a truly open-source enterprise Linux that's compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).\n\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try these 6 Linux distros\n\nThis isn't to say that Red Hat is hurting. It's not. The biggest commercial Linux distribution is doing just fine. IBM's Red Hat acquisition has proven to be arguably IBM's most successful acquisition ever.\n\nArvind Krishna, IBM's CEO, claimed that Red Hat had doubled in size since its acquisition and saw a 14% growth rate in its last quarter. According to IBM CFO James Kavanaugh, OpenShift, Red Hat's Kubernetes distro, and the Ansible DevOps program both grew at more than 20% year over year, with the core Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) disto business growing \"in the double digits.\"\n\nIndeed, put it all together, and it's clear that without Red Hat, IBM would be struggling to make a profit.\n\n4. AI and open source go together like bread and butter\n\nWithout open source, there is no AI. It's that simple. In their search for profits, though, AI companies -- with the notable exception of IBM with its Granite models -- like to give open source a lot more lip service than they do to releasing their code and models under an open-source license. Yes, I'm looking at you, Meta, with your Llama.\n\nThat said, open source doesn't fit easily with AI. If you don't believe me, just look at the endless fights over the Open Source Initiative's (OSI) Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) 1.0. We may have an \"official\" open-source definition, but we are nowhere close to an agreement about how valid OSAID is.\n\nAlso: IBM's new enterprise AI models are more powerful than anything from OpenAI or Google\n\nWhile the details are still being worked out, there can be no question whatsoever that AI and open source will continue to work together. AI's foundations are built from open-source programs such as Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and Tensorflow. Without these programs and others, none of the AI programs you use every day -- such as ChatGPT -- would exist.\n\n5. Real-time Linux made it into mainstream Linux\n\nIt took 20 years -- no, really! -- but Real-Time Linux (PREEMPT_RT) is finally in the mainline kernel.\n\nAnd what is a real-time operating system (RTOS), you ask? It's a specialized operating system designed to handle time-critical tasks with precision and reliability. Unlike general-purpose operating systems like Windows or MacOS an RTOS is designed to respond to events and process data within strict time constraints, often measured in milliseconds or microseconds.\n\nAlso: 20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really\n\nMany people assume that RTOSs are for fast processes. They're not. Speed is not the point of RTOSs -- reliability is. This feature is crucial in applications where timing is everything, such as industrial control systems, medical devices, and aerospace equipment.\n\nThis opens up a new field of devices for Linux. Going forward, we'll see numerous new real-time hardware gadgets running Linux.\n\nLooking ahead, I see all these trends continuing, for better or worse. It's my sincere hope that it will all, in the end, work out for the best."

            "article_content": "The latest AI model from OpenAI achieved an \u201cimpressive leap in performance\u201d but it still hasn\u2019t demonstrated what experts classify as human-level intelligence\n\nOpenAI announced a breakthrough achievement for its new o3 AI model Rokas Tenys / Alamy\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new o3 artificial intelligence model has achieved a breakthrough high score on a prestigious AI reasoning test called the ARC Challenge, inspiring some AI fans to speculate that o3 has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). But even as ARC Challenge organisers described o3\u2019s achievement as a major milestone, they also cautioned that it has not won the competition\u2019s grand prize \u2013 and it is only one step on the path towards AGI, a term for hypothetical future AI with human-like intelligence.\n\nThe o3 model is the latest in a line of AI releases that follow on from the large language models powering ChatGPT. \u201cThis is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an engineer at Google and the main creator of the ARC Challenge, in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did OpenAI\u2019s o3 model actually do?\n\nChollet designed the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Challenge in 2019 to test how well AIs can find correct patterns linking pairs of coloured grids. Such visual puzzles are intended to make AIs demonstrate a form of general intelligence with basic reasoning capabilities. But throwing enough computing power at the puzzles could let even a non-reasoning program simply solve them through brute force. To prevent this, the competition also requires official score submissions to meet certain limits on computing power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s newly announced o3 model \u2013 which is scheduled for release in early 2025 \u2013 achieved its official breakthrough score of 75.7 per cent on the ARC Challenge\u2019s \u201csemi-private\u201d test, which is used for ranking competitors on a public leaderboard. The computing cost of its achievement was approximately $20 for each visual puzzle task, meeting the competition\u2019s limit of less than $10,000 total. However, the harder \u201cprivate\u201d test that is used to determine grand prize winners has an even more stringent computing power limit, equivalent to spending just 10 cents on each task, which OpenAI did not meet.\n\nThe o3 model also achieved an unofficial score of 87.5 per cent by applying approximately 172 times more computing power than it did on the official score. For comparison, the typical human score is 84 per cent, and an 85 per cent score is enough to win the ARC Challenge\u2019s $600,000 grand prize \u2013 if the model can also keep its computing costs within the required limits.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBut to reach its unofficial score, o3\u2019s cost soared to thousands of dollars spent solving each task. OpenAI requested that the challenge organisers not publish the exact computing costs.\n\nDoes this o3 achievement show that AGI has been reached?\n\nNo, the ARC challenge organisers have specifically said they do not consider beating this competition benchmark to be an indicator of having achieved AGI.\n\nThe o3 model also failed to solve more than 100 visual puzzle tasks, even when OpenAI applied a very large amount of computing power toward the unofficial score, said Mike Knoop, an ARC Challenge organiser at software company Zapier, in a social media post on X.\n\nIn a social media post on Bluesky, Melanie Mitchell at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico said the following about o3\u2019s progress on the ARC benchmark: \u201cI think solving these tasks by brute-force compute defeats the original purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the new model is very impressive and represents a big milestone on the way towards AGI, I don\u2019t believe this is AGI \u2013 there\u2019s still a fair number of very easy [ARC Challenge] tasks that o3 can\u2019t solve,\u201d said Chollet in another X post.\n\nHowever, Chollet described how we might know when human-level intelligence has been demonstrated by some form of AGI. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible,\u201d he said in the blog post.\n\nThomas Dietterich at Oregon State University suggests another way to recognise AGI. \u201cThose architectures claim to include all of the functional components required for human cognition,\u201d he says. \u201cBy this measure, the commercial AI systems are missing episodic memory, planning, logical reasoning and, most importantly, meta-cognition.\u201d\n\nSo what does o3\u2019s high score really mean?\n\nThe o3 model\u2019s high score comes as the tech industry and AI researchers have been reckoning with a slower pace of progress in the latest AI models for 2024, compared with the initial explosive developments of 2023.\n\nAlthough it did not win the ARC Challenge, o3\u2019s high score indicates that AI models could beat the competition benchmark in the near future. Beyond its unofficial high score, Chollet says many official low-compute submissions have already scored above 81 per cent on the private evaluation test set.\n\nDietterich also thinks that \u201cthis is a very impressive leap in performance\u201d. However, he cautions that, without knowing more about how OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 models work, it is impossible to evaluate just how impressive the high score is. For instance, if o3 was able to practise the ARC problems in advance, then that would make its achievement easier. \u201cWe will need to await an open-source replication to understand the full significance of this,\u201d says Dietterich.\n\nThe ARC Challenge organisers are already looking to launch a second and more difficult set of benchmark tests sometime in 2025. They will also keep the ARC Prize 2025 challenge running until someone achieves the grand prize and open-sources their solution."

NIO stock made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on September 12th, 2018, at $6.26 per share.\n\nWithin 3 years of trading, NIO stock hit an all-time high of $62.84 in February 2021 before plummeting 92.74% to today\u2019s price of $4.56per share.\n\nWhile the share price run-up in early 2020 was purely a momentum push, NIO brand in the EV market was not tarnished. In fact, the car company is still seen as a premium EV player and one of the first companies to address range anxiety issues by creating battery swap technology as a supplement to charging.\n\n24/7 Wall Street aims to provide readers with our assumptions about the stock\u2019s prospects going forward, what growth we see in NIO stock for the next several years, and what our best estimates are for NIO\u2019s stock price each year through 2030.\n\nKey Points in this Article:\n\nNIO is the 3rd largest EV company in China\n\nNIO is the first EV to pioneer swappable battery packs.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report.

This weekend will mark the official unveiling of Firefly, a brand dedicated to premium smart electric vehicles designed for global urban consumers. Today, NIO released Firefly\u2019s logo for the first time.\n\n12/16/2024\n\nNIO has expanded its battery swap network in China. The company added six new stations today, bringing the total count to 2,802. So far, NIO has installed 62 new stations this month, with the aim of meeting an ambitious target of 200 battery swap stations by the end of December.\n\n12/13/2024\n\nNio\u2019s shares dropped more than 2% in U.S. trading and nearly 4% in Hong Kong and Singapore today. Yesterday, NIO hosted a media event in Shanghai, but it appears it was not as successful with investors as planned.\n\n12/12/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s third plant, F3, is scheduled to commence operations in the third quarter of 2024. This aligns with NIO\u2019s ambitious goal of delivering 44,000 vehicles in 2025, a large increase from its projected output for this year.\n\n12/11/2024\n\nNIO shares were down 6.6% yesterday, trading as low as $4.80. The number of shares traded was also down 51% below average.\n\n12/9/2024\n\nNIO experienced a large gap up at the market open today. After closing at $4.61 on Friday, NIO\u2019s stock opened at $4.94 (a 7.16% increase). In addition to the price surge, NIO also saw unusual options activity today, with 294,778 purchased call options, a 53% increase compared to the average volume of 193,100 call options.\n\n12/6/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s new partnership with Mastercard includes many new experiences and innovative payment solutions. Mastercard cardholders will gain access to exclusive NIO benefits like charging, battery swapping, maintenance, car rental, and business travel privileges. In addition, NIO users will have the option to make contactless payments directly from their vehicle.\n\n12/5/2024\n\nNIO is teaming up with Mastercard to enhance user experiences and expand its global reach. The partnership will focus on improving payment solutions, user services, and international business growth.\n\n12/3/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s shares surged today by 3.9%, peaking at $4.60.\n\n11/27/2024\n\nGoldman Sachs has taken a bearish stance on NIO, downgrading its rating from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201csell\u201d and lowering the price target to $3.90. This decision is primarily driven by concerns over NIO\u2019s product pipeline, production ramp-up, and financial performance.\n\nNIO Stock Early Stage Growth\n\nThe following is a table of NIO\u2019s revenues, operating income, and share price for the first few years as a public company.\n\nHere\u2019s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018.\n\nShare Price\n\n(End of Year) Revenues (CNY) Operating Income 2018 $5.39 4,951.2 (9,595.6) 2019 $3.45 7,824.9 (11,079.2) 2020 $40.00 16,257.9 (4,607.6) 2021 $16.70 36,136.4 (4,496.3) 2022 $7.87 49,268.6 (15,640.7) 2023 $4.71 55,617.9 (22,655.2)\n\nRevenue and operating income in Billion CNY (1CNY=.14 USD)\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) the first few years it was a publicly traded company (here is Rivian\u2019s stock price forecast):\n\nShare Price\n\n(End of Year) Revenues Operating Income 2021 $50.24 $55.0 ($4,220.0) 2022 $19.30 $1,658.0 ($6,856.0) 2023 $10.70 $4,434.0 ($5,739.0) TTM $15.35 $4,997.0 (5,790.0)\n\nThe revenue growth for both firms is similar but Rivian\u2019s operating loss is more than double the yearly operating loss of NIO.\n\nNIO formerly contracted its manufacturing to Jianghuai Automobile Group, paying a fee for each vehicle produced in addition to fixed cost. They have since acquired the factory from JAC. This agreement is beneficial for a young start-up in a very capital-intensive market. However, when scale is reached, the variable cost model has its downsides.\n\n2023 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images\n\n3 Key Drivers of NIO\u2019s Stock Performance\n\nProduct Portfolio Expansion and Growing Market Share New Model Launches : Similar to Tesla, NIO started off with a higher-end roadster and used the higher-end models to re-invest into more affordable, mass-market vehicles. NIO aims to push further into price-conscious markets while also adding options for its more premium customers. Add-On Services: With NIO\u2019s battery swap technology, the company plans to roll out an innovative battery-as-a-service solution for its customer base. The company plans on building over 4,000 swap stations worldwide by the end of 2025.\n\nIncreased Vehicle Deliveries and Market Penetration Growing NEV Adoption : The market for new market vehicles (NEVs) is on the rise in China. NIO expects vehicle deliveries in 2025 to double the output from 2023 (roughly 165,000 units). This still only makes up about 2% of the Chinese NEV market and gives NIO plenty of roadway to grab market share for years to come. International Expansion : NIO\u2019s strategy includes expanding its market presence outside China. The company built its first overseas battery-swap station in Hungary in 2022 and has several service centers and NIO accessory businesses throughout Europe.\n\nAdvancements in Technology and Customer Experience Battery and Charging Solutions : NIO\u2019s advancements in battery technology and charging solutions aim to alleviate range anxiety among consumers and help lower the overall cost of the vehicle by 15% to 30%. Focus on Younger Consumers : NIO\u2019s leadership in EV technology will provide brand equity to younger generations of drivers who value enhanced technology packages.\n\n\n\nNIO Stock Forecast Through 2030\n\nYear Revenue Shares Outstanding P/S Est. 2025 97,052 2,050 mm 1x 2026 114,172 2,050 mm 1x 2027 134,643 2,050 mm 1.5x 2028 257,634 2,050 mm 1.5x 2029 176,533 2,050 mm 1.5x 2030 189,548 2,050 mm 2x\n\nRevenue in CYN millions\n\nCompared to Rivian and Tesla, NIO\u2019s price-to-sales valuation will be moderately discounted. While NIO is in solid financial standing and has a premium brand image, it\u2019s still uncertain how much competition the company will face in China and expanding overseas. The company is already spending a quarter of revenues on R&D and if NIO can\u2019t capitalize on this spend, the stock price will be sluggish compared to North American EV manufacturers.\n\nNIO Share Price Estimates 2025-2030\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nHow NIO\u2019s Next 5 Years Could Play Out\n\nWall Street analysts have NIO\u2019s stock price over the next year to be $6.94 which gives the stock a 52.20% upside over today\u2019s price of $4.56. Of the 26 analysts covering the stock, the consensus recommendation is a 2.07 \u2018Outperform\u2019 Score.\n\nWe expect to see a revenue growth of 60% for 2025, with a price-to-sales multiple of 1x, which puts our price target at $6.63, an upside of 45.40%.\n\nGoing into 2026, we estimate the price to be $7.80, with another strong 50%+ revenue bump. However, with EBITDA still well in the negative, we see the market not rewarding the stock as much and giving it a lower valuation multiple, resulting in an upside of 71.06%.\n\nHeading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase to leap forward to $13.80 with another strong 50%+ revenue growth year-over-year. That is a 97% year-over-year gain and up 202.64% from today\u2019s stock price.\n\nWhen predicting more than 3 years out, we expect NIO\u2019s P/S ratio in 2028 to be 1.5x and top-line growth of 50%. In 2028, we have NIO\u2019s revenue coming in around $36 billion, suggesting a stock price estimate at $26.39 or a gain of 478.74% over the current stock price.\n\n24/7 Wall Street expects NIO\u2019s stock to continue its revenue growth and to generate $25 billion in revenue. The stock price in 2029 is estimated at $18.08, or a gain of 296.50% over today\u2019s price.\n\nNIO Stocks Price Target for 2030\n\nWe estimate NIO\u2019s stock price to be $25.89 per share. Our estimated stock price will be 467.78% higher than the current stock price.\n\nYear Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $6.94 Upside of 52.20% 2025 $6.63 Upside of 45.40% 2026 $7.80 Upside of 71.06% 2027 $13.80 Upside of 202.64% 2028 $26.39 Upside of 478.74% 2029 $18.08 Upside of 296.50% 2030 $25.89 Upside of 467.78%\n\nJenoche / Shutterstock.com\n\nTake This Retirement Quiz To Get Matched With An Advisor Now (Sponsored) Are you ready for retirement?

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nYou expect your electronic devices to work a certain way when you use them. If you tap an app icon on your phone, it should open. When you boot up your laptop, it should start in a reasonable amount of time. But that\u2019s not always how it goes. As your device ages, it often develops inefficiencies and quirks that make it slower and less reliable.\n\nNo device is immune to this kind of decline, yet certain brands have a reputation for building tech that performs reliably\u2014without crashes, slowdowns, or other glitches\u2014for longer periods. Others\u2026not so much. So, which brands should you buy from if you want tech you can depend on for the longest time?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a definitive answer to this question, we asked thousands of our readers to share their experiences and rate the products they depend on in our Readers\u2019 Choice surveys about , , and . In those surveys, conducted over the past year, our audience rated electronics manufacturers on a scale from 1 to 10 for reliability. Here\u2019s which brands come out on top.\n\nThe Best PC, Tablet, and Phone Brands for Reliability\n\nLaptops: MacBooks Are the Most Trusted\n\nIf you need a laptop you can count on, you\u2019d be wise to pick up a MacBook. Apple\u2019s laptops score nearly half a point higher than competing machines from any other brand. Apple\u2019s MacBooks are known for their longevity and seamless updates, making them favorites for students, creatives, and professionals.\n\nMSI comes in second for laptops, with Lenovo and Asus rounding out the top tier. All have respectable reliability scores, but nevertheless pale in comparison to Apple. MSI, however, excels in the gaming and performance space. If you prefer Windows, MSI is the way to go, but whether you\u2019re after a powerhouse for gaming or a workhorse for productivity, these brands won\u2019t let you down.\n\nFor more, read .\n\nApple Aces Laptops for Work\n\nWhile Windows-based machines have a reputation for being more business-oriented, PCMag readers suggest that Apple computers are the most reliable work machines.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\u2019s MacBook line scores well ahead of the big three PC manufacturers (Dell, HP, and Lenovo) here, with Dell in last place. Couple that with Apple\u2019s excellent scores for and in our companion stories, and it\u2019s obvious that office workers with Apple laptops are happier\u2014and with this level of reliability, they\u2019ll be using them for a long time.\n\nIT-Managed Laptops: HP Is the MVP in the Office\n\nWhat do the people who purchase and maintain laptops for big offices think? Well, they didn\u2019t think of Apple enough to rate them in our results\u2014they stick with the big three manufacturers. Of them, HP and Lenovo are deadlocked for the best reliability, according to IT managers. But thanks to the tie-breaker from the overall score earned in the same survey, the award goes to HP.\n\nBut when things are so close, anything could change in the future. (If you\u2019re an IT manager, take our currently running right now to impact the results for next year's story.)\n\nFor more, read .\n\nDesktops: Top Reliability Ratings Go to Apple\n\nApple\u2019s desktops vary in many ways, including size, shape, and price\u2014but they\u2019re lumped together by PCMag readers as the most reliable PCs you can buy for home use, period. Apple desktop systems are a half point ahead of the nearest competitor in this category.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep in mind that if you're a Windows aficionado, the \u201creal\u201d winner after Apple is a PC you buy locally or build yourself. These DIY rigs score even higher than the next best PC vendor (Dell, in this case).\n\nApple system soundness stands out specifically in all-in-one computers as well. Dell and HP both score respectably, but the Apple iMac continues to set the standard. If you\u2019re looking for a sleek, space-saving machine that handles everything from work to creative projects, the trustworthy is a fantastic choice. It\u2019s a little pricier, but the build quality and reliability make it worth the investment.\n\nGamers Give the Nod to HP Desktops\n\nWhen it comes to non-portable PCs built for games, HP tops the reliability charts with a score of 9.4. Alienware and MSI aren\u2019t far behind, but self-built rigs once again shine the brightest with a 9.5.\n\nIf you\u2019re handy and want the best bang for your buck, building your own gaming PC is tough to beat. But if you're not into DIY, HP delivers an excellent mix of reliability and performance.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more, read .\n\nMacs Earn Workplace Trust in Desktops\n\nWhile Windows-based machines are know for being better-suited for most business applications, PCMag readers suggest that Apple computers are the most reliable work machines.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting (and somewhat surprising) that self-built computers are the real winner here, scoring even higher than Apple when it comes to reliability for work-focused machines. Building your own PC gives you full control over the components, which means you can prioritize quality and tailor everything to your exact needs. But if you don\u2019t want to mess with screwdrivers and thermal paste, Apple\u2019s prebuilt systems are a solid choice for reliability and performance.\n\nIT-Managed Desktops: Managers Prefer Lenovo\n\nDell, HP, and Lenovo are the biggest sellers of PCs in the US, especially because they sell in bulk to businesses. They might seem evenly matched in many ways, but when it comes to longevity, IT managers in our surveys specifically peg Lenovo as a bit more dependable. And that kind of thing on a fleet of desktop units can make all the difference.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat said, the Dell and HP numbers are respectable among IT professionals. There\u2019s a reason these brands are top sellers, after all. They make PCs that last, even when abused by staffers.\n\nFor more, read .\n\nPhones: Samsung Is the Most Reliable Brand for Home and Work\n\nApple, Google, and Samsung top our charts in phone reliability with a score of 9.1, tying for the lead. To break the tie and determine a single winner, we look at overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend scores, which means Samsung grabs the win.\n\nSo, what does that mean for you? If you\u2019re deep in the Apple ecosystem\u2014or just want a phone you can depend on\u2014iPhones are the way to go. That said, Google and Samsung phones are just as solid, according to our readership. As long as you buy from one of the Big Three mobile device manufacturers, you can rest assured that your phone will work well for a long time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor phones in the workplace, Samsung edges out Apple. It\u2019s not by a huge gap, but it\u2019s worth noting if you\u2019re buying for a business. Samsung\u2019s enterprise features and IT-friendly tools give it the edge. If you\u2019re looking to keep your team connected and productive, Samsung is the best bet.\n\nFor more, read our .\n\nTablets: Reliability Is Apple's Hallmark\n\nApple dominates the tablet scores with a 9.4. Samsung and Microsoft round out the top three, both with excellent reliability numbers, but not better than Apple\u2019s.\n\nIf you want a dependable tablet that will work well for years to come, the iPad is your best bet. Apple\u2019s seamless ecosystem, hardware quality, and regular software updates make it a no-brainer. Alternatively, if you\u2019re a diehard Android fan or need a Windows tablet for work, Samsung and Microsoft are solid alternatives.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor more, read our .\n\nFor more extended survey coverage on your most important hardware, read and ."

The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office.

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"

We get misunderstood all the time,\u201d he said. His team contends that negative time is not just theoretical but may exist in a measurable way.\n\nThey remain cautious in describing their experiments, emphasizing that the results reflect a subtle effect in quantum mechanics.\n\n\u201cThat time turned out to be negative,\u201d Steinberg explained. Their data points to strange interactions between light and matter that defy everyday assumptions.\n\nQuantum quirks\n\nTheir basement lab brims with mirrors, wires, and delicate lasers that track how photons interact with atoms.\n\nThe atoms sometimes absorb photons and later emit them, leaving the atoms in an excited state for a short period. Measuring this period was tricky, and to many, it sounded like it might flirt with impossibilities.\n\nSteinberg and graduate student Daniela Angulo focused on the short time atoms remain excited. By collecting data on how atoms emit absorbed light, they uncovered intervals that appeared less than zero.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say anything traveled backward in time,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s a misinterpretation.\u201d\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d doesn\u2019t violate reality\n\nInvestigations into quantum phenomena often spark worry about collisions with Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity.\n\nYet nothing in these experiments hints that any object can outrun light. Photons here do not convey information faster than physical laws permit, so there is no conflict with long-accepted principles.\n\nSome have questioned whether labeling this interval as negative time might invite confusion.\n\nThe team is aware that such language can sound surreal, but they believe it captures the unusual nature of quantum measurements that drift from usual expectations.\n\nPhotons and probabilities\n\nPhotons have a split personality, sometimes acting like particles and other times behaving like waves.\n\nThey follow probability rules that let them appear in multiple states at once, prompting a range of possible outcomes. This fuzziness underpins the notion that events do not always fit into a neat timeline.\n\nIn standard settings, photons pass through materials in ways consistent with well-established physics.\n\nBut in the group\u2019s experiments, certain measurements produce results that slip into territory most would never predict.\n\nThese findings spark curiosity about how quantum mechanics can present effects that appear at odds with common sense.\n\nReactions and skepticism\n\nThe concept has captured the attention of many, including German theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, who remains unimpressed.\n\n\u201cThe negative time in this experiment has nothing to do with the passage of time \u2014 it\u2019s just a way to describe how photons travel through a medium and how their phases shift,\u201d she said in a YouTube video with more than 250,000 views.\n\nSome observers suspect the term negative time is too dramatic and misrepresents the study\u2019s scope. Others argue that a fresh approach could encourage deeper conversations about how quantum processes unfold.\n\nThe researchers maintain they are not rewriting the rules of physics but aiming to highlight the weirdness at play in fundamental experiments.\n\nNext steps for \u201cnegative time\u201d studies\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made our choice about what we think is a fruitful way to describe the results,\u201d Steinberg said, adding that while practical applications remain elusive, the findings open new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena.\n\nHe acknowledged that many remain skeptical, but he insists the numbers speak for themselves. No serious criticism has challenged their raw data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t currently have a path from what we\u2019ve been looking at toward applications,\u201d Steinberg admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep thinking about it, but I don\u2019t want to get people\u2019s hopes up.\u201d\n\nWhether the idea of negative time transforms into something with everyday uses remains to be seen, yet the curiosity it sparks is hard to ignore.\n\nWhat does all of this mean?\n\nTo sum it all up, quantum physics has always pushed boundaries, forcing researchers to adjust old assumptions.\n\nThese experiments from the University of Toronto team serve as another reminder that the world behaves in ways that do not always match common intuition. Still, they stress that no claims of time travel are on the table.\n\nBy presenting evidence that something can measure out to less than zero time, these researchers have challenged expectations about how light interacts with matter.\n\nFor now, the puzzle remains a subject of debate. Unraveling the enigma might take further studies, but many agree that investigating such bizarre possibilities is part of the ongoing effort to understand quantum reality.\n\nThe results highlight how experiments can produce outcomes that differ from conventional thinking. Negative intervals in absorption times remain an intriguing piece of a much broader puzzle.\n\nScientists continue to refine experiments and weigh alternative explanations. Despite lingering questions, the project stands as a reminder that quantum behavior can seem downright strange, to put it mildly.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal arXiv.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
