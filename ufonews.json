        "source": "Yale Daily News",
        "article_content": "During my first two months at Yale, I\u2019ve learned how to be an indulgent skeptic.\n\nThe Thursday before Family Weekend, I received an email advertising an 11-hour-long teach-in about UFOs, to which I responded with immediate incredulity. I wasn\u2019t quite sure that \u201cfree exchange of ideas surrounding a challenging subject\u201d could apply to government cover-ups of UFOs, a conspiracy theory seemingly on par with the flat Earth.\n\nI decided to reach out to Sydney Morrison \u201925, the leader of the Yale Student UFO Society, or YSUS, to find out what could lead a Yale student to believe that little green men in flying saucers were anything but pure science fiction. After a few back-and-forth emails, she explained her reasoning over lunch last Monday.\n\nSydney\u2019s story with ufology, the study of UFOs, began during her time away from Yale after her sophomore year. Throughout her childhood and teenage years, her idea of UFOs was much like mine: \u201cpotentially some weird spiritual thing, like a semi-religious phenomenon.\u201d But one night, while hanging out with a friend in a Washington park, they turned around simultaneously to see a large object with blinking lights in the sky. Unbothered at first, they then encountered an 8-foot-tall bulky humanoid object with two deer-like eyes, casually strolling around and absorbing all visible light entering its body. Sydney said that they got within two feet of the alien, which continued to stomp around and followed them back to their car.\n\nNaturally, this experience was \u201cpretty shaking,\u201d and Sydney started YSUS her next semester back at Yale to create a space for UFO believers \u2014 the only such space in the Ivy League. The club\u2019s main goal is to consolidate and present knowledge on UFO sightings.\n\nConvincing those in the Yale community is more of a secondary objective. Sydney explained that when talking about her experience to people outside the ufology community, she always begins with \u201cI know this sounds crazy\u201d or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have believed it myself,\u201d but it\u2019s often unsuccessful; she\u2019s mostly given up on convincing people to believe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such pervasive stigma that associates UFOs with mental illness,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s scary when you do try to take [beliefs about UFOs] further into the media and the public.\u201d\n\nI felt sympathetic to her cause. If UFOs were to exist, I \u2014 and most of the world \u2014 would be virtually clueless, having been deaf to all those who claimed to have seen evidence. Sydney often wishes she hadn\u2019t had her sighting \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s kind of like the Matrix, where you can\u2019t go back after you\u2019ve seen something like that,\u201d she said. Personally, I\u2019d rather live my life unaware of any alien existence \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine being so utterly sure of a truth that my family and friends would never accept.\n\nCurious about what led other students to join the club \u2014 to voluntarily take the red pill \u2014 I talked to Lorenzo Chamberlin \u201928, YSUS\u2019s newest officer. He told me that he saw a poster advertising YSUS on the way to class one day and was immediately drawn to it. He\u2019s never had an experience with UFOs, though he would like to, and was enthusiastic about the club\u2019s efforts to find \u201cways to have those experiences.\u201d He quoted Sherlock Holmes to summarize his reason for joining: \u201conce you\u2019ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Lorenzo wrote the original teach-in email that piqued my curiosity. Rereading it after our chat, I realized that his description of the event\u2019s purpose \u2014 raising awareness for \u201cwider epistemological challenges to accepted boundaries of scholarship and civic activism\u201d \u2014 was not a half-baked attempt at intellectualizing a joke but a genuine reflection on how deep our assumptions lie.\n\nOver the course of our lunch, Sydney presented a logical, well-thought-out argument. By the time she brought up postcolonialism and ontology, it was clear that she\u2019d spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours researching ufology.\n\nWe talked for around an hour, but most people don\u2019t devote that much time to understanding a claim viewed as fundamentally absurd. It\u2019s so easy to just dismiss someone as crazy when that\u2019s what the rest of the world thinks.\n\nIn my philosophy and astronomy courses, I\u2019ve learned about dozens of breakthroughs that were met with universal skepticism when they were first made. Ideas like philosophical questioning, the heliocentric theory and special relativity were incredibly controversial when proposed because they disrupted beliefs that felt safe and secure. Socrates, Galileo and Einstein \u2014 some of the most important contributors to human knowledge \u2014 were all shunned for their \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cpreposterous\u201d findings.\n\nSo maybe \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 UFOs are real and Sydney is the next Einstein. I\u2019m not quite convinced, but I\u2019ve learned to at least give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Nothing is for certain, and so to make a leap into the unknown, to challenge centuries of knowledge and billions of people, should be seen not as ignorance but bravery."

Davis, an astrophysicist who worked as a subcontractor and then a consultant for the Pentagon UFO program; Harald Malmgren, who served as a senior adviser under four Presidents; and the late former Democratic majority leader in the Senate, Harry Reid.\n\nNow, a new report by the Daily Mail adds another layer of intrigue with even more whistleblower testimony.\n\nAccording to these whistleblowers, there has been a secret Pentagon UFO data retrieval program that has been hidden from Congressional oversight since 2017.\n\nCodenamed \u201cImmaculate Constellation,\u201d the directive of the program is to \u201cdetect\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d the military\u2019s best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis trove of high quality, multi-sensor UFO data is so tightly held that \u2018talking about it will put you in the danger zone,\u2019 according to a US official who confirmed the leak. The quite literally \u2018above top secret\u2019 program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos.\n\nIf true, this program will have been operating outside the law as any type of Special Access Program, or SAP, must be disclosed. According to the whistleblowers, the secret Pentagon UFO data retrieval program is what is known, according to the source, as an \u201cUnacknowledged Special Access Program,\u201d or USAP.\n\nThis would help explain why a Pentagon spokesperson denied the existence of the program, claiming, \u201cThe Department of Defense has no record, present or historical, of any type of SAP [Special Access Program] called \u2018Immaculate Constellation.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Executive Branch has been managing UAP/NHI issues without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization for some time, quite possibly decades,\u201d the whistleblower wrote in a report they say was presented to Congress and shared with the website Public.\n\nA second whistleblower added that this UFO data retrieval program \u201cis run out of SEC DEF [Office of the Secretary of Defense].\u201d\n\nLast year, Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett accused the United States government of a \u201chuge cover-up\u201d when it comes to revealing what it knows about UFOs and aliens.\n\nIn 2020, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid admitted that he spearheaded two programs funded by a Congressional \u201cblack budget\u201d and were run through a company called Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies, which worked alongside the Pentagon."

Chief among them is Adobe, whose Terms of Service debacle in the summer led to a fierce backlash from creatives. But the brand's latest move might just help ingratiate the company with AI-sceptics.\n\nThe company has announced a new Content Authenticity Web App designed to \"champion creator protection and attribution\". An extension of the Content Authenticity Initiative we've already seen Adobe develop over the last couple of years, the new web app offers a free way for creators to apply content credentials to their work.\n\nAdobe\n\nAs well as adding credentials, the web app lets creators set AI training and usage preferences, essentially letting artists opt-out of being trained by models. Of course, this relies on other models recognising this, but Adobe is \"actively working to drive industry-wide adoption of this preference.\"\n\nA free, public beta of the Adobe Content Authenticity web app will be available in Q1 2025, and users can sign up for more information here. As well as the web app, there'll also be a handy Chrome extension for inspecting credentials.\n\nAdobe Content Credentials web app\n\n\"Adobe\u2019s new tool for signing artwork is a game-changer,\" gushes illustrator Pepita Sandwich via the Adobe website. \"It makes adding Content Credentials to digital pieces easy and professional. The interface is intuitive and ensures seamless integration, while the security features give me peace of mind. I also love that it offers the option to opt-out of AI training\u2014perfect for protecting my creative rights.\"\n\nIt's certainly a timely move for a company that has endured its fair share of criticism from artists this year, as well as facing the small matter of getting sued by the US government over its convoluted cancellation processes. But with the brand having previously committed to \"doing the right thing\" when it comes to AI, focussing its efforts on the Content Authenticity Initiative seems like a wise move."

The exhibit officially opened Friday at the Villa Antigua Border Heritage Museum, located at 810 Zaragoza St.\n\nThe Strange Possessions Exhibit opens Friday, showcasing \"haunted artifacts\" at the Border Heritage Museum through a partnership with NeverDead Entertainment and the Laredo Paranormal Research Society. Courtesy/Laredo Paranormal Research Society\n\nNeverDead Entertainment founder Jesus Moreno says Laredo Paranormal Research Society founder Ismael Cuellar agreed to lend the relics from a collection of more than 200 items, which some believe to be cursed or possessed, that the society gathered over 30 years.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe paranormal, or stories of the paranormal, is such a huge part of our culture.

After the society conducted an investigation, the LPRS said Emma appeared to blink and close its left eye after sitting in an isolated room for more than 40 hours.\n\nCuellar said he has presented Emma in public, with the LPRS later being asked to no longer bring her due to reports of flickering lights and strange sounds when she was present.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nRaggedy Andy, the possessed doll who doesn't enjoy being separate from its counterpart, Raggedy Ann.

It\u2019s after midnight. You\u2019ve scattered video cameras around the cabin. You ask questions about the lives of those who labored here, and you hope that you\u2019ve captured their answers on your audio recorders. You glance down a short passageway and watch, saucer eyed, as a video camera launches itself off a wicker chair for no discernible reason.\n\nOnce you recover from your shock, you try to recreate and debunk it. You can\u2019t. Could it possibly be something paranormal?\n\nExperiences like this often lead me to reflect on the unexpected turns life can take. Sometimes you land someplace completely weird, and you find a sense of belonging you never expected. After 15 years of training as a historian, I assumed a traditional teaching job would be waiting for me after graduation. Instead, I\u2019m investigating reportedly haunted houses and writing about them. Looking back, the leap from scholar to paranormal investigator might not be as strange as it seems because I investigate to better understand history.\n\nMore:Connell Sanders: Mama loves to rock, and baby's along for the big noise\n\nMore:Last Call: Historian looks for clues to life, death and justice in medieval Ireland\n\nEven when we can\u2019t verify something we learn from an investigation as historical truth, the story becomes an important part of the haunted location\u2019s lore. And when the historical record matches up with our paranormal experiences, we\u2019ve struck gold.\n\nI\u2019ve found my favorite people in the paranormal community. We share more than a love for all things spooky; we\u2019re connected by curiosity and a desire to tell the stories of those who have passed. We bond over experiences that nobody else would understand.\n\nWe also support each other\u2019s creative pursuits; we are writers, photographers, filmmakers and musicians. And the best paranormal conventions (or paracons) feel more like family reunions than your ordinary geeky gatherings. There\u2019s the darker side of the paranormal community, too \u2014 the big egos, fame-seekers and petty drama. But it\u2019s easy enough to look past them and find the people you want on your team. I\u2019ve joined countless paranormal investigations in the U.S. and the U.K., and I\u2019ve met kindred spirits who are now lifelong friends.\n\nWhen we investigate haunted places, we protect each other. We learn our teammates\u2019 body language, and we recognize when they\u2019re uncomfortable and need to leave the scene. Our camaraderie often dispels tension in places where traumatic events happened.\n\nSometimes we catch the best electric voice phenomena (also known as EVPs; unexplained voices imprinted on audio recordings) when we\u2019re relaxed and trading lighthearted banter \u2014 the kind that comes from people who genuinely like each other. There\u2019s no judgment. We understand each other, and we know that our experiences are real. We don\u2019t really care if other people might think we\u2019re bonkers.\n\n\u201cCommunity\u201d means something different for everyone. Since I found mine, I\u2019ve learned what it feels like to let my guard down and embrace the weird, because we\u2019re all weirdos at heart. If hanging out in haunted places after dark and hoping for an experience you can\u2019t explain is your idea of a good time, come celebrate the weird with us. You\u2019re always going to be welcome in the paranormal community.\n\nJoanna MacGugan is a social historian, copy editor, and paranormal investigator.

        "article_content": "Researchers at Harvard University use a model Hamiltonian to simulate strongly-correlated matter in quantum systems. Credit: Nishad Maskara et al. / Harvard University\n\nSince its founding in 2020, the Quantum Systems Accelerator (QSA) has advanced the science and technologies required to bridge the gap between today's NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) information systems and those that will be fully fault-tolerant to facilitate impactful scientific discovery.\n\nAs a U.S. National Quantum Information Science Research Center, QSA has developed algorithms and applications constructed explicitly for the current near-term, imperfect quantum systems to advance fundamental research across various fields such as chemical science.\n\nProgrammable quantum computers have the potential to efficiently simulate increasingly complex molecular structures, electronic structures, chemical reactions, and quantum mechanical states in chemistry that classical computers cannot.\n\nAs the molecule's size and complexity increase, so do the computational resources required to model it. For example, it could take thousands to millions of years, even with the world's most advanced classical supercomputers, to simulate essential molecules for drug discovery.\n\nIndeed, chemistry has emerged as one of the most compelling applications of near-term quantum devices. Given their ability to process information in qubits, quantum processors are naturally suited for simulating the dynamics of complex and highly correlated quantum systems.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a key structural characterization technique in biology, chemistry, and materials science that gathers structural information about atoms and their arrangement in space. However, interpreting the results can be challenging. This is especially true for zero-field NMR experiments which remove the large magnet used in conventional NMR experiments.\n\nThe quantum simulation of NMR, however, enables the possibility of mimicking the noisy dynamics of one system with the dynamics of another.\n\nAn interdisciplinary collaboration by QSA researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, University of Maryland, and Duke University demonstrated a zero-field NMR digital quantum simulation experiment on a programmable trapped-ion processor. Their 2023 study was published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nThe team used four qubits to compute the zero-field NMR spectrum of the methyl group of acetonitrile for the first time, a simple organic compound used in many products, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, plastics, and batteries. Furthermore, researchers deployed compressed sensing techniques to obtain accurate results in less time and with less computational resources.\n\nThis novel experimental work paves the way for finding exciting practical uses of near-term quantum devices.\n\n\"Tailoring the algorithmic and hardware approaches to the structure of NMR systems may enable resource-efficient simulations on near-term devices, thereby opening specific biochemistry analysis pipelines. The breadth and depth of the QSA community provide a fertile ground for the multidisciplinary collaborative efforts required to realize the potential of this application,\" said Kushal Seetharam, postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and lead paper author.\n\nQSA, in parallel, is further developing quantum devices based on arrays of neutral atoms with pioneering methods for control and fast readout for complex molecular simulations. A multi-institution team led by QSA researchers at Harvard University published a theoretical framework for simulating strongly correlated quantum systems in chemistry using Rydberg atom arrays.\n\nThe authors published their study last December on the arXiv preprint server, offering a flexible quantum toolbox for simulating the time evolution of spin Hamiltonians (mathematical models of quantum systems).\n\nUsing a mix of computational approaches and engineering methods, including hardware-specific multi-qubit gates for the Rydberg atom arrays, researchers showed how to optimize hardware operations to accurately simulate complex interactions between spins.\n\nUsing hybrid quantum-classical computing techniques, they also introduced an algorithm from near-term quantum experiments, enabling predictions of key quantities, such as how energy and temperature changes could influence the chemical properties and behavior of molecules and atoms.\n\n\"Neutral atom arrays have undergone rapid experimental progress in recent years, and here, we show how these novel architectures can be applied to accelerate classically challenging simulations of quantum systems. The collaborations facilitated by the QSA are crucial for pursuing this interdisciplinary research,\" explained Nishad Maskara, Ph.D. researcher at Harvard and lead paper author.\n\nResearchers further suggested that this framework could study exotic materials, such as transition metal compounds with complex magnetic properties. These compounds appear in various contexts, including catalysis in biological systems. Further, simulations of 2D or 3D transition metal materials could provide clues to some of the fabrication and material challenges of quantum processors currently using conventional materials.\n\n\"The ability to perform detailed and accurate quantum simulations will be invaluable for chemists and material scientists as they try to understand experimental results and design new compounds with interesting properties,\" said Maskara.\n\nComputational simulation in classical computers has been limited by the exponentially large number of possible state configurations required to interpret the nuclear spin system for large molecules, proteins, and protocols. Therefore, complex simulations in chemical science are ideal for tackling with a quantum computer.\n\nThrough collaboration, QSA continues to drive innovation in quantum prototypes and algorithms for fundamental science, especially complex chemistry, across all partner institutions. Harvard researchers are currently exploring how to advance the quantum simulation of the NMR experiment with a toolbox of protocols using reconfigurable quantum processors.\n\n\"Guided by a science-first approach since 2020, QSA has developed scalable quantum systems and prototypes that will pave the way for groundbreaking discoveries across various hardware platforms, algorithms, and science applications,\" said Sandia National Laboratories' Daniel Stick, QSA's Deputy Director.\n\nProvided by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"

No-code platforms, equipped with codeless app design capabilities, empower your team to create and deploy apps without writing a single line of code.\n\nThis means that even team members who aren't traditionally tech-savvy can contribute to the app development process, significantly speeding up project timelines.\n\nImagine you're tasked with improving customer engagement through a new interactive app. With a codeless app design tool, you can drag and drop elements to assemble a prototype within hours, not weeks. This rapid prototyping accelerates development and allows for iterative testing and feedback, ensuring the final product meets user needs while aligning with your strategic goals.\n\nOptimal Flexibility with WYSIWYG App Builders\n\nA crucial element of digital transformation is flexibility\u2014the ability to pivot and tailor solutions in real-time as your business needs evolve. What You See Is What You Get, or WYSIWYG app builders, exemplify this flexibility. They allow you to build and edit your applications visually, seeing exactly how they'll appear to the end-users as you construct them.\n\nThis hands-on approach reduces misunderstandings and miscommunications between business departments and IT teams. For example, your marketing team can directly create landing pages and promotional apps, ensuring that the end design matches their vision without back-and-forth with developers.\n\nThis saves time and empowers your non-technical staff to execute their ideas independently.\n\nReducing Costs and Resource Allocation\n\nOne significant impact of no-code in your digital transformation strategy is cost reduction. Traditional app development involves significant investment in technical staff, extended development timelines, and often expensive fixes and iterations.\n\nNo-code platforms change this dynamic by minimizing the need for a large development team and reducing the dependency on external IT consultants or software development companies.\n\nIntegrating no-code tools into your strategy allows you to allocate your financial and human resources more efficiently. Savings on technical development can be redirected towards other critical areas, such as market research, customer experience improvements, or expansion strategies.\n\nMoreover, the ease of updating applications built with no-code tools means that maintaining and improving your digital assets becomes less costly and more manageable over time.\n\nDriving Business Agility and Competitive Advantage\n\nNo-code platforms give your business the agility to stay ahead of the curve. Because no-code development significantly shortens the time from concept to deployment, your business can respond more swiftly to market changes and emerging opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, no-code tools give you the competitive advantage of experimenting with and implementing new ideas quickly without substantial upfront investment.\n\nWhether it's testing a new customer service bot, a unique booking system, or a custom data analysis tool, no-code platforms let you innovate faster, learn quickly from real-world feedback, and iterate effectively.\n\nIntegrating no-code technology into your strategy offers a pathway to more than just technological advancement. It transforms your organizational culture. It democratizes technology creation, empowers your teams, and sprinkles both agility and innovation into your business.\n\nUsing no-code platforms is a no-brainer. They can dismantle traditional barriers to technology development, open up new avenues for growth, and position your business as a leader in the digital economy."

        "article_content": "Friday\u2019s best deals are headlined by a significant price drop on the base model Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 at $387 under the most affordable S10 and now sitting at one of the lowest prices we have ever tracked. But the Samsung deals keep coming as not only is the best price ever still live on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro at nearly $100 off, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra has somehow now dropped down even lower than the $100 deals we spotted for Prime Day. From there, we have the regularly $429 Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones starting from $279 alongside some Google Home gear, chargers, speakers, and more. Scope it all out down below.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S9 now $387 under the most affordable S10 starting at $613 (Reg. $800)\n\nThe new plus and Ultra model Tab S10 have arrived, but Amazon is landing with a serious deal on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 in graphite at $612.49 shipped. This is a regularly $800 tablet that effectively remains the current-generation base-model flagship release \u2013 there its no standard S10 just yet. This model is still sold on the official Samsung storefront and currently for the full $800 MSRP. You can score up to $600 instant trade credit there, but Amazon is now offering one of the best straight up cash deals we have tracked with $187 in savings \u2013 this is well under the $650 we featured last month.\n\nBest price ever somehow still live: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro still at wild $152 all-time low (Nearly $100 off with no trade in needed)\n\nUpdate: This deal is still live (somehow) and now with no code needed.\n\nIn a frankly wild turn of events, although it shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising considering how aggressive Woot has been as of late on recently released tech, the Amazon retailer is now undercutting everyone on the new Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. The regularly $250 set of flagship earbuds dropped (and remains) and its best post-release price to date over at Amazon with a $209.99 discounted listing, but using code SAVE20 at checkout over on Woot today, you can score a set at a surprisingly notable $151.99 Prime shipped (a $6 delivery fee will apply otherwise). That\u2019s nearly $100 off, close to $70 under Amazon\u2019s Prime Day price, and the best we have ever tracked. Woot ships with a full 1-year warranty from Samsung too.\n\nRegularly $429 Bose QuietComfort Ultra ANC Headphones drop to $279 today\n\nWe caught a solid $100 price drop on the wonderful Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in new condition for Prime Day this year \u2013 a notable offer for sure. But the official Bose site and its wonderful refurbishment program is now offering them down at $279 shipped. This is a $429 pair of active noise cancellation headphones (among the very best in fact) now seeing a sizable $150 price drop. Bose runs one of the better refurbished programs in the game and ships these headphones with the same warranty as a new set.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra now sitting below Prime Day price at nearly $118 off with new lows from $532\n\nUpdate: Prices have now dropped again to new all-time lows at Amazon across all colorways.\n\nWe have been seeing some seriously notable deals on the new Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra over the last week or so, but Amazon has now dropped the price down even lower across the lineup. Now starting from $532.20 shipped on the Titanium Gray model with the orange band, all three configurations on Amazon are now at new all-time lows with the Titanium Silver and gray band combo at $549.99 and the Titanium White model with the white band at $532.20 shipped. Now sitting at up to $109.50 off the sticker price, all three options are now at new all-time lows and undercutting the Prime Day prices we were tracking over the last couple days.\n\nTP-Link\u2019s Google Home magnetic wireless smart cam has FREE AI motion detection, now back at $60 (Reg. $90+)\n\nUpdate: This deal is live once again. Details in original post below.\n\nAmazon is now offering its best price yet on the TP-Link Tapo Smart MagCam (C425) at $59.99 shipped after you clip the on-page coupon. This wireless smart camera hit Amazon for the first time in late 2023 at $120 before more typically fetching a $90 price tag through 2024. Today\u2019s offer knocked that price down even further with a straight markdown to $80 and an additional $20 in savings via the coupon code. This is the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon since release.\n\nToday\u2019s accessories and charging deals:\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S9 FE 256GB just hit the $380 Amazon all-time low ($140 off)\n\nToday we are tracking one of the best prices ever on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE with the upgraded 256GB of storage. We did see the entry 128GB model drop to $333 last month, but Amazon just knocked the regularly $520 upgraded configuration to $379.99 shipped. While only on the silver model \u2013 my personal favorite of the bunch, we haven\u2019t seen a price anywhere near this since mid July and even then it never dropped below $389. Today\u2019s deal is a new Amazon low on this configuration at $20 under the price we saw over the last two days for the fall Prime event.\n\nThe new Ticwatch 5 Enduro model has now returned to its best price yet. After being unleashed this past May as an updated version of the existing model, the official Mobvoi Amazon store is serving up an on-page coupon once again to knock the price on the Wear OS Ticwatch Pro 5 Enduro Smartwatch down to $261.99 shipped. Regularly $350, you\u2019ll find this deal live on both the Obsidian and Slate colorways. Today\u2019s offer is matching our previous mention to land at the lowest price we have tracked for the second time since release.\n\nAnker\u2019s new 14-port Anker Prime Docking Station now $5 under Prime Day low at $175 (Reg. $250), more\n\nOne of our top 10 Prime Day deals was the 2024 Anker Prime lineup, featuring a series of charging solutions and the 14-port Anker Prime Docking Station. This regularly $250 USB-C/A hub fell to $212.49 before dropping again to $180 for day 2 of the Amazon fall event, and now it is sitting at the $174.99 shipped all-time low. There\u2019s no telling how long this straight up 30% price drop will stick around for considering it is in some ways a hangover Prime Day deal, so you\u2019ll want to jump as soon as possible if you\u2019re interested.\n\nWatch 9to5Toys on YouTube:\n\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!\n\nReview: Next Level Racing\u2019s $300 Formula Lite Pro living room-friendly racing cockpit [Video]\n\nReview: Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro goes back to the basics and I love it [Video]\n\nThe $400 Moza R3 for Xbox is finally available!
