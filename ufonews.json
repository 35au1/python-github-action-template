I think,\u201d he says, grinning, checking his pulse theatrically. \u201cHold on a minute\u2026 Who paid for the last round? No\u2026 I got lucky really.\u201d\n\nClassic Rock is catching up with Mogg in Brighton, where the veteran singer now lives, to discuss the apparent dissolution of his much-loved band UFO, as well as the latest repackaging of the band\u2019s sixth album, Lights Out. He also sheds light on the birth of a new solo project called Moggs Motel.\n\nIt\u2019s mid-January, and we are among the first customers to walk through the door of a pub near the railway station. For some unexplained reason we drink halves instead of pints, forgetting that doing that usually hastens consumption. Gradually the pub\u2019s early drinkers arrive. Those are gradually replaced by the lunchtime crowd. By the time we leave, following multiple exclamations of \u201cJust one more?\u201d, darkness is approaching.\n\nOn that August 2022 evening, Mogg, now 76 years old, was at home with his wife Emma, a former glamour model, when he started to feel unwell.\n\n\u201cI thought it was indigestion or heartburn. But it was quite a bit more than reflux. Emma was watching a comedy show, with a glass of wine, and I was going [mimes choking],\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s laughing at the TV, and I\u2019m realising it\u2019s serious \u2013 \u2018Hang on, I could be dying here.\u2019 So I popped to the hospital down the road.\u201d\n\nThe eventual outcome was that Mogg had two stents implanted into his coronary arteries, and doctors advised him to rest. That caused the cancellation of the final run of dates of UFO\u2019s farewell tour, Last Orders, which was scheduled to finish in Athens. \u201cIt was all a bit of a shock,\u201d he admits.\n\nResponding to the suggestion that Mogg looks after himself better these days \u2013 certainly compared with the levels of UFO\u2019s Bacchanalian heyday \u2013 he simply chuckles darkly. Doesn\u2019t he go to the gym?\n\n\u201cNot any more. I use gardening as the gym. You can do as much or as little as you want.\u201d\n\nUFO in 1974 - group portrait\n\nThe enforced cancellation of the final run of Last Orders shows suggested the end of the long road UFO had travelled for more than 50 years, and our meeting in Brighton comes a few days after the announcement of an online auction for the equipment used by the band on their US tours.\n\n\u201cBasically, all of that stuff is in storage. We may as well flog it,\u201d Mogg says.\n\nIt seems awfully final.\n\n\u201cWell, the situation was frustrating,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you commit to doing something, you should finish it, but it just wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d\n\nSo UFO are over, definitely, for good?\n\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no going back?\n\n\u201cNo. That really cool tour we did in the UK was it. For us to suddenly reappear again, the fans would say: \u2018Oi! I paid to see you on that last tour.\u2019 Some might think that a great thing. Me, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s topsy-turvy career is a tale worthy of an entire issue of Classic Rock. The line-up changes, mid-tour departures, fist fights between band members, reunions, and now belatedly blighted by funerals, often marinated in strong booze and heightened by Class-A drugs. Its plot twists would merit a soap opera were they not so implausible.\n\nRegularly in cahoots with co-founding bass player Pete Way (RIP), as the group\u2019s singular strand of consistency Londoner Mogg was right there at the heart of it all. He\u2019s been a singer, lyricist, ringleader, villain (during the 70s he punched the band\u2019s talismanic guitarist Michael Schenker, causing him to quit), bandleader (for the 1985 album Misdemeanor, Mogg rebuilt UFO from scratch), and clown (he fell off stage on at least one occasion). But now, after 56 years of all that and much more, the time has come for Phil Mogg to do something else.\n\npage divider\n\nBefore we get into that, there\u2019s the not-so-trifling matter of the new 2024 reboot of Lights Out, remastered and with the added bonus of a fabulous archive show from London\u2019s Roundhouse in 1977. Mogg is well aware of EMI\u2019s efforts to overhaul the band\u2019s catalogue.\n\n\u201cThose reissues are impressive, aren\u2019t they? It makes me think why we didn\u2019t do that [employ such a level of care] back in the day.\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cNo, I\u2019m joking. They\u2019re very nice.\u201d\n\nLike many artists, Mogg has a complicated view of the industry\u2019s quest to re-sell to the public records that they already own.\n\n\u201cThe labels are always looking for something new, and I find myself wondering who\u2019s going to buy it,\u201d he muses. \u201cIf these things come out again on vinyl, that\u2019s a selling point for me. From that perspective it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAs a curious aside, Mogg confides that he recently bought a copy of UFO\u2019s quintessential 1979 double live album Strangers In The Night from a second-hand record shop adjacent to the pub in which we sit. \u201cI didn\u2019t own an original version, so I bought one. Just to put it on the shelf, I guess, along with everything else. Everything goes into a cupboard or on to a shelf.\u201d\n\nAs the swan song of UFO\u2019s herculean first era with Schenker on guitar, Strangers still stands up as a brilliant record. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mogg says fondly, nodding. \u201cBut I tend to remember the funny bits [more than the music]. With Lights Out, making that album was a barrelful of laughs. It was a good, fun time, everybody was enjoying themselves and stuff.\u201d\n\nIncluding the supposedly \u2018difficult\u2019 Michael Schenker?\n\n\u201cYeah. He had his moments. You had to look out for them. No\u2026 I\u2019m kidding. Michael was fine.\u201d\n\nFor UFO, Lights Out and its follow-up Obsession were the best of times. With Schenker on board, having joined from the Scorpions in 1973, the band had toured heavily for Force It and No Heavy Pettin\u2019, released in 1975 and \u201976 respectively.\n\n\u201cWe also knew that either Lights Out was going to do something big for us, or it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cNo disrespect to Leo [Lyons, the former Ten Years After bass player who produced those two records], but we had to jump from where we were to somewhere else. That\u2019s when some investigation began \u2013 which producer had made the albums that we liked best. And Ron Nevison\u2019s name kept coming up.\u201d\n\nUFO onstage\n\nWith Nevison signed up as producer, UFO and their new keyboard player/second guitarist Paul Raymond set up in Air Studios at London\u2019s Oxford Circus. Having worked with The Who and Led Zeppelin, Nevison was a hard taskmaster. A real man\u2019s man. And he liked to let his charges know who was boss.\n\n\u201cOnly if you took any notice of him,\u201d Mogg says. \u201cI\u2019m sure that to most people Ron could be quite intimidating, but we had this way of subtly\u2026 sort of not letting him do that. He was right and he was the producer, but he had a knack of putting things that might rub people up the wrong way. Fortunately we all became pals. Ron made the band sound amazing. He gave us that extra push.\"\n\nLights Out was packaged in an eye-catching sleeve, shot in the bowels of London\u2019s Battersea Power Station and created by the immensely popular and acclaimed design team Hipgnosis.\n\n\u201cWho knows what was going on there,\u201d Mogg ponders, with a wave of his hand. \u201cThe idea came from them, Storm [Thorgerson] and Po [Powell]. I\u2019m not sure if they had taken a load of pictures of inside Battersea when they worked with Pink Floyd. You know, Battersea Power Station\u2026 lights\u2026 that was the connection. We lucked out working with them.\u201d\n\nLights Out became and remains UFO\u2019s highest-charting album in the USA, but Mogg rejects the suggestion that the band felt tantalisingly close to becoming The Next Big Thing.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t buy into such preconceived ideas,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe were still too busy telling ourselves: \u2018All of this is a bit good, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d\n\nRetaining Nevison, UFO went to California to make Obsession, where their great adventure continued, residing in hired luxury pads and driving rented cars.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own them,\u201d Mogg says, smiling, \u201cand years later you discover that you still owe money on them. It\u2019s a funny old world. But yeah, we enjoyed the experience to the maximum. We certainly paid for it to the maximum.\u201d\n\nHe chuckles when he recalls the group\u2019s respective choices of mode of transport.\n\n\u201cI went for the Trans Am with the eagle on the front \u2013 I took that off, I couldn\u2019t stand it. Michael got a Chevvy Stringray, and Pete went for the Camaro. Paul took over [Chrysalis labelmate] Robin Trower\u2019s Cadillac. For some reason Andy [Parker, drums] picked a Honda Civic. That still makes me laugh.\u201d On one notable occasion the band raced through Coldwater Canyon, although Mogg claims they \u201cremained just within the speed limit\u201d.\n\nPete Way and Phil Mogg (holding a tabloid newspaper)\n\nFrom the outside it looked as though UFO were English (and German) rock stars living the Californian dream.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d says Mogg. \u201cWe were working in LA, but it really didn\u2019t feel romantic in the sense you are implying.\u201d\n\nAll the same, by that point UFO had put in more than a decade of hard work and knew they were making great records. \u201cThe thought never occurred to us,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, it wasn\u2019t like that. That\u2019s not the kind of people we are. You\u2019d be somewhere on the road in America, a bit knackered from partying and in one of the most awful places, and before going on stage Pete would gather us together and in very serious tones tell us: \u2018Right, we\u2019re about to take out Poughkeepsie.\u2019 It was absurd, but that was our general attitude.\u201d\n\nThere was also an awareness that it could all come tumbling down at any given moment.\n\n\u201cAs much as we were enjoying it to the max, nobody expected things to last,\u201d Mogg affirms. \u201cThere was a bit of friction with Michael, because Way and I were just juveniles. And of course, Parker was the sensible one.\u201d\n\nWere those times the best of his life?\n\n\u201cYeah, probably. It was pretty knockout.\u201d\n\nFollowing the departure of Michael Schenker at the end of the 70s, UFO invited former Lone Star guitarist Paul Chapman back for a second run with the band. The Welshman had played with UFO from 1974-75 as part of a twin-guitar line-up alongside Schenker. With Chapman, nicknamed \u2018Tonka\u2019 for his indestructible qualities, UFO thrived, although a softening of their sound caused Way to quit following 1982\u2019s Mechanix. The rest of the decade presented tough times and mixed results, and a number of line-up changes.\n\nIn 1991, Mogg and Way put the band back together without Schenker, although along with Raymond and Parker he rejoined for Walk On Water, an excellent album, again produced by Nevison, from a frustratingly short-lived reunion.\n\nSchenker rejoined again at the turn of the millennium. But following his shamefully inebriated performance at Manchester Apollo, UFO\u2019s fortunes plummeted to an all-time low. Still, Schenker\u2019s replacement, American guitar hero Vinnie Moore, remained a part of UFO until the very end, and from 2004\u2019s You Are Here onwards they made a string of very creditable records. Sixteen years ago, Way\u2019s own well-publicised issues with addiction gave the band no option but to \u2018let him go\u2019. He never returned to the line-up. To Mogg\u2019s great sadness, Way died in 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that, robbed of the bonhomie of his long-time partner in crime, life within UFO was never the same again for the singer. He enjoyed the 100 minutes or so performing on stage each night, but the travelling wore him down. As a man of advancing age, the more undignified elements of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll circus became magnified.\n\nWith bandmates past and present now passing on, Mogg became conscious of his own mortality. In 2018, during the build-up to UFO\u2019s 50th anniversary, he announced his retirement from the road upon completion of a tour that, inevitably, became significantly extended. \u201cThis is the right time for me to quit,\u201d he said back then.\n\nMoggs Motel group portrait\n\nMogg had ventured outside of UFO for two albums with Way under the handle Mogg/Way, and even undertook a short tour for an extremely fine 2002 project named $ign Of 4. With that in mind, the end of UFO wouldn\u2019t necessarily spell the end of his career as a musician. A fresh period of activity began when Mogg bumped into Tony Newton, the bassist with Voodoo Six, and now a member of KK\u2019s Priest.\n\n\u201cWe [UFO] had toured with Voodoo Six so we got chatting,\u201d Mogg recalls. \u201cI told him I was looking to do something, and he replied \u2013 this is great: \u2018Well I\u2019ve got a couple of riffs.\u2019 So we got together to see what transpired. And then Steve [Harris, Iron Maiden bassist] lent us his studio.\u201d\n\nOver the following year, and partly during lockdown, the project took shape. Just like the album, the band are called Moggs Motel (no apostrophe). \u201cMotels don\u2019t have apostrophes,\u201d he insists. \u201cNot the ones I stay in, anyway.\u201d\n\nBesides him and Newton, who also co-wrote and produced the album, the line-up includes Neil Carter, UFO\u2019s second guitarist, keyboard player and occasional saxophonist, who returned to the group unexpectedly following Paul Raymond\u2019s death in 2019, plus second guitarist Tommy Gentry (Gun, The Raven Age) and former Voodoo Six drummer Joe Lazarus.\n\nInserting Moggs Motel into a one-size-fits-all category isn\u2019t easy. On the day that we meet in Brighton, Mogg doesn\u2019t even try.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played the album to a couple of people I know,\u201d he confides, before listing several of them, including his daughter and \u201cmy mate who lives around the corner\u201d who considered it \u201clovely\u201d. Ultimately, he shrugs: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s rock music?\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of symphonic rock. No. Actually, I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\nHe whips out his mobile phone and plays a couple of tracks. Sunny Side Of Heaven features Alabama 3 singer Zoe Devlin Love, while the instrumental Harry\u2019s Place is a flute-driven nod to the Dirty Harry soundtrack. Mogg hopes to play a one-off showcase-style gig for the album in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being discussed, it\u2019s just a case of finding the right venue,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve even got a new hat.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is a great name for a band. Some guests check in and some leave. Other, less savoury, characters are barred.\n\n\u201cMy motel has speciality suites,\u201d he remarks proudly. \u201cThe Frank Sinatra Suite has been left reserved. I\u2019ve given Kate [UFO\u2019s long-suffering merchandise and web lady] the Sammy Davis Jr. Suite. There are also the Dean Martin and Lauren Bacall Suites. I\u2019m thinking about a Charles Bukowski Suite. You can have that one, because it\u2019s for writers.\u201d\n\nThanks. On that note, another half?\n\n\u201cYeah, why not.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2019, with no British dates on the cards for the line-up featuring Neil Carter, Mogg invited me to attend a couple of UFO shows on the continent. Travelling on the bus, he often sat up front in the dark, watching quietly as the miles were eaten up.\n\n\u201cI call it, white-line fever,\u201d he says. \u201cI love midnight driving, just the driver and you. I like to play Tangerine Dream, Love On A Real Train. Try it, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWill all of that be hard to relinquish?\n\n\u201cNot really. I said that when I stopped having fun I wouldn\u2019t do it any more. I hadn\u2019t reached that point, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain this\u2026 Well I do, but I\u2019m not going to. UFO was wound down at the right time. I\u2019d had a birthday, the band had had a good run, it was time to go: \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019 Plus I fancied doing something else anyway.\u201d\n\nAll the same, the other members of UFO, especially Andy Parker, felt that there was still mileage in the UFO name. Could the band still make records, without touring?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he fires back instantly. \u201cAnd there are deep rooted reasons. But\u2026 definitely not.\u201d\n\nUFO\u2019s career has been fascinating in so many ways. If Mogg could go back and change some of the many \u2018banana-skin\u2019 moments\u2019, would he do so, and what would they be?\n\n\u201cWhen all those glamour models were banging at my door, I should have opened it and let them all in,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cBut I was strong, I said no.\u201d\n\nIs there a serious answer for that question?\n\n\u201cNo. Some things get screwed up and others are great. That\u2019s life. But I do wish we\u2019d got a fair crack of the whip.\u201d\n\nBusiness-wise, you mean?\n\n\u201cIn our youth we were gung-ho, living in the moment. If only someone had looked after us. But those people are hard to find. As far as UFO goes, we got pretty screwed.\u201d\n\nUFO have been hailed an as influence by Metallica, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains, but Mogg states: \u201cI take all of that stuff with a pinch of salt. Steve [Harris], for instance, says nice things about us. [Pearl Jam guitarist] Mike McCready wrote a charming note after we covered [McCready\u2019s 90s project] Mad Season\u2019s River Of Deceit. You half-believe it, don\u2019t you? But I always mistrust someone that says: \u2018You\u2019re fucking great\u2019.\u201d\n\nFormer band members and associates, including ex-manager John Knowles and popular tour manager Tonio Neuhaus, are no longer with us, but they are never far from Mogg\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a question to ask Pete, and then I realise he\u2019s not there to answer any more,\u201d he sighs.\n\nDuring the later years, you and Pete remained extremely close.\n\n\u201cWe had some fucking great times. I mean ridiculous times,\u201d Mogg reminisces. \u201cThose two [Way and Chapman] always made me laugh. [Mogg launches into a scarily good impression of Way]: \u201cHere, John, is there any more money left in the float?\u201d [Then just as accurately as Chapman]: \u2018Eh, I tell you what, let\u2019s get drunk like we used to.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith impeccable comic timing, Mogg says: \u201cThat bastard [Way] still owes me twenty quid.\u201d\n\nSo, if UFO are over and done, how would Mogg like his band to be remembered? \u201cI\u2019m happy that we achieved what we set out to do, and I hope people think of us in the way I remember The Animals, who I saw as a kid and it gave me goosebumps,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI know we did some dodgy gigs when we overindulged, but the good ones really took off. So if we gave some people goosebumps, for me that would be sufficient.\u201d\n\nMoggs Motel is available now via SPV."

He opined that UFOs are likely not aliens but a top secret 'new weapons program'\n\n'I would guarantee that the split-second I see any evidence of aliens, I will immediately post that on the X platform,' Musk told Carlson on the pundit's new show, which is hosted on the social media site X.\n\n'It will probably be our number one post of all time,' the billionaire added.\n\nBut Musk said he believes UFOs seen in the skies now are classified military vehicles.\n\n'Where are the aliens? Why don't I see them,' Musk said to Tucker.\n\n'A lot of people think we see aliens, but I have not seen any evidence.'\n\nHe continued to explain that SpaceX has more than 6,000 Starlink satellites in orbit and 'not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.'\n\nMany skeptical commentators have long maintained that UFOs could be classified US military test planes or other next-generation craft like the the Silent Ventus drone.\n\nThe drone was made by Florida-based start-up Undefined Technologies and generates thrust by ionizing the air with custom-made electrodes.\n\nSpaceX has also been rumored to be building a network of hundreds of spy satellites under a classified $1.8 billion contract with US intelligence agency the National Reconnaissance Office, which may have been the secret weapons Musk was referring to.\n\nBut the comments from the on-again, off-again contender for the world's richest man elicited mixed reactions online, including from reporters responsible for bringing to light some of America's most credentialed and high-profile UFO whistleblowers.\n\nInvestigative journalist Ross Coulthart \u2014 who conducted the first televised interview with UFO whistleblower David Grusch last year \u2014 has long maintained that Musk knows more than he is letting on about the government's secret UFO programs.\n\n'I've been told by people who are aware of what Elon Musk and SpaceX are up to, that he has been read in to parts of \"The Program,\"' Coulthart told viewers of the cable channel NewsNation this May.\n\n'But at the moment, he's taking the position he's taken,' he added. 'Let's see how long that lasts.'\n\nOther critics on social media were less measured in their criticism of Musk's comments, however.\n\n'So Elon is saying the USG has tech that can go from space to the surface of the ocean in seconds while also making sharp angle turns with no visible means of propulsion or wings and instantly disappear in front of pilots' eyes,' an X user shared.\n\n'Why is he wasting money on #SpaceX then?'\n\nA UAP researcher said Musk sounded almost 'exactly like Mick West' during the interview.\n\n'It's making sense. They're all on the same team,' Robert WR commented.\n\n'They're using the same words and same method of saying, 'it's PROBABLY this,' without any shred of evidence. They're hypocrites bc that's what they accuse the ufo com. of.'\n\nBut Musk is not the only one to come forward with the theory. In March, US officials said there was 'no evidence' that the US government had encountered alien life and the UFOs seen by American are merely objects from Earth.\n\nWhile the public criticizes Musk on X about his comments, he has been at least consistent with his opinion on UFOs throughout the year.\n\nIn May, the SpaceX founder said the people who believe there are aliens among us are the same people who believe NASA's moon landings were fake.\n\nSpeaking on a panel titled 'How to save the human race and other light topics' at the 2024 Milken Institute Global Conference held in Los Angeles, Musk gave a similar response to what he shared with Tucker.\n\nMusk cited no secret knowledge for his assessment on Carlon's program (above) - only his management of a worldwide satellite internet network via Starlink. 'We've got 6,000 satellites in orbit and not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft,' Musk said\n\n'I've not seen any evidence of aliens,' Musk said. 'And SpaceX, with the Starlink constellation, has roughly 6,000 satellites, and not once have we had to maneuver around a UFO. [...] Never. So I'm like, okay, I don't see any evidence of aliens.'\n\nNevertheless, Musk's network of 6,426 Starlink satellites currently orbiting Earth as of September 2024, do routinely engage in evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions, as many as 275 such dodges per day to avoid other objects in space.\n\nThis week, Musk offered his best, unclassified assessment of what pilots and other military eyewitnesses were encountering when they report a out of this world craft.\n\n'If you had the top secret compartmented clearance, you would know about this new program,' Musk told Carlson as a hypothetical. 'So, then, you know, some pilot sees something moving fast and says, 'Hey! I saw a UFO!''\n\nMusk continued, speaking from the voice of a hypothetical senior Pentagon official: 'Yeah, that was actually a new weapons program but we can't tell you that.'\n\nMusk's doubling-down on his stance this week was met by a similarly jaded response from Las Vegas-based KLAS-TV new reporter George Knapp, who has made a career breaking stories on the UFO beat from FBI raids of Area 51 citizen watchdogs to the 'Mosul orb.'\n\n'Great news,' Knapp posted to Musk's X platform. 'So when do they finally deploy those nifty Tic Tac [UFO] craft seen in 2004?'\n\nThe infamous 2004 Nimitz 'Tic Tac' UFO encounter has remained unsolved to the present day, meriting a mention before Congress last summer when a US Navy pilot eyewitness to the baffling pill-shaped object testified before Congress."

        "article_content": "A recent revelation by a Pentagon whistleblower has disclosed the existence of a highly classified government program called \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nReported by journalist Michael Shellenberger on his Substack newsletter \u2018Public,\u2019 this secret Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP) allegedly deals with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), formerly referred to as UFOs, and has operated for decades without Congressional oversight, raising concerns about government transparency.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, elements within the military and intelligence community (IC) have withheld information about UAPs, violating constitutional obligations. Shellenberger notes, \u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about UAPs.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s report outlines seven categories of evidence, detailing various UAP sightings captured by U.S. military sensors and personnel. It claims that \u201cthe verifiable chain of custody for UAP IMINT [Imagery Intelligence] collected by U.S. military assets ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered.\u201d\n\nThe report also mentions \u201calien reproduction vehicles\u201d (ARVs) being secured within this program. The whistleblower further warned that publishing the name \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d could lead to government surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nThese revelations align with former President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing claims that the government is withholding information about UAPs. In a June 2024 interview, Trump said, \u201cI have access, and I speak to people about it. I've had actual meetings on it. And they will tell you there\u2019s something going on.\u201d He has frequently expressed frustration over the government\u2019s secrecy, stating that his administration sought to release more information to the public.\n\nLawmakers like Senators Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have pushed for greater transparency on UAPs, have voiced concerns about the lack of accountability. \u201cMost of [the UAP whistleblowers] have held very high clearances and high positions within our government,\u201d Rubio said last year.\n\nWhile the full extent of \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d remains unclear, the disclosure has reignited public interest in UAP investigations. The Pentagon has yet to respond to the new allegations, though it previously denied any reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology. Whistleblowers, however, continue to claim that crucial information about UAPs is being hidden from Congress."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nDatabricks just made app development a piece of cake. The Ali Ghodsi-led company announced Databricks Apps, a capability that allows enterprise developers to quickly build production-ready data and AI applications in a matter of clicks.\n\nAvailable in public preview today, the service provides users with a template-based experience, where they can connect relevant data and frameworks of choice into a fully functional app that could run within their respective Databricks environment.\n\nAccording to the company, it can be used to create and deploy a secure app in as little as five minutes.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when enterprises, despite being bullish on the potential of data-driven applications, continue to struggle with the operational hassle of the entire development cycle, right from provisioning the right infrastructure to ensuring security and access control of the developed app.\n\nWhat to expect from Databricks Apps?\n\nMuch like Snowflake, Databricks has long provided its customers the ability to build apps powered by their data hosted on the company\u2019s platform. Users can already build applications such as interactive dashboards to delve into specific insights or sophisticated AI-driven systems like chatbots or fraud detection programs.\n\nHowever, no matter what one chooses to develop, the process of bringing a reliable app to production in a secure and governed manner is not an easy one.\n\nThe developers have to go beyond writing the app to handle several critical aspects of the development pipeline, right from provisioning and managing infrastructure and ensuring data governance and compliance to manually bolting integrations for access controls and defining who could use the app and who could not. This often makes the whole development process complex and time-consuming.\n\n\u201cApp authors had to become familiar with container hosting technologies, implement single sign-on authentication, configure service principals and OAuth, and configure networking. The apps they created relied on integrations that were brittle and difficult to manage,\u201d Shanku Niyogi, the VP of product management at Databricks, tells VentureBeat.\n\nTo change this, the company is now bringing everything to one place with the new Databricks Apps experience.\n\nWith this offering, all a user has to do is select a Python framework from a set of options (Streamlit/Dash/Gradio/Flask), a template of the type of app they want to develop (chatbot or data visualization app) and configure a few basic settings, including those for mapping resources (like data warehouses or LLMs) and defining permissions.\n\nOnce the basic setup is done, the app is deployed to the user\u2019s Databricks environment, allowing them to use it themselves or share it with others in the team. When others log in, the app automatically prompts them with single sign-on authentication. Further, if needed, the developer will also get the option to customize the developed app and test their app code in their preferred IDE (integrated development environment).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/databricks/status/1843639454596247664\n\nOn the backend, Niyogi explained, the service provisions serverless compute to run the app, ensuring not only faster deployment but also that the data does not leave the Databricks environment.\n\n\u201cEach app is fortified with robust security measures for seamless and secure user access. Plus, the integration with Unity Catalog provides comprehensive data governance and management capabilities, while the apps inherit the networking protections of your workspace, ensuring a multi-layered security approach for your sensitive data and applications,\u201d he explained.\n\nAt this stage, Databricks Apps only supports Python frameworks. However, Niyogi noted that the company is working to expand to more tools, languages and frameworks, making secure app creation easier for everyone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started with Python, the #1 language for data. Anyone familiar with a Python framework can write their app in code, and anyone with an existing app can onboard it into Databricks Apps easily. We support any Python IDE. We are working with ISV partners to enable their tools to support Databricks Apps, and add support for other languages and frameworks,\u201d he added.\n\nSome 50 enterprises have already tested Databricks Apps in beta, including Addi, E.ON Digital Technology, SAE International, Plotly and Posit. With the public preview launching today, the number is expected to grow in the coming months.\n\nNotably, Snowflake, Databricks\u2019 biggest competitor, also has a low-code way to help enterprises develop and deploy data and AI apps.\n\nHowever, Databricks claims to distinguish itself with a more flexible and interoperable approach.\n\n\u201cDatabricks Apps supports Dash, Gradio, Flask, and Shiny as well as Streamlit, and supports more versions of Streamlit than Snowflake does. Developers can also use their choice of tools to build apps. We will continue to build on this flexible approach, adding support for more languages, frameworks and tools,\u201d Niyogi pointed out."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nHugging Face has released an innovative new Python package that allows developers to create AI-powered web apps with just a few lines of code.\n\nThe tool, called \u201cOpenAI-Gradio,\u201d simplifies the process of integrating OpenAI\u2019s large language models (LLMs) into web applications, making AI more accessible to developers of all skill levels.\n\nThe release signals a major shift in how companies can leverage AI, reducing development time while maintaining powerful, scalable applications.\n\nHow developers can create web apps in minutes with OpenAI-Gradio\n\nThe OpenAI-Gradio package integrates OpenAI\u2019s API with Gradio, a popular interface tool for machine learning (ML) applications.\n\nIn just a few steps, developers can install the package, set their OpenAI API key, and launch a fully functional web app.\n\nThe simplicity of this setup allows even smaller teams with limited resources to deploy advanced AI models quickly.\n\nFor instance, after installing the package with:\n\npip install openai-gradio\n\nA developer can write:\n\nimport gradio as gr import openai_gradio gr.load( name='gpt-4-turbo', src=openai_gradio.registry, ).launch()\n\nThis small amount of code spins up a Gradio interface connected to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4-turbo model, allowing users to interact with state-of-the-art AI directly from a web app.\n\nDevelopers can also customize the interface further, adding specific input and output configurations or even embedding the app into larger projects.\n\nSimplifying AI development for businesses of all sizes\n\nHugging Face\u2019s openai-gradio package removes traditional barriers to AI development, such as managing complex backend infrastructure or dealing with model hosting.\n\nBy abstracting these challenges, the package enables businesses of all sizes to build and deploy AI-powered applications without needing large engineering teams or significant cloud infrastructure.\n\nThis shift makes AI development more accessible to a much wider range of businesses. Small and mid-sized companies, startups, and online retailers can now quickly experiment with AI-powered tools, like automated customer service systems or personalized product recommendations, without the need for complex infrastructure.\n\nWith these new tools, companies can create and launch AI projects in days instead of months.\n\nWith Hugging Face\u2019s new openai-gradio tool, developers can quickly create interactive web apps, like this one powered by the GPT-4-turbo model, allowing users to ask questions and receive AI-generated responses in real-time. (Credit: Hugging Face / Gradio)\n\nCustomizing AI interfaces with just a few lines of code\n\nOne of the standout features of openai-gradio is how easily developers can customize the interface for specific applications.\n\nBy adding a few more lines of code, they can adjust everything from the input fields to the output format, tailoring the app for tasks such as answering customer queries or generating reports.\n\nFor example, developers can modify the interface to include specific prompts and responses, adjusting everything from the input method to the format of the output.\n\nThis could involve creating a chatbot that handles customer service questions or a data analysis tool that generates insights based on user inputs.\n\nHere\u2019s an example provided by Gradio:\n\ngr.load( name='gpt-4-turbo', src=openai_gradio.registry, title='OpenAI-Gradio Integration', description=\"Chat with GPT-4-turbo model.\", examples=[\"Explain quantum gravity to a 5-year-old.\", \"How many R's are in the word Strawberry?\"] ).launch()\n\nThe flexibility of the tool allows for seamless integration into broader web-based projects or standalone applications.\n\nThe package also integrates seamlessly into larger Gradio Web UIs, enabling the use of multiple models in a single application.\n\nWhy this matters: Hugging Face\u2019s growing influence in AI development\n\nHugging Face\u2019s latest release positions the company as a key player in the AI infrastructure space. By making it easier to integrate OpenAI\u2019s models into real-world applications, Hugging Face is pushing the boundaries of what developers can achieve with minimal resources.\n\nThis move also signals a broader trend toward AI-first development, where companies can iterate more quickly and deploy cutting-edge technology into production faster than ever before.\n\nThe openai-gradio package is part of Hugging Face\u2019s broader strategy to empower developers and disrupt the traditional AI model development cycle.\n\nAs Kevin Weil, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Product Officer, mentioned during the company\u2019s recent DevDay, lowering the barriers to AI adoption is critical to accelerating its use across industries.\n\nHugging Face\u2019s package directly addresses this need by simplifying the development process while maintaining the power of OpenAI\u2019s LLMs.\n\nHugging Face\u2019s openai-gradio package makes AI development as easy as writing a few lines of code. It opens the door for businesses to quickly build and deploy AI-powered web apps, leveling the playing field for startups and enterprises alike.\n\nThe tool strips away much of the complexity that has traditionally slowed down AI adoption, offering a faster, more approachable way to harness the power of OpenAI\u2019s language models.\n\nAs more industries dive into AI, the need for scalable, cost-effective tools has never been greater. Hugging Face\u2019s solution meets this need head-on, making it possible for developers to go from prototype to production in a fraction of the time.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a small team testing the waters or a larger company scaling up, openai-gradio offers a practical, no-nonsense approach to getting AI into the hands of users. In a landscape where speed and agility are everything, if you\u2019re not building with AI now, you\u2019re already playing catch-up."

This article contains spoilers from the Dandadan manga.\n\nThe world of Dandadan is as wild and unpredictable as it gets, filled with paranormal entities, bizarre aliens, and quirky, unforgettable characters. In this supernatural mix, there is a mysterious character that is yet to be introduced to anime-only viewers, and that is Count St. Germain. Introduced in chapter 120, Count Saint-Germain\u2019s main goal is to acquire the elusive Dandadan. But who exactly is this character, and what\u2019s the deal with his name?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCount St. Germain from Dandadan manga | Credit: Viz Media\n\nInterestingly, the name \u201cCount St. Germain\u201d isn\u2019t just a random name. It has a fascinating link to a historical character who has long piqued the interest of historians and conspiracy theorists: a man who was believed to be immortal and was surrounded by rumors of vampirism.\n\nWho is Count Saint-Germain in Dandadan?\n\nCount St. Germain is portrayed in the Dandadan universe as a paranormal collector who has a particular interest in obtaining Dandadan for reasons that are currently unclear. Under the alias of \u201cSanjome\u201d, Count St. Germain is currently serving as the high school\u2019s deputy head teacher and advisor to the History and Culture Research Club, despite his connections with the Kur, a militaristic alien race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCount St. Germain | Credit: Viz Media\n\nAlthough his dual identity suggests that he is cunning and discrete, his name is what really grabs fans\u2019 attention. St. Germain is not your typical temporary antagonist. It\u2019s evident from his introduction that he will have a bigger part to play in Dandadan\u2018s overall story.\n\nHe might easily emerge as one of the primary antagonists, using supernatural methods to achieve his goals given his fascination with the paranormal. But his name, steeped in history and tradition, offers even more hints about his true nature. The parallels between Dandadan\u2018s Count St. Germain and his real-life counterpart are impossible to ignore. Both figures are shrouded in mystery, have questionable origins, and exhibit strange, otherworldly behavior.\n\nThe Historical Count Saint-Germain: An Immortal or a Vampire?\n\nThe name Count St. Germain holds weight in history, tied to a figure who lived in 18th-century Europe, claiming to be an alchemist, diplomat, and composer. Fast forward to the early 20th century, a man named Jacques St. Germain arrived in New Orleans, claiming to be a descendant of the legendary Count St. Germain. Jacques became notorious for his luxurious parties and mysterious habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandadan | Credit: Science SARU\n\nDespite impressing the aristocracy with his wit, knowledge, and wealth, there was something truly mysterious about him \u2014 he was claimed to be immortal. Known for his refusal to eat in public and his disappearing acts, Jacques St. Germain quickly became a subject of intrigue and suspicion, and rumors of his strange, vampiric behavior spread across New Orleans.\n\nThe most chilling story tied to Jacques is the story of a woman who allegedly jumped from the second floor of his home, claiming he had bitten her on the neck in an attempt to drain her blood. When authorities searched his home, they found bottles filled with what appeared to be blood, but Jacques St. Germain was nowhere to be found. This event fueled rumors that he was not just an eccentric nobleman but an actual vampire.\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Aromatic_Assist_3825 from discussion\n\ninDandadan\n\nIs the Dandadan universe about to introduce its own version of a vampire through Count St. Germain? In Dandadan, Count Saint-Germain\u2019s role as a collector of paranormal artifacts positions him as a character deeply rooted in the supernatural. Moreover, in the manga Turbo Granny refers to him as \u201cHyper Geezer\u201d. It\u2019s no surprise that fans are speculating whether Dandadan\u2019s Count St. Germain is setting up to be a vampiric force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandadan has already introduced us to a host of strange and supernatural elements, but Count St. Germain\u2019s appearance raises the stakes in more ways than one. Whether he\u2019s an immortal, a vampire, or something even stranger, the journey to uncover his secrets is just beginning as the series unfolds.\n\nDandadan is currently available to watch and read on Netflix and Viz Media, respectively."

        "article_content": "LAFAYETTE \u2014 Your heart is pounding. You feel beads of sweat coming down your face but your mouth is dry as you slowly climb the stairway, the creak from each step echoing up the stairwell. You feel the cobwebs on the handrail as you continue to climb, faintly hearing the notes of a song coming from an old gramophone mingling with what sounded like a woman screaming in another room. It is nearly pitch black as you reach the top of the stairs. As your eyes strain to see into the hallway, a red light flickers on behind you, its light reflecting off the head of the axe the murderer is holding as he waits for you in the darkness.\n\nTales of horror like these are all too common this time of year as people celebrate all things scary during the Halloween season. While a story like this might be part of the plot of a scary movie, haunted attractions give thrill seekers the chance to become part of the story themselves.\n\n\u201cEverybody has their own opinions,\u201d Ned Baughman said. \u201cA lot of them like to be scared. Some of them like the artwork that goes into the process.\u201d\n\nBaughman, along with his wife, Nettie, own and operate the Haunted Town Hall in Lafayette along with their business partner, David Neff. The hall, along with its famous insane Mayor Joseph, is now in its 13th year of operation, kicking off its latest season last month \u2014 on Friday the 13th, no less. When it comes to making the attraction as scary and fun as possible, they consider it a labor of love as they paint the faded water stains on the walls or put the finishing touches on the cobwebs covering the shelves in the hall\u2019s library.\n\n\u201cGenerally, November, December is a cool-down time for us,\u201d Baughman said. \u201cBut come January, we start planning and even taking out old rooms that we know are changing.\u201d\n\nThat same planning and effort go into the Hammer Brothers Haunted Circus in Auglaize County southeast of Westminster. Now in its ninth year, the venue has grown to offer something for everyone as Julie Gossard and her husband, Matt, have incorporated multiple spooky attractions.\n\n\u201cWe do the haunted cornfield,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have our homestead, which is a haunted house walk-through, and then we also do the zombie paintball wagon ride, which is family-friendly for ages 4 and up. In the haunt realm, you don\u2019t see that a lot.\u201d\n\nBoth Baughman and Gossard said the number of visitors has been good so far this year, noting that foot traffic tends to ramp up as the calendar flips to October.\n\n\u201cI do think people are more careful,\u201d Gossard said. \u201cI see that more often this year where folks have to really choose what they\u2019re going to do versus other years where they might have done everything because our economy is tough.\u201d\n\nEven as times have been tight, people still have this desire to indulge in the creepy and spooky, especially, it would seem, in Ohio, with venues like the Haunted Town Hall, the Hammer Brothers Circus and Putnam County\u2019s Haunted Cornfield near Ottawa. According to TheScareFactor.com, a website that both keeps a database of and reviews haunted attractions and paranormal sites throughout the world, Ohio leads the nation with 135 haunted house attractions.\n\n\u201cA lot of them are historical, old buildings where they do actual paranormal investigations and stuff, too,\u201d Tyler Proffet, the owner of the website, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a haunted prison over in Mansfield. There\u2019s a schoolhouse in Cincinnati that\u2019s got some lore to it.\u201d\n\nProffet has found during his experiences at various haunted attractions that, while the reasons why people visit these sites may vary by individual, a lot of it comes down to seeking that next thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an endurance and it\u2019s a real sense of accomplishment when you get out to the other side and you didn\u2019t die or you laugh at your friends as they get scared,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Halloween inches closer, there is no sign the thrills, the screams or the laughs will be stopping anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t scare you, we try to make you laugh,\u201d Baughman said. \u201cThere\u2019s people who do the haunt and they\u2019re not scared, but as long as they come out the door laughing and just having a good time, we know that they enjoyed themselves.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the Lafayette Haunted Town Hall, go to https://bit.ly/3A2p4kV.

However, that announcement didn\u2019t make clear whether Rogers and WBD would move forwards as partners on the latter\u2019s lifestyle channel, though a rep indicated there would be no change.\n\nBell has been the Canadian home of WBD and predecessor Discovery\u2019s suite for three decades, operating many of its channels locally. However, in June, Rogers struck a deal to move WBD\u2019s lifestyle and factual channels into its sphere. Bell responded by filing for an injunction at the Ontario Superior Court to stop Rogers distributing the networks, claiming that WBD was blocked from moving its shows.\n\nRogers said today that Bell \u201cacknowledged all claims against Rogers were unfounded and abandoned its legal efforts.\u201d\n\nThe upshot is Rogers will launch Discovery ID and Discovery Channel as linear networks and distribute them to third-parties such as Bell. Content from Cooking, OWN, MotorTrend, Animal Planet and Discovery Science will be available on-demand and via Citytv+ on Amazon Prime Video Channels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already home to Canada\u2019s number one sports network, and this partnership helps solidify our leadership in entertainment with a diverse media portfolio of TV\u2019s most iconic brands,\u201d said Colette Watson, President, Rogers Sports & Media.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

        "article_content": "Two scientists have won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their discovery of microRNA, tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it\n\nBy DANIEL NIEMANN Associated Press , MARIA CHENG Associated Press , and MIKE CORDER Associated Press\n\nSTOCKHOLM -- Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine on Monday for their discovery of microRNA, tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it.\n\nIf scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.\n\nThe work by Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun is \u201cproving to be fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function,\" according to a panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun were initially interested in genes that control the timing of different genetic developments, ensuring that cell types develop at the right time.\n\nTheir discovery ultimately \u201crevealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\u201d the panel said.\n\nRNA is best known for carrying instructions for how to make proteins from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to tiny cellular factories that actually build the proteins. MicroRNA does not make proteins, but helps to control what cells are doing, including switching on and off critical genes that make proteins.\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel for medicine went to scientists who discovered how to manipulate one of those types of RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA, now used to make vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nAmbros' and Ruvkun's revolutionary discovery was initially made in worms; they set out to identify why some kinds of cells didn't develop in two mutant strains of worms commonly used as a research model in science.\n\n\u201cTheir groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\u201d according to the citation explaining the importance of their work.\n\nThat mechanism has been at work for hundreds of millions of years and has enabled evolution of complex organisms, it said.\n\nAmbros, currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, performed the research at Harvard University. Ruvkun\u2019s research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he\u2019s a professor of genetics.\n\nThe study of microRNA has opened up approaches to treating diseases like cancer because it helps regulate how genes work in our cells, said Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London.\n\nFletcher said there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as possible indicators of diseases, by tracking microRNA levels in the body.\n\n\u201cIf we take the example of cancer, we\u2019ll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,\u201d said Fletcher. She said scientists might one day be able to use microRNA to stop such effects.\n\nEric Miska, a geneticist at Cambridge University, said the discovery by Ambros and Ruvkun came as a complete surprise, overturning what scientists had long understood about how cells work.\n\nTheir discovery of microRNA shocked many scientists, Miska said, explaining that such small bits of genetic material had never been seen before. The tiny fragments of RNA \u2014 the human genome has at least 800 \u2014 were later found to play critical roles in how our bodies develop.\n\nMiska said there is ongoing work on the role of microRNA in infectious diseases like hepatitis and that it might also be helpful in treating neurological diseases.\n\nFletcher said the most advanced studies to date are reviewing how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but no drugs have yet been approved. She predicted that might happen in the coming years, adding that most treatments at the moment target cell proteins.\n\n\u201cIf we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nThe phone call from the Nobel panel is often a surprise, but there are certain signs that recipients and their families pick up on.\n\n\u201cWell, when a phone rings at 4:30 in the morning. ... It never happens here,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\n\u201cNatasha actually answered it,\u201d Ruvkun added, referring to his wife. \u201cAnd she goes: \u2018He has a Swedish accent.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt took a little longer to rouse Ambros.\n\n\u201cSomebody called my son, who called my wife as my phone was downstairs,\u201d he said.\n\nRuvkun knew immediately the impact the award would have on his life.\n\n\u201cWell, I just kept repeating in my mind, this changes everything because you know, the Nobel is just mythic in how it transforms the life of people who are selected,\u201d Ruvkun said. \u201cThe Nobel Prize is a recognition that\u2019s sort of 100 times as much press and celebration as any other award. So, it\u2019s not part of a continuum. It\u2019s a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nGoing to pick up his award in December will be the third time he has been to a Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm after attending to watch his mentor Robert Horvitz receive the 2002 award and then his buddy Jack Szostak, who won in 2009.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trip coming up. It will be the third, possibly the best,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAmbros said he didn\u2019t expect the award as he felt that the Nobel committee has already singled out RNA in the 2006 prize that went to his friends Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.\n\n\u201cIt represents the recognition of how wonderful and unexpected discoveries come from a curiosity in basic science financed by taxpayer money. It\u2019s a vitally important, probably the most important message, that this investment really pays off,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that microRNA helps regulate gene activity, rather than carrying instructions for making proteins.\n\n___\n\nCorder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, Cheng reported from London.

Out-of-the-box integrations with Google Merchant Center, Shopify, Bloomreach, Algolia, and more eliminate the need to manually configure, customize or update data for each individual destination system.\n\nSpecifically, to empower both marketers and merchants, the Lily app supports:\n\nAgnostic catalog ingestion via API or flat file;\n\nFully automated product attribution;\n\nOn-demand activation of Lily AI product attributes in: Shopify, Google Merchant Center, Algolia, Bloomreach & more;\n\nAutomatic retrieval and enrichment of new products from destination systems and return synchronization for timely activation;\n\nA/B testing and impact measurement across Google\u2019s surfaces.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor some retailers and brands, the excitement of the omnipresent Generative AI narrative is wearing off yet they aren\u2019t abandoning hope; instead, they are pushing through and figuring out how AI can create real value,\u201d says Purva Gupta, CEO and Co-founder of Lily AI. \u201cWhile upskilling internal teams, many relied on their technology providers to leverage AI on their behalf, but today, I\u2019m excited to deliver the newest version of our Lily app to empower our clients with easy-to-use self-serve access to the most accurate and high quality AI-powered product attribute platform in the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I meet with our customers, I often hear the term \u2018automagically\u2019 to describe their vision for product data enrichment and activation,\u201d says Ahmed Naiem, President of Lily AI. \u201cNow with the Lily app, we\u2019re empowering their teams to submit product data, publish enrichments, and view reports all through a self-serve interface, yet where the app really shines through is with our Google Merchant Center integration. Not only does the app eliminate human efforts in preparing and transferring data, but it improves the performance of traditional Search, Shopping, and Performance Max (PMax) campaigns, delivering 5-20% lifts across impressions and clicks.\u201d\n\nAbout Lily AI:\n\nLily AI is a female-founded retail AI company empowering retailers and brands by bridging the gap between merchant-speak and customer-speak. Leveraging generative AI, computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning, the Lily platform enhances customer shopping experiences by analyzing product catalogs and automatically enriching the assortment with the natural language consumers actually use when they search and shop. The platform then distributes the optimized data across a retailer\u2019s entire ecosystem from their website to Google Ads and beyond, ultimately delivering upwards of 9-figure revenue lift through improved product attribution, enhanced discovery, increased traffic and higher conversion.

It sparks both excitement and fear, as creators and industry professionals reckon with AI tools that make some creative tasks easier but ultimately could displace work.\n\nA new tech startup called Dreamwell AI has its sights set on using AI to make influencer marketing run more efficiently.\n\nDreamwell's AI tools help brands automate tasks like finding influencers to work with, assessing their value in terms of audience and potential engagement rate, and sending out cold emails to discuss paying them for a sponsored post. The company's goal is to automate 80% to 90% of the work that goes into setting up an influencer campaign, its cofounder Kazzy Khazaal told Business Insider. The task of bargaining with creators and vetting their content for brand safety still requires a human touch, he added.\n\n\"My suggestion to the brands is that as soon as you're starting to negotiate and the influencer gives you a price and says, 'Hey, this is the price that I want,' you're able to step in,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August, Dreamwell, which was cofounded by Khazaal and his business partner Anthony Bobsin, raised a $2.3 million pre-seed round led by Tim Draper's VC firm, Draper Associates. Other participating investors in the round included Panache Ventures and BDC Capital Seed Venture Fund.\n\nHow does the Dreamwell platform actually work? First, a brand looking to run an influencer campaign on the platform enters criteria for the type of audience it wants to reach, such as targeting a particular age group or gender, as well as how much it's willing to pay each creator. Dreamwell then identifies up to 1,000 prospective influencers on apps like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn. The company doesn't have direct relationships with most of those talent, but instead tracks down contact information to email prospective creators so a brand can begin a negotiation. A company can automate the entire discovery and outreach process, or manually select different creators that match its audience criteria for a campaign.\n\n\"First and foremost, we try to understand what's the value of this creator,\" Khazaal said. \"What's the predicted performance?\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nAI tech helped Dreamwell win over investors, but it also drew skepticism\n\nAI is a major focus among creator-economy companies this year. Startups and Big Tech alike are adding AI tools to help creators automate tasks like video editing, dubbing, and even coming up with ideas. Top creators like MrBeast and Dude Perfect are already testing the tech out, though some influencers are approaching generative AI with trepidation as they fear it could rob them of work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI-focused influencer startups have become a hot M&A target in recent months, as ad-holding companies like Stagwell and Publicis Groupe have scooped up companies with proprietary AI tech. But the phrase \"AI\" has become so common in startup decks that VCs have a fair amount of skepticism when they hear it in pitches, Khazaal said.\n\n\"I noticed that investors were very skeptical because they'd ask, 'Did you build anything, or are you just taking an OpenAI prompt, wrapping a GPT, and calling it a company?'\" Khazaal said.\n\nWhile Dreamwell uses OpenAI to support tasks like summarizing or categorizing data, it built its own model, Khazaal said: \"We have our own database. We have our own model that we built. We have proprietary data.\"\n\nPrashant Matta, a general partner at Panache Ventures, told BI he was drawn to Dreamwell's granularity of data and AI-generated insights, which he viewed as unique to the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKhazaal, who has also worked as a creator himself (he has around half a million YouTube subscribers), said having a track record of real revenue was also key to winning over investors.\n\n\"I would recommend to any startup founder, go get your revenue,\" he said. \"Make the story make sense and get to at least six figures in annual recurring revenue.\""

        "article_content": "\u201cPreviously, many organizations took their on-premises bad habits and moved them to the cloud,\u201d says Roger Haney, CDW\u2019s chief architect for software-defined infrastructure, in the report. \u201cThe people who are starting to see benefits are the ones who have gone from lift-and-shift activities to lift-and-improve activities. Then there\u2019s still a whole step to go, in which we modernize their workloads and move people into a cloud-native mindset.\u201d\n\nThe research report also dives into challenges to cloud management efforts, such as lack of cloud governance or on-staff cloud skills. This is one area in which many K\u201312 respondents struggled; the majority rely on third-party experts and cloud management platforms in their environments. Visibility into cloud spending also could use improvement across industries, as only 47% of respondents reported being very confident in their ability to track the costs of their public and private cloud systems.\n\nFinally, the report highlights the complex relationship between the cloud and security. While many organizations have undergone cloud repatriation due to security concerns, nearly half of respondents cite improved security as a major business benefit from public cloud investment.\n\n\u201cPeople now understand how cloud security works. It\u2019s much more of a whitelist security capability,\u201d Haney says. \u201cYou have to define what you allow through instead of what you deny. As people start to understand it, they see that it works differently, but it works just as well.\u201d\n\nDISCOVER: More findings from the 2024 CDW Cloud Computing Research Report here."
