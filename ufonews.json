Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month. Up next, they\u2019re scheduled to headline When We Were Young 2025 (get tickets here).\n\nBlink-182\u2019s Tom DeLonge Has a Theory on the New Jersey Drones: They\u2019re UFOs\n\nJo Vito\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopular Posts\n\nSubscribe to Consequence\u2019s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox."

It was Pajama Day at school but 6-year-old Levi didn't have any PJs.\n\n\"As he saw that I was upset, he saw my head looking down, and when I got on the bus he asked me what was wrong,\" Levi said. \"When I looked up tears came out of my eyes.\"\n\nLevi's bus driver later surprised him at school with some brand new pajamas.\n\nPeople as far as England and Portugal reached out to JCPS after their photo went viral.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nYared Nuguse takes bronze medal with a furious rally in historic Olympic 1500m\n\nIn August, Louisville watched one of its own race in the Olympics.\n\nManual graduate Yared Nuguse won a bronze medal in the men's 1500 meter race in Paris.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a long time since the Olympics, and I've just been taking it in for what it is, and just really believing internally that I am an Olympic bronze medalist,\" Nuguse said.\n\nThe runner got his start in high school when a teacher noticed him sprinting to McDonald's. Several years later, he sprinted across the finish line at the summer Olympics.\n\n\"Honestly, it's been pretty normal,\" he said. \"I only just finished my running season this weekend, so a lot of it has been normal training and stuff. But I'll get recognized at the grocery store a lot more, or little things like that. People are like, 'Oh my God, it's Yared.' And I'll be like, 'Oh, hi. What's up?'\"\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville's littlest lunch lady | Kind 2-year-old makes meals for trashmen every week\n\nTrash day was more than that for a 2-year-old girl in south Louisville.

The town's public works office later adopted the chicken after it laid an egg in someone's pickup truck. It's not clear why the chicken crossed the road though.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville attorney surprises teen with Taylor Swift tickets\n\nA Swiftie's wildest dreams came true this fall.\n\nWDRB was there as Louisville injury lawyer Sam Aguiar surprised 14-year-old Lola with tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in Indianapolis. The family has two children with down syndrome and got emotional at the surprise.\n\n\u201cWe looked around at several deserving families, and when I saw Lola\u2019s smile and learned more about the Rosenbaum family, I was hooked,\u201d Aguiar said.\n\nLola and her mom stood in the Swift merchandise line for hours before the concert and said it was worth it.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nMechanic proves Hoosiers are not lying about UFO sightings with his flying saucer car\n\nWDRB tracked down a street-legal UFO in southern Indiana.

One of us doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts, goblins and other paranormal \u201cBS\u201d.My spouse on the other hand is a believer.\n\nIn fact, she claims to have experienced the spirits that are supposed to frequent the Gibson Inn, one of our haunted hotels in Florida we list below. Personally, I believe she spent to much time listening to the spooky stories the bartender at the Gibson was feeding her!\n\nIn any event, the creepy stories about hotels in the Sunshine State are rampant. We pass along some of the more believable accountings.\n\nHaunted Hotels in Florida\n\nBiltmore Hotel \u2013 Coral Gables Haunted Hotel\n\nIf you have visited the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables Florida, you know this grand old resort has tons of history. The walls are lined with pictures of famous people who have stayed there.\n\nOf all the stories about lively spirits at the Biltmore, the most famous is the tale about Thomas \u201cFatty\u201d Walsh. The portions of the story that are true are that he was a gangster with friends like Lucky Luciano and Dutch Shultz.\n\nFatty had parties in the hotel on the 13th floor as the story goes, but our research shows it was the 14th floor. They always included women and gambling. It has been reported that Fatty paid the Biltmore staff handsomely to look the other way during his party nights.\n\nPolice never solved the murder of Walsh in March 1929. He was embedded in criminal activity from New York to Miami. While there were a dozen or so witnesses to the shooting, none ever admitted to whom the actual gunman was. Some were fearful of retaliation by the real murderer.\n\nFatty seems to be the primary spirit roaming the hotel looking for the murderer. Staff at the hotel used to relate more ghostly stories to the hotel\u2019s official historian Linda Spitzer.\n\nMs. Spitzer heard about the spirits of soldiers who died at the hotel when it was used as a hospital during World War II. She heard about guests who vanished after asking for assistance from the front desk clerk. There are many more abnormal sightings.\n\nIf ghosts are at the hotel for unfinished business, the history of this grand old hostelry certainly offers many opportunities for haunting.\n\nThings To Do in Coral Gables\n\nLoop Road, The Everglades and The Gator Hook Lodge\n\nSpend a little time deep in the Everglades. That is creepy enough without the stories of Loop Road.\n\nLoop Road can be described as a byway off the Tamiami Trail. That is a generous description. It is actually a semi-dangerous gravel road cut through the middle of the swamp.\n\nLoop Road is full of alligators, swamp angels, off-the-grid people, ramshackle dwellings, and plenty of things that want to bite, sting or eat you!\n\nThe Tamiami Trail was built as part of the quest to find a quick way to Miami. It was completed in 1928. Long before the completion of the Trail, a man by the name of James Franklin Jaudon built Loop Road from an old Indian trail into the Everglades.\n\nJaudon had a dream that tourists and travelers along the Miami-Dade/Monroe County line would come to his community of Pinecrest along Loop Road. He ran out of money.\n\nLoop Road eventually was traveled only by gladesmen, Indians, bootleggers and loggers. Rumors persist today that Al Capone had a speakeasy and gambling joint near Pinecrest.\n\nCrime, deceit, lawlessness, and unmarked graves have been associated with Loop Road. One old-timer quipped, \u201cwise men don\u2019t travel Loop Road at night\u2026. bears and panthers are the least of their worries\u201d.\n\nIn the 1950s Gator Hook Lodge opened for a 20-year stint. It was a real dive bar frequented by \u201chunters and fishers, froggers and gator poachers, moonshiners and misanthropes\u201d.\n\nThe Gator Hook burned down, but the stories about lost souls, disappearances, and lack of law enforcement remain. The nearest sheriff was 90 miles away in Key Largo.\n\nNeedless to say, the sounds of the Everglades at night lead to ghostly thoughts and inhuman sightings. Even the paranormal investigators shy away from the swamp.\n\nWe traveled Loop Road during the day. It is not for the faint of heart or vehicle in need of service. There are no gas stations, rest stops or stores. Cell phone service is spotty at best.\n\nThis creepy section of the Everglades is 20 miles of gravel road on the western portion and somewhat paved on the eastern side. The couple of homes at the eastern end are rustic, at best.\n\nOur advice is to travel at your leisure and own risk!\n\nContinue traveling\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThe information contained in South Florida Reporter is for general information purposes only.\n\nThe South Florida Reporter assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions in the contents of the Service.\n\nIn no event shall the South Florida Reporter be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages or any damages whatsoever, whether in an action of contract, negligence or other tort, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Service or the contents of the Service.

Critics like Meta and Musk argue that OpenAI risks undermining trust in nonprofits by exploiting charitable resources for private benefit. Image Credit: Reuters\n\nMeta has stepped into the fray, urging California\u2019s attorney general to block OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model. In a letter sent to Attorney General Rob Bonta, Meta argued that OpenAI\u2019s shift would be \u201cwrong\u201d and could set a precedent for other start-ups to exploit charitable status until profitability becomes feasible.\n\nThis move follows a similar legal challenge by Elon Musk in November, raising the stakes in the ongoing debate over OpenAI\u2019s future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns over nonprofit roots\n\nMeta\u2019s letter, published in full by The Verge, accuses OpenAI of leveraging its nonprofit beginnings to attract substantial investment, only to now seek private gain. Meta contends that OpenAI\u2019s conversion would allow it to unfairly reap benefits built on a charitable foundation. The company has also called for an investigation into OpenAI\u2019s past practices as a nonprofit, raising concerns about how the organisation has handled its assets and commitments.\n\nMeta\u2019s stance aligns with Musk\u2019s efforts, as the letter expressed support for Musk and Shivon Zilis to represent public interests in the lawsuit Musk revived in August. The lawsuit challenges OpenAI\u2019s ability to shift its status while retaining the resources it amassed under its original mission.\n\nOpenAI defends its position\n\nOpenAI has responded to the criticism, maintaining that any restructuring would be done responsibly. According to OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor, the nonprofit arm would remain intact, receiving full value for its current stake in the for-profit entity. OpenAI emphasised that its mission to advance artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity remains unchanged, even as it consults legal and financial advisors about its next steps.\n\nIn a timeline released last week, OpenAI highlighted past communications from Musk, showing that he once advocated for the organisation to adopt a for-profit structure under his leadership. This revelation has added another layer of complexity to the dispute, pointing to longstanding tensions about OpenAI\u2019s direction.\n\nImplications for the AI landscape\n\nThe battle over OpenAI\u2019s status highlights a broader debate about the balance between innovation and ethical responsibility in the AI industry. Critics like Meta and Musk argue that OpenAI risks undermining trust in nonprofits by exploiting charitable resources for private benefit. On the other hand, OpenAI claims that its proposed changes are necessary to secure funding and scale its mission.\n\nThis clash reflects the high stakes in the race for AI dominance, as tech giants and industry leaders wrestle with how to balance profit, public trust, and technological advancement. As the case unfolds, its outcome could set a precedent for how AI start-ups navigate the delicate boundary between nonprofit origins and for-profit ambitions."

            "article_content": "5 Trends In Digital Therapeutics For 2025\n\nBy Acacia Parks, Ph.D., MBA, CEO, Liquid Amber\n\nDespite industry pitfalls we\u2019ve seen in the past, digital therapeutics (DTx) are poised to gain momentum by showcasing their viability in addressing unmet healthcare needs, improving patient outcomes, and complementing traditional treatments over the next year.\n\nExpansion In Mental Health And Other Therapeutic Areas\n\nDTx has traditionally been rooted in areas like mental health and chronic disease management, and we\u2019ll continue to see developers drive innovation in these areas \u2014 bringing new digital therapies to market and refining existing technologies, especially in new indications where there are no or limited existing digital health interventions.\n\nFor example, Pfizer recently released a new digital application for migraine management that helps patients better understand and manage their symptoms through personalized insights and education. Given the prevalence and global burden of migraines, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see more manufacturers homing in on this condition as well.\n\nThe digital health sector also will expand to new therapeutic domains, including:\n\nOncology: Used to complement patients\u2019 existing oncology care, DTx products are emerging as a valuable tool in addressing side effects such as pain, nausea, and fatigue, as well as anxiety and depression associated with cancer diagnoses.\n\nUsed to complement patients\u2019 existing oncology care, DTx products are emerging as a valuable tool in addressing side effects such as pain, nausea, and fatigue, as well as anxiety and depression associated with cancer diagnoses. Women\u2019s health: With helpful features such as symptom tracking, behavioral coaching, telehealth, and more, the women\u2019s health sector will continue to see rapid adoption of digital therapeutics.\n\nWith helpful features such as symptom tracking, behavioral coaching, telehealth, and more, the women\u2019s health sector will continue to see rapid adoption of digital therapeutics. Pediatric conditions: We\u2019ve seen DTx interventions transform pediatric care by tackling ADHD, autism, and anxiety with engaging, interactive designs to address their symptoms.\n\nEvolving Approaches To FDA Interactions\n\nAs the industry continues to mature, DTx companies need to continue engaging with the FDA early and often as they develop their products. This includes meeting with the Agency to gauge their thoughts on endpoints, study designs, and statistical approaches before conducting a trial, as well as at key milestones throughout development, such as the conclusion of a study.\n\nLack of robust clinical evidence, issues with data privacy, and regulatory missteps encompass the challenges developers face in obtaining FDA approval for their digital therapies. Many companies approach the FDA expecting to be guided on how to conduct their research or obtain clearance, which can delay the start of trials or market approval, especially if studies have already been conducted without a clear understanding of what\u2019s needed for clinical validation. I\u2019m hopeful that these companies will learn from their and others\u2019 mistakes going into the next year.\n\nThe Future Of DTx And Healthcare Provider Partnerships\n\nSeamless integration of DTx into clinical workflows will require stronger partnerships between DTx companies and healthcare providers. In 2025, these collaborations will be driven by co-design initiatives where providers play a central role in shaping the design and deployment of digital therapies. This will ensure that DTx tools address real-world challenges, such as fitting within the constraints of short appointment times or interfacing with existing electronic health records (EHRs).\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ll see a rise in clinical decision support (CDS) tools that integrate with DTx platforms, equipping providers with actionable insights to guide patient care. The success of these partnerships will hinge on DTx companies\u2019 ability to demonstrate the simplicity, scalability, and tangible value of their solutions within the realities of modern clinical practice.\n\nPredictions For Reimbursement Models\n\nReimbursement remains one of the greatest challenges for the DTx industry. However, in July of this year, the CMS introduced a potential new reimbursement pathway for \"digital mental health treatment\" (DMHT) devices and services in its 2025 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule. This marks a monumental milestone for the DTx industry, where insurance companies have yet to offer reimbursement.\n\nThe introduction of three new codes anticipated for 2025 could pave the way for Medicare reimbursement frameworks for the treatment of chronic diseases and other therapeutic areas. This development has the potential to enhance the credibility of digital therapeutics by highlighting their ability to deliver measurable health outcomes. Ideally, it could also encourage the private insurance sector to adopt similar approaches.\n\nThe three proposed codes will reimburse physicians for:\n\nGMBT1: Prescribing FDA-approved DTx devices for mental health\n\nPrescribing FDA-approved DTx devices for mental health GMBT2: The first 20 minutes of managing a patient\u2019s DTx device each month\n\nThe first 20 minutes of managing a patient\u2019s DTx device each month GMBT3: Each additional 20 minutes of management\n\nAI-Driven Innovation\n\nAI and ML will continue to redefine DTx development and delivery in 2025, accelerating innovation and transforming patient outcomes. AI-powered algorithms will enable hyper-personalized interventions in real time, adapting content and strategies based on user data. These advancements will enhance engagement and treatment efficacy, ensuring that patients receive the most effective therapy for their unique needs. At the same time, strong evidence-generation programs will help to differentiate science-backed products from the thousands of digital health products out there that are not based in, or tested by, science.\n\nOn the operational side, we\u2019ll see more sponsors and CROs integrating AI within their everyday workflows. Companies will continue to leverage AI to streamline clinical trial design by identifying ideal patient populations and optimizing study endpoints through predictive analytics, reducing time and costs. AI also has untapped potential to improve diversity in trial populations with natural language processing (NLP) tools to provide translation services, remote monitoring to allow virtual participation, and data-driven site selection to identify sites with specific demographic populations. This sets the stage for developers to demonstrate value to payers by forecasting long-term outcomes and cost savings with greater precision.\n\nA Call To Action For DTx Innovators\n\nTo thrive in 2025, DTx companies must prioritize collaboration with regulators, healthcare providers, and payers. Proactive engagement, combined with a relentless focus on evidence generation and user-centric design, will enable the industry to realize its full potential. By building trust and demonstrating value across stakeholders, DTx has the opportunity to not only transform individual patient care but also redefine how we deliver healthcare on a global scale. The steps we take today will determine how quickly and effectively these innovations can make a lasting impact on patients' lives.\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nAcacia Parks, Ph.D., MBA, who serves as an advisor to Lindus Health, is a digital health executive whose experience revolves around scientific, product, and regulatory strategy for digital therapeutics/software as medical device (SAMD).

Collecting tchotchkes, our ancestors potentially comforting or sheltering one another in the face of a cataclysmic disaster, or building owl toys for children show how caring we can be as a species. However, other findings can reveal our darker side.\n\nThat more bleak part of human nature can be found in the bones uncovered from an archeological site in Charterhouse Warren, Somerset, England. A team recently analyzed over 3,000 bones found there decades ago that date back to the Early Bronze Age. The remains of at least 37 individuals here were killed, butchered, and likely partially eaten before they were thrown down a shaft that is 49-feet-deep. The analysis is detailed in a study published December 15 in the journal Antiquity and represents the largest-scale example of interpersonal violence from British prehistory.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

The bones belonged to a mixture of men, women, and children, which likely means they were representative of a community.\n\nExamples of cranial trauma. Top) perimortem injury to the left posterior of the frontal bone (a), cutmarks can also be seen on the frontal bone (b) and patinated bevel of the internal cranial surface is apparent around the injury (c); middle) cranium with a perforating injury to mid-frontal bone (d), a closer view shows radiating fracture lines (e) and the internal view shows patinated bevel (f ); bottom) adult cranium (g), close inspection shows cutmarks running along the mid-frontal (h) and a perimortem blunt force fracture to the conjoining right frontal bone fragment (i) Images by Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024. CREDIT: Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nSearching for motivation\u2013and a reason for cannibalism\n\nThe skulls have evidence of a violent death from blunt force trauma, unlike the majority of contemporary burials. Researchers from multiple institutions further analyzed the bones to try and learn more about how these people died. They found several cutmarks and fractures that occurred at or near the time of death on the bones. The team believes that this is evidence that they were intentionally butchered and may have been partly consumed.\n\nTo find clues to why people in Early Bronze Age Britain might cannibalize their dead, they looked at the nearby Palaeolithic site of Gough\u2019s Cave in Cheddar Gorge. Evidence uncovered there suggests that cannibalism was likely a funeral rite in the area. However, Charterhouse Warren is a bit different. The evidence of a violent death with no indication of a fight or struggle implies that the victims were caught off guard. The team believes it is likely that they were all massacred and the butchering was done by their enemies.\n\n[ Related: Bronze Age village was \u2018pretty cozy\u2019\u2014until Britain\u2019s Pompeii. ]\n\nAbundant cattle bones have been found mixed in with the human bones suggests that people at Charterhouse Warren probably had enough to eat, so it is unlikely that they were killed strictly for food.\n\nInstead, cannibalism may have been a way to \u201cother\u201d and dehumanize the deceased. The killers were likening their enemies to animals by eating their flesh and mixing their bones in with animal bones.\n\n\u2018People in prehistory could match more recent atrocities\u2019\n\nThe conflict was likely caused by social factors. Theft or insults may have led to tensions which then escalated out of proportion. Additionally, two of the children had evidence of plague in their teeth. The fear of such a deadly illness may have also exacerbated tensions. Scientists at the The Francis Crick Institute found these signs of plague at Charterhouse Warren in a 2023 study and they were a \u201ccompletely unexpected\u201d finding, according to Schulting. However, the team still does not know what\u2013if any\u2013impact plague had on this conflict.\n\nRight hemi-mandible of child aged about 10 years (a) with detail of cutmarks on the ascending ramus (b).

Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nAs a whole, the discovery of such violence at Charterhouse Warren shows that in at least this instance, perceived slights and cycles of revenge could result in violent actions.\n\n\u201cCharterhouse Warren is one of those rare archaeological sites that challenges the way we think about the past,\u201d said Schulting. \u201cIt is a stark reminder that people in prehistory could match more recent atrocities and shines a light on a dark side of human behaviour. That it is unlikely to have been a one-off event makes it even more important that its story is told.\u201d"

            "article_content": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Emergency workers raced on Monday to restore basic services to the French overseas territory of Mayotte, where hundreds or even thousands are feared dead from the most powerful cyclone to hit the Indian Ocean island in nearly a century.\n\nMaritime and aerial operations were underway to transport relief supplies and equipment, French authorities said late on Sunday, after Cyclone Chido slammed into the islands with winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph).\n\n\"The first intervention planes arrive in Mayotte to provide emergency aid in the face of the damage caused by the cyclone. The State is fully mobilised to support the inhabitants of Mayotte in this ordeal,\" Nicolas Daragon, France's minister for everyday security, said on X.\n\nThe extent of casualties and physical damage on the islands, which lie between Madagascar and Mozambique, remained unclear.\n\nThe prefect of Mayotte, Francois-Xavier Bieuville, said on Sunday that the death toll would \"certainly be several hundreds, maybe we will reach a thousand, even several thousands.\"\n\nAuthorities had also established an air bridge between Mayotte and Reunion Island, another French overseas territory on the other side of Madagascar, said Sebastien Lecornu, the French minister of the armed forces.\n\n\"For the accommodation of emergency services, three structures capable of accommodating 150 people are on site, with an additional one currently on its way,\" Lecornu said on X late Sunday, adding that military rations and generators were also being provided.\n\nThe storm was the strongest to strike Mayotte in more than 90 years, the French weather service, Meteo France said. One resident on Sunday likened the scene to a nuclear apocalypse.\n\nThe wreckage of hundreds of makeshift houses was strewn across hillsides, coconut trees had crashed through building roofs and hospital corridors were flooded, according to images from local media and the French gendarmerie.\n\nLocated nearly 8,000 km (5,000 miles) from Paris, Mayotte is a major destination for undocumented immigrants from nearby Comoros. It is significantly poorer than the rest of France and has grappled with gang violence and social unrest for decades.\n\nFrance colonised Mayotte in 1843 and annexed the four large islands of the Comoros archipelago in 1904. The rest of the archipelago voted for independence in a 1974 referendum, but Mayotte decided to remain under French control.\n\n(This story has been refiled to fix the spelling of 'cyclone' in the headline)\n\n(Reporting by Ammu Kannampilly; Editing by Aaron Ross and Lincoln Feast.)"

            "article_content": "Despite pouring vast resources into the war, Mr. Putin still does not control all of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces in Ukraine, which, together with Luhansk, are part of his declared goals. He, too, has begun to outline his terms for a cease-fire \u2014 even as his troops push forward and before he has managed to fully eject Ukrainian troops from the parts of Russia\u2019s Kursk province that they overran in an audacious gambit in August.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s imminent return to the White House has put everyone on notice. Mr. Trump has vowed to end the war quickly and will not lack leverage to do so \u2014 he can halt military aid to Ukraine if it won\u2019t negotiate and increase it if Mr. Putin refuses to come to the table. But, though various proposals for a deal have been floated privately and publicly, it\u2019s not clear that Mr. Trump has a workable plan.\n\nStill, a deal will eventually be done, so it\u2019s time to plan for the postwar phase. Whatever is agreed, Ukraine will continue to adjoin a large and powerful neighbor that could attack again. Talk has therefore turned to security guarantees if Mr. Putin flouts the terms of a political settlement. When Mr. Zelensky met with Mr. Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris this month \u2014 Mr. Zelensky\u2019s first in-person meeting with Mr. Trump since the election \u2014 he apparently used the opportunity to press the importance of such assurances.\n\nHere are four possible scenarios for Ukraine\u2019s future security.\n\nMr. Zelensky wants NATO membership, but this hope will probably remain unfulfilled. Unanimity is required to admit a new member to NATO, and the closest the alliance has come to being of one mind on Ukraine was in 2008, when it announced that Ukraine would join its ranks at some unspecified future date. That vagueness owed to divisions that persist today: At least seven NATO countries are reported to oppose Ukraine\u2019s entry or want to defer it indefinitely, including the United States \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers have said that membership is off the table.\n\nAlternatively, a coalition of the willing could pledge to protect Ukraine. The trouble is that Ukraine will want the United States to be among the guarantors. It views NATO as essentially a U.S. guarantee of protection and won\u2019t consider any coalition reliable unless it\u2019s fortified by American troops and weaponry. Mr. Trump, who seeks not only to end the war without making any promise to protect Ukraine, but also to reduce America\u2019s security commitments in Europe in general, is unlikely to sign off on any such arrangement."

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The death toll in Gaza has been the source of uncertainty, speculation and heated debate. Since Israel unleashed its war machine on the territory from which militant group Hamas launched its lethal strike of Oct. 7, 2023, we have relied upon data provided by Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, whose work counting the dead in previous rounds of conflict was seen as accurate, although it doesn\u2019t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Most humanitarian organizations, the United Nations itself and Israeli-friendly governments, including the Biden administration, have broadly accepted the publicized data as the best measure of what has unfolded over the past 14 months.\n\nIsraeli officials and their supporters abroad scoff at the reported casualty figures in Gaza as the inflated product of Hamas propagandists. They blame Hamas for embedding itself in Gaza\u2019s densely packed neighborhoods. But the undeniable devastation of Gaza and hundreds of documented mass casualty events tell a different story \u2014 one that myriad watchdog groups and human rights organizations are trying to flesh out in greater detail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Airwars, a British-based nonprofit that charts civilian casualties in 21st-century conflicts, put out a report that examined in granular detail the first 25 days of the war in October 2023. It concluded that, in that time period, \u201ccivilian harm in Gaza occurred on a scale unmatched by any conflict\u201d the organization has tracked, which includes the U.S.-led bombing campaigns of the Islamic State-held cities of Mosul and Raqqa.\n\nThe organization said Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza \u201cis incomparable with any 21st century air campaign\u201d and \u201cby far the most intense, destructive, and fatal conflict\u201d it has tracked. In October 2023 alone, Airwars reported, 5,139 civilians were killed in Israeli strikes, 1,900 of them children. The figure is nearly seven times higher than the monthly toll for slain children in any other conflict the group\u2019s researchers have monitored. Out of 606 incidents of civilian harm during October 2023 that Airwars has studied so far, just 26 had clear public evidence of the death of at least one confirmed Palestinian militant. Those 606 are less than a tenth of the more than 7,000 such incidents its researchers have monitored that month.\n\nThe organization is known for its thorough, painstaking approach. Its referrals prompted more than 70 percent of the Pentagon\u2019s investigations into incidents of civilian harm during the U.S.-led air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the case of Gaza, Airwars spent months combing through open-source data on casualties, including the Palestinian national ID numbers of the victims, social media notices, news reports and other information, to build a dataset regarding each casualty incident. The data for October 2023 is available, but it\u2019s continuing the work for the subsequent months of the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe picture that may emerge, the organization said, is grim. \u201cWhile expecting the overall trends to remain, magnitudes of difference \u2014 where measures of civilian harm in Gaza outpace those from previously documented conflicts \u2014 are expected to grow,\u201d Airwars noted in its report.\n\nThe violence has hardly let up. Even as Israel carried out a widespread bombing campaign across Syria and expanded its hold over the contested Golan Heights, it maintained its drumbeat of strikes on Gaza. According to local health authorities, there were five Israeli attacks over the weekend that, collectively, killed at least 46 people. Since October, Israeli operations aimed at uprooting cells of Hamas fighters have further pounded northern areas of the Gaza Strip, flattening neighborhoods and displacing the population that remains multiple times. Rights groups warn of the dire threats facing everyone trapped in the territory as the cold of winter deepens.\n\nHamas endures despite an Israeli campaign in Gaza that has forced some 2 million people from their homes and destroyed most of the territory\u2019s civilian infrastructure, including bakeries, water plants and hospitals. Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries and organized criminal looting have accelerated a hunger crisis, as my colleagues reported, leaving some areas on the brink of famine. The scale of the devastation, the pattern of strikes and the rhetoric of many Israeli politicians all fed into Amnesty International\u2019s declaration earlier this month that Israel had committed \u2014 and was committing \u2014 acts of genocide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsraeli authorities rejected the human rights group\u2019s findings. \u201cThe claims presented in this report are entirely baseless,\u201d the Israeli military said in a statement to The Washington Post. The military said it was \u201cactively working to dismantle Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure while adhering to its obligations under international law.\u201d\n\nThose claims have been challenged in many instances, including through ongoing cases against Israel and its leaders at the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court. The incoming Trump administration appears set to shield Israel from further international censure \u2014 following, in many ways, in the footsteps of its predecessor.\n\nThe Biden administration received nearly 500 reports alleging that Israel used U.S.-supplied weapons for attacks that caused unnecessary harm to civilians in the Gaza Strip, but it has failed to comply with its own policies requiring swift investigations of such claims, my colleagues reported in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ignoring evidence of widespread civilian harm and atrocities to maintain a policy of virtually unconditional weapons transfers to the [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government,\u201d John Ramming Chappell, a legal and policy adviser who focuses on U.S. security assistance and arms sales at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, told my colleagues."

            "article_content": "Industrial output increased 5.4%, keeping momentum as the manufacturing side of the economy continues to outperform consumer spending.\n\nChina\u2019s retail sales growth unexpectedly weakened in November despite signs of improvement in the housing market, highlighting the urgency for Beijing to further encourage residents to spend.\n\nRetail sales rose 3% from a year ago, the slowest pace in three months and undershooting even the most bearish of forecasts. Industrial output increased 5.4%, keeping momentum as the manufacturing side of the economy continues to outperform consumer spending.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\u201cThe data show that the recovery in domestic demand has remained sluggish, while the stabilization in industrial production was likely due to some order front-loading ahead of US tariffs and is not sustainable,\u201d said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA.\n\nThe CSI 300 Index of onshore stocks fell after the data release to trade as much as 0.6% lower. The benchmark 10-year yield extended a decline, falling 6 basis points on the day to a record low of 1.72%. The yuan was steady in both onshore and offshore markets.\n\nThe data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday underscores the need for Beijing to reignite consumers\u2019 willingness to spend, especially after the reelection of Donald Trump as US president. The threat of a new trade war may diminish exports\u2019 role as a growth driver after contributing to nearly a quarter of economic expansion this year.\n\nThe weakening in retail sales was surprising following strong sales of home appliances and cars a month ago thanks to government subsidies. While sales for those two categories remained strong in November, a number of discretionary goods recorded a slump. Cosmetics led the decline with a 26% plunge in sales from a year ago, while those of clothing, jewelry, beverages and tobacco and alcohol also decreased.\n\nThe disappointing consumption figures overshadowed signs of improvement in the troubled property market. Price declines eased for a third month in November, reflecting the effect of policy stimulus introduced in late September including lower taxes related to transactions.\n\nHome sales grew in year-on-year terms in November for the first time since the economy re-opened in the first quarter of 2023 from Covid lockdowns, based on Bloomberg Economics\u2019 calculation of official data. Floor space sold in November rose 2.7% from a year ago following a 1.8% decline in October.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nNBS spokesperson Fu Linghui attributed some of the slowdown to the fact that the Singles\u2019 Day online shopping festival \u2014 traditionally held on Nov. 11 each year \u2014 started earlier than usual in October this year, which squeezed sales last month.\n\n\u201cLooking at the overall retail sales in October and November, it was still significantly better than that in the third quarter,\u201d Fu said in a press briefing in Beijing. \u201cBut the internal drive of consumption growth still needs to be strengthened.\u201d\n\nThe data came just days after Chinese policymakers elevated boosting consumption to the top priority for economic work next year, only the second time in at least a decade. They listed a few areas of focus including helping lower-income groups and improving the social safety net, although Chinese leaders left investors guessing on the scale and specifics of their plans.\n\nOfficials have said they will expand the cash-for-clunker program that subsidizes purchases of home appliances and cars with central government funds this year. But economists warned the effect may be temporary because consumers are unlikely to repeat large-ticket purchases in a short period of time. The government has resisted proposals from economists to hand out cash to consumers in recent years, with President Xi Jinping warning against falling into a trap of \u201cwelfarism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big picture remains the supply-demand imbalance, which still points to a deflationary outlook,\u201d Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.\n\nThe growth in industrial production has outperformed retail sales since the pandemic, but this may not be a sustainable way to propel the economy as Beijing\u2019s manufacturing push has seen the US and European Union accuse China of flooding their markets with cheap goods.\n\nA slowdown of economic expansion in the last quarter to the weakest since early 2023 has prompted policymakers to deliver out-sized interest-rate cuts and support for the property and stock markets. Authorities also rolled out a $1.4 trillion debt swap program to curb debt risks faced by local authorities and free up fiscal room for them to promote growth.\n\nGovernments at all levels accelerated bond sales in recent months, with net financing exceeding 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) for four straight months through November. China has promised to increase public borrowing and spending next year to stimulate demand, but the scale of increase is likely to remain modest and not aggressive enough to reverse persisting deflation and dwindling confidence.\n\nChina\u2019s retail sales data show private demand remain frail and the stimulus efforts have \u201cprioritized optics over delivering meaningful economic improvements,\u201d said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.\n\nThis means the government \u201cneeds to do more target fiscal measures to help boost business and consumer confidence. Even for a tactical recovery we need more after a series of false starts and the risk of tariffs ahead.\u201d"

            "article_content": "While members of the 118th Congress will be finished with their lame-duck session this week, lawmakers have yet to release or vote on a year-end legislation package.\n\nAlthough recent negotiations have included funding for the federal government, a Farm Bill extension, economic assistance for agriculture producers and natural disaster recovery aid, Congressional leadership has signaled that the package does not currently include economic assistance.\n\nIn response to this development, the following national ag leaders have issued the following statements over the weekend:\n\nTed McKinney, CEO of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA):\n\n\u201cFarmers and ranchers are encountering tremendous pressures under high input costs, elevated interest costs, deeply depressed commodity futures markets and poor local cash markets. Additionally, they have experienced powerful headwinds, ranging from extreme weather to uncertain global demand to supply chain disruptions. NASDA calls on Congress to put politics aside and find a resolution that provides the necessary economic aid and disaster assistance for the farmers and ranchers who work every day to provide food security to our country while also feeding the world.\u201d\n\nZippy Duvall, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF):\n\n\u201cAt a time when farm income is in a downward spiral and costs are rising, it\u2019s unacceptable for Congress to turn its back on farmers. Farmers don\u2019t get to set the prices for their goods and right now those prices don\u2019t even come close to covering their costs. We lost 141,000 farms in five years and if Congress fails to include economic aid for farmers, the sad reality is that we\u2019ll lose more.\n\n\u201cOur whole country will suffer the consequences if Congress takes farmers and our food supply for granted. For this reason, I call on members of Congress who represent agriculture to stand with farmers by insisting the supplemental spending bill include economic aid for farmers and voting it down if it doesn\u2019t. In truth, every elected leader who enjoys our affordable and abundant food supply represents agriculture, so I urge them to band together and ensure farmers are supported.\n\n\u201cNearly 80% of Americans believe lawmakers should prioritize legislation that supports farmers and ranchers so it\u2019s just plain unacceptable that our elected leaders are considering putting politics first. I hope reasonable members of Congress take a stand for the good folks who stock their pantries.\u201d\n\nKenneth Hartman Jr, President of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA):\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that congressional leadership appears to be at an impasse over crucial economic assistance for farmers in an end-of-the-year legislative package. Corn growers are faced with low prices and high input costs and economic aid would provide them with critical relief during challenging economic times.\n\n\u201cWhile these developments are disheartening, we call on Congress to resume negotiations and pass legislation that includes economic assistance while there is still time.\u201d\n\nCaleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA):\n\n\u201cWe urge congressional leadership to return to the negotiating table and find a path forward. A package that does not include both economic and disaster assistance for our farmers who have suffered significantly from unforgiving market conditions, disastrous weather phenomena and for many, a combination of both, simply does not meet the mark for what agriculture and specifically, our soy growers, need. We will oppose any supplemental spending package that does not provide meaningful assistance to farmers who need help now to stay afloat in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nChandler Goule, CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG):\n\n\u201cNAWG opposes any continued resolution that does not include economic assistance for farmers. We are disappointed that leaders in Congress couldn\u2019t find common ground to provide relief to farmers experiencing a financial crisis and urge them to continue working on a package that meets the needs of rural America. Wheat growers have seen their prices drop by over 36 percent since the 2022/23 marketing year and need the certainty an economic assistance package can provide before the end of the year. Period. Congress has already failed to pass a robust farm bill, and the lack of leadership in reaching an agreement will continue to hurt farmers who feed America and the world.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The Organised Private Sector has joined the call on the Central Bank of Nigeria to address the cash scarcity witnessed nationwide, stressing that the country is not developed enough for cashless transactions.\n\nMembers of the OPS pointed out that the scarcity of cash has adversely affected businesses, especially those in the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises category, as they expressed fears of an imminent collapse of MSMEs.\n\n\u201cWhile the intent may have been to modernise the financial system and promote cashless transactions, the reality is that these policies have inadvertently stiffened business operations across the country,\u201d the National Vice President of the Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists, Segun Kuti-George, said.\n\nKuti-George noted, \u201cNigeria\u2019s economy is not yet developed enough to function effectively on a predominantly cashless basis. A significant portion of the population still relies heavily on cash for daily transactions.\n\n\u201cWhile the cash scarcity has encouraged some adoption of electronic payment methods, it is not sufficient to address the broader economic needs. The adverse impact on businesses and individuals remains severe.\u201d\n\nHe explained that even in advanced economies like the United States and European nations, cash remains an accessible option.\n\n\u201cThis is supported by higher levels of financial literacy and efficient systems for online transactions. In Canada, for instance, one can withdraw up to $1,500 in a single ATM transaction. Comparatively, Nigeria\u2019s withdrawal limit of N20,000 (approximately $26) per transaction is impractical and reflects a lack of consideration for the needs of businesses and individuals.\n\n\u201cThese restrictions undermine the economy and highlight systemic challenges in understanding and implementing policies that align with the realities of the population. A more balanced approach is needed, one that gradually transitions the economy towards cashless transactions without disrupting livelihoods or stifling business growth.\n\n\u201cThe path forward should involve greater financial inclusion, improved infrastructure for electronic payments, and policy adjustments that reflect the economic realities of Nigeria\u2019s diverse population.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the National President of the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Dr Femi Egbesola, said the naira scarcity hurts the macro, micro, and small businesses that are largely cash-dependent.\n\nHe said, \u201cMany in this sector sell small-sized products for as low as N50, N100, and N200 that are wholly transacted with cash. Many of these businesses now find it hard to survive with the cash crunch. Another negative outcome of the scarcity is that it discourages small business owners from banking, thereby reducing financial inclusion and increasing financial insecurity associated with carrying cash.\n\n\u201cSome have resorted to buying cash from POS operators at higher costs, resulting either in depleting their profits or leading to increasing the prices of their wares, and this eventually leads to low sales. The majority of the MSMEs still operate in the informal sector and as such are largely dependent on cash transactions.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent then, that CBN responds swiftly to arrest this anomaly before it impedes more negatively on micro and small businesses to the extent of extinction of a substantial fraction of the sector. Hence, if not arrested fast, the wholesale negative effects would become very pronounced on the economy soon.\u201d\n\nThe Director of the Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, told The PUNCH that the present cash scarcity risks a slowdown of business activities in the country.\n\nYusuf explained that the cash scarcity was particularly not good for Nigeria\u2019s highly informal sector, saying \u201cThe major effects of the cash scarcity on business is that it slows down the velocity and the volume of business transactions, especially at the informal sector level and micro-enterprise level in our rural areas because these are segments of the economy that uses a lot of cash.\n\n\u201cIn the cities, I imagine that the use of electronic payments is very high for retail transactions. But in many of our rural areas, the use of cash is huge.\n\nThe CPPE president cautioned against the dangers of cash flow disruption, adding \u201cSince cash is a means of payment, once there is a disruption in the flow of cash, it affects the payment system and therefore affects the flow and the velocity of transactions.\n\n\u201cEconomic activities are affected and that is not good for any economy. (This is) because you want economic activities to be seamless and you need a very efficient payment system to make that happen. And cash, of course, is a means of payment. So that is the negative effect it has on the economy.\u201d\n\nYusuf also outlined factors worsening the cash scarcity crisis, including low financial inclusion and lowered trust in commercial banks, noting \u201cThere is also the issue of low level of financial inclusion. Even though we have made progress in that, I must confess that there is still a lot more to do.\n\n\u201cThen lately there has been a breach of confidence, if I may put it that way, concerning some online transactions because of the failure of some of the banks\u2019 apps which affected quite many people and created a trust problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the economist, the use of online transactions or electronic payment systems is a function of trust.\n\nHe explained further: \u201cSo if anything happens to undermine that trust, a lot of people may stay away from it. There are quite many people who are yet to recover from the disruptions that happened about a month ago with some of the major banks concerning the electronic payment system.\n\n\u201cOnce people have one experience, because of that, they may shy away completely from the use of online transactions and decide to go purely for cash.\u201d\n\nYusuf stressed the importance of maintaining the trust customers have in banks to dispense cash as well as improving literacy in cash-heavy rural areas.\n\nHe emphasised, \u201cThe ability to continue to sustain the confidence of citizens in the payment system is extremely very important. Because once anything goes wrong, it has a far-reaching implication for the use of online payments. And once that happens, a lot of people will move to the use of cash.\n\n\u201cThen there is also the level of literacy. The level of literacy is still very low largely in our rural areas. And that affects the enthusiasm about the use of online transactions. So such people prefer and are more confident with the use of cash.\u201d\n\nFurther, the CPPE director pointed out the negative impact of money laundering on cash scarcity, remarking, \u201cThere is the problem of money laundering. A lot of corruption activities are done in cash which could also affect the demand for cash and if the total supply has not increased, then there may be scarcity.\n\nYusuf added that the business model of Point of Sale operators which presently competes with commercial banks for cash is a net negative for sufficient cash circulation in the economy.\n\nThe economist noted that there were over three million POS operators in the economy who \u201cRather than wait for depositors to bring cash to them like the banks would do, go to retail outlets to buy cash.\n\n\u201cSo cash is not flowing to the banking system as it used to, because the banks now have a major competitor in the POS operators.\u201d\n\nThe economist acknowledged a higher percentage of cash resided with the POS operators who do business with them.\n\n\u201cThey buy the cash and they dispense cash at a commission,\u201d Yusuf asserted. \u201cThat (POS business) has added a completely new dimension to the dynamics around cash management and cash availability in the economy. Because as of October, for instance, we had cash currency in circulation, I\u2019m talking of currency outside the banking system of about N4.3tn.\u201d\n\nYusuf exclaimed that with N4.3tn in circulation, there should be sufficient cash but for the drop in confidence, money laundering issues, and emerging money-buying POS business.\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH, the Director-General of the Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association, Mr Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, described the cash scarcity in Nigeria as a double-edged sword.\n\nOyerinde noted that while it could accelerate the shift towards a cashless economy, it poses significant challenges for micro, small, and medium enterprises and the informal sector, which heavily rely on cash transactions for their daily operations.\n\nAccording to Oyerinde, \u201cThe current cash scarcity is a double-edged sword. While it could foster a faster evolution of the much-touted cashless economy, it also portends a great challenge to MSMEs and the informal sector.\u201d\n\nHe added that balancing this transition is critical to ensuring inclusive growth and economic stability.\n\nWhile decrying the devaluation of the naira, the President of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture, Dele Oye, said the lack of confidence in the naira was part of its scarcity.\n\nHe said, \u201cNobody is holding naira, everybody is holding a dollar, this is why nobody goes to the bank to withdraw naira because they put all their money in dollars. This is why the naira has to become stabilised. If it continues to appreciate, that is fine. However, the Central Bank of Nigeria has not told us the fundamentals of why we should trust the naira. Until they carry us along, we cannot know what is happening.\n\n\u201cThe CBN is not engaging stakeholders, it may be the end of the year if they want to show that they have performed. The Central Bank of Nigeria needs to engage and listen more to the stakeholders. They should not only listen to the banks or talk to the banks, they need to also talk to people who utilise those banks, like what are our impressions of the services? How do their monetary policies affect us? This lack of stakeholder engagement is a big problem.\n\nOye explained that the consequence is for investors to invest in other countries due to the lack of uncertainty in Nigeria.\n\nCBN fines banks\n\nThe CBN is making efforts to tackle the cash scarcity, as it announced a fine of N150m per branch on Deposit Money Banks found guilty of facilitating the illegal flow of mint naira notes to currency hawkers and unscrupulous agents.\n\nThe apex bank disclosed this in a circular issued on December 13, 2024, signed by the acting Director of the Currency Operations Department, Mohammed Olayemi.\n\nThe circular revealed that the CBN is concerned about the increasing prevalence of mint naira notes being traded by hawkers, a practice the bank described as impeding efficient and effective cash distribution to customers and the general public.\n\nThe circular, which referred to an earlier directive dated November 13, 2024, highlighted the apex bank\u2019s determination to address the commodification of the naira.\n\nUnder the directive, any branch of a financial institution found culpable will face a penalty of N150m for the first violation.\n\nSubsequent infractions, the CBN warned, would attract stricter sanctions under the provisions of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act 2020.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the apex bank stated that it would increase periodic spot checks in banking halls and ATMs while deploying mystery shoppers to uncover illicit cash hawking spots across the country.\n\nThe PUNCH earlier reported that the CBN issued a stern warning to Deposit Money Banks over cash hoarding and diversion, stating that such actions will attract stiff penalties.\n\nIn a circular dated November 13, 2024, signed by the Acting Director of Currency Operations, Muhammad Olayemi, and released by the CBN, the apex bank announced intensified measures to ensure efficient and transparent cash disbursement.\n\nThe CBN reminded banks of its ongoing mystery shopping exercises and spot checks aimed at discouraging the abuse of naira notes and ensuring responsible distribution of cash, especially as the festive season approaches.\n\nAccording to the circular, the initiatives are designed to prevent the flow of newly minted banknotes to hawkers and support efficient cash disbursement to the public.\n\nThe central bank stated that any DMB traced to seized cash from unauthorised hawkers would face financial penalties.\n\nSuch banks will be fined 10 per cent of the total value of cash withdrawn from the CBN on the day the offence was committed. Repeat offenders will incur an additional five per cent penalty for each subsequent breach.\n\nThe CBN also warned against cash hoarding, diversion, and other practices that hinder cash flow, stressing that such actions violate the Clean Note Policy. It noted that defaulters would face appropriate sanctions, which may include additional fines or other regulatory actions."

            "article_content": "8.6 / 10\n\nSCORE Origin Eon17-X v2 $3,568 at Origin PC Pros Beautiful 4K display with DCI-P3 support looks sharp and saturated\n\nIncredible general and gaming performance\n\nRGB keyboard paired with a gigantic trackpad feels great to use Cons 17.3-inch laptop is extremely heavy\n\nFan noise is distractingly loud\n\nDisplay is great but not an OLED\n\nIf you want the best gaming laptop you can buy, then you must be ready to subject your wallet to some horrors. Your ears, too, in the case of the Origin PC Eon17-X v2. This formidable gaming machine costs a fortune and demands headphones, thanks to its very loud (though very capable) fans that start blasting air over its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU even before your favorite game's introductory cutscene gets a chance to load.\n\nAt more than $3,500 after a substantial discount, the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 is one of the more expensive gaming laptops we've tested recently, but it's not the fastest. The Alienware M18 R2 still holds that title, but the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 still offers plenty of 3D muscle -- and it has the better display of the two in the form of a 4K, 144Hz panel.\n\nIf you build the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 to the exact specs of the Alienware M18 R2 we tested, it costs about $250 more, which is a reasonable sum for the superior display. Alienware's 18-inch monster is still the one to beat in terms of raw performance, but the Origin's 4K display is super sharp and saturated, and the laptop can easily dish out triple-digit frame rates for today's demanding titles at their highest quality settings.\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 Price as reviewed $3,568 Display size/resolution 17.3-inch 3,840x2,160 144Hz IPS LCD CPU Intel Core i9-14900HX Memory 64GB LPDDR5-4800 Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Storage Two, 2TB SSD Ports Thunderbolt 5 (x2), USB-C 3.2 Gen1, USB-A 3.2 Gen1 (x2), HDMI 2.1, Mini DisplayPort 1.4, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, combo audio Networking Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 Operating system Windows 11 Home 24H2 Weight 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg)\n\nConfiguration options are plentiful\n\nSince Origin is a boutique PC builder, its laptops are customizable, and it gives you a good amount of leeway to adjust your system to your exact needs and budget -- and you can really push the limit for the latter. The Eon17-X v2 laptop we reviewed costs an eye-opening $3,568, and that's after Origin's $700 discount. But the system builder doesn't slouch on parts; you're getting some of the best components you can stuff into a 17-inch gaming behemoth.\n\nOur laptop came with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, which has a whopping 24 cores and 32 threads and runs at 2.2GHz by default (with its turbo clock boost maxing out at 5.8GHz). The CPU is paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, which ensures that even opening a web browser has a decent chance of making the laptop sound like a passenger jet at takeoff.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOur test system also included a near-overkill 64GB of DDR5-4800 memory and 4 terabytes of storage (split across two 2TB SSDs). That's the most memory offered, but far from the most storage, with 4TB and 8TB drives also available and three total M.2 slots.\n\nYou can choose from one of two 17.3-inch displays: a 2,560x1,440-pixel panel with a 240Hz refresh rate or a 3,840x2,160, 144Hz screen. The former locks you into an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, whereas the latter is the only option for the faster RTX 4090 GPU. We received the latter. It's a better setup, but it'll cost you an extra $523 from the laptop's base configuration.\n\nOrigin also offers custom UV prints for the top of the laptop, a $30 upgrade that's nice to have if one of the 19 designs really catches your eye. You can also send in your own custom art to print, but that's a $140 charge. This level of customization isn't offered by a more conventional manufacturer like Dell, but I'd recommend going with a lighter print than a darker one. The Starfield print on the laptop I reviewed looked quite a bit murkier in person compared with the bright, beautiful image on Origin's site.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 performance\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 is a beast in size and performance. Across the board, it delivered scores and frame rates on our benchmarks that were competitive with the highest-performing laptops we've tested, the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16, each of which features the same CPU/GPU duo in the Core i9-14900HX and RTX 4090.\n\nOn Geekbench 6, the Eon17-X v2 put out single- and multicore scores that were in line with those of the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16. It had the fastest single-core score of the three, and its multicore score was 4% slower than the Alienware M18 R2's. It fell back a bit on our Cinebench 2024 tests, especially on the multicore CPU test, where it was 33% slower than the Alienware M18 R2.\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 performed well on our 3D graphics and gaming tests, but it still trailed the Alienware and Razer. I checked to make sure thermal throttling wasn't to blame for the Origin's consistent third-place finishes of this trio since all three laptops share the same CPU and GPU configuration. When I repeated our Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark back to back to back, the average temperature of the laptop's CPU and GPU was under 80 degrees Celsius the entire time, which I expected given how much fan noise the laptop puts out. That's a great reading, since you may start to experience performance drops as you inch closer to triple-digits.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nBig, bulky and beautiful\n\nThe Origin Eon17-X v2 is not the laptop to buy for your daily commute, both due to its weight (7.5 pounds) and the fact that you'll enrage everyone on your train or subway with its noise once you fire up a game. It's a great desk companion that feels incredibly sturdy and solid to use, and its 17.3-inch display is big enough to make your games feel immersive and fun.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe huge footprint, including a near-1-inch thickness, provides plenty of room for both a regular keyboard and numpad. While they're centered on the laptop's palm rest, the laptop's gigantic touchpad (at 6 inches wide by just over 3.5 inches tall) is centered below the regular keyboard. This feels slightly awkward, as your left hand is a bit cramped for space when you rest it on the lower-left side of the laptop's palm rest, whereas your right has plenty of room. And this design puts your hands slightly off-center from the screen, which feels a little wonky.\n\nThe keys themselves are incredibly comfortable to type on, with great travel (and resistance) for everything from casual gaming to first-person shooters. They light up, too, but you have to use Origin's Control Center app to manage your look; you can't adjust the colors using Function key shortcuts, including their brightness. It's a bit annoying to have to launch an app when you want to make modifications on the fly, and while the app lets you change the backlight color of any individual key or pick from one of nine preset effects that apply to all your keys at once, it's not as comprehensive as what you might get with most gaming keyboards.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nParent company Corsair and its iCUE software allows for a lot more creativity, but that doesn't work on Origin's laptop. With Origin's Control Center, you can't, for example, create your own effects or patterns, set up reactive lighting for games, or import color profiles.\n\nThe laptop's touchpad, though huge, is much more responsive toward its bottom than its top. You really have to push to register a click within an inch of the touchpad's top, which is annoying but not uncommon on a mechanical touchpad. I dislike that the laptop's arrow keys -- typically critical for gaming -- bleed right into its numpad. It's an awkward design to have the right arrow sit directly below the laptop's 1 key, and I question the usefulness of the numpad, in general, on a gaming laptop.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nI was slightly concerned that the laptop's vents, located on the upper half of its left and right sides, would cause some unpleasant hand-warming during game sessions. My fears were unfounded; the laptop's loud cooling system is nothing if not effective. Fan noise may be ever-present and thunderous, but I had no issues gaming on a couch. It's much more comfortable, however, to plop the heavy laptop on a desk than on your lap.\n\nMinor shortcomings aside, the Eon17-X v2 is built like a tank. Its downward-facing speakers, which sit on the laptop's bottom (closest to your lap), sound decent, with bass ever-so-slightly better than the meh quality most laptops dish out. They give you a pleasant, enveloping sound when you're checking out an errant TikTok or YouTube video, but there's absolutely no way you're going to use these for gaming. You're going to need to budget for a headset, possibly even noise-canceling, with this beast.\n\nMassive 17-inch 4K display\n\nThe 17.3-inch display isn't an OLED, which is a letdown, given the laptop's price and noteworthy specs, but having a huge, gorgeous 4K display is nothing to be sad about. The display -- presumably IPS, though Origin doesn't detail this anywhere -- supports both the DCI-P3 and regular sRGB color spaces. Though folks who prefer color accuracy above all else might not care for the overly saturated look of DCI-P3, it makes games, movies and pictures absolutely pop. Unfortunately, the display doesn't support HDR, so you don't get those superrich scenes and dark-as-night black levels you might otherwise find on your living-room TV.\n\nThe laptop's white levels hit 30 nits at its lowest brightness setting and an impressive 556 nits at its highest. You should have few, if any, issues seeing the screen in daylight, even if you're unlikely to commute with it because of its heft. The minimum luminance is right in the sweet spot: not too dim to look bad but not too bright to cause annoyance to those who are particularly sensitive when staring at screens all day long.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe laptop's 4K resolution is a great fit for its humongous screen, making everything look sharp and crisp. I had as much fun (as one possibly can) mucking around in spreadsheets and Google Docs as I did gaming on the Eon17-X v2, and I would absolutely use this laptop as my daily driver -- just at my desk, not carried around my house.\n\nTo that point, it's also great that the laptop, big as it is, comes with a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity (supporting 160Hz-wide wireless channels for those of you living far away from any neighbors). I don't foresee moving it around very much, so it's great that you can hardwire yourself into blazing speeds on your home network, especially if you're rocking a higher-than-gigabit setup. The rest of the laptop's ports cover all the bases, from USB-A and USB-C to HDMI and DisplayPort -- no issues there. The most noteworthy inclusion among the ports are the two USB-C ports that offer the latest Thunderbolt 5 connectivity.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nIs the Origin Eon17-X v2 gaming laptop worth it?\n\nMy only qualm with the Eon17-X v2 is that it's very expensive for the performance it delivers. If you build Alienware's M18 R2 with the same specs as this Origin laptop, you're already saving around $250 (limited-time discounts notwithstanding) for a system that's a step faster for gaming by a not-so-insignificant amount (though it lacks a 4K screen). Match an Eon17-X v2 configuration to the M18 R2 that we reviewed, and it's the same deal: Origin's system costs around $250 more, but you get a much better, if slightly smaller, display.\n\nIf all you care about are frame rates, Alienware's M18 R2 remains the gaming laptop to beat. But for an overall experience, especially when you can find it on sale, Origin's Eon17-X v2 wins out for its superior display and slightly better customizability when you're building the laptop to begin with. Resist the urge to configure more laptop than you really need, and it's worth the extra cost you'll pay for everyday use.\n\nHide our expert take Photo Gallery 1/1 How we test computers Photo Gallery 1/1 The review process for laptops, desktops, tablets and other computerlike devices consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our expert reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments. The list of benchmarking software we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. The most important core tests we're currently running on every compatible computer include Primate Labs Geekbench 6, Cinebench R23, PCMark 10 and 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra.

            "article_content": "A woman made a 'mind blowing' revelation about UK number plates that left her - and countless others - stunned.\n\nWhile most drivers might view registration plates as little more than a jumble of letters and numbers, it turns out they hold a lot more information than meets the eye.\n\nCourtney Wright, a mum and TikTok user posting under the handle @courtneywrightxxx, shared her discovery in a viral clip, admitting that she was shocked to learn what the letters on car's number plates really mean.\n\n\"I've just learnt something new this morning. I actually can't believe it,\" she said in the video. \"Apparently, the first two letters on your number plate - so, like, my old car was MV - mean that car was registered in Manchester.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"They all have different codes, so it goes from MA to M- whatever, and that's all from Manchester.\"\n\nCourtney went on to explain: \"The first two letters actually mean something. You've got where the car was registered, the year it was registered, and then just a random sequence. I'm literally mind blown.\"\n\nHer video has since sparked a flurry of comments, with other people either sharing her amazement or confessing they had no idea about the system themselves.\n\nOne user wrote: \"How did I not know this? Mind blown too,\" while another joked: \"I've been driving for years, and this just made me feel like I missed an entire class on life.\"\n\nWhat do UK number plates actually mean?\n\nIf you've ever wondered about the seemingly random assortment of characters on UK number plates, Jon Kirkbright, the sales director of Private Number Plates, broke it down.\n\nAdvert\n\nCourtney shared her discover with TikTok (TikTok/@courtneywrightxxx)\n\nSpeaking to Diamond Advanced Motorists last year, Jon said: \"To the untrained eye, number plates may look like a random combination of letters and numbers.\n\n\"While many people are aware that the numbers indicate the year the car was made and registered, fewer people realise that the letters better them serve as 'regional identifiers.' These refer to the DVLA office where the car was registered.\"\n\nFor instance, plates beginning with MV, MA, or MB originate from the Manchester and Merseyside region, LA, LB, LV, etc., are assigned to London and BA, BB and BC indicate registration in Birmingham.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"This may be why your number plates start with the same letters if you buy more than one car from the same dealership - it's not just a coincidence,\" Jon added.\n\nWhat are the rules around private plates?\n\nFor those with private plates, the rules are a little stricter. Jon highlighted that while it's legal to make a car seem older using a dateless plate, it's illegal to make it look newer.\n\nEach car's number plate are assigned to where the car was registered (Getty stock image)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"For example, you cannot put an '11' number plate on a car registered in 2007,\" he said. \"It is an offence to misrepresent the registration in any way.\"\n\nThose wanting to hide the age of their car often opt for dateless plates, which allow for complete customisation while avoiding this issue.\n\nIf you're curious about your own car's registration, you can find a full list of regional number plate identifiers online - and join the ranks of those whose minds have been well and truly blown by the hidden meaning behind UK plates."

While the FBI and Home Security authorities have claimed the flying objects pose no threat to national security, conspiracy theorists are rushing ahead with absurd stories of alien invasion, government plots and foreign threats read more\n\nThis photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, New Jersey, on Thursday, December 5, 2024. AP\n\nOver the US East Coast, a swarm of drones is lighting up the night sky, raising serious concerns and causing confusion.\n\nConspiracy theorists are rushing ahead with absurd claims of alien invasions, political meddling, and foreign threats due to mysterious flying objects.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nWhat do we know about drone sightings in the US?\n\nThere has been a trail of confusion and fear following reports of the mysterious drone sightings in at least six states: New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Virginia.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration reports that the drone sightings started on November 18 in the area of Morris County, New Jersey. Paul Kanitra, a Republican in the New Jersey Assembly, told CNN that since then, drone sightings have occurred every night. They have been observed over significant structures, restricted areas, and residential neighbourhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrones were seen over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf property in Bedminster and close to the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research centre, raising concerns, according to state politicians and military authorities.\n\nAt least one airport, Stewart International Airport in New York, temporarily closed its runways for around an hour on Friday night due to the alleged drone activity.\n\n\u201cThis has gone too far,\u201d New York Governor Kathy Hochul said on Saturday, adding last month she \u201cdirected the New York State Intelligence Centre to actively investigate drone sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address this issue.\u201d\n\nWhat are the authorities saying?\n\nThe sightings have put intense pressure on federal agencies to provide more information about the aircraft.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, addressed the matter on Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week, becoming the first official to do so on camera. \u201cI want to assure the American public that we are on it.\u201d\n\nHe added the federal government is \u201cdeploying additional resources, personnel, and technology\u201d to address the aerial drones.\n\nNeither President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken on the issue in public.\n\nHowever, a number of elected lawmakers and local leaders in New Jersey and along the East Coast have demanded that the flying objects be investigated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul called for increased federal intervention.\n\n\u201cIn response to my calls for additional resources, our federal partners are deploying a state-of-the-art drone detection system to New York State,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. \u201cThis system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigations.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed this call for action, demanding answers. \u201cI\u2019m pushing for answers amid these drone sightings,\u201d he said, noting that it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that the public still had more questions than answers.\n\nIn New York and New Jersey, Schumer has called for the deployment of \u201cspecial detecting systems,\u201d such as Robin Radar systems as they have a better chance of detecting drones because of their \u201c360-degree technology.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA drone detecting device has been deployed, Connecticut State Police stated Friday, to aid with the investigation of unauthorised drone sightings reported over Fairfield County.\n\nAccording to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, his administration is \u201caware of\u201d and taking seriously reports of drone sightings.\n\nAccording to the Democratic governor, on Friday night, he gave the Pennsylvania State Police instructions to look into the sightings more closely. Police will use helicopters to try to \u201cdetermine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are.\u201d\n\nIs it a threat to national security?\n\nNo.\n\nThe FBI and DHS said in a joint statement on Thursday, saying there is \u201cno evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDHS secretary Mayorkas said, \u201cIt is our job to be vigilant. If there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity we will communicate with the American public accordingly. Right now we are not aware of any.\"\n\nNew York State Police said Friday afternoon, in a post on X, they had received \u201cnumerous reports of drone sightings over the past 24 hours\u201d and they were investigating the reports.\n\n\u201cWe have no evidence at this time that any of the reported sightings pose a public safety threat.\u201d\n\nDoes it represent a foreign threat?\n\nNo.\n\nJim Himes, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on Fox News on Sunday, and said, \u201cThere are a lot of us who are pretty frustrated right now,\u201d Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, told Fox. \u201cThe answer \u2018we don\u2019t know\u2019 is not a good enough answer when people are anxious, when they are nervous, and this has been true since we\u2019ve been a species on this planet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople will fill a vacuum with their fears and anxieties,\u201d Himes said, adding, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s an Iranian mothership hovering off the coast of Asbury Park!\"\n\n\u201cLet me say something I know with confidence: It is not the Iranians, it is not the Chinese. They aren\u2019t Martians.\u201d\n\nPentagon Spokesperson Sabrina Singh addressed the allegations, saying, \u201cThere is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there\u2019s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.\u201d\n\nWhat are the floating conspiracy theories?\n\nAlthough these instances have been brushed off as non-threatening by federal agencies, the internet is overflowing with wilder theories.\n\nOne of the most prominent is comedian Roseanne Barr, who links mysterious drones to Project Blue Beam, a decades-old conspiracy theory made popular by Infowars founder Alex Jones. According to this theory, the government is getting ready to launch a fictitious alien invasion to impose authoritarian authority and widespread terror on the population.\n\nResearcher Dr. Steven Greer Accurately Predicted The Rollout Of Project Blue Beam That's Happening Now\n\n\n\nWATCH/SHARE THE LIVE X STREAM HERE:https://t.co/iRbKT1cEXq pic.twitter.com/3n27ycFglz \u2014 Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) December 11, 2024\n\n\u201cNow you see why I mention Project Blue Beam every week on my podcast,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday, fanning the flames of paranoia.\n\nKnown for supporting conspiracies, Jones last week endorsed Project Blue Beam in a conversation with Dr. Steven Greer, a urologist. According to Greer, the world\u2019s elites are planning to use disasters, such as a fake alien invasion, to gain control of the planet.\n\n\u201cThey all have this agenda to want to control the world through one calamity after the other, and the big one they\u2019ve been planning is the hoax of an alien threat from outer space,\u201d Greer warned on the show.\n\nOn the other hand, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, known for making controversial statements, claimed that the government is hiding the facts. \u201cThe government is in control of the drones and refuses to tell the American people what is going on. It really is that bad,\u201d Greene wrote on X.\n\nIn another one, Greene endorsed an idea that drones could be part of a military training programme, perhaps preparing for drone warfare in the future.\n\n\u201cHowever, the government needs to come clean and tell the American people what is going on. That\u2019s the most infuriating part to me,\u201d she added.\n\nMatt Walsh, a Daily Wire commenter, said that the drones might be the result of alien activity, which fuelled followers\u2019 further theories.\n\nSo, what exactly are the flying objects?\n\nAccording to the FBI and DHS, the majority of drone sightings are thought to be cases of \u201cmistaken identity,\u201d whereby members of the public mistakenly identify small, lawfully functioning manned aircraft as drones.\n\nMayorkas told CNN on Friday that some of the sightings might potentially be commercial drones.\n\n\u201cWe know of no threat or nefarious activity,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cIf we learn of any cause for concern, we will be transparent in our communication of it.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, many people own drones, which are an umbrella term for unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nThe FAA has registered 791,597 drones in total, about equally split between commercial and recreational use.\n\nThey are used in a number of fields, including as law enforcement, agriculture, and photography.\n\nAn FBI official reaffirmed during a news briefing on Saturday that the majority of the sightings were manned aircraft that were misidentified as drones. The officer noted that the visual sightings reported to tip lines reflected similar flight approach trends from neighbouring airports.\n\nAccording to the official, out of the 5,000 tips that have been sent to the tip line, less than 100 have resulted in leads that are \u201cdeemed worthy of more investigative activity.\u201d\n\nThe official stated that no proof of \u201clarge-scale UAS activity\u201d had been discovered.\n\nAccording to the FBI official, there has been a \u201cslight overreaction\u201d to the reports.\n\nStill, \u201cwe can\u2019t ignore the sightings that have been there, and we are concerned about those just as much as anybody else is,\u201d the official added.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month. Up next, they\u2019re scheduled to headline When We Were Young 2025 (get tickets here).\n\nBlink-182\u2019s Tom DeLonge Has a Theory on the New Jersey Drones: They\u2019re UFOs\n\nJo Vito\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopular Posts\n\nSubscribe to Consequence\u2019s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox."

            "article_content": "Following historian and philosopher Hanna Arendt, there is the belief that the public should assert their needs and interests in scientific endeavors.1 But, before the public can weigh in, someone must fully inform them of the issue involved. Once citizens understand a problem, they can ensure, through their political representatives, that the science aligns with their demands and does not go off on its own. For example, once Americans understood the gravity, they clearly articulated that they would not allow science to create human beings in a laboratory or have computers governing the world.\n\nSource: CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\nIn contrast, modern medicine illustrates what happens when the public lacks information and has little input: educators and researchers go on their own\u2014and continue to do so in the face of abject failure. Here is one example in medicine, US citizens do not know how frightful their mental health care is, that medicine refuses to adopt the teaching that would cure it, or that they can direct their politicians to require that change.\n\nWhat do Americans need to know to activate and direct change?\n\n1. Although mental illness is the most common health condition in the US (nearly 100 million Americans in any one year), most people do not know that only 25 percent of patients receive any care, most of which does not meet standards. Compare this to 70 percent of physical disease patients receiving care of high quality. Mistakenly, some uninformed Americans even assume mental health care matches medical care.\n\n2. Few realize that compromised mental health care results from two easily remediable medical derelictions: a) medicine fails to train enough mental health professionals (psychiatrists and psychologists each conduct only 12 percent of care); and b) it provides almost no training for the primary care clinicians who, by default, conduct over 75 percent of mental health care; their lack of training explains why most mental health care is substandard. Shockingly, educators devote only 2 percent of physicians\u2019 training to mental health care. These facts identify the simple but surprisingly overlooked solution to the mental health crisis: train more mental health professionals and train the medical doctors who provide most of the care.\n\n3. Almost no one understands why medicine would resist such obvious solutions. The \u201cmind-body split\u201d philosophy or theory developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries caused this blind spot. In a political compromise, church and science leaders of the scientific revolution agreed to the split: the mind, soul, and spirit went together and were the church\u2019s province alone. Medicine could only consider the physical body and its diseases from the neck down. That made mental disorders and other mind issues, such as emotions, off base for medicine. Although mental health care became medicine\u2019s responsibility in the 1800s, physicians have never deviated from their isolated focus on the physical body and its diseases. Only a small minority of clinicians ever showed any interest in mental health, and the tiny field of psychiatry formed around them; this was often disdained and dismissed by the majority culture. Sadly, medical education has never exhibited an interest in mental illness training for medical students or producing enough residencies to train psychiatrists. On the other hand, medicine has not failed. The mind-body split led to massive physical healthcare improvements in the last century when life survival doubled from 40 years to 80 years.\n\nSource: CC-BY-2.5\n\nNevertheless, the exclusion of a patient's psychological and social life now renders the mind-body split obsolete. It worked primarily for the acute physical and surgical illnesses that medicine has now cured or controlled for the most part (for example, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough; and ether anesthesia). But modern medicine\u2019s patient population has changed\u2014mental illnesses and chronic physical diseases are the most common conditions practitioners face.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s obvious why eschewing the mind shortchanges mental illnesses, almost no one recognizes it is also harming chronic disease care. Most chronic physical disorders are caused by the very psychological and social factors excluded by medical education\u2014lifestyle issues such as cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, overeating and overweight, drug addiction, and stress. Doctors must incorporate lifestyle issues into treatment to improve the underlying physical disease, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, yet they are not taught how to do this. More incriminating, medicine could prevent some 80 percent of heart disease and diabetes and 40 percent of cancers by addressing lifestyle factors. But it waits for cancer and heart disease to occur and then treats the problem.\n\n4. Although most people think medical education and research are scientifically based, the public will no doubt be aghast to learn that it does not follow modern scientific principles. Among all sciences, only medicine does not adhere to modern scientific theory: a systems view of life\u2014where physicians and other scientists must consider all parts of a problem and their interactions.2 Medicine\u2019s isolated disease focus omits the equally important psychological and social parts of its patients. More disturbing, medicine ignores the systems approach proposed for it in the 1970s, the biopsychosocial model. Demonstrably superior and research-based, the model links the patient\u2019s physical disease (biological) features with their psychological and social parts, thus integrating mental health care with medical care. Actively teaching the model would guarantee that the quality of mental health care matched physical disease care. Yet four centuries of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d by a now effete theoretical concept has left physicians immune to recognizing its profound shortcomings.\n\nExactly how do we initiate change? Inform the public. Typically, after citizens are informed and angry, they direct their politicians to confront refractory institutions. People knew little, for example, about the risks of automobiles and chemical pollutants. Then came Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader3 and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.4 These books made millions of Americans aware that seat belts saved lives and that we had poisonous DDT in our drinking water\u2014but that the auto and chemical industries refused to install seat belts and remove DDT for financial reasons. An irate US population insisted on change. That\u2019s why you have seat belts and clean water today. And a model for change\u2014informing the public."

            "article_content": "December 16, 2024: In September satellite images revealed a large crater at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome next to a silo that was apparently used to test a Sarmat ICBM/InterContinental Ballistic Missile that could reach any location in the United States. This is why most Russian ICBM silos are in northern Russia. The failed Sarmat launch spilled a lot of unused rocket fuel over the area which caused forest fires several hundred meters from the launch site.\n\nThe 77-year old Cosmodrome at Plesetsk has rarely suffered disasters like this. So far, the Cosmodrome has launched over 1,600 SLV/Satellite Launch Vehicles. The real problem with Plesetsk is that as a space launch facility it is becoming obsolete. The SpaceX technology revolution is something the Russians can\u2019t match. Russia can continue building ICBMs in the face of the secret military SpaceX projects dedicated to developing technology to destroy ICBMs once they leave the atmosphere and before they turn and plunge towards their distant targets.\n\nPlesetsk Cosmodrome is 926 kilometers north of Moscow and 180 kilometers from the city of Arkhangelsk which is on the White Sea in northwest Russia. Arkhangelsk is opposite Murmansk, which is adjacent to NATO member Finland. Finland and neighboring NATO member Norway maintain bases and the capability to monitor what goes on at Plesetsk.\n\nThe costs of the war in Ukraine reduced government income as military spending took priority. The cuts did not extend to the Russian space program. In theory Roscosmos could assist in the military effort but in practice Roscosmos has little to offer. Even without the Ukraine War related economic sanctions, the Russian space program was in financial trouble and sanctions only made it worse. The Russian space program suffered from a growing number of problems in the last decade. Russian support for the ISS suffers because Roscosmos is also responsible for maintaining the more important Russian GPS/GLONASS satellites as well as all other military communications and surveillance satellites. These activities take priority over projects involving international cooperation.\n\nRoscosmos has been receiving between $3.4 billion and $3.9 a year until a few years ago. Then the annual budget began to shrink. The 2024 budget is $2.8 billion. maintaining the Plesetsk military launch site and other military related space program infrastructure.\n\nCurrently Russia wants to eliminate all cooperation with Western nations, especially the United States and Europe. Roscosmos officials point out that it is not economically possible or technically preferable. Cooperation with the West has increased the capabilities of the Russian space program and provided economic opportunities for Russia. A much larger space program budget would be required and the loss of Western tech and markets for satellite launch services and satellite manufacturing hurts Russia more than the West. There are other problems, some needing immediate attention.\n\nFor example, GLONASS satellites regularly exceed their expected useful life and have to be replaced before they fail. To keep the GLONASS network operational you need at least 18 operational satellites. Currently Russia has 25 operational with replacement satellites standing by. Until 2023 Russia was using GLONASS -K satellites to replace the older GLONASS-Ms that were past their replacement date. As of 2024 all the replacements are the new K2 models. Russia before the sanctions were imposed Russia had been producing 15 to 17 new satellites a year and many were GLONASS replacement models. Russia cannot afford to replace the aging GLONASS satellites quickly enough to prevent shrinkage in the number of satellites required for global coverage. The sanctions mean Russia losing sales of satellites and launch services, which involves putting foreign satellites into orbit. The Russian government insists that Roscosmos can survive without Western nations as partners and customers. Roscosmos officials know better and quietly dismiss government plans to put a Russian space station into orbit after 2030. One reason for this goal being out of reach is that about 90 percent of the satellite components come from Western nations. Seeking substitute components from nations willing to break the sanctions, or smugglers who do it for a living, increases the coast of components. Even then, all the needed components cannot be obtained.\n\nAll these problems mean the end of a long Russian history with space stations. The Mir space station was the last Russian built space station and remained occupied for over twelve years. In 2001 the 130-ton Mir was destroyed by deorbiting and burning up during forced reentry into the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Meanwhile Russia joined the ISS consortium. The 420-ton ISS has been in orbit since 1998. Other nations have built similar space stations. Since the 1990s most nations with space programs have put their resources into supporting the ISS. Now the development of commercial space stations will dominate simply because it\u2019s cheaper and more efficient than government-run operations. This has already happened, again without much media fanfare, in the design, launch and operation of space satellites. While Roscosmos fades away, it is replaced by the expanding Chinese space program, which is expected to become dominant by the 2030s. The most obvious aspect of this is space stations. There are only two in orbit. The ISS was completed in 2011. The 419 ton ISS is the largest and usually occupied by a crew of six. The ISS has been the longest in orbit at over 24 years and the longest occupied at 23 years. The ISS was initially expected to have a useful occupied life of fifteen years.\n\nThe longer it was up there the more space station tech was developed. That led to extensions to the useful life of space stations. Until recently the ISS was to be used until 2028 but it is proposed to extend that to 2030.\n\nWithout any new government proposals for a new ISS replacement space station, the only one up there after 2030 would be the Chinese Tiangong 3, which has been occupied since 2021 and was completed in 2022 as a 66-ton unit with a useful life of 15 years. Tiangong 3 was designed to easily be doubled in size and extend useful life to 30 years.\n\nChina's new space station could be built so quickly because space technology has advanced over the years. For that reason, there are several proposals by Western firms to finance, build and operate commercial space stations. This development is no surprise to veteran space program engineers and administrators. Most of these new developments go unnoticed by the public because it is very technical and few people outside the kind of boring tech stuff. One exception was commercial firm SpaceX with its revolutionary SLV technology, which reduced the cost of putting anything into orbit.\n\nThe ISS cost about $150 billion to build and operate so far. The Tiangong 3 cost much less because it's now cheaper to build and launch satellite components and China plans to include lots of space for profitable science experiments. The large number of such experiments carried out in the ISS demonstrated that there is a market for this and that\u2019s the motivation behind commercial space stations, especially those using SpaceX SLV tech and similar new tech developed by SpaceX and a number of other firms. Space stations no longer have to be limited to government funded science experiments. Few noticed how much the costs were coming down at the same time income sources increased. Current plans are to have the first commercial space station operational before ISS retires in 2030. More commercial stations will follow.\n\nChina seemed to sense this trend when, without much fanfare, they put their first space station into orbit in 2011, This was the eight-ton Tiangong 1. It lasted two years and provided practical experience for the construction and launch of the 8.6-ton Tiangong 2 in late 2016. This one was built to last longer and in early 2017 a Chinese cargo vehicle made an automated docking with the Tiangong 2. This was a major step for the Chinese, who could now maintain two or three people in the Tiangong 2 for up to 30 days with the supplies from one cargo vehicle. China put the first 22 t0n module of the Tiangong 3 in orbit during April 2021 and it has been occupied since September 2021. Two laboratory modules, each weighing the same as the first, are planned for 2022. The first of these was launched on schedule and by the end of 2022 second one went into orbit. This made the initial Tiangong 3 complete. After that three more modules were added to double the crew size to six.\n\nChina wanted to join the consortium (United States, Russia, European Union, Japan, and Canada) that built and managed the ISS. There was opposition within the U.S. government from Chinese espionage efforts that had obtained data from the United States for peaceful use of space but then used that information for military purposes. The U.S. passed the Wolf Act in early 2011 prohibiting the American space agency NASA from cooperating with China on the ISS. That ended Chinese efforts to participate in the ISS. Later in 2011 China launched, on schedule, Tiangong 1, its first space station. China was in the space station business while Russia desperately sought ways to regain a place in orbital space and once more be competitive."
