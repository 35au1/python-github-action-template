Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month. Up next, they\u2019re scheduled to headline When We Were Young 2025 (get tickets here).\n\nBlink-182\u2019s Tom DeLonge Has a Theory on the New Jersey Drones: They\u2019re UFOs\n\nJo Vito\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopular Posts\n\nSubscribe to Consequence\u2019s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox."

It was Pajama Day at school but 6-year-old Levi didn't have any PJs.\n\n\"As he saw that I was upset, he saw my head looking down, and when I got on the bus he asked me what was wrong,\" Levi said. \"When I looked up tears came out of my eyes.\"\n\nLevi's bus driver later surprised him at school with some brand new pajamas.\n\nPeople as far as England and Portugal reached out to JCPS after their photo went viral.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nYared Nuguse takes bronze medal with a furious rally in historic Olympic 1500m\n\nIn August, Louisville watched one of its own race in the Olympics.\n\nManual graduate Yared Nuguse won a bronze medal in the men's 1500 meter race in Paris.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a long time since the Olympics, and I've just been taking it in for what it is, and just really believing internally that I am an Olympic bronze medalist,\" Nuguse said.\n\nThe runner got his start in high school when a teacher noticed him sprinting to McDonald's. Several years later, he sprinted across the finish line at the summer Olympics.\n\n\"Honestly, it's been pretty normal,\" he said. \"I only just finished my running season this weekend, so a lot of it has been normal training and stuff. But I'll get recognized at the grocery store a lot more, or little things like that. People are like, 'Oh my God, it's Yared.' And I'll be like, 'Oh, hi. What's up?'\"\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville's littlest lunch lady | Kind 2-year-old makes meals for trashmen every week\n\nTrash day was more than that for a 2-year-old girl in south Louisville.

            "article_content": "No chipmaker has benefited more from the rapid rise in artificial intelligence (AI) spending than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential for any company looking to develop and train large language models and build generative AI applications.\n\nNvidia flew past the $1 trillion milestone in May 2023. It's more than tripled since that point, becoming one of just three companies with a market capitalization above $3 trillion. But Nvidia isn't the only company that's seen its market capitalization soar as AI spending booms. In fact, AI advancements are virtually inseparable from the success of nearly every company valued at over a trillion dollars. The newest member, which both complements and competes with Nvidia, is no different.\n\nThe newest artificial intelligence chip stock in the $1 trillion club is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The stock passed the milestone after a stellar fourth-quarter earnings report on Dec. 12. Here's how the company became a leading AI chipmaker worth 13 figures.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company making the next generation of AI chips\n\nBroadcom is a well-diversified business. It has an enterprise software segment, led by VMWare and Symantec. It also makes semiconductors for applications, including wireless phones, WiFi, and Bluetooth. But what's really driving the business are two specialized semiconductor applications: Its networking chips, and its AI accelerators.\n\nBroadcom's networking chips are essential infrastructure for AI data centers. While hyperscalers are paying billions for Nvidia's GPUs, they need Broadcom's chips to get the most out of their processing power. Broadcom's Tomahawk and Jericho switches ensure that data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another. That means there's less redundancy and downtime in processing. And when you're trying to make the most out of billions of dollars' worth of chips, every second counts.\n\nThere's no company that's even close to Broadcom's technology when it comes to developing these chips. Moreover, there's nobody in charge of a hyperscale data center who's going to risk their job by switching to a competitor's offering, no matter how much money it could save the business. So, as data centers grow the number of expensive GPUs and other chips in their server racks, Broadcom's business has grown exponentially.\n\nEven more promising is its custom AI accelerator business. These are the next generation of AI chips.\n\nBroadcom works with several companies to develop purpose-built AI chips for their data centers. Its three biggest customers are Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. Management estimates that these three companies will present an addressable market of between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027. Considering all three companies' potential gains from advancements in AI, the high end of that number seems more likely than the low end.\n\nStory Continues"

And why were they no longer embraced as part of the wider literary canon?\" Jane Austen's Bookshelf sets out to find the answers, with each chapter following a different writer and their impact on Austen.

            "article_content": "I see a lot of movies in theaters every year. Last year, I was pretty pleased with my total of 79 trips to my local multiplex but for 2024, I set myself the goal of hitting triple-digits. Over the past 12 months, I\u2019ve seen 104 movies in theaters, and that number will rise even higher before the clock strikes midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nSeeing more than 100 movies in theaters in a calendar year has given me a pretty good overall gauge of 2024 in film. I saw all the major blockbusters from \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d to \u201cWicked\u201d as well as smaller indie releases and a couple of foreign flicks, too. I also endured some of the year\u2019s low points on the silver screen, including \u201cMadame Web\u201d and the \u201cBorderlands\u201d movie.\n\nLike any self-respecting movie buff, I keep a ranked list of everything I see in theaters each year (and there were some tough movies to place in 2024). Below you\u2019ll find the 10 movies that had me eager to book a second screening and the 10 that had me tempted to walk out early. These are the best and worst movies of 2024 from somebody who saw a whole lot of them.

That\u2019s not because of the talent involved; I\u2019ve enjoyed much of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 work and the cast is stacked (Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, yes please). Rather, I approached this black comedy with skepticism because it\u2019s an anthology movie comprised of three separate short stories.\n\nI typically struggle with anthology movies as I find the shift between narratives halts any momentum, and if even one of the chapters fails to connect with you that\u2019s potentially as much as a third of the flick written off. However, \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is a rare exception. Each of its three warped tales worked for me, and even just picking a favorite would be tough. Plus, it helps that \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is somewhat tonally similar to Lanthimos\u2019 2017 flick \u201cThe Killing of a Scared Deer\u201d which is my favorite entry in the Greek director's filmography.\n\nWatch now on Hulu\n\n9. \u2018Conclave\u2019\n\nCONCLAVE - Official Trailer [HD] - Only In Theaters October 25 - YouTube Watch On\n\n\u201cConclave\u201d is a 2024 movie that I know I\u2019m going to be recommending nonstop for years to come. The secretive process for picking a new pope might not sound like the ideal framework for a compelling mystery thriller, but it proves to be fertile ground for intrigue and strong character development. The Edward Berger movie follows a well-respected Cardinal (Ralph Fiennes) as he uncovers a web of secrets while overseeing the election of the next pope.\n\nFiennes is phenomenal in the lead role, playing a conflicted man of faith who is torn between duty, faith, and ambition, and the supporting cast around him is equally strong. Big kudos to Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Sergio Castellitto. Based on the best-selling Robert Harris novel of the same name, \u201cConclave\u201d crackles with compelling dialogue, but it\u2019s the tense atmosphere that sucked me in. I can't wait to rewatch this thriller over the holidays.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n8. \u2018Sing Sing\u2019\n\nSing Sing | Official Trailer HD | A24 - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhen the credits rolled on \u201cSing Sing\u201d, I didn\u2019t know whether to burst into tears of joy or stand up and applaud Colman Domingo for his awards-caliber performance. This is a prison drama with a real heart. Rather than being about gang violence or an audacious escape attempt like so much of the genre, it\u2019s a soulful flick about a group of prisoners that find solace in a theater group that allows them to become somebody else entirely for just a moment.\n\nThe emotions are so raw in this movie that while writing this blurb I threw on the trailer to refresh my memory, and got literal chills all over again. Domingo is breathtaking in the lead role of Divine G, a wrongly convicted prisoner who operates as the group leader. But he\u2019s matched by Clarence \"Divine Eye\" Maclin playing a fictionalized version of himself who is a newcomer to the group. If you need a spiritual boost then \u201cSing Sing\u201d will deliver in spades.\n\n7. \u2018Juror No. 2\u2019\n\nJuror #2 | Official Trailer | Max - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf I were to rank the movies on this list based purely on entertainment factor, then \u201cJuror No. 2\u201d would compete for the top spot. The latest (and reportedly last) film from cinema legend Clint Eastwood, it\u2019s a legal thriller that lacks filmmaking panache but packs an engaging premise that is well-delivered thanks to solid script work. If you need a movie that will have you absorbed from start to finish, you don\u2019t need to look any further.\n\nNicholas Hoult plays a recovering alcoholic, now family man, who is selected for the jury of a high-profile murder case. Things take an uncomfortable turn when he realizes he might be responsible (inadvertently) for the crime rather than the man on trial. Toni Collette adds steely determination as the prosecutor, and J.K. Simmons is having a blast as a fellow juror. \u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is the sort of intelligent adult-targeting drama we don\u2019t see as much in the theatrical space these days, but I really wish we did.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n6. \u2018Hit Man\u2019\n\nHit Man | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube Watch On\n\nI suspect the vast majority of people watched \u201cHit Man\u201d on their televisions when it landed on Netflix over the summer, so I consider myself supremely fortunate to have seen this crime-comedy on the big screen because Glen Powell is a movie star with a capital M and films like this belong in the theater. Directed by Richard Linklater, and co-written by Linklater and Powell, it\u2019s a movie with a little bit of everything. There\u2019s comedy, drama, thrills and a healthy dash of romance.\n\nPowell plays a fake contract killer working as part of a police sting operation who must adopt the hitman persona for real when he gets romantically involved with a woman in need (Adria Arjona). The chemistry between Arjona and Powell is practically off the chart, and I also love that \u201cHit Man\u201d is perfectly OK with being very silly at points. The montage of Powell dressing up as various types of assassins is a scene I often rewatch when I need a quick laugh.\n\nWatch now on Netflix\n\n5. \u2018The Substance\u2019\n\nTHE SUBSTANCE | Official Trailer | In Theaters & On MUBI Now - YouTube Watch On\n\nI find talking about \u201cThe Substance\u201d sort of tricky. That\u2019s not because it\u2019s bad. Its high placement on this list should speak to how highly I recommend it. Instead, \u201cThe Substance\u201d is tough to talk about because it\u2019s one of those movies that I think is best experienced when you know as little as possible before watching. I caught the dark thriller as part of a \u201cMystery Screening\u201d event at my local theater, and seeing it with practically zero prior awareness only elevated its impact.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m aware that for many people, movie-watching time is in short supply, so if you really need to know a little more before committing, it\u2019s a warped fable that follows a washed-up Hollywood star (played by a never-been-better Demi Moore) who takes a mysterious substance that promises to transform her into a younger, better version of herself (an also never-better Margaret Qualley), so long as she follows the rules. Spoiler: She does not.\n\nWatch now on Mubi\n\n4. \u2018Late Night with the Devil\u2019\n\nLate Night with the Devil: Official Trailer | Shudder - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe found footage format wore out its welcome in the horror genre pretty fast in the mid-2000s following the success of \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d and frankly, I always found the presentation style more limiting than immersive. However, \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d proved to me, that when used correctly, found footage can add a whole new layer of fear. This supernatural chiller is presented as an episode of a late-night talk show and things get nightmarish at a breakneck speed.\n\nDavid Dastmalchian plays Jack Delroy, a Johnny Carson type, who hosts \u201cNight Owls\u201d. To boost the rating for the struggling chat show the charismatic presenter invites a supposed possessed girl onto the set, and well, let\u2019s just say that things go south. The building sense of dread is almost palatable in \u201cLate Night with the Devil,\u201d and Dastmalchian is excellent in the lead role. There\u2019s also more occurring behind the scenes here than you might expect, and I enjoyed the movie\u2019s willingness to give us a peak beyond the cameras.\n\nWatch now on Hulu\n\n3. \u2018Alien: Romulus\u2019\n\nAlien: Romulus | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nFirst, I must clarify that I\u2019m extremely biased toward \u201cAlien: Romulus.\" The \u201cAlien\u201d franchise is my favorite in all of cinema, so even the bad \u201cAlien\u201d movies (yes, I\u2019m talking about you, \u201cAlien Covenant\u201d) are still pretty good in my books. But even when trying to look beyond my fandom, I still think \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d is a legacy sequel done right. I watched this one four times in theaters, and have seen it twice more on streaming, and I\u2019m already planning my next rewatch. That\u2019s a sign that \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d understands the franchise.\n\nEven as a superfan, I can acknowledge director Fede \u00c1lvarez overindulgence in fanservice (and the inclusion of a deepfake Ian Holm was unwise), but I can forgive a few corny callbacks when practically everything else is awesome. Newcomers Caille Spaeny and David Jonsson prove to be capable of carrying the weight of this iconic franchise, and finally, the Xenomorph has been made scary again. Plus, the production design is immaculate (I adore the nods to Alien: Isolation), and the ambitious finale takes a big swing and lands.\n\nWatch now on Hulu\n\n2. \u2018Challengers\u2019\n\nCHALLENGERS | Official Trailer 2 - YouTube Watch On\n\nSappy romantic drama \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d recently proved that a nonlinear narrative can do more harm than good, but \u201cChallengers\u201d is an example of the structure being used to great effect. This sports drama set in the world of professional tennis has no right to be this compelling. And a large part of the reason it grips you right from the very first serve is that its layers are slowly peeled away as we zip about the timeline learning more about the core trio.\n\nAnd what a central trio. Zendaya, Josh O\u2019Connor and Mike Faist have enough chemistry that it\u2019s advisable to wear safety goggles while watching. Though prepare for them to steam up quite a bit as director Luca Guadagnino\u2019s trademark raw sexual energy can be felt in almost every frame of \u201cChallengers.\" Credit to the Italian filmmaker too for some widely inventive shots, most prominently a final act rally where the camera becomes the tennis ball pinging over the net. The fact that \u201cChallengers\u201d is being ignored this awards season is a true outrage.\n\nWatch now on Prime Video\n\n1. \u2018Dune Part Two\u2019\n\nDune: Part Two | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nI\u2019m not going to win any points for originality for selecting \u201cDune Part Two\u201d as my favorite movie of 2024, but sometimes the frontrunner deserves its place at the top of the pack. A great testament to just how riveting I found this sci-fi epic is that I first saw it at a midnight screening, mere hours before catching an overseas flight, and having worked all day beforehand. My eyelids felt heavy before the trailers had finished, but moments later, I was wide awake. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s sequel demanded my attention from the first, truly stunning, moment, and my exhaustion was a nonfactor for the next two and a half hours.\n\n\u201cDune Part Two\u201d is one of those rare movies that gets so much right it\u2019s sort of hard to know where to begin (especially when you\u2019re trying to offer a concise write-up). The cast list is truly stacked, and everybody brings their A-game (big shouts to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Austin Butler), but what really captivated me throughout this second chapter of Villeneuve\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d saga is the massive scale. Recently, Hollywood blockbusters feel increasingly small in scope \u2014 often due to an over-reliance on CGI that makes everything feel glossy and fake \u2014 but \u201cDune Part Two\u201d doesn\u2019t have that problem. It really does feel like being transported to a new world and then swept up in an enthralling tale stuffed with drama, excitement, adventure and high-stakes revelations.\n\nWatch now on Max\n\n10 worst movies of 2024\n\n10. \u2018The Crow'\n\nThe Crow (2024) Official Trailer - Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, FKA twigs, Danny Huston - YouTube Watch On\n\nRemaking \"The Crow\" seemed like an ill-fated idea from the very start. The '90s cult classic is very much a product of its era, and with lead actor Brandon Lee tragically losing his life on set after an accident involving a prop gun, it's taken on a macabre mythical status with many fans. But unsurprisingly that didn't stop the Hollywood machine, and after years in development purgatory, in August this new spin on \"The Crow\" took flight, and quickly flamed out.\n\nBill Skarsg\u00e5rd and FKA Twig play the lead roles of doomed lovers, and there's just one problem: They have zero on-screen chemistry. This is a major issue when the entire movie hangs on Eric Draven's (Skarsg\u00e5rd) quest for revenge in the wake of a grim tragedy. It also takes a ludicrously long time for Draven to earn the eponymous moniker and become a vengeful anti-hero. A gleefully violent action sequence within an opera house offers a brief reprieve from the somber tone, but it's not enough to save this completely pointless remake.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon and Apple\n\n9. \u2018Imaginary\u2019\n\nImaginary (2024) Official Trailer \u2013 DeWanda Wise, Tom Payne, Taegen Burns - YouTube Watch On\n\nIt\u2019s hard to take a horror movie seriously when the antagonist is a stuffed bear named Chauncey. Of course, \u201cImaginary\u201d could have gone the horror-comedy route in a similar vein to the classic \u201cChild\u2019s Play\u201d franchise or more modern efforts like \u201cM3GAN\u201d but instead this frustratingly bland supernatural horror plays things bizarrely safe. The spooks never moving beyond jump scares is another missed opportunity. Frankly, I've seen more frightful kid\u2019s movies.\n\n\u201cImaginary\u201d follows a woman named Jessica (DeWanda Wise) who moves back to her childhood home with her new husband (Tom Payne) and stepdaughters. Once there an imaginary friend from her youth resurfaces, and you can probably predict where things go next. While there is nothing egregiously bad about this Jeff Wadlow-helmed time-waster \u201cImaginary\u201d\u2019s biggest crime is that it\u2019s so forgettable it barely registers just hours later.\n\nWatch now on Starz\n\n8. \u2018The Watchers\u2019\n\nTHE WATCHERS | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nIshana Night Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night Shyamalan (who serves as a producer on this movie), clearly took some filmmaking lessons from dear old dad. The only problem is that \u201cThe Watchers\u201d packs all the worst traits of Shyamalan\u2019s divisive school of directing. Namely, the entire movie is constructed around a predictable twist that I suspect most viewers will figure out within the first third of the movie\u2019s 100-minute runtime.\n\nWith the shock of the movie\u2019s narrative wrinkle removed, \u201cThe Watcher\u201d has practically nothing else to offer viewers. The somber tone doesn\u2019t add to the atmosphere, it just makes the whole thing feel monotonous, and a very wooden performance from Dakota Fanning doesn\u2019t help matters either. I don\u2019t want to bash a first-time director too much, but I hope that if Ishana Night Shyamalan steps behind the camera again she will seek to break beyond her father\u2019s shadow because frankly, M. Night\u2019s record is so spotty it makes for poor inspiration.\n\nWatch now on Max\n\n7. \u2018Borderlands\u2019\n\nBorderlands (2024) Official Trailer - Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black - YouTube Watch On\n\nA calamitous box office bomb, and an unwelcome throwback to the era of awful video game adaptation, \u201cBorderlands\u201d was the internet\u2019s punching bag for much of the summer movie season. Heck, here at Tom\u2019s Guide we got in a few jabs ourselves, with staff writer Martin Shore giving it a one-star review and labeling it a \u201cmess\u201d. But you know what, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as unwatchable as its reputation would suggest. I even wrote an op-ed offering a very lukewarm rebuttal to the claims it was one of the worst movies ever made.\n\nI do think it\u2019s a bad movie (it\u2019s made No. 7 on my worst-of-the-year list after all), but I found a few flecks of fun in this zany action-comedy. However, the flaws are apparent, and several of them verge on fatal. The biggest is that pretty much the entire cast is wrong for their roles \u2014 Kevin Hart as gruff soldier Roland is a choice \u2014 also the sanitized PG-13 tone doesn\u2019t fit the Borderland universe, and the narrative is flimsy at best. Franky, there are very few reasons to watch this poor action flick, but worst movie of all time material? Not for me.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n6. \u2018Night Swim\u2019\n\nNight Swim | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\n\u201cNight Swim\u201d is a horror movie about a haunted swimming pool that proceeds to have zero fun with such a ludicrously stupid idea. This should have been a tongue-in-cheek horror that constantly pokes fun at its own ridiculousness, but writer/director Bryce McGuire opts for a more straight-laced approach instead. This decision results in a stilled horror movie that lacks scares, tension, atmosphere, or pretty much anything to keep audiences interested.\n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking that escaping a haunting swimming pool would be fairly straightforward (you just get out of the pool\u2026), but \u201cNight Swim\u201d goes to farcical lengths to keep its cast bobbing around the murky waters for a painstakingly dull 98 minutes. Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon are much better than the material they are presented with here, and even almost a year later (this one hit theaters in January 2024), I still cannot get over the movie\u2019s refusal to have fun with the idea of an evil backyard pool.\n\nWatch now on Prime Video\n\n5. \u2018Madame Web\u2019\n\nMADAME WEB \u2013 Official Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On\n\n\u201cMadame Web\u201d is another big-budget bomb that took a serious beating on social media. And while it wasn\u2019t the worst effort that Sony\u2019s interconnected comic book universe had to offer this year (we\u2019ll get to that shortly), it was still pretty darn horrendous. I\u2019d go as far as to say it makes \u201cMoribious\u201d look pretty good in comparison. However, it feels unfair to lay all the blame at the feet of director S. J. Clarkson as \u201cMadame Web\u201d displays all the hallmarks of intense studio interference.\n\nThe entire movie borders on incoherent with scenes that appear to have been chopped up in the editing room and some of the worst ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) I\u2019ve ever seen in a Hollywood blockbuster. Things aren\u2019t helped by Dakota Johnson\u2019s ill-fitting performance as lead Cassandra Webb. Her deadpan delivery clashes with the rest of the cast, and stands in stark contrast to villain Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) whose performance borders on pantomime-levels of subtly. But at least we got some funny memes from this one.\n\nWatch now on Netflix\n\n4. \u2018Venom: The Last Dance\u2019\n\nVENOM: THE LAST DANCE \u2013 Official Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On\n\nI have never cared for the \u201cVenom\u201d movies so I approached \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d with virtually no expectations, and still came away feeling like it had failed to reach them. Billed as the final installment in the franchise (for now at least), \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is less a fond farewell and more an unwelcome reminder that the comic book movie genre has fallen off a cliff quality-wise in the last four years. At least Sony has iced its cinematic universe now, so there's a silver lining.\n\nIf you like messy CGI effects, a generic narrative that revolves around hunting for a meaningless McGuffin, and dialogue so excruciatingly painful that I actually winced numerous times, then perhaps you\u2019ll have some fun with \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d, but otherwise skip this one. Even a very committed Tom Hardy can\u2019t save this superhero stinker. In fact, Hardy\u2019s overeager performance only adds to the sheer awfulness and you'll wish he'd tone it down. A truly miserable trilogy closer.\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple\n\n3. \u2018Argylle\u2019\n\nArgylle | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On\n\nAll the movies listed above are bad, but at least most of them have the good sense to conclude within less than two hours, but not \u201cArgylle\u201d. This spy-flavored action-comedy clocks in 140 minutes long, and it feels every single second of its bloated runtime. To be frank, this movie was always facing an uphill battle to win my affection. I never connected with Matthew Vaughn\u2019s \u201cKingsman\u201d franchise, and \u201cArgylle\u201d is the same shtick but worst in every department. The reasonably likable characters and well-crafted action are gone, but the cheesy comedy, poor narrative construction and oversaturated color pallet have been retained and expanded.\n\nI also feel it\u2019s important to call out how misleading the movie\u2019s marketing was. Henry Cavill was placed front of center (with popstar Dua Lipa also often showcased alongside him), but both barely feature, the real stars are Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell. Both are fine but lacking charm. Even a supporting cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston and Catherine O\u2019Hara can\u2019t save this messy blockbuster that reportedly cost $200 million and grossed less than half.\n\nWatch now on Apple TV Plus\n\n2. \u2018Afraid\u2019\n\nAFRAID - Official Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On\n\nI suppose there\u2019s something ironic about \u201cAfraid\u201d. This cautionary tale about the dangers of AI feels very much like it could have been written by a computer program instead of a human being. Playing out like the worst episode of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d ever made (which is really saying something as Charlie Brooker\u2019s sci-fi anthology has dropped a couple of clankers of its own), \u201cAfraid\u201d is pretty much only good for a few laughs at the movie\u2019s expense as it muddles its way through cliche social commentary that is on the nose it feels almost intentionally bad.\n\nAt least \u201cAfraid\u201d runs a mere 84 minutes (including credits), but even this saving grace isn\u2019t enough to save the movie from earning a deserved spot on this list. John Cho and Katherine Waterson labor through some awful material with dialogue that had me clutching my face in second-hand embarrassment (one character actually uses the word \u201cwoke\u201d at one point...). The only thing scary about \u201cAfraid\u201d is that I wasted a whole evening watching it in my local cinema.\n\nWatch now on Netflix\n\n1. \u2018Megalopolis\u2019\n\nMegalopolis (2024) Official Trailer - Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhen it comes to movies, I have one very strict rule: I finish once I\u2019ve started. I have only walked out of a movie before the credits rolled once (and on that occasion it wasn\u2019t because of the movie\u2019s quality), but \u201cMegalopolis\u201d seriously tested my resolve. Sitting through this incomprehensibly awful slop, I couldn\u2019t help but imagine all the better things I could be doing with my time, and the exit door looked extremely appealing. Out of a sense of stubbornness, and feeling that I couldn\u2019t fairly rank this movie as the worst of the year without seeing it through to the end, I stuck around. And frankly, I probably should have just walked out sooner.\n\n\u201cMegalopolis\u201d is a complete and utter mess. Apparently, there\u2019s a plotline about an architect named Cesar (Adam Driver) trying to create a perfect society named Megalopolis but that\u2019s news to me because the movie I watched presented me with indecipherable nonsense. The cast is universally terrible \u2014 bar Aubrey Plaza who is seemingly aware she\u2019s in hot garbage and plays to the cheap seats \u2014 and the self-satisfied message feels tacky and frankly condescending. It\u2019s the movie equivalent of that time Gal Gadot and her celebrity pals sang \u201cImagine.\" Francis Ford Coppola is a masterful director, but what was he thinking here?\n\nWatch with purchase on Amazon or Apple"

            "article_content": "The field of materials science is no stranger to unexpected breakthroughs. A recent example comes from the University of Hong Kong, where Professor Mingxin Huang and his team have developed a groundbreaking stainless steel for hydrogen production. This innovation, dubbed SS-H2, exhibits remarkable corrosion resistance and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional materials like titanium.\n\nThe discovery of SS-H2 is particularly intriguing due to its sequential dual-passivation mechanism. This unique property allows the steel to resist corrosion in chloride media up to an ultra-high potential of 1700 mV, surpassing the limitations of conventional stainless steel. Dr. Kaiping Yu, the first author of the study, remarked, \u201cMn-based passivation is a counter-intuitive discovery that cannot be explained by current knowledge in corrosion science.\u201d\n\nThis breakthrough could revolutionize hydrogen production from renewable sources, potentially reducing structural material costs by up to 40 times. Such advancements in green hydrogen technology align with efforts to develop AI-powered sailboats for green hydrogen production, further pushing the boundaries of sustainable energy solutions.\n\nUnexplained phenomena in energy research\n\nThe quest for efficient and sustainable energy sources has led to several unexplained discoveries. One such example is the development of a tiny nuclear battery capable of operating for 7,000 years. This groundbreaking energy solution challenges our understanding of long-term power generation and storage.\n\nIn the realm of hydrogen technology, researchers continue to encounter puzzling phenomena. Recent advancements have led to the creation of a new catalyst that enhances efficiency and reduces emissions in hydrogen engines. These innovations often emerge from unexpected sources and defy initial scientific predictions.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of these unexplained phenomena on energy research, consider the following table :\n\nTechnology Conventional Understanding Unexplained Breakthrough Stainless Steel Limited corrosion resistance SS-H2 with ultra-high potential resistance Nuclear Batteries Short lifespan 7,000-year operational capacity Hydrogen Engines High emissions New catalyst for cleaner operation\n\nThe role of serendipity in scientific breakthroughs\n\nMany unexplained phenomena in science arise from serendipitous discoveries. The development of SS-H2 is a prime example of how unexpected results can lead to significant advancements. Initially, the research team was skeptical of their findings, as the prevailing view suggested that manganese impairs the corrosion resistance of stainless steel.\n\nThis serendipitous discovery highlights the importance of :\n\nOpen-mindedness in scientific research\n\nRigorous testing and validation of unexpected results\n\nChallenging established scientific paradigms\n\nCollaboration between different scientific disciplines\n\nThe journey from initial discovery to potential industrial application of SS-H2 took nearly six years, emphasizing the patience and persistence required in unraveling unexplained phenomena. Professor Huang noted, \u201cOur strategy overcame the fundamental limitation of conventional stainless steel and established a paradigm for alloy development applicable at high potentials.\u201d\n\nFuture implications of unexplained scientific phenomena\n\nAs scientists continue to grapple with unexplained events and discoveries, the potential for groundbreaking applications grows. The development of SS-H2, for instance, could dramatically reduce the cost of structural components in water electrolyzers, making green hydrogen production more economically viable.\n\nThese unexplained phenomena often lead to :\n\nNew research directions and funding opportunities Interdisciplinary collaborations to solve complex problems Technological innovations with far-reaching impacts Paradigm shifts in scientific understanding\n\nAs we move forward, it\u2019s crucial to remain open to the unexpected and unexplained in scientific research. By embracing these mysteries, we pave the way for transformative discoveries that can shape the future of technology, energy, and our understanding of the natural world."

            "article_content": "Two breakthroughs in material science, both related to manipulating the arrangement of atoms in a material, were reported recently.\n\nThe first is the discovery of a new way of changing the phase of a material, from crystalline to amorphous, using an electrical pulse, which has the potential to revolutionise data storage in gadgets, mainly computer RAM. This new method consumes \u201ca billion times less electricity\u201d than the traditional melt-quench process, according to a paper published in Nature by researchers of IISc-Bengaluru, University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nElectronic storage devices use a type of glass called chalcogenide, which can change its phase from crystalline to amorphous (and back, when needed). In a solid, the atoms are in an ordered state. In an amorphous phase, the atoms are disordered, as in a liquid, but frozen into solid state \u2014 sort of a \u2018liquid in solid form\u2019. These two phases of a material are used to attribute the values \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for storing data. The phase change from crystalline to amorphous is achieved by highly localised application of laser pulses, which consumes a lot of electricity. The crystals must be heated beyond 800 degrees C and then rapidly cooled. If there is a way to convert crystal directly to glass without the intermediate liquid phase, then the power required for memory storage can be greatly reduced.\n\nA group of 12 researchers have demonstrated amorphisation of indium selenide using pulsed electric current. The localised electric pulse causes the weakly bonded layers of the material to slide over each other, like tectonic plates \u2014 and, like the plates, they too generate a shock wave, explains one of the researchers, Dr Pavan Nukala of the Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering, IISc, Bengaluru. The wave propagates through the material and causes amorphisation.\n\nThis new process has immediate application in microelectronics, but is really a breakthrough in material science as it shows a new way of thinking about amorphisation, he tells Quantum.\n\nDesired misfit\n\nThe second discovery \u2014 by a team led by Prof Kanishka Biswas, New Chemistry Unit, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru \u2014 has led to the synthesis of a new material with high potential for conversion of waste heat into electricity. The group researched into ferecrystals, a class of \u2018misfit layered compounds\u2019 (MLC) \u2014 so called because their atomic layers are misaligned, like an uneven stack of cards.\n\nMLCs have an interesting property \u2014 they do not allow the smooth conduction of heat and thereby block heat transfers. This ultra-low thermal conductivity creates a heat gradient across the material. According to the \u2018Seebeck effect\u2019, discovered in 1821, wherever there is a heat gradient, the material can also generate electricity.\n\nThe ferecrystal material shows a \u2018thermoelectric figure of merit\u2019 of 2.3, a high number that means the material can convert a lot of heat into electricity.\n\n\u201cThe material is already generating electricity in the lab. However, it needs to be scaled up for practical use,\u201d Biswas says.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

For example, a user might ask for help in responding to a message in an opened app or get real-time instructions for making coffee.\n\nThe video option will begin rolling out this week for paid ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers. OpenAI\u2019s enterprise and educational customers will get the feature in January, the company said.\n\nOpenAI kicked off a wave of investment in text-based chatbots with the launch of ChatGPT two years ago. Since then, OpenAI and its rivals have pushed into so-called multimodal features that respond to audio, images and video. In the process, these services are able to provide a more dynamic and engaging digital assistant.\n\nThe announcement came during what OpenAI has said will be 12 days of livestreamed product events. OpenAI has used the launch series to introduce a more expensive new ChatGPT Pro subscription option and begin rolling out an AI video generation tool called Sora. \u2013 Bloomberg"

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents GPT o1 GPT o1-mini GPT-4o GPT-4o mini GPT-4 Early versions\n\nWe\u2019re now into the third year of the AI boom, and industry leaders are showing no signs of slowing down, pushing out newer and (presumably) more capable models on a regular basis. ChatGPT, of course, remains the undisputed leader.\n\nBut with more than a half-dozen models available from OpenAI alone, figuring out which one to use for your specific project can be a daunting task.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nGPT o1\n\nIf you want to try out the best and brightest model for ChatGPT, look no further than o1.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman spent a better part of his summer in 2024 teasing the imminent release of the company\u2019s secretive Project Strawberry. The company finally unveiled Project Strawberry in September, outing it as OpenAI\u2019s first \u201creasoning\u201d model and renaming it \u201co1.\u201d Much like the two-stage release of GPT-2, where a stripped-down version was released months ahead of the full-feature version, GPT Plus subscribers were first given access to the o1-preview version.\n\nAs a reasoning model, o1 is touted as using humanlike reasoning to check its own answers before outputting more accurate responses to complicated science, math, and coding queries. Trained on a \u201ccompletely new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset specifically tailored for it,\u201d per the company, o1 drastically outperforms the GPT-4o family of models across industry benchmark tests.\n\nThe full version of OpenAI o1 made its debut in December 2024 during the company\u2019s 12 Days of OpenAI livestream event. Its internal system of checks reportedly helps the new model hallucinate less than its predecessors. According to OpenAI\u2019s tests, the new version of o1 reduces \u201cmajor errors\u201d on \u201cdifficult real-world questions\u201d by 34% compared to its preview version. If you\u2019ve got reams of highly complex data to pour over or have complicated math and coding problems to solve, o1 is the OpenAI model you\u2019ll want to use.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not currently available to free-tier users (and likely won\u2019t be for quite some time). You can access o1 with a Plus or Teams subscription, though you\u2019ll only get 50 messages with it per week at that level. You\u2019ll need to shell out $200 monthly for a Pro subscription if you want to use it without limits. So, our recommendation would be to start out on 01, and if you run out of your allotted messages for the day, move on to one of the models below.\n\nGPT o1-mini\n\nOpenAI\u2019s o1-mini is a lightweight version of the company\u2019s larger reasoning model. It is geared more toward quickly solving challenging mathematics and coding problems rather than creative prose generation. It\u2019s built for speed and designed to provide fast, efficient solutions for specific technical tasks, making it ideal for task automation.\n\nUnlike the preview model, you can still access o1-mini, though you will need at least a Plus subscription. With Plus, you\u2019ll get 50 messages a day with OpenAI o1-mini. Pro subscribers, aka the folks shelling out $200 a month, have unlimited access to the mini model.\n\nGPT-4o is to GPT-4 in terms of performance what GPT-4 was to GPT-3.5. Introduced in May 2024, GPT-4o (the \u201co\u201d stands for \u201comni\u201d) is OpenAI\u2019s \u201clatest, fastest, highest intelligence model.\u201d It offers human-level response times (critical for features like Advanced Voice Mode), improved performance with languages beyond English, and a far better understanding of vision and audio content.\n\nNot only is this model faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective than its predecessors, but 4o has also achieved state-of-the-art results in multilingual and vision benchmark tests. It also offers a 128,000-character context window and can generate text, images, audio, and computer code. It recently received a minor boost to its creative writing skills thanks to a pre-Thanksgiving update.\n\nYou can access GPT-4o through the free tier of ChatGPT, but you will run into restrictive usage caps. Once you reach your limit with 4o, the platform will drop your access down to either 4o-mini or the older GPT-4-Turbo model. Subscribing to the $20-per-month Plus tier will significantly increase that usage cap.\n\nGPT-4o mini\n\nOpenAI\u2019s \u201clightest-weight intelligence model\u201d is GPT-4o mini. Designed more for completing computationally simple tasks performed quickly and repeatedly as opposed to pondering over challenging coding or analytical problems, 4o mini offers nearly all of the same features as the larger 4o model, save for its restricted access to some of the more advanced analytical tools.\n\nGPT-4o mini is available to Plus and Pro subscribers, and you can select it from the drop-down model list in the upper left corner of the ChatGPT home screen. You can also access it as a free-tier user by blowing through your GPT-40 usage allowance. The platform will shunt you over to the 4o mini model until you come off cool down and are allowed to access GPT-4o again.\n\nGPT-4 was the first big step up in ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities since its debut. Launched in April 2023 alongside the new ChatGPT Plus subscription tier, GPT-4 powered both ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s free Copilot platform. OpenAI touted GPT-4 as \u201cmore reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\u201d It was also the company\u2019s first multimodal model, allowing it to generate and analyze images and audio in addition to text.\n\nGPT-4 still serves as the base model available for free-tier ChatGPT users. For most casual users, GPT-4 and its \u201comni\u201d variants are plenty capable of performing the inference tasks that you need.\n\nEarly versions\n\nGPT-1, the original large language model from OpenAI, made its debut in June 2018 and became the archetype of generative pre-trained transformer technology. Even in its earliest form, GPT-1 managed to outperform the state-of-the-art models of the time by nearly 6% at natural language inference tasks.\n\nIts 1.5-billion-parameter successor, GPT-2, arrived in November 2019. It expanded upon GPT-1\u2019s basic text generation capabilities to include answering questions, summarizing documents, and translating text between languages. GPT-3 arrived in May 2020 but was quickly snatched up by Microsoft that September with a licensing scheme that gives Microsoft exclusive use of that model.\n\nThe GPT-3.5 model is a subset of Microsoft\u2019s licensed GPT-3 that offered better performance and a later knowledge cutoff date than earlier iterations. When OpenAI launched the ChatGPT platform in November 2022, the chatbot ran atop the GPT-3.5 model. The company incorporated web browsing capabilities the following April, but by May 2023, GPT-3.5 had been depreciated in favor of the far more capable GPT-4 family of models. As such, it\u2019s no longer available for public use and can only be accessed through OpenAI\u2019s developer API."

            "article_content": "Archeological discoveries can reveal the brighter sides of humanity. Collecting tchotchkes, our ancestors potentially comforting or sheltering one another in the face of a cataclysmic disaster, or building owl toys for children show how caring we can be as a species. However, other findings can reveal our darker side.\n\nThat more bleak part of human nature can be found in the bones uncovered from an archeological site in Charterhouse Warren, Somerset, England. A team recently analyzed over 3,000 bones found there decades ago that date back to the Early Bronze Age. The remains of at least 37 individuals here were killed, butchered, and likely partially eaten before they were thrown down a shaft that is 49-feet-deep. The analysis is detailed in a study published December 15 in the journal Antiquity and represents the largest-scale example of interpersonal violence from British prehistory.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

The bones belonged to a mixture of men, women, and children, which likely means they were representative of a community.\n\nExamples of cranial trauma.

Antiquity, December 2024. CREDIT: Schulting et al. Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nSearching for motivation\u2013and a reason for cannibalism\n\nThe skulls have evidence of a violent death from blunt force trauma, unlike the majority of contemporary burials. Researchers from multiple institutions further analyzed the bones to try and learn more about how these people died. They found several cutmarks and fractures that occurred at or near the time of death on the bones. The team believes that this is evidence that they were intentionally butchered and may have been partly consumed.\n\nTo find clues to why people in Early Bronze Age Britain might cannibalize their dead, they looked at the nearby Palaeolithic site of Gough\u2019s Cave in Cheddar Gorge. Evidence uncovered there suggests that cannibalism was likely a funeral rite in the area. However, Charterhouse Warren is a bit different. The evidence of a violent death with no indication of a fight or struggle implies that the victims were caught off guard. The team believes it is likely that they were all massacred and the butchering was done by their enemies.\n\n[ Related: Bronze Age village was \u2018pretty cozy\u2019\u2014until Britain\u2019s Pompeii. ]\n\nAbundant cattle bones have been found mixed in with the human bones suggests that people at Charterhouse Warren probably had enough to eat, so it is unlikely that they were killed strictly for food.\n\nInstead, cannibalism may have been a way to \u201cother\u201d and dehumanize the deceased. The killers were likening their enemies to animals by eating their flesh and mixing their bones in with animal bones.\n\n\u2018People in prehistory could match more recent atrocities\u2019\n\nThe conflict was likely caused by social factors. Theft or insults may have led to tensions which then escalated out of proportion. Additionally, two of the children had evidence of plague in their teeth. The fear of such a deadly illness may have also exacerbated tensions. Scientists at the The Francis Crick Institute found these signs of plague at Charterhouse Warren in a 2023 study and they were a \u201ccompletely unexpected\u201d finding, according to Schulting. However, the team still does not know what\u2013if any\u2013impact plague had on this conflict.\n\nRight hemi-mandible of child aged about 10 years (a) with detail of cutmarks on the ascending ramus (b).

Antiquity, December 2024.\n\nAs a whole, the discovery of such violence at Charterhouse Warren shows that in at least this instance, perceived slights and cycles of revenge could result in violent actions.\n\n\u201cCharterhouse Warren is one of those rare archaeological sites that challenges the way we think about the past,\u201d said Schulting. \u201cIt is a stark reminder that people in prehistory could match more recent atrocities and shines a light on a dark side of human behaviour. That it is unlikely to have been a one-off event makes it even more important that its story is told.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In an unprecedented wave of collaboration, leading AI firms are teaming up\u2014sometimes with rivals\u2014to serve a Pentagon and Congress determined to put AI to military use. Their growing alignment may herald an era in which software firms seize the influence now held by old-line defense contractors.\n\n\u201cThere's an old saying that software eats the world,\u201d Byron Callan, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, told Investors Business Daily on Wednesday. \u201cIt's going to eat the military too.\"\n\nOver the last week, Palantir, Anduril, Shield AI, OpenAI, Booz Allen, and Oracle announced various partnerships to develop products tailored to defense needs. Meanwhile, the House passed the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act with provisions that push the Defense Department to work more closely with tech firms on AI, and DOD announced yet another office intended to foster AI adoption.\n\nPerhaps the most significant partnership is between Palantir and Anduril, two companies that offer somewhat competing capabilities related to battlefield data integration. Palantir holds the contract for the Maven program, the seminal Defense Department AI effort to derive intelligence from vast amounts of data provided by satellites, drones, and other sensors. Anduril offers a mesh-networking product called Lattice for rapid collection and analysis of battlefield data for drone swarming and other operations.\n\nJust a day earlier, Palantir and Shield AI expanded their own partnership to include the deployment of Palantir\u2019s Warp Speed for integrating data into workflow. Their collaboration has sought to integrate Shield AI's autonomous systems with Palantir\u2019s data-processing platforms to provide commanders with a clearer operational picture. Shield AI also competes against Anduril with its autonomous piloting and drone swarm software for GPS-denied environments.\n\nAnduril also has new team-ups with Oracle, whose cloud infrastructure will support Anduril\u2019s autonomous systems to offer real-time data analysis near the battlefield; and with fellow drone maker Archer, to develop hybrid-propulsion aircraft for defense.\n\nFinally, Palantir announced a partnership with longtime defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton to make AI tools for logistics, autonomous systems, and other applications.\n\nCongress gets behind AI firms\n\nOn Wednesday, the House approved a 2025 defense authorization bill that includes several provisions intended to spur military adoption of AI. The bill puts a big emphasis on building out data and cloud computing resources to enable much faster adoption of AI and AI-enabled weapons, areas where companies like Anduril, Palantir, Booz Allen, and Shield AI excel.\n\nOne of the most ambitious is Section 1532, which mandates the expansion of secure, high-performance computing infrastructure to support AI training and development.\n\nThis infrastructure, which will include partnerships with commercial and hybrid cloud providers, is critical for developing scalable AI models capable of adapting to evolving mission requirements.\n\nSection 236 also presses the Pentagon to deepen partnerships with the private sector and academia, building on commercial expertise to accelerate innovation.\n\nThe act also includes stringent reporting requirements intended to ensure accountability and adaptability. From pilot programs in biotechnology to operational testing of cheap, autonomous drones under the Replicator program, the Pentagon must provide regular updates to Congress, demonstrating progress and addressing challenges.\n\n\u201cAnnual updates will assess data resources, cybersecurity measures, and the potential for operational use of technologies,\u201d the legislation says.\n\nThe Pentagon needs to reshape its acquisition philosophies to accommodate software firms, DIU Director Doug Beck said on Saturday. Instead of buying things via program requirements, the Defense Department must give companies more flexibility to design products that might be useful for defense and then bring those to the Pentagon.\n\nThat could be a boon to companies like Anduril, which has found a way to produce and even battlefield-test products before the Defense Department even asks for them.\n\n\u201cIf you give exact definitions and just port more money against it, then\u2026you actually don't incent the kind of behaviors that you want,\u201d Beck said Saturday at the Reagan National Security Forum. \u201cInstead, for those major areas of tech change, we should provide a consistent demand signal of the critical areas we'll be buying in, rather than specific programs, areas like AI, autonomy, space, biotech.\u201d\n\nBeck said the hope is that this approach will induce competition among industry players.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how the emerging partnerships will square with that.\n\nOne Defense Department official, speaking on background, called Anduril and Palantir the \u201csuccess stories of the defense-tech movement.\u201d The official said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the partnerships signaled \u201ca play to shape the next administration\u2019s approach\u201d to buying defense technology.\n\nThat will be even easier under Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar, who has reportedly been picked to lead the Pentagon\u2019s research and engineering efforts under the next administration.\n\nAnduril and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nNew DOD AI cell\n\nWhich agency or office in the Department of Defense will spearhead accountability and governance over players that are increasingly coordinating their approach? That falls to the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, better known for its efforts to foster the use of AI.\n\nJust on Wednesday, the CDAO and the Defense Innovation Unit announced that they had created an AI rapid capabilities cell to accelerate the exploration, testing, and adoption of generative AI.\n\nThe NDAA also pushes the CDAO to smooth the adoption of AI. Section 1521 tasks the office with increasing and synchronizing the use of modern data formats and sharing standards across the department. This includes defining and implementing a strategy to transition from obsolete data formats to modern ones in weapons, command-and-control systems, and sensors.\n\nThose company partnerships announced last week are directly relevant to that\u2014and to Section 233, which requires \u201cthe development of a strategy to invest in advanced technologies, including automated systems and artificial intelligence, to streamline the process of organizing, indexing, and categorizing data.\u201d\n\nCDOA chief Radha Plumb is scheduled to depart in January as the new administration takes over. Her successor will be tasked with implementing those NDAA provisions on data synchronization and strategy development. But they will be overseeing an AI defense contractor community that is increasingly synchronized in their approach to data standards, reporting, and competition.\n\nScott Nover, writing at GZERO Media, called this an incipient \u201cAI military-industrial complex.\u201d\n\nIn November, Palantir passed Lockheed Martin in one closely watched measure: market cap. In a letter to investors that month announcing quarterly revenue, Palantir founder Alex Karp boasted, \u201cA juggernaut is emerging. This is the software century, and we intend to take the entire market.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, Karp and his fellow defense-tech execs are hunting together."

            "article_content": "A new study has demonstrated that a tiny bundle of optical fibers can continuously, accurately, and simultaneously measure six biomarkers of brain health, helping to prevent serious complications that can follow a traumatic brain injury.\n\nOptical fiber technology, a.k.a. fiber optics, uses pulses of light to transmit data along a bundle of thin strands of glass or plastic. It\u2019s a technology that, more often than not, is closely associated with the internet, a means of achieving things like faster download and upload speeds and reduced latency.\n\nA new study led by Imperial College London (ICL) has used the technology to improve healthcare, particularly the diagnosis and treatment of dangerous swelling that can follow a traumatic brain injury.\n\n\u201cContinuous and comprehensive brain monitoring is crucial for timely identification of changes or deterioration in brain function, enabling prompt intervention and personalized treatments,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cHowever, existing brain monitoring systems struggle to offer continuous and accurate monitoring of multiple brain biomarkers simultaneously.\u201d\n\nBrain monitoring after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is critical to patient care. After the initial injury, the brain swells, a delayed response known as a secondary injury. Swelling presses the soft brain tissue against the hard, inflexible skull, causing further damage. Secondary injury is the leading cause of hospital death. Unlike the initial injury, secondary brain injury can be mitigated by closely monitoring parameters such as EEG, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow, and brain oxygen levels. Separate devices are currently used to measure these parameters.\n\nFor the present study, the researchers took advantage of technological advances to create a bundle of optical fiber sensors that simultaneously monitor six biomarkers that are indicative of brain health: temperature, pH, and concentrations of dissolved oxygen, glucose, sodium ions, and calcium ions. The biomarkers are measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the watery liquid that fills and surrounds the brain and spinal cord and provides nutrients, removes waste, and acts as a shock absorber for these delicate organs.\n\nA catheter containing the bundled optical fiber sensing system is inserted into the brain tissue to monitor biomarkers in CSF via selective fluorescent sensing films Zhang, Y et al. CC BY 4.0\n\nThe tips of six optical fibers were fitted with fluorescent sensors, which, by using a multi-wavelength laser, enabled the selective and continuous measurement of each of the biomarkers. A spare optical fiber was included in case it was needed for signal enhancement or a seventh biomarker. The fibers were bundled up into a 2.5-millimeter-thick (0.1-inch) catheter, which was initially inserted into animal brain models of TBI. Machine learning algorithms were used to decipher the incoming biomarker measurements.\n\nAfter demonstrating that the device could continuously and accurately measure the six biomarkers in animal brains, the researchers moved on to validating their findings using clinical human CSF samples. They obtained samples from 11 patients and used the optical fiber sensing system to measure the select biomarkers.\n\n\u201cIn the measurement of clinical human CSF samples, the multiplexed sensing system demonstrated high sensing precision for the continuous measurement of multiple biomarkers simultaneously with high selectivity and stability,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cTherefore, we conclude that the sensing system, coupled with intelligent algorithms, possesses great potential in the multiplexed monitoring of deep brain biomarkers for TBI treatment.\u201d\n\nThe device is not limited to only measuring six biomarkers, though.\n\n\u201cIn the current design, the system is developed for the monitoring of six biomarkers simultaneously with one spare fiber to accommodate a seventh biomarker,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cHowever, it is not the maximum capacity of the system. With careful optimization of the connector and individual fiber dimensions, it has the potential to measure more than 10 biomarkers concurrently. Achieving this would require additional lasers with varying wavelengths to efficiently excite all of the sensors.\u201d\n\nThe sensing device could be used in various clinical scenarios, including brain injury, stroke, and brain tumor resection Depositphotos\n\nAnd the researchers say the sensing device could be used in other situations.\n\n\u201cThe device also holds potential to be utilized with other modalities,\u201d they said. \u201cThe device\u2019s optical fiber-based design offers full compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), making it suitable for use in MR-guided surgeries with long-distance fibers and remote monitoring capabilities. It could also be integrated with drug delivery systems, utilizing hollow fibers to directly measure responses to pharmacological interventions. Further studies are necessary to assess the performance of the sensing system in diverse environments to fully explore its potential in multiplexed sensing and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said that the probe\u2019s small size and its being made from soft, highly biocompatible materials reduce the risk of it damaging brain tissue and prompting an inflammatory response, making it suitable for long-term implantation. However, the biocompatibility of the system needs to be evaluated over extended periods.\n\n\u201cThe system is minimally invasive, multiplexed, sensitive, selective, robust, and fully reversible and suitable for long-term applications,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cIt holds great promise for precise and continuous monitoring of deep brain physiology, aiding in pathological identification and clinical guidance in various clinical cases, including but not limited to brain injury, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and brain tumor resection.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the journal ACS Sensors.\n\nSource: American Chemical Society"

            "article_content": "The Liberation War, while emblematic of unparalleled heroism, is equally a tale of immense loss and suffering. Over the years, filmmakers have explored various aspects of this historic conflict through the medium of cinema. Let us revisit some of the most notable films that captured the essence of this epochal event.\n\n'Ora Egaro Jon'\n\nThe first film about Bangladesh's Liberation War, \"Ora Egaro Jon,\" holds a special place in the nation's cinematic history. Directed by the legendary Chashi Nazrul Islam, the movie received accolades at the inaugural Bangladesh National Film Awards for its monumental depiction of the War.\n\nThe story follows Khasru and his sister Mita (played by Shabana), who live in Dhaka with their uncle for their studies. Khasru is engaged to their neighbour Sheela (Nuton), while Mita, a medical student, is romantically involved with Sheela's brother Parvez (Razzak). Their tranquil lives are upended when the war begins.\n\nKhasru joins the War and forms a guerrilla unit with 10 others under his command. Meanwhile, Parvez is captured and tortured by the Pakistani military for aiding the freedom fighters. Unable to extract information, the soldiers execute his mother and younger brother. Sheela endures unspeakable atrocities, while Mita, who had joined a medical team in Bikrampur, also falls victim to the military's brutality.\n\nThe film culminates with the victory of the freedom fighters, though many return home to find their families destroyed or permanently absent. With the cooperation of Major Ziaur Rahman, a prominent sector commander, \"Ora Egaro Jon\" used authentic weapons and ammunition from the Liberation War. A memorable scene depicting the execution of a captured Pakistani soldier was enacted with the help of real-life prisoners of War, highlighting the film's commitment to realism. This cinematic masterpiece remains a poignant portrayal of the war's sacrifices and the resilience of the Bangladeshi people.\n\n'Arunodoyer Agnishakhi'\n\n\"Arunodoyer Agnishakhi,\" directed by Subhash Dutta, was the second film in independent Bangladesh to centre on the Liberation War. Known for his innovative poster designs and celebrated for his direction of \"Mukh O Mukhosh,\" Dutta crafted a stirring film that addressed the plight of war survivors, particularly women who faced sexual violence. The poster carried a heart-wrenching message: \"Restore the dignity of violated women!\"\n\nThe plot begins in early 1971 with a film crew arriving in a village to shoot a movie. Among them is an actor, famous for his portrayal of Sirajuddaula, who becomes acquainted with villagers Asad, Romana, and Badruddin. A love triangle develops: Romana is romantically involved with Asad, while Badruddin harbours unrequited feelings for her.\n\nThe village faces devastation during the night of March 25, 1971. Romana's family is killed, and she becomes a victim of violence. The actor escapes to Kolkata, where he grapples with survivor's guilt and eventually resolves to join the Liberation War. However, his fear of death holds him back.\n\nMeanwhile, Asad dies trying to rescue Romana, and Badruddin also loses his life in the effort. Pregnant and devastated, Romana contemplates suicide but chooses to live for the sake of her siblings. After the War, the actor returns and advocates for the recognition of War children and the valour of the Biranganas. Featuring stellar performances by Ujjal, Babita, and Anowar Hossen, this film remains a powerful exploration of war's human cost.\n\n'Abar Tora Manush Ho'\n\nAmong the most discussed post-independence Liberation War films is \"Abar Tora Manush Ho,\" released on December 7, 1973. Directed by Khan Ataur Rahman, the film portrays the struggles of seven freedom fighters who return from the war, only to confront the corruption and moral decay plaguing post-independence society.\n\nArmed with weapons they refuse to surrender, the fighters take matters into their own hands, combating vices like black marketeering and exploitation. Khan Ataur Rahman plays the principal of Bangobani College, with the seven fighters as his students.\n\nThe film's soundtrack includes the iconic songs \"Ek Nodi Rokto Periye\" by Shahnaz Rahmatullah and \"Tumi Cheyechile Ogo Jante\" by Abida Sultana, both written and composed by Khan Ataur Rahman. While the film sparked controversy, with some accusing Rahman of undermining the war's sanctity, it remains an enduring commentary on the societal challenges that followed independence.\n\n'Megher Onek Rong'\n\nReleased in 1976, \"Megher Onek Rong\" was Bangladesh's second colour film and the first to depict the Liberation War in vibrant hues. Directed by Harunur Rashid, it challenged the male-centric narratives of victory and focused on the harrowing sacrifices of women.\n\nThe story follows Dr Omar, his wife Ruma, and their child Adnan as their lives are shattered by the Pakistani military. Ruma endures unimaginable suffering, while Omar, consumed by grief, withdraws emotionally. Ruma ultimately takes her own life, leaving Adnan to be raised by his grandfather.\n\nThough the film did not achieve commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its technical brilliance and artistic depth. It remains a landmark in Liberation War cinema, offering a rare perspective on women's experiences during the conflict.\n\n'Aguner Poroshmoni'\n\nBased on Humayun Ahmed's novel, \"Aguner Poroshmoni\" unfolds in Dhaka in July 1971. It tells the story of Badiul Alam, a freedom fighter leading a guerrilla operation, and his interactions with Matin's family, particularly his daughter Ratri.\n\nAs Badi's mission unfolds, the war's violence intrudes on their lives, culminating in a devastating loss. The film juxtaposes the personal struggles of its characters with the broader war effort, capturing both the heroism and tragedy of the time.\n\nReleased on December 16, 1994, \"Aguner Poroshmoni\" won the National Film Award for its compelling storytelling, exceptional performances, and iconic soundtrack. Directed by Humayun Ahmed, it remains a cinematic milestone in portraying the Liberation War."

            "article_content": "The rapid rise of rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has left many questions unanswered, especially how it might govern the fractious country. PHOTO: NYTIMES\n\nMr Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of the rebel group that ousted the Assad regime in Syria, said this weekend that \u201cSyria\u2019s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations\u201d.\n\nBut the rapid rise of Mr Sharaa\u2019s group to power has left many questions unanswered, especially how it might govern the fractious country. And there are many confrontations already in motion, including a violent conflict between Turkey-backed militias and Kurdish-led forces, and Israel\u2019s ongoing air strikes on Syrian military sites.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to understanding where things stand in Syria, and what may come next.\n\nHow will the rebels govern Syria?\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) was the main rebel group leading the offensive that quickly led to the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. The group is now leading the transition to a new Syrian government.\n\nMr Mohammad al-Bashir, a rebel leader affiliated with HTS, has been named as caretaker prime minister until March 1. Mr Bashir previously served as head of the administration in Idlib, a rebel-held territory in the north-west.\n\nHTS\u2019 track record there may offer some clues to how it will oversee a much larger territory. The group maintained a robust internal security force to confront other military factions and domestic critics, prompting regular protests against its authoritarian methods and harsh jail conditions.\n\nIt is an open question whether these rebels can scale up what they achieved in Idlib, a poor, agrarian region with a relatively small population, throughout most of Syria.\n\nThe alliance said it would grant an amnesty for lower-level government workers and soldiers, but vowed to hunt down and punish senior officials of the previous regime who were implicated in torture and other abuses.\n\n\u201cWe will not relent in holding accountable the criminals, murderers, and security and military officers involved in torturing the Syrian people,\u201d said Mr Sharaa, who was formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.\n\nThe group is a former affiliate of al-Qaeda that broke with the older group years ago and came to dominate Idlib, the last stronghold of Syria\u2019s opposition during the 13-year civil war.\n\nMr Geir Pedersen, the United Nations\u2019 special envoy for Syria, said on Dec 10 that HTS and other armed groups controlling the capital had issued \u201creassuring statements\u201d about forming a government of \u201cunity and inclusiveness\u201d. He urged Syria\u2019s armed groups to protect civilians and create a government that represented the country\u2019s many ethnic and religious communities.\n\nWho is Ahmad al-Sharaa?\n\nMr Sharaa of HTS recently gave up his nom de guerre after concluding the shocking military offensive that unseated the Assad regime.\n\nHe was born Ahmad Hussein al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, the child of Syrian exiles, according to Arab media reports. In the late 1980s, his family moved back to Syria, and in 2003, he went to neighboring Iraq to join al-Qaeda and fight the US occupation.\n\nMr Ahmad Hussein al-Sharaa, the leader of Syria\u2019s Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group addresses a crowd at the capital\u2019s landmark Umayyad Mosque on Dec 8. PHOTO: AFP\n\nHe spent several years in a US prison in Iraq, according to the Arab media reports and US officials. He later emerged in Syria around the start of the civil war and formed the Nusra Front, which eventually evolved into HTS.\n\nSince breaking ties with al-Qaeda, Mr Sharaa and his group have tried to gain international legitimacy by putting aside global jihadi ambitions and focusing on organised governance in Syria.\n\nQuestions have emerged about what kind of government Mr Sharaa would support and whether Syrians would accept it. In Idlib, HTS has espoused a government guided by a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology.\n\nSince the rebel offensive began, Mr Sharaa has sought to reassure minority communities from other sects and religions. Some analysts say he now faces the test of his life: whether he can unite Syrians.\n\nWhat is Russia doing in Syria?\n\nRussia was a key backer of the Assad regime, intervening in Syria\u2019s civil war with brutal bombing campaigns that helped the government defeat rebel groups. It also maintained a military presence throughout the country, including the Tartus naval base and Hmeimim air base, enabling Russia to project military power throughout the Mediterranean and northern Africa.\n\nSince the rebel alliance deposed Mr Assad, Russia has moved to scale down its presence. But one key question has yet to be resolved: whether Russia manages to strike an agreement with Syria\u2019s new government to hold on to Hmeimim and Tartus.\n\nA New York Times analysis of satellite imagery of Hmeimim on Dec 13 showed planes designed to transport heavy machinery prepared for loading, and Russian military equipment apparently being packed up nearby.\n\nTwo videos verified by the Times also showed at least one convoy of Russian military vehicles moving north, near Damascus and Homs, in the direction of the air base.\n\nRussian naval and commercial activity in the key Syrian deepwater port of Tartus has also ceased since Assad\u2019s government fell.\n\nA convoy of Russian military vehicles and armoured personnel carriers on a road west of Homs, Syria, moving towards the Mediterranean Sea from their bases on Dec 15. PHOTO: NYTIMES\n\nWhat is Israel doing?\n\nIsrael is carrying out intensive air strikes on military targets that were controlled by the Assad government, despite warnings that its operations there could ignite new conflict and jeopardise the transition of power to an interim government.\n\nIts ground forces have advanced beyond the demilitarised zone on the Israel-Syria border, their first overt entry into Syrian territory in more than 50 years, including on the Syrian side of the strategic Mount Hermon. Israel has given no timeline for its departure, apart from saying that it would stay until its security demands were met.\n\nOn the night of Dec 14 , Israel carried out 75 air strikes near the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the cities of Hama and Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organisation based in Britain that has long tracked the conflict in Syria. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nIsrael has struck Syria more than 450 times since the collapse of the Assad regime a week ago, according to the observatory.\n\nMr Sharaa said in an interview on Dec 14 with Syria TV, a pro-opposition channel, that Israel was using pretexts to justify its \u201cunwarranted\u201d territorial seizures in Syria. Still, he said, Syria could not afford any further conflict.\n\n\u201cSyria\u2019s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,\u201d he said, adding that he was focused on diplomatic solutions. \u201cThe priority at this stage is reconstruction and stability, not being drawn into disputes that could lead to further destruction.\u201d\n\nWhat is Turkey doing?\n\nTurkey has emerged as a winner of the Syrian civil war, with more influence than ever over the rebels who now control most of the country.\n\nIts President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had long worked with and supported the Syrian rebels who forced Mr Assad to flee.\n\nHe took in more than 3 million Syrian refugees and committed Turkish troops to secure a buffer zone inside Syria. He funded and trained a Turkish-backed rebel force, the Syrian National Army, which provided security for Turkish military bases in northern Syria and helped Turkey fight Kurdish forces that officials in Ankara, the Turkish capital, viewed as a threat.\n\nFierce fighting has already taken place between rebels supported by Turkey and US-backed, Kurdish-led forces. On Dec 10, Kurdish forces in Manbij announced a ceasefire brokered by the United States.\n\nThe US and an independent group monitoring the war have said that Turkish warplanes have assisted their allies on the ground with air strikes. Turkey and the US, allies in Nato, both welcomed the fall of the Assad government over the weekend. But one of Turkey\u2019s central strategic goals in the region is to weaken Kurdish forces, putting it at odds with Washington.\n\nHTS is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and other nations because of its history of Islamist extremism, but the Turks found a way to work with them and now have enormous leverage.\n\nA fighter walks outside the Turkish Embassy, after fighters of the ruling Syrian body ousted Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, on Dec 14. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n\u201cOut of all the region\u2019s major players, Ankara has the strongest channels of communication and history of working with the Islamist group now in charge in Damascus, positioning it to reap the benefits of the Assad regime\u2019s demise,\u201d Dr Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute\u2019s Turkish program, wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine on Dec 12 .\n\nTurkey has provided indirect assistance to the group, Dr Tol wrote, by shielding it from Syrian government attacks through the presence of Turkish troops in Idlib province. It also channeled humanitarian aid and trade into the region, which helped HTS gain legitimacy among the people of the region.\n\n\u201cAll this has given Turkey influence over\u201d HTS, she wrote.\n\nWhat is the US doing?\n\nThe main US interest in Syria is the defeat of the Islamic State group, also known as Isis, which maintains a presence in the north-eastern and central parts of the country. About 1,000 US Special Operations troops are housed in bases in the east and north-east of the country, often working closely with Syrian Kurdish troops.\n\nPresident Joe Biden authorised US air strikes last week against Islamic State group camps and operatives inside Syria. A swarm of B-52, F-15 and A-10 warplanes hit more than 75 targets in central Syria, according to US officials.\n\nHe said the United States would support the region \u201cshould any threat arrive from Syria during this period of transition\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cleareyed about the fact that Isis will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capability, to create a safe haven,\u201d Mr Biden said. \u201cWe will not let that happen.\u201d\n\nWhat are the internal factions in Syria?\n\nIn addition to HTS, there are several major armed groups in Syria, and many smaller ones:\n\nSyrian Democratic Forces\n\nForces from Syria\u2019s Kurdish ethnic minority, which makes up about 10 per cent of the population, became the United States\u2019 main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria, under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nAfter the Islamic State group was largely defeated in 2019, the Kurdish-led forces consolidated control over towns in the north-east, expanding an autonomous region they had built there. But Kurdish fighters still had to contend with a longtime enemy, Turkey, which regards them as linked to Kurdish separatist insurgents in Turkey.\n\nSyrian National Army\n\nThis umbrella group, which includes dozens of groups with different beliefs, receives funding and arms from Turkey, which has long been focused on expanding a buffer zone along its border with Syria to guard against the activities of Kurdish militants.\n\nTurkey wants to create an area where it can resettle some of the 3 million refugees who have fled Syria and are living within its borders. But it has struggled to harmonise the ragtag groups that make up the Syrian National Army.\n\nThe group is largely composed of the dregs of the Syrian civil war, including many fighters whom the United States had rejected as criminals and thugs. Some received training from the United States early in the war, but most were dismissed as too extreme or too criminal. Most have no clear ideology and had turned to Turkey for a paycheck of about US$100 (S$135) a month when the group was formed.\n\nThe Druse militia\n\nSyria\u2019s Druse minority is concentrated in Sweida, an area in the south-west. Last week, Druse fighters joined the push to topple the Assad regime, launching an offensive in the south-west and clashing with government forces, according to media reports.\n\nThe Druse fighters are part of a newly formed group of Syrian rebels, which includes fighters from other backgrounds, working under the name the Southern Operations Room.\n\nThe Druse are a religious group practicing an offshoot of Islam, developed in the 11th century, that contains elements of Christianity, Hinduism, Gnosticism and other philosophies. There are more than 1 million Druse across the Middle East, mostly in Syria and Lebanon, with some also in Jordan and Israel.\n\nIslamic State group\n\nThe Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, also known as Isis, seized vast stretches of territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, establishing a brutal caliphate before it was beaten back by a US-led coalition. Now its members are largely in hiding.\n\nLately, there have been signs of the group\u2019s resurgence in Syria amid wider instability in the region. The Pentagon warned in July that Islamic State group attacks in Syria and Iraq were on track to double compared with 2023 . The group has repeatedly tried to free its members from prisons and has maintained a shadow governance in parts of north-eastern Syria, the US said.\n\nOn Dec 10 , Islamic State group forces killed 54 people in the Homs region in central Syria who had been part of the Syrian government\u2019s military and fled during the collapse of the Assad regime, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

            "article_content": "While members of the 118th Congress will be finished with their lame-duck session this week, lawmakers have yet to release or vote on a year-end legislation package.\n\nAlthough recent negotiations have included funding for the federal government, a Farm Bill extension, economic assistance for agriculture producers and natural disaster recovery aid, Congressional leadership has signaled that the package does not currently include economic assistance.\n\nIn response to this development, the following national ag leaders have issued the following statements over the weekend:\n\nTed McKinney, CEO of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA):\n\n\u201cFarmers and ranchers are encountering tremendous pressures under high input costs, elevated interest costs, deeply depressed commodity futures markets and poor local cash markets. Additionally, they have experienced powerful headwinds, ranging from extreme weather to uncertain global demand to supply chain disruptions. NASDA calls on Congress to put politics aside and find a resolution that provides the necessary economic aid and disaster assistance for the farmers and ranchers who work every day to provide food security to our country while also feeding the world.\u201d\n\nZippy Duvall, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF):\n\n\u201cAt a time when farm income is in a downward spiral and costs are rising, it\u2019s unacceptable for Congress to turn its back on farmers. Farmers don\u2019t get to set the prices for their goods and right now those prices don\u2019t even come close to covering their costs. We lost 141,000 farms in five years and if Congress fails to include economic aid for farmers, the sad reality is that we\u2019ll lose more.\n\n\u201cOur whole country will suffer the consequences if Congress takes farmers and our food supply for granted. For this reason, I call on members of Congress who represent agriculture to stand with farmers by insisting the supplemental spending bill include economic aid for farmers and voting it down if it doesn\u2019t. In truth, every elected leader who enjoys our affordable and abundant food supply represents agriculture, so I urge them to band together and ensure farmers are supported.\n\n\u201cNearly 80% of Americans believe lawmakers should prioritize legislation that supports farmers and ranchers so it\u2019s just plain unacceptable that our elected leaders are considering putting politics first. I hope reasonable members of Congress take a stand for the good folks who stock their pantries.\u201d\n\nKenneth Hartman Jr, President of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA):\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that congressional leadership appears to be at an impasse over crucial economic assistance for farmers in an end-of-the-year legislative package. Corn growers are faced with low prices and high input costs and economic aid would provide them with critical relief during challenging economic times.\n\n\u201cWhile these developments are disheartening, we call on Congress to resume negotiations and pass legislation that includes economic assistance while there is still time.\u201d\n\nCaleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA):\n\n\u201cWe urge congressional leadership to return to the negotiating table and find a path forward. A package that does not include both economic and disaster assistance for our farmers who have suffered significantly from unforgiving market conditions, disastrous weather phenomena and for many, a combination of both, simply does not meet the mark for what agriculture and specifically, our soy growers, need. We will oppose any supplemental spending package that does not provide meaningful assistance to farmers who need help now to stay afloat in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nChandler Goule, CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG):\n\n\u201cNAWG opposes any continued resolution that does not include economic assistance for farmers. We are disappointed that leaders in Congress couldn\u2019t find common ground to provide relief to farmers experiencing a financial crisis and urge them to continue working on a package that meets the needs of rural America. Wheat growers have seen their prices drop by over 36 percent since the 2022/23 marketing year and need the certainty an economic assistance package can provide before the end of the year. Period. Congress has already failed to pass a robust farm bill, and the lack of leadership in reaching an agreement will continue to hurt farmers who feed America and the world.\u201d"

            "article_content": "8.6 / 10\n\nSCORE Origin Eon17-X v2 $3,568 at Origin PC Pros Beautiful 4K display with DCI-P3 support looks sharp and saturated\n\nIncredible general and gaming performance\n\nRGB keyboard paired with a gigantic trackpad feels great to use Cons 17.3-inch laptop is extremely heavy\n\nFan noise is distractingly loud\n\nDisplay is great but not an OLED\n\nIf you want the best gaming laptop you can buy, then you must be ready to subject your wallet to some horrors. Your ears, too, in the case of the Origin PC Eon17-X v2. This formidable gaming machine costs a fortune and demands headphones, thanks to its very loud (though very capable) fans that start blasting air over its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU even before your favorite game's introductory cutscene gets a chance to load.\n\nAt more than $3,500 after a substantial discount, the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 is one of the more expensive gaming laptops we've tested recently, but it's not the fastest. The Alienware M18 R2 still holds that title, but the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 still offers plenty of 3D muscle -- and it has the better display of the two in the form of a 4K, 144Hz panel.\n\nIf you build the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 to the exact specs of the Alienware M18 R2 we tested, it costs about $250 more, which is a reasonable sum for the superior display. Alienware's 18-inch monster is still the one to beat in terms of raw performance, but the Origin's 4K display is super sharp and saturated, and the laptop can easily dish out triple-digit frame rates for today's demanding titles at their highest quality settings.\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 Price as reviewed $3,568 Display size/resolution 17.3-inch 3,840x2,160 144Hz IPS LCD CPU Intel Core i9-14900HX Memory 64GB LPDDR5-4800 Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Storage Two, 2TB SSD Ports Thunderbolt 5 (x2), USB-C 3.2 Gen1, USB-A 3.2 Gen1 (x2), HDMI 2.1, Mini DisplayPort 1.4, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, combo audio Networking Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 Operating system Windows 11 Home 24H2 Weight 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg)\n\nConfiguration options are plentiful\n\nSince Origin is a boutique PC builder, its laptops are customizable, and it gives you a good amount of leeway to adjust your system to your exact needs and budget -- and you can really push the limit for the latter. The Eon17-X v2 laptop we reviewed costs an eye-opening $3,568, and that's after Origin's $700 discount. But the system builder doesn't slouch on parts; you're getting some of the best components you can stuff into a 17-inch gaming behemoth.\n\nOur laptop came with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, which has a whopping 24 cores and 32 threads and runs at 2.2GHz by default (with its turbo clock boost maxing out at 5.8GHz). The CPU is paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, which ensures that even opening a web browser has a decent chance of making the laptop sound like a passenger jet at takeoff.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOur test system also included a near-overkill 64GB of DDR5-4800 memory and 4 terabytes of storage (split across two 2TB SSDs). That's the most memory offered, but far from the most storage, with 4TB and 8TB drives also available and three total M.2 slots.\n\nYou can choose from one of two 17.3-inch displays: a 2,560x1,440-pixel panel with a 240Hz refresh rate or a 3,840x2,160, 144Hz screen. The former locks you into an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, whereas the latter is the only option for the faster RTX 4090 GPU. We received the latter. It's a better setup, but it'll cost you an extra $523 from the laptop's base configuration.\n\nOrigin also offers custom UV prints for the top of the laptop, a $30 upgrade that's nice to have if one of the 19 designs really catches your eye. You can also send in your own custom art to print, but that's a $140 charge. This level of customization isn't offered by a more conventional manufacturer like Dell, but I'd recommend going with a lighter print than a darker one. The Starfield print on the laptop I reviewed looked quite a bit murkier in person compared with the bright, beautiful image on Origin's site.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 performance\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 is a beast in size and performance. Across the board, it delivered scores and frame rates on our benchmarks that were competitive with the highest-performing laptops we've tested, the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16, each of which features the same CPU/GPU duo in the Core i9-14900HX and RTX 4090.\n\nOn Geekbench 6, the Eon17-X v2 put out single- and multicore scores that were in line with those of the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16. It had the fastest single-core score of the three, and its multicore score was 4% slower than the Alienware M18 R2's. It fell back a bit on our Cinebench 2024 tests, especially on the multicore CPU test, where it was 33% slower than the Alienware M18 R2.\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 performed well on our 3D graphics and gaming tests, but it still trailed the Alienware and Razer. I checked to make sure thermal throttling wasn't to blame for the Origin's consistent third-place finishes of this trio since all three laptops share the same CPU and GPU configuration. When I repeated our Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark back to back to back, the average temperature of the laptop's CPU and GPU was under 80 degrees Celsius the entire time, which I expected given how much fan noise the laptop puts out. That's a great reading, since you may start to experience performance drops as you inch closer to triple-digits.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nBig, bulky and beautiful\n\nThe Origin Eon17-X v2 is not the laptop to buy for your daily commute, both due to its weight (7.5 pounds) and the fact that you'll enrage everyone on your train or subway with its noise once you fire up a game. It's a great desk companion that feels incredibly sturdy and solid to use, and its 17.3-inch display is big enough to make your games feel immersive and fun.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe huge footprint, including a near-1-inch thickness, provides plenty of room for both a regular keyboard and numpad. While they're centered on the laptop's palm rest, the laptop's gigantic touchpad (at 6 inches wide by just over 3.5 inches tall) is centered below the regular keyboard. This feels slightly awkward, as your left hand is a bit cramped for space when you rest it on the lower-left side of the laptop's palm rest, whereas your right has plenty of room. And this design puts your hands slightly off-center from the screen, which feels a little wonky.\n\nThe keys themselves are incredibly comfortable to type on, with great travel (and resistance) for everything from casual gaming to first-person shooters. They light up, too, but you have to use Origin's Control Center app to manage your look; you can't adjust the colors using Function key shortcuts, including their brightness. It's a bit annoying to have to launch an app when you want to make modifications on the fly, and while the app lets you change the backlight color of any individual key or pick from one of nine preset effects that apply to all your keys at once, it's not as comprehensive as what you might get with most gaming keyboards.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nParent company Corsair and its iCUE software allows for a lot more creativity, but that doesn't work on Origin's laptop. With Origin's Control Center, you can't, for example, create your own effects or patterns, set up reactive lighting for games, or import color profiles.\n\nThe laptop's touchpad, though huge, is much more responsive toward its bottom than its top. You really have to push to register a click within an inch of the touchpad's top, which is annoying but not uncommon on a mechanical touchpad. I dislike that the laptop's arrow keys -- typically critical for gaming -- bleed right into its numpad. It's an awkward design to have the right arrow sit directly below the laptop's 1 key, and I question the usefulness of the numpad, in general, on a gaming laptop.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nI was slightly concerned that the laptop's vents, located on the upper half of its left and right sides, would cause some unpleasant hand-warming during game sessions. My fears were unfounded; the laptop's loud cooling system is nothing if not effective. Fan noise may be ever-present and thunderous, but I had no issues gaming on a couch. It's much more comfortable, however, to plop the heavy laptop on a desk than on your lap.\n\nMinor shortcomings aside, the Eon17-X v2 is built like a tank. Its downward-facing speakers, which sit on the laptop's bottom (closest to your lap), sound decent, with bass ever-so-slightly better than the meh quality most laptops dish out. They give you a pleasant, enveloping sound when you're checking out an errant TikTok or YouTube video, but there's absolutely no way you're going to use these for gaming. You're going to need to budget for a headset, possibly even noise-canceling, with this beast.\n\nMassive 17-inch 4K display\n\nThe 17.3-inch display isn't an OLED, which is a letdown, given the laptop's price and noteworthy specs, but having a huge, gorgeous 4K display is nothing to be sad about. The display -- presumably IPS, though Origin doesn't detail this anywhere -- supports both the DCI-P3 and regular sRGB color spaces. Though folks who prefer color accuracy above all else might not care for the overly saturated look of DCI-P3, it makes games, movies and pictures absolutely pop. Unfortunately, the display doesn't support HDR, so you don't get those superrich scenes and dark-as-night black levels you might otherwise find on your living-room TV.\n\nThe laptop's white levels hit 30 nits at its lowest brightness setting and an impressive 556 nits at its highest. You should have few, if any, issues seeing the screen in daylight, even if you're unlikely to commute with it because of its heft. The minimum luminance is right in the sweet spot: not too dim to look bad but not too bright to cause annoyance to those who are particularly sensitive when staring at screens all day long.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe laptop's 4K resolution is a great fit for its humongous screen, making everything look sharp and crisp. I had as much fun (as one possibly can) mucking around in spreadsheets and Google Docs as I did gaming on the Eon17-X v2, and I would absolutely use this laptop as my daily driver -- just at my desk, not carried around my house.\n\nTo that point, it's also great that the laptop, big as it is, comes with a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity (supporting 160Hz-wide wireless channels for those of you living far away from any neighbors). I don't foresee moving it around very much, so it's great that you can hardwire yourself into blazing speeds on your home network, especially if you're rocking a higher-than-gigabit setup. The rest of the laptop's ports cover all the bases, from USB-A and USB-C to HDMI and DisplayPort -- no issues there. The most noteworthy inclusion among the ports are the two USB-C ports that offer the latest Thunderbolt 5 connectivity.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nIs the Origin Eon17-X v2 gaming laptop worth it?\n\nMy only qualm with the Eon17-X v2 is that it's very expensive for the performance it delivers. If you build Alienware's M18 R2 with the same specs as this Origin laptop, you're already saving around $250 (limited-time discounts notwithstanding) for a system that's a step faster for gaming by a not-so-insignificant amount (though it lacks a 4K screen). Match an Eon17-X v2 configuration to the M18 R2 that we reviewed, and it's the same deal: Origin's system costs around $250 more, but you get a much better, if slightly smaller, display.\n\nIf all you care about are frame rates, Alienware's M18 R2 remains the gaming laptop to beat. But for an overall experience, especially when you can find it on sale, Origin's Eon17-X v2 wins out for its superior display and slightly better customizability when you're building the laptop to begin with. Resist the urge to configure more laptop than you really need, and it's worth the extra cost you'll pay for everyday use.\n\nHide our expert take Photo Gallery 1/1 How we test computers Photo Gallery 1/1 The review process for laptops, desktops, tablets and other computerlike devices consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our expert reviewers.

            "article_content": "A woman made a 'mind blowing' revelation about UK number plates that left her - and countless others - stunned.\n\nWhile most drivers might view registration plates as little more than a jumble of letters and numbers, it turns out they hold a lot more information than meets the eye.\n\nCourtney Wright, a mum and TikTok user posting under the handle @courtneywrightxxx, shared her discovery in a viral clip, admitting that she was shocked to learn what the letters on car's number plates really mean.\n\n\"I've just learnt something new this morning. I actually can't believe it,\" she said in the video. \"Apparently, the first two letters on your number plate - so, like, my old car was MV - mean that car was registered in Manchester.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"They all have different codes, so it goes from MA to M- whatever, and that's all from Manchester.\"\n\nCourtney went on to explain: \"The first two letters actually mean something. You've got where the car was registered, the year it was registered, and then just a random sequence. I'm literally mind blown.\"\n\nHer video has since sparked a flurry of comments, with other people either sharing her amazement or confessing they had no idea about the system themselves.\n\nOne user wrote: \"How did I not know this? Mind blown too,\" while another joked: \"I've been driving for years, and this just made me feel like I missed an entire class on life.\"\n\nWhat do UK number plates actually mean?\n\nIf you've ever wondered about the seemingly random assortment of characters on UK number plates, Jon Kirkbright, the sales director of Private Number Plates, broke it down.\n\nAdvert\n\nCourtney shared her discover with TikTok (TikTok/@courtneywrightxxx)\n\nSpeaking to Diamond Advanced Motorists last year, Jon said: \"To the untrained eye, number plates may look like a random combination of letters and numbers.\n\n\"While many people are aware that the numbers indicate the year the car was made and registered, fewer people realise that the letters better them serve as 'regional identifiers.' These refer to the DVLA office where the car was registered.\"\n\nFor instance, plates beginning with MV, MA, or MB originate from the Manchester and Merseyside region, LA, LB, LV, etc., are assigned to London and BA, BB and BC indicate registration in Birmingham.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"This may be why your number plates start with the same letters if you buy more than one car from the same dealership - it's not just a coincidence,\" Jon added.\n\nWhat are the rules around private plates?\n\nFor those with private plates, the rules are a little stricter. Jon highlighted that while it's legal to make a car seem older using a dateless plate, it's illegal to make it look newer.\n\nEach car's number plate are assigned to where the car was registered (Getty stock image)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"For example, you cannot put an '11' number plate on a car registered in 2007,\" he said. \"It is an offence to misrepresent the registration in any way.\"\n\nThose wanting to hide the age of their car often opt for dateless plates, which allow for complete customisation while avoiding this issue.\n\nIf you're curious about your own car's registration, you can find a full list of regional number plate identifiers online - and join the ranks of those whose minds have been well and truly blown by the hidden meaning behind UK plates."

Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month. Up next, they\u2019re scheduled to headline When We Were Young 2025 (get tickets here).\n\nBlink-182\u2019s Tom DeLonge Has a Theory on the New Jersey Drones: They\u2019re UFOs\n\nJo Vito\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPopular Posts\n\nSubscribe to Consequence\u2019s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox."

            "article_content": "Following historian and philosopher Hanna Arendt, there is the belief that the public should assert their needs and interests in scientific endeavors.1 But, before the public can weigh in, someone must fully inform them of the issue involved. Once citizens understand a problem, they can ensure, through their political representatives, that the science aligns with their demands and does not go off on its own. For example, once Americans understood the gravity, they clearly articulated that they would not allow science to create human beings in a laboratory or have computers governing the world.\n\nSource: CC-BY-SA-3.0\n\nIn contrast, modern medicine illustrates what happens when the public lacks information and has little input: educators and researchers go on their own\u2014and continue to do so in the face of abject failure. Here is one example in medicine, US citizens do not know how frightful their mental health care is, that medicine refuses to adopt the teaching that would cure it, or that they can direct their politicians to require that change.\n\nWhat do Americans need to know to activate and direct change?\n\n1. Although mental illness is the most common health condition in the US (nearly 100 million Americans in any one year), most people do not know that only 25 percent of patients receive any care, most of which does not meet standards. Compare this to 70 percent of physical disease patients receiving care of high quality. Mistakenly, some uninformed Americans even assume mental health care matches medical care.\n\n2. Few realize that compromised mental health care results from two easily remediable medical derelictions: a) medicine fails to train enough mental health professionals (psychiatrists and psychologists each conduct only 12 percent of care); and b) it provides almost no training for the primary care clinicians who, by default, conduct over 75 percent of mental health care; their lack of training explains why most mental health care is substandard. Shockingly, educators devote only 2 percent of physicians\u2019 training to mental health care. These facts identify the simple but surprisingly overlooked solution to the mental health crisis: train more mental health professionals and train the medical doctors who provide most of the care.\n\n3. Almost no one understands why medicine would resist such obvious solutions. The \u201cmind-body split\u201d philosophy or theory developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries caused this blind spot. In a political compromise, church and science leaders of the scientific revolution agreed to the split: the mind, soul, and spirit went together and were the church\u2019s province alone. Medicine could only consider the physical body and its diseases from the neck down. That made mental disorders and other mind issues, such as emotions, off base for medicine. Although mental health care became medicine\u2019s responsibility in the 1800s, physicians have never deviated from their isolated focus on the physical body and its diseases. Only a small minority of clinicians ever showed any interest in mental health, and the tiny field of psychiatry formed around them; this was often disdained and dismissed by the majority culture. Sadly, medical education has never exhibited an interest in mental illness training for medical students or producing enough residencies to train psychiatrists. On the other hand, medicine has not failed. The mind-body split led to massive physical healthcare improvements in the last century when life survival doubled from 40 years to 80 years.\n\nSource: CC-BY-2.5\n\nNevertheless, the exclusion of a patient's psychological and social life now renders the mind-body split obsolete. It worked primarily for the acute physical and surgical illnesses that medicine has now cured or controlled for the most part (for example, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough; and ether anesthesia). But modern medicine\u2019s patient population has changed\u2014mental illnesses and chronic physical diseases are the most common conditions practitioners face.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s obvious why eschewing the mind shortchanges mental illnesses, almost no one recognizes it is also harming chronic disease care. Most chronic physical disorders are caused by the very psychological and social factors excluded by medical education\u2014lifestyle issues such as cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, overeating and overweight, drug addiction, and stress. Doctors must incorporate lifestyle issues into treatment to improve the underlying physical disease, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, yet they are not taught how to do this. More incriminating, medicine could prevent some 80 percent of heart disease and diabetes and 40 percent of cancers by addressing lifestyle factors. But it waits for cancer and heart disease to occur and then treats the problem.\n\n4. Although most people think medical education and research are scientifically based, the public will no doubt be aghast to learn that it does not follow modern scientific principles. Among all sciences, only medicine does not adhere to modern scientific theory: a systems view of life\u2014where physicians and other scientists must consider all parts of a problem and their interactions.2 Medicine\u2019s isolated disease focus omits the equally important psychological and social parts of its patients. More disturbing, medicine ignores the systems approach proposed for it in the 1970s, the biopsychosocial model. Demonstrably superior and research-based, the model links the patient\u2019s physical disease (biological) features with their psychological and social parts, thus integrating mental health care with medical care. Actively teaching the model would guarantee that the quality of mental health care matched physical disease care. Yet four centuries of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d by a now effete theoretical concept has left physicians immune to recognizing its profound shortcomings.\n\nExactly how do we initiate change? Inform the public. Typically, after citizens are informed and angry, they direct their politicians to confront refractory institutions. People knew little, for example, about the risks of automobiles and chemical pollutants. Then came Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader3 and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.4 These books made millions of Americans aware that seat belts saved lives and that we had poisonous DDT in our drinking water\u2014but that the auto and chemical industries refused to install seat belts and remove DDT for financial reasons. An irate US population insisted on change. That\u2019s why you have seat belts and clean water today. And a model for change\u2014informing the public."

            "article_content": "A film by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon, on PBS\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, a two-part, four-hour documentary by veteran filmmaker Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon, was broadcast on PBS in November. It is now available for streaming.\n\nThe film, deserving of a wide audience, is the first Burns production focused on a topic or person not American. In an interview, Burns noted that the similarities between Leonardo and Ben Franklin, a subject of one of his more recent productions, led him to consider examining the Italian Renaissance luminary.\n\nThe life story of Leonardo (1452\u20131519), one of history\u2019s most extraordinary intellects and artistic geniuses, always stirs the imagination.\n\nHis name evokes achievements that number among the pinnacles of human endeavor, and the boundless potential of human consciousness and activity. The terms \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201cpolymath\u201d so often used to describe his unquenchable intellect are certainly apt. But it is also the case that his emergence as the preeminent artistic and scientific thinker of the late 15th and early 16th centuries was no accident. Every historical period, from the most progressive to the most retrograde, thrusts up individuals who embody the essence of the epoch.\n\nThe Vitruvian Man, Leonardo da Vinci\n\nLeonardo\u2019s reputation rose as Europe and the Old World were recovering from one of the greatest catastrophes in human history, the horrific Black Death, the bubonic and pneumonic plague pandemics of the mid-14th century that wiped out a third of the populations of Europe, Central Asia, the Near East and North Africa. It should be noted that the year of Leonardo\u2019s birth was also the year in which Johannes Guttenberg invented the printing press.\n\nThe epoch of the Middle Ages was coming to an end, and with it came the first serious stirrings of a truly humanistic and secular society. The Renaissance that emerged in the flourishing and competitive Italian city-states, centers for banking and commerce, had their counterparts in the Flemish- and Dutch-speaking regions of Europe, and together they produced remarkable individuals whose artistic, scientific and literary accomplishments hold an honored place to this day.\n\nLeonardo\u2019s contemporaries in Florence included artists such as Sandro Botticelli and Fra Filippo Lippi. By the time Leonardo was in his 40s, Michelangelo had sculpted his Piet\u00e0, and shortly later a young Raphael was gaining widespread admiration for his art. Meanwhile, Machiavelli was developing some of the first political theories of bourgeois statecraft that would constitute his celebrated work, The Prince.\n\nLeonardo was given the name of his birth village, Vinci, a short distance from burgeoning Florence. As the two-part documentary points out, his birth out of wedlock automatically restricted the possibility of his receiving a formal education. Nevertheless, the contradictory character of the emerging epoch, the social order\u2019s liberating qualities coinciding with the rule of oligarchical families like the Medici in Florence, despite the continuing dominance of the Catholic Church, opened up opportunities for the brilliantly talented Leonardo. He became the apprentice of one of the most well-known artists of the period, Andrea del Verrocchio. In a short time, however, the student would surpass the teacher.\n\nGinevra de\u2019 Benci, Leonardo da Vinci\n\nThe Burns-McMahon effort includes narration in addition to insightful commentary from several of Leonardo\u2019s biographers, including Walter Isaacson, as well as Mexican filmmaker and Oscar recipient Guillermo del Toro. Their contributions add to our understanding of Leonardo as the representative of something new.\n\nLeonardo is described by commentators as an \u201cextremely rational\u201d man who saw in all phenomena, including human existence, an underlying symmetry. His copious notes, often written backwards as mirror images, and exquisite illustrations, remarkable in their detail, reveal that for him nothing in the world was simply given. Everything had to be examined, probed and dissected in order to be fully understood. The documentary highlights Leonardo\u2019s obsession with \u201csquaring the circle.\u201d He sought to reveal the deep connections between man and nature, and its illusive symmetry, immortalized in his famous drawing The Vitruvian Man, in honor of the Roman architect, Vitruvius.\n\nLeonardo referred to himself as a \u201cdisciple of experience,\u201d a not accidental phrase. He recognized that real insight could only be found by understanding the natural world, a profound conception that not only informed his artistic and scientific investigations, but more importantly established, at least in his own mind, their underlying unity. As one art historian has written, \u201cAs an artist and scientist, Leonardo came to his revolutionary belief in empirical observation as the foundation of all knowledge.\u201d (Leonardo da Vinci, Master Draftsman)\n\nHe is described by one contributor to the Burns series as not being particularly religious. In one extraordinary, albeit brief, segment in the PBS presentation, Leonardo\u2019s interest in philosophy leads him to a critique of Plato\u2019s approach of proceeding from the ideal to the world of real objects. Instead, in a remarkably materialistic interpretation of the path of cognition, Leonardo insists that it is through the study of the natural world that ideas are generated.\n\nMona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci\n\nLeonardo was the first artist to draw or paint landscapes, that is, to create works where the principal focus was on the natural world. His first such work was a detailed sketch of a section of the Arno river (which flows through Florence). In his paintings, the subjects in the foreground are invariably part of a greater whole. Leonardo\u2019s interest in mathematics allowed him to apply geometry to the creation of perspective, the \u201csingle point linear perspective,\u201d from which the idea of the \u201cvanishing point\u201d in painting originates.\n\nLeonardo sought to depict movement in everything he painted. His notebooks are packed with drawings of flying machines, of machines in general, that reveal a knowledge of physics. In fact, his study of falling objects anticipated the work of both Galileo and Newton. He was, as well, an expert in illustrating animal locomotion, particularly involving horses.\n\nHis drawings examining the human form and anatomy are unsurpassed, and his interest in human physiology would lead him to two important discoveries regarding the heart. When he was allowed to perform an autopsy on a man who lived to be 100, he discovered that in the interior of the man\u2019s arteries leading to the heart was a substance that he described as resembling a lemon clogging the openings. He concluded that this obstruction, a condition we now call atherosclerosis, was the cause of the man\u2019s death. His dissection of the corpse also revealed that the human heart had four chambers.\n\nAnother aspect of Leonardo\u2019s innovativeness in his paintings involved his portrayal of women. Leonardo broke with the practice of painting women\u2019s faces as profiles; inscrutable and unquestioning. Now they faced their viewer, as in the immortal painting Ginevra de\u2019 Benci. Later, his famed Mona Lisa would be the consummation of this attitude for all time.\n\nThe Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist, Leonardo da Vinci\n\nThe Burns-McMahon film deals succinctly with the artist\u2019s homosexuality, prompting the Los Angeles Times to disapprove: \u201cThe doc acknowledges its subject\u2019s homosexuality but doesn\u2019t fully explore the implications for an artist living in a repressive milieu.\u201d Actually, Burns does explore the implications of homosexuality in late 15th-century Italy without overstating its significance.\n\nAccording to the Burns mini-series, several young people were charged under the sodomy laws imposed by the Catholic Church, with Leonardo\u2019s name included. However, one of the youths involved was the son of a prominent Florentine family, and when the latter intervened, the charges were quickly dropped. Homosexual relations were widely tolerated during the early Renaissance, depending on the social circumstances, and a young boy \u201cgiven\u201d to Leonardo to be his trainee and assistant, Gian Giacomo Caprotti, nicknamed \u201cSalai\u201d (little devil) because of his meddlesomeness, became his life-long companion. His somewhat gender-ambiguous face appears in a number of Leonardo\u2019s paintings.\n\nThe Renaissance purported to be a return to the classical period of Greco-Roman culture, and a negation of the backwardness associated with the Middle Ages, especially in the centuries that followed the fall of the Roman Empire, the period known as the Dark Ages. However, the Catholic Church dominated official ideology. Artistic works, if not representations of the gods and goddesses of Greco-Roman mythology, treated religious themes, the most popular of these being depictions of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, the Madonna and Child theme.\n\nAs Leonardo was increasingly recognized for his artistic brilliance, he was given commissions to produce works of art by various religious institutions. He had developed a reputation, however, as a perfectionist who would see mistakes in his work that his patrons would either discount or be oblivious to. Thus, he would abandon many projects uncompleted. One such painting, undertaken somewhat later in life and commissioned by the King of France, was Leonardo\u2019s The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist.\n\nAdoration of the Magi, Leonardo da Vinci\n\nHowever, the most famous of these unfinished works was his painting of the Adoration of the Magi commissioned for a church in Scopeto, outside Florence\u2019s walls. The painting is spectacular and complex. While the theme is supposedly centered on the visit by the Magi (three wise men or kings) to the baby Jesus and Mary, there is much going on. Everywhere there is movement. In the background, there is a battle occurring, and surrounding the Madonna and child are numerous people talking to each other, some seemingly paying no attention. Even the Magi express a range of emotion from adoration to skepticism, and on the right, there is one visage turned away\u2014presumably, according to the Burns-McMahon series, a portrait of the artist himself.\n\nLeonardo subsequently left Florence for Milan, and worked under the patronage of Ludovico Sforza, \u201cil Moro [the Moor].\u201d One of his first works in Milan was a painting of the Duke\u2019s 16-year old daughter, Lady with an Ermine. But it was his mural The Last Supper that would be his crowning work in that city.\n\nWith The Last Supper, Leonardo\u2019s genius is on full display. In preparation for the work, Leonardo purchased a Bible translated into Italian so he could get a better understanding of the Apostles. His knowledge of geometry allowed hm to brilliantly frame the entire mural, placing Jesus at the center. But this was not some wooden depiction of the event but revealed instead the turmoil of Jesus\u2019 alleged last days, or as described by the narrator in the Burns presentation, the work created \u201charmony out of chaos.\u201d One sees in Leonardo\u2019s work the whole spectrum of human emotion; agitation and even fear, as Jesus is asking \u201cwho will betray me?\u201d Judas, the actual traitor, is watchful rather than alarmed. Then there\u2019s the woman (Mary Magdalene?) to Jesus\u2019s right apparently flirting with an Apostle.\n\nLady with an Ermine, Leonardo da Vinci\n\nThe Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov argued that the mural\u2019s subject\n\nis that highly dramatic moment in the relationship of Jesus to his disciples when he says: \u201cOne of you shall betray me.\u201d Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s task was to portray the state of mind of Jesus himself, who was deeply grieved by his dreadful discovery, and of his disciples, who could not believe there could be a traitor in their small company.\n\nLeonardo is reputed to have commented on completing The Last Supper, \u201cTell me \u2026 if anything is ever done.\u201d For Leonardo, everything was movement and change, and no work was truly finished. His final work, the iconic Mona Lisa was completed after returning to Florence in 1503. The city was recovering from the effects of the Catholic \u201creformer\u201d Girolamo Savonarola, who replaced the Medici until his execution in 1498.\n\nOf the Mona Lisa, Burns says the following:\n\nThe Mona Lisa is more than a portrait\u2014it\u2019s the culmination of a life spent exploring the fusion of art, science and the natural world, in which Leonardo captures the mysteries of the mind and the human experience.\n\nLeonardo died in 1519, just as the European political and cultural landscape was changing. The Protestant Reformation was in its early stages, with Marin Luther having posted his 95 grievances against the Catholic Church two years earlier. In England, Henry the VIII would force a break with the Vatican in the 1530s, and the writings of Shakespeare would later transform the English language and world literature.\n\nThe scientific revolution would begin with Copernicus and Galileo challenging and overthrowing the dogma of the Earth-centered universe. These profound changes would provoke a reaction by the Catholic Church with the Inquisition and later, the Counterreformation. Meanwhile, the Age of Exploration and the expansion of the European powers globally was underway.\n\nThe Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci\n\nThe decision of Burns and his collaborators to produce Leonardo da Vinci has borne fruitful results. Leonardo\u2019s life strongly tells us that the arrow of human progress still points up, and that all the problems facing mankind caused by a moribund capitalist system can be resolved.\n\nLeon Trotsky was optimistic about humanity\u2019s fate. He concluded Literature and Revolution (1924) with this remarkable passage:\n\nIt is difficult to predict the extent of self-government which the man of the future may reach or the heights to which he may carry his technique. Social construction and psychophysical self-education will become two aspects of one and the same process. All the arts\u2014literature, drama, painting, music, and architecture will lend this process beautiful form. More correctly, the shell in which the cultural construction and self-education of Communist man will be enclosed, will develop all the vital elements of contemporary art to the highest point. Man will become immeasurably stronger, wiser, and subtler; his body will become more harmonized, his movements more rhythmic, his voice more musical. The forms of life will become dynamically dramatic. The average human type will rise to the heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe, or a Marx. And above this ridge new peaks will rise.\n\nI would add Leonardo\u2019s name to those \u201cheights\u201d to which humans under socialism will rise and surpass."
