            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "2024 was another fabulous year for video game releases, and indie games truly shined all year long. This is normally the time when we\u2019d list our top 10 indies, and we do just that below. However, we also don\u2019t believe this year could be confined to a measly 10 games, even in indies. That\u2019s why we included 14 more.\n\nShacknews Top 24 Indies, 24 - 11\n\n24. Little Kitty, Big City\n\n23. Felvidek\n\n22. Card-en-Ciel\n\n19. Kamikaze Lassplanes\n\n19. Fields of Mistria\n\n19. Luma Island\n\n18. Isles of Sea and Sky\n\n17. Slitterhead\n\n16. Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore\n\n15. Thank Goodness You're Here!\n\n14. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes\n\n13. 1000xRESIST\n\n12. Tales of Kenzara: ZAU\n\n11. Penny's Big Breakaway\n\nCongrats to those that made our list, even if they couldn\u2019t be in the Top 10. Voting was tight this year and many of these games are that splendid and were hotly contested! Each of them is well worth a check if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t played them yet, so we wish them all congrats for launching this year. Without further ado. It\u2019s time to move on to Shacknews Top 10 Indie Games of 2024. Here they are:\n\n10. Crow Country\n\nThere's a lot of nostalgia wrapped up in 90s horror games, and it's quite special how the team behind Crow Country managed to perfectly capture not only the look, but the vibe and feel of those games with this year's indie horror hit.\n\nCrow Country dials up scares without an excessive use of jump scares or other cheap tactics. Instead, SFB Games uses atmosphere to unsettle its players. From the music and sound design to bizarre creature models, Crow Country nestles itself deep under your skin.\n\nThe mystery of Crow Country was fodder for countless YouTubers this year as the community collaborated to piece together the clues laid out by SFB Games. It takes a special kind of game to foster that sort of community, and Crow Country is an excellent ambassador for the indie horror space.\n\nCrow Country is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.\n\n9. The Axis Unseen\n\nThere was little doubt that Nate Purkeypile was going to give us a game to remember from the moment he revealed The Axis Unseen because regardless of where you stand on indies, first-person games, or survival games, this one is an incredible concept: A heavy metal-inspired survival game where you wander the wilderness with a bow, arrows, and supernatural powers as you hunt cryptids and they often hunt you in turn.\n\nPurkeypile came out of the gate looking all sorts of ambitious with this one. He was an early adopter of Unreal Engine 5 in the indie game dev community, and it was clear from early on how much UE5's streamlined asset creation and specialized tools were a boon to the experienced environmental designer. The Axis Unseen's wilderness is rich and wicked, featuring a vast forest full of hills, mountains, and creatures to discover.\n\nThe Axis Unseen's creature design is also on point. It starts with small, mostly benign critters that will really only attack you if you attack them. However, it's not long before you running into tree giants that can impale you with thorny branches and intense Bigfoot creatures that can beat your brains in a jiffy if they catch you. The smart use of your arrows and the powers you can imbue into them is the only way you stand a chance.\n\nWhen it came to 2024's gaming year, The Axis Unseen was maybe one of the most interesting indie stoies. Nate Purkeypile clearly had a distinct vision and the experience to know how he wanted to apply it, but his early work in UE5 feels like a story other indie devs should appreciate and study. Even then, how many other games let you try to outmaneuver and hunt Bigfoot amid outcroppings of giant radical horned skulls and creature skeletons?\n\nThe Axis Unseen is available on Steam and Epic Games Store platforms.\n\n8. Mouthwashing\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of games that unnerve us here at Shacknews. Mouthwashing more than unnerved us, it wormed its way into our brain, made is feel uncomfortable, unpleasant, and disgusted at what people are capable of doing. It\u2019s also hands-down one of the indie games this year.\n\nMouthwashing is a psychological horror game set aboard a cargo vessel that\u2019s transporting goods between planets. The crew is small, consisting of just five people, and as you might assume, tensions fray. The game kicks off with the ship colliding with a celestial body after someone sabotaged the flight controls.\n\nFrom this point onward, the narrative plays out along two timelines: the lead up to the crash and following the crash. You\u2019ll be walking around the ship, helping solve the issues that crop up, from general maintenance to smoothing over everyone\u2019s emotional state. But things go sideways quickly.\n\nMouthwashing instils a sense of impending dread as the crew fights to survive not just dwindling supplies, but their withering emotional and mental stability. It\u2019s a harrowing game that left us staring at our screens, mouth agape, as the credits rolled. Want to feel gut-punched? Play Mouthwashing.\n\nMouthwashing is available on the Steam platform.\n\n7. Another Crab's Treasure\n\nSince Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring have solidified what the souls-like genre is, there have been no lack of studios derivating on it. But few have made their version of this genre stand out from the regular Soulsborne vibe like Another Crab\u2019s Treasure. Instead of being a forsaken ethereal being wandering through a fallen kingdom or the remains of a ferocious war, you\u2019re a hermit crab named Kril who just wants his shell back after a literal loan shark takes it from him. With that, you wander the floor of an ocean where all the local life has taken a shine to human garbage that has littered the seabed. And so, it\u2019s an undersea souls-like in which your \u201csoul\u201d resources are trash and your various weapons are \u201cshells\u201d Kril can equip that give him unique powers.\n\nThe environment itself in Another Crab\u2019s Treasure is equal parts funny, pretty, and upsetting. Every area you go to has some level of natural undersea beauty to it, but it\u2019s tainted with the cheap veneer of repurposed garbage from the human world that sea creatures have become enamored with. What most of them don\u2019t know is that prolonged contact with that trash makes them crazy and violent.\n\nThat means Kril has to fight through insane creatures, many of which are much larger than him. What\u2019s a hermit crab to do? Well, that\u2019s where the shells come in. At any time, Kril can jump into a nearby soda can, banana peel, yogurt cup, or any other prop to defend himself as he fights back with his trusty crab fork and fishing hook. The shell also matters because each of them has a different power you can use to even the odds and stay alive. For instance, the soda can lets you dodge backwards and release a spray of bubbles that home in on a target. Using the right shell in the right situation is key if you\u2019re going to survive. It\u2019s challenging to play, but Aggro Crab was also brave enough to allow you to soften the difficulty, up to and including the ridiculous option to give Kril a gun.\n\nUltimately, Aggro Crab blends a solid display of comedy and charm with a stark undertone. Its funny crab and crazy fish are cute as heck, but they can also be scary and upsetting in near equal capacity. The environments have a similar energy. Put that together with responsive action and platforming under the sea and you just might see the value of Another Crab\u2019s Treasure.\n\nAnother Crab's Treasure is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.\n\n6. The Plucky Squire\n\nThe Plucky Squire immediately climbed our most anticipated games of the year list when got our first glimpse at its reality-bending art style. With the combination of 2D and 3D art styles, developer All Possible Futures is able to have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nNot only is The Plucky Squire satisfying to look at, it's fun to play, too. It's levels and puzzles are packed with homages to the classics of the genre, with enough originality to keep gameplay feeling fresh.\n\nPlaying through The Plucky Squire is like reading a storybook rich with humor and fun characters. We hope this isn't the last we see of this neat little universe.\n\nThe Plucky Squire is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n5. UFO 50\n\nWhen we learned the developers of Spelunky and its sequel were going to be developing a new game, we expected it would be something cool. What we could have never guessed was that it would be 50 somethings that were each, in fact, cool. UFO 50 is a collection like nothing else. It\u2019s an homage to a vast array of classic video game titles and might be the most ridiculously efficient bang for your gaming buck, especially since many of its included games turned out to be full-length titles.\n\nRight from the get-go Mossmouth allows players access to every single one of the 50 games in UFO 50. The idea is that a mysterious company released all these games in obscurity. They all hearken back to the days of 80s arcades and home platforms, with some being very short and easy to beat while others are like full-length RPGs of the time that could take hours to complete.\n\nThey\u2019re a pretty awesome spread of titles too. Action, horror, sports, adventure, puzzle, and even narrative journeys are among those included here. Heck, there are even homages to metroidvanias, first-person dungeon crawlers, and narrative horror like NES\u2019s Uninvited, Deja Vu, and Shadowgate. Yet somehow, Mossmouth was able to also pack in its signature charm and humor in most cases, making this an altogether incredible collection.\n\nUFO 50 is a very easy game to recommend to anyone at any age because of the way it\u2019s set up. There\u2019s something for just about everyone here, and pretty much all of these games are worth trying at least once. We don\u2019t know what compelled Mossmouth to pack 50 different games into a single title, but we can\u2019t help but applaud the absolute madness and the quality that each title contains.\n\nUFO 50 is available on the Steam platform.\n\n4. Neva\n\nNeva delivered one of the year's most beautiful narratives with the tale of woman's bond with a wolf. It explores the relationship between a person and their animal companion, poignantly examining the highs and lows that entail.\n\nVisually, Neva is one of the year's most stunning games. Every location is picturesque, beautiful vistas juxtaposed against a decaying world.\n\nNeva is also a competent platformer, providing a decent challenge throughout its 5-6 hours of gameplay. That said, those in it for the narrative can opt to play in Story Mode.\n\nNeva is a reminder of the impact that video games can have, and that some of the best stories in games reside in the indie space.\n\nNeva is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n3. Pacific Drive\n\nPacific Drive saw an early release in 2024, but Ironwood Studios\u2019 sci-fi driving survival game got its hooks in and stayed with us well throughout the year. In all of 2024 gaming (and really beyond it for that matter), there was nothing quite like what Pacific Drive brought to the table. Moreover, its environments, music, and narrative were great enough to make sure that when this year\u2019s Shacknews Awards deliberations came around, it was still solidified in our minds as one of this year\u2019s most unique titles.\n\nIn Pacific Drive, you are a mysterious investigator that ventures into the mountainous forest region of the Pacific Northwest to a place known as the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Serious environmental experiments and oddities occurred in this place which led to the government building a barrier around it to keep what was inside, inside, and what was outside, outside. Obviously your intrusion means it didn\u2019t quite work, but it also isn\u2019t long before you discover a seemingly innocuous station wagon that acts as your getaway from a rough situation. And shortly after that, you discover folks that were both studying the Zone and got trapped by it. You also find a garage, which plays a big role in the rest of your journey.\n\nTo escape the Zone (theoretically) you\u2019ll need to venture deeper into it and collect energy from anomalous sites to power various experimental machinery. The Zone is a pretty fragile place, so every journey into a new area finds you traversing randomized stretches of dense forests and hills in the Station Wagon as you loot the supplies you need, build the tools that make things easier, and generally try to keep your station wagon maintained. After all, there\u2019s also freakish anomalies that can be a danger to you and the car such as autonomous piles of electrified scrap. Also, when you take the energy you need from a place in the Zone, that area\u2019s stability will collapse and it\u2019s a race to get out alive.\n\nGetting back to the garage and being able to recuperate with your pillaged resources was brief recompense, and it also feels therapeutic to repair and upgrade your car for the next adventure. You can even paint and put decals on it to make it truly your own. All of these things together made Pacific Drive a game unlike really anything else this year, and Ironwood Studios deserves to be celebrated for such an interesting journey, not to mention assembling such a perfect sci-fi roadtrip soundtrack with all of the good vibes of a personal mixtape.\n\nPacific Drive is available on PlayStation, and Steam platforms.\n\n2. Animal Well\n\nEveryone knew Animal Well was special the moment they laid eyes on it. The cute and unassuming pixel art style of a dark and lonely world was just dripping with mysteries to solve. Then it released and everyone realized the genius at work in Billy Basso\u2019s head.\n\nAnimal Well is a Metroidvania unlike anything that has come before it. There\u2019s no combat to be found, and as a tiny little critter, your only course of action against any threat is to run \u2013 or use the cleverly designed tools to your advantage.\n\nYou see, you\u2019re not going to get something as straightforward as unlocking double-jump or a grapple hook. You\u2019re going to get a Frisbee, a yo-yo, and other childhood toys. It\u2019s not even going to be clear how these things work and how you might use them to solve the game\u2019s myriad puzzles and navigate its dense, secret-packed world.\n\nBut when you do figure out how to use these items, you\u2019ll see the world differently. These little light bulb moments happen constantly throughout Animal Well as you engage in one of the best puzzle-platforming games this year.\n\nThough it hasn\u2019t secured our Indie Game of the Year 2024 award, it has come remarkably close and remains a favorite among the staff here at Shacknews. If you\u2019re a fan of unassuming indie games that have a tendency to blow your mind, you need to do yourself a favor and check out Animal Well.\n\nAnimal Well is available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\n1. Balatro\n\nThinking back over the past few decades at Shacknews, the staff is hard-pressed to think of any indie game that has garnered such universal acclaim or been as accomplished as Balatro. There have been memorable indie titles over the years. Games like Journey, Gone Home, and Hades come to mind as true standout efforts. Yet Balatro feels like it stands above them all. It certainly stands out over an incredibly stacked field of outstanding indie titles in 2024.\n\nFor solo developer LocalThunk to build on a relatively simple idea and captivate the entire gaming world has been nothing short of impressive. A poker roguelike sounds like a simple idea in theory, but the execution and the way it all came together has been special. Thousands of players across multiple platforms continue to try and chase high scores, just like in gaming days of old, all while utilizing well thought-out strategies and rolling with whatever luck befalls them. There are few sensations better in gaming right now than when a Balatro run comes together with the right combinations of rare Jokers, enhanced cards, and Boss Blinds that somehow manage not to upend the entire outing.\n\nThe Balatro formula is so easy to get into and drives its hooks in deep. It's part of why the Shacknews staff feared the day that it came to mobile devices, because it's the kind of game that's perfect to play on-the-go. It ranks up with historic handheld greats like Tetris and Dr. Mario in terms of easy accessibility and \"one more game\" loops that never seem to end.\n\nLocalThunk's efforts have been remarkable. It's amazing to see a single artist put the bulk of the work into such an expertly crafted game. It's the kind of phenomenon that gaming may never see for a long time. Shacknews was privileged to see the tale of Balatro play out over the course of 2024 and we're happy to name it the Shacknews Best Indie Game of 2024.\n\nBalatro is available on Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam platforms.\n\nCheck out our Shacknews Indie Game of the Year 2024 - Balatro article to read more.\n\nWe salute everyone who released a game in this very difficult year for so many game developers. We couldn\u2019t do our jobs without these amazing creators. Thank you for another year of amazing indie games and congratulations to everyone who made our Shacknews Top 24 Indie Games of the Year 2024 list.\n\nBe sure to read over the rest of the Shacknews Awards in our Year of the Games: 2024 feature."

            "article_content": "An artist's impression of a hot exoplanet.\n\nAstronomers have unveiled the discovery of two Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting a star more than 40 light-years from our planet, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing quest to identify potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. A team of researchers have outlined their findings in a paper published on the pre-print server arXiv and shared by phys.org. The star, HD 101581, also catalogued as GJ 435, is a K5V-type orange dwarf star located about 42 light years away. The two confirmed exoplanets, designated HD 101581 b and HD 101581 c, were identified through meticulous observations using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during its 63rd and 64th observation sectors. These planets exhibit radii comparable to Earth's, with HD 101581 b measuring approximately 0.956 times Earth's radius and HD 101581 c about 0.990 times. Their orbital periods are notably brief, with HD 101581 b completing a revolution around its host star every 4.47 days and HD 101581 c every 6.21 days.\n\nArtist's impression of the James Webb Telescope.\n\nAdditionally, a third candidate planet, HD 101581 d, has been detected, though its existence awaits further confirmation. If validated, this planet would also be Earth-sized, with an orbital period of approximately 7.9 days. The discovery of these Earth-sized exoplanets is especially compelling due to their relative proximity to our solar system, which facilitates more detailed study. Nevertheless, their close orbits to HD 101581 suggest that they are subjected to intense stellar radiation, resulting in higher surface temperatures than Earth's. This likely renders them inhospitable to life as we know it. Despite the remote possibility that they could harbour life, the planets offer invaluable opportunities for scientific investigation.\n\nRecent images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Such research contributes to the broader objective of identifying Earth-like planets within habitable zones, where conditions may be conducive to life. This discovery arrives at a pivotal moment. The astronomical community anticipates a surge in exoplanet research in 2025, propelled by data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

            "article_content": "A new artificial intelligence (AI) model has just achieved human-level results on a test designed to measure \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d.\n\nOn December 20, OpenAI\u2019s o3 system scored 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, well above the previous AI best score of 55% and on par with the average human score. It also scored well on a very difficult mathematics test.\n\nCreating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is the stated goal of all the major AI research labs. At first glance, OpenAI appears to have at least made a significant step towards this goal.\n\nWhile scepticism remains, many AI researchers and developers feel something just changed. For many, the prospect of AGI now seems more real, urgent and closer than anticipated. Are they right?\n\nGeneralisation and intelligence\n\nTo understand what the o3 result means, you need to understand what the ARC-AGI test is all about. In technical terms, it\u2019s a test of an AI system\u2019s \u201csample efficiency\u201d in adapting to something new \u2013 how many examples of a novel situation the system needs to see to figure out how it works.\n\nAn AI system like ChatGPT (GPT-4) is not very sample efficient. It was \u201ctrained\u201d on millions of examples of human text, constructing probabilistic \u201crules\u201d about which combinations of words are most likely.\n\nThe result is pretty good at common tasks. It is bad at uncommon tasks, because it has less data (fewer samples) about those tasks.\n\nUntil AI systems can learn from small numbers of examples and adapt with more sample efficiency, they will only be used for very repetitive jobs and ones where the occasional failure is tolerable.\n\nThe ability to accurately solve previously unknown or novel problems from limited samples of data is known as the capacity to generalise. It is widely considered a necessary, even fundamental, element of intelligence.\n\nGrids and patterns\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark tests for sample efficient adaptation using little grid square problems like the one below. The AI needs to figure out the pattern that turns the grid on the left into the grid on the right.\n\nEach question gives three examples to learn from. The AI system then needs to figure out the rules that \u201cgeneralise\u201d from the three examples to the fourth.\n\nThese are a lot like the IQ tests sometimes you might remember from school.\n\nWeak rules and adaptation\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how OpenAI has done it, but the results suggest the o3 model is highly adaptable. From just a few examples, it finds rules that can be generalised.\n\nTo figure out a pattern, we shouldn\u2019t make any unnecessary assumptions, or be more specific than we really have to be. In theory, if you can identify the \u201cweakest\u201d rules that do what you want, then you have maximised your ability to adapt to new situations.\n\nWhat do we mean by the weakest rules? The technical definition is complicated, but weaker rules are usually ones that can be described in simpler statements.\n\nIn the example above, a plain English expression of the rule might be something like: \u201cAny shape with a protruding line will move to the end of that line and \u2018cover up\u2019 any other shapes it overlaps with.\u201d\n\nSearching chains of thought?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know how OpenAI achieved this result just yet, it seems unlikely they deliberately optimised the o3 system to find weak rules. However, to succeed at the ARC-AGI tasks it must be finding them.\n\nWe do know that OpenAI started with a general-purpose version of the o3 model (which differs from most other models, because it can spend more time \u201cthinking\u201d about difficult questions) and then trained it specifically for the ARC-AGI test.\n\nFrench AI researcher Francois Chollet, who designed the benchmark, believes o3 searches through different \u201cchains of thought\u201d describing steps to solve the task. It would then choose the \u201cbest\u201d according to some loosely defined rule, or \u201cheuristic\u201d.\n\nThis would be \u201cnot dissimilar\u201d to how Google\u2019s AlphaGo system searched through different possible sequences of moves to beat the world Go champion.\n\nYou can think of these chains of thought like programs that fit the examples. Of course, if it is like the Go-playing AI, then it needs a heuristic, or loose rule, to decide which program is best.\n\nThere could be thousands of different seemingly equally valid programs generated. That heuristic could be \u201cchoose the weakest\u201d or \u201cchoose the simplest\u201d.\n\nHowever, if it is like AlphaGo then they simply had an AI create a heuristic. This was the process for AlphaGo. Google trained a model to rate different sequences of moves as better or worse than others.\n\nWhat we still don\u2019t know\n\nThe question then is, is this really closer to AGI? If that is how o3 works, then the underlying model might not be much better than previous models.\n\nThe concepts the model learns from language might not be any more suitable for generalisation than before. Instead, we may just be seeing a more generalisable \u201cchain of thought\u201d found through the extra steps of training a heuristic specialised to this test. The proof, as always, will be in the pudding.\n\nAlmost everything about o3 remains unknown. OpenAI has limited disclosure to a few media presentations and early testing to a handful of researchers, laboratories and AI safety institutions.\n\nTruly understanding the potential of o3 will require extensive work, including evaluations, an understanding of the distribution of its capacities, how often it fails and how often it succeeds.\n\nWhen o3 is finally released, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of whether it is approximately as adaptable as an average human.\n\nIf so, it could have a huge, revolutionary, economic impact, ushering in a new era of self-improving accelerated intelligence. We will require new benchmarks for AGI itself and serious consideration of how it ought to be governed.\n\nIf not, then this will still be an impressive result. However, everyday life will remain much the same.\n\nMichael Timothy Bennett, PhD Student, School of Computing, Australian National University and Elija Perrier, Research Fellow, Stanford Center for Responsible Quantum Technology, Stanford University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "THE OpenAI, founded a decade ago as a research organization, is considering a change to the AI company\u2019s structure that would create a more conventional money-making corporation alongside a nonprofit arm.\n\nThe board is evaluating a plan that would turn OpenAI\u2019s business into a public benefit corporation\u2014an entity free to pursue income but with the goal of bettering society\u2014while retaining a nonprofit side, according to a blog post Friday. As part of the new structure, the nonprofit arm would hold shares in the moneymaking entity.\n\nBloomberg previously reported that the company was considering such a move and has been in talks with regulators in California and Delaware about the potential change. Friday\u2019s announcement signals that the board is poised to move forward with a restructuring.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s existing for-profit arm is currently controlled by its nonprofit organization. Under the proposal, the business would become a Delaware Public Benefit Corp., or PBC. The nonprofit entity would continue to exist as one of the \u201cbest-resourced nonprofits in history\u201d and would then hold a \u201csignificant interest\u201d in the for-profit arm, in the form of shares determined by independent financial advisers at a fair valuation, OpenAI\u2019s board said.\n\nWhen OpenAI was founded in 2015, it adopted the idealistic mission of building artificial intelligence that would be safe and beneficial to humanity. In 2019, OpenAI created the for-profit subsidiary to help fund the high costs of AI model development. By 2022, when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT chatbot, the company became a superpower in the artificial intelligence industry\u2014and put its operations under greater scrutiny.\n\nA simplified for-profit structure is considered more attractive to investors, although it could raise questions about whether the San Francisco-based company is sticking with its original public mission. Elon Musk, a co-founder and early investor in OpenAI, filed a lawsuit against the company in August accusing it of breaching an agreement to operate as a nonprofit. Musk recently asked a federal court to block OpenAI from pursuing a conversion to a for-profit business while his legal fight plays out.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s board said the proposed plan will ensure the company\u2019s for-profit arm is successful in the long term. It will help the nonprofit raise funds and better execute on its mission, according to the post.\n\n\u201cWe once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined,\u201d the board said. \u201cInvestors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.\u201d\n\nThe board said the plan that it\u2019s considering would better equip OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education and science."

            "article_content": "The ChatGPT logo at an office in Washington. Under the new organisation, the non-profit will own shares in the for-profit, similar to outside investors, and the for-profit will fund the charitable mission of the non-profit. \u2014 AFP file\n\nOpenAI on Friday laid out a plan to transition its for-profit arm into a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC) to help it raise capital and stay ahead in the costly AI race against companies such as Google.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new structure aims to potentially make a more investor-friendly corporation, while maintaining a mission of funding a related charity.\n\nRivals including Anthropic have also adopted the PBC structure to balance societal interests along with shareholder value.\n\nWhat is a public benefit corporation?\n\nWhile both PBCs and traditional corporations are for-profit entities, PBCs are legally required to pursue one or more public benefits, including social and environmental goals.\n\nDelaware amended its general corporation law to allow the formation of PBCs in 2013 and as of December 2023, there were 19 publicly traded PBCs, according to research by Jens Dammann of the University of Texas.\n\nIn its blog, OpenAI described the current structure as \u201ca for-profit, controlled by the non-profit, with a capped profit share for investors and employees\u201d.\n\nUnder the new organisation, the non-profit will own shares in the for-profit, similar to outside investors, and the for-profit will fund the charitable mission of the non-profit.\n\n\u201cThe PBC will run and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while the non-profit will hire a leadership team and staff to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as healthcare, education, and science,\u201d it said.\n\nDifference between a PBC and other corporate structures\n\nUnlike PBCs, non-profit corporations do not have shareholders and reinvest profits into their mission rather than distributing them to individuals.\n\nPBCs do not receive special tax exemptions or incentives, while non-profits are generally exempted from federal income taxes if they meet certain requirements.\n\nLimitations of PBCs\n\nBecoming a benefit corporation does not guarantee a company will put its stated mission above profit, as the law only legally requires the board to \u201cbalance\u201d its mission and profit-making interests, said Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane Law School.\n\nDelaware law does require the company to report on its progress towards the goals to shareholders, who, in practice, dictate how closely a PBC sticks to its mission, Lipton said. \u201cThe only reason to choose benefit form over any other corporate form is the declaration to the public. It doesn\u2019t actually have any real enforcement power behind it,\u201d Lipton added. Some legal experts also say that publicly traded PBCs are more susceptible to takeovers, as bidders can argue the company lacks profit maximisation or that its public benefit goals conflict with the bidder\u2019s objectives. Some existing PBCs Anthropic and xAI: OpenAI\u2019s rivals, Anthropic and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI have also adopted PBCs. Allbirds: Allbirds is a San Francisco-based PBC that sells sustainable shoes and apparel made from natural materials. Kickstarter: Kickstarter is a New York-based PBC that maintains a global crowdfunding platform for creative projects. Patagonia: Patagonia is a California-based retailer of outdoor recreation clothing, equipment and food. The company has contributed over $230 million to environmental organisations, according to its website.\n\nWarby Parker: Warby Parker is a New York-based manufacturer and retailer of eyewear products. The company\u2019s \u201cBuy a Pair, Give a Pair\u201d policy aims to help people in need."

            "article_content": "For anyone living under a social media rock, #vanlife has become one of the biggest viral trends of the last few years.\n\nTaking off during the pandemic, on TikTok the hashtag has been viewed more than 12 billion times, with a further 15 million posts on Instagram.\n\nThe nomadic way of life is popular with (mainly) young people, and preceded the 'underconsumption core' lifestyle.\n\nGolden sunsets, expansive beaches, fairy lights and romantic filters; living out of a van is as Instagram aesthetic as it gets (on the surface).\n\nBut what about living out of an electric car? Could that be the most eco and luxury van life possible? Or is the reality just a photo opportunity but a holiday to avoid?\n\nThis is Money\u2019s Freda Lewis-Stempel took a new Tesla Model Y with its own specially designed 'Air Mattress' and \u2018Camp Mode\u2019 to one of the remotest islands in the UK to find out....\n\nCan you really sleep in a Tesla? This is Money's Motoring Reporter Freda Lewis-Stempel puts the electric car version of the #vanlife trend to a very remote test....\n\nHow the Model Y is designed for 'van life' glamping?\n\nIt makes sense to first explain how Tesla has taken the American \u2018van life\u2019 idea and added special features to the Model Y SUV to make it double up as a home on wheels.\n\nTesla Air Mattress: This \u00a3200 blow-up mattress has been designed to fit the rear of the car perfectly when the back seats are folded down. Penned on tracing paper, it has the cutouts in precisely the correct places in order for it to sit flush to the floor around wheel arches and arm rests.\n\nIt pumps up almost instantly when connected to the car's 12V outlet in the boot.\n\nJust roll the air mattress out, plug the air pump into the 12V, slot the air pump nozzle into the air mattress intake, turn the air pump on and watch it inflate.\n\nAt this point you can decide to go full glamping \u2018boujee\u2019 and bring a sheet, pillows and duvet like we did, or you can go more pop-up tent style and just use a sleeping bag and inflatable pillow.\n\nTesla has a specially shaped Air Mattress for its Model Y SUV that inflates to turn the car into a bed for the night\n\nTesla's Camp Mode is another sleeping-friendly feature that keeps the cabin at the perfect temperature overnight to make sure you don't get too hot or cold\n\nCamp Mode: Sort of genius from Tesla, Camp Mode maintains the optimum temperature and airflow within the cabin while you sleep so you don\u2019t wake up freezing cold or boiling hot in the middle of the night.\n\nIt also maintains the lighting setup you want or even music or a podcast if that helps you sleep.\n\nThere's even a Camp Profile which remembers your preferences and sets them automatically when you want to conk out for the night.\n\nTo enter Camp Mode, just tap the temperature menu icon on the bottom of the screen and select Camp (or use the Tesla app).\n\nSentry Mode, auto lock and the Model Y\u2019s alarm system are all disabled with Camp Mode so the alarm doesn\u2019t go off every time you exist - just remember to lock the car yourself while you sleep!\n\nWhy Scotland? Scotland is popular for wild camping because of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, which gives everyone the right to access Scotland's outdoor spaces. You can park and camp by the side of the road as long as you aren't blocking access or parked dangerously. The Outdoor Access Code does stipulate you should camp away from roads, but campervans frequently park in larger lay-bys. As some of the most remote and dramatic countryside in the UK, especially on the islands, Scotland is also a brilliant place to put EV charging and range anxiety to the test too.\n\nDay 1/night 1: Regrettable decision? It can only get better...\n\nMy plucky school friend and I left London at around 5.30pm to drive up to the Peak District.\n\nIt was all going swimmingly, cruising up the M6 in the warm, extremely comfortable and smooth Model Y.\n\nThough I tend to find Teslas a bit clinical (or 'spaceship-y', as my friend said) for long journeys, their performance is undeniably strong.\n\nThe space, comfort, and how Teslas hold their range makes driving for hours minimum effort, and the Y was no different.\n\nDeciding to charge at the Superchargers near Stoke-on-Trent - because we didn't know how much range Camp Mode would use overnight - we snuck in the back door of a restaurant nearby to use the loo to brush our teeth and get ready for 'bed\u2019.\n\nThere were a few funny looks as we set the air mattress up for the night at the Superchargers (so we didn\u2019t have to figure it out for the first time in the middle of nowhere in the pitch-black Peaks), but it was very easy to set up.\n\nWhile the Y finished charging, we used the Theatre function - which has Netflix, YouTube, Hulu etc - to watch the different Christmas adverts on the touchscreen; Waitrose\u2019s \u2018who dunnit\u2019 was of course the clear winner.\n\nThanks to Tesla's Theatre suite we could watch all the Christmas adverts on YouTube while the car charged\n\nBrushing your teeth and washing your face in a restaurant loo near a Tesla Supercharger is the glamorous reality of Tesla living\n\nThen we drove off in search of our sleeping spot in the wild for the night.\n\nWe\u2019d pre-selected a place using the Park4night app, but driving up to a lay-by under a remote bridge and encountering just one guy and his camper van we got the heebie-jeebies and decided to find an alternative.\n\nThe only other option nearby was a lay-by/field gate entrance, and (after accidentally driving through someone\u2019s farmyard) we decided this was the best of two rather unappealing options, as it was already almost midnight.\n\nOff to bed (a bed that was as steep as Everest because the parking spot was on a sharp incline) I awoke just over four hours later at 4.55am.\n\nMy friend had seemingly disappeared. In a bleary state, I thought she'd been abducted, but thankfully she\u2019d just moved to the front seat to try and sleep.\n\nTurning the headlights on, we had a near heart attack (my second in 10 minutes) when they picked up a Land Rover Discovery that had silently turned up sometime between 12.40 and 4.55am.\n\nConvincing ourselves we weren\u2019t going to end up as front page horror story news, we tried to get back to sleep.\n\nIt was at this point we learnt two valuable EV glamping lessons: never park on an incline and an overinflated Air Mattress is, as I ruefully summarised, like sleeping on a slab of rock.\n\nWaking up in Leek in Staffordshire wasn't the most picturesque first wake up in the Tesla I'd envisioned as the beautiful countryside was hidden in fog and we'd had 4 hours of sleep each\n\nI failed to fall back to sleep, but my friend did, so I watched a very cold and wet dawn creep in through the windows and panoramic sunroof.\n\nI also watched two other cars come and go \u2013 one of which was a hunter\u2019s van containing three Hound of the Baskervilles-sized hunting dogs.\n\nIn the end, my friend and I ended up getting four hours sleep each.\n\nIt wasn't a great way to kick-off but thanks to the Camp Mode we were at least nice and warm. And, as only a year before we'd spent a night in the Peaks in minus five degrees on top a Jeep Wrangler in a Tentbox, we knew how absolutely brutal car 'glamping' really can be in cold weather.\n\nGoing for a brisk wake-up walk around 8am, we packed down the Air Mattress and set off for our pre-Scotland charging and feed stop at Tebay.\n\nDay 2/night 2: How much difference a day can make\n\nThe Tebay pit stop seriously perked us both up.\n\nThe car had a full charge on the Superchargers - we were charging to 100 per cent, which isn't as good for the battery as charging to 80 per cent but it's sensible for wilderness camping to have maximum range - while I managed a nap.\n\nThe nap was followed by a shower (you swap your car key for the shower key at Tebay and it\u2019s free to use), and we both scoffed full English breakfasts.\n\nThen it was back into the car for another three hours of driving up to Edinburgh for an afternoon 'city break'.\n\nThe roads were opening up and the scenery became road trip goals - in my opinion the best motorway driving in the UK is the Cumbria-Borders stretch - and everything was looking up.\n\nEdinburgh was a chance to get some steps and movement in, and a bit of big city excitement before the total and utter isolation that the next sleeping spot would bring.\n\nWe'd pre-planned to sleep in a very remote valley between Edinburgh and the Ardrossan ferry terminal where we had a 9am ferry to catch the next morning.\n\nI wanted to try Edinburgh public charging because it has a bad reputation, and although I did manage to find a charger, for a capital city Edinburgh charging has some way to go\n\nWe drove for about three hours to walk around Edinburgh and find some hot food before our next lay-by camp\n\nI also wanted to test Edinburgh's EV charging infrastructure because it has a bad reputation for being underprovided.\n\nIn reality this is unfortunately true - considering it\u2019s the capital of Scotland the charging options are pretty slim.\n\nWe weren\u2019t fussy and didn\u2019t mind what speed we charged, but that didn't really help. There weren't many chargers and almost all of them were in use.\n\nAnd unlike London, Edinburgh doesn't have lots of lamppost chargers, so all the on-street chargers are taken by residents.\n\nWe did, however, find one fast charger near George Street, so we walked around Edinburgh and had some hot food while the Model Y slow charged back up to 100 per cent.\n\nAt around 6pm we drove off to find our next Park4night place.\n\nThe second night camping location was the stuff of Instagram posts - although murky weather the remote Scottish hills were beautiful and it felt safe which led to a great nights' sleep\n\nThe Model Y has massive windows and a huge panoramic roof so you get 360 views when you wake up\n\nThis time we wanted the spot to be as isolated as possible, and we found it; a single-track road about 30 minutes from the coast without a soul in sight. Not a star, not an animal \u2013 nothing. And it felt so much safer.\n\nI should explain that my school friend and I both grew up in very remote parts of Herefordshire and Shropshire so having no-one around feels safer to us than having people nearby, but over people might entirely disagree with this logic.\n\nFeeling far more secure than night one allowed us to relax into our bedtime camping 'routine' (i.e. cleaning our teeth with water from a bottle).\n\nAnd we got the bed blowing-up level right this time, which meant the Air Mattress went from being a slab of rock to incredibly comfortable.\n\nWhile we could use the Tesla Model Y's Theatre mode again, part of the relaxation of camping is winding down reading a book\n\nThen we got the Camp Mode temperature perfect, read our books and drifted off to sleep in our very cosy hotel on wheels. We slept like logs.\n\nI woke about 6am to a glorious stormy Scottish dawn sky, and an empty valley of mountains.\n\nIt was everything I\u2019d thought Tesla living would be. And the night became an amusing memory.\n\nDay three/night three: Tesla living on the Isle of Arran - as good as glamping gets\n\nScotland has 'right-to-access' laws so it's much easier to camp in a car in Scotland than England. A place as remote as the Isle of Arran is a real test for glamping in an EV\n\nStarting off at 7.20am to drive 20 minutes for an ultra-rapid top-up before we boarded the Ardrossan car ferry, we pulled up at the InstaVolt chargers outside Stevenston McDonalds. Who doesn't love a retail park and a Maccies hash brown before 8am?\n\nThe loos gave us the chance to brush our teeth and clean our faces while the car went from around 80 to 100 per cent charge - after all, glamping is all about glamour.\n\nThe Model Y Long Range AWD has a range of 373 miles which gives you around 330/340 real world range.\n\nWe didn't actually need to be at 100 per cent before going across to the Isle of Arran - which is only 56 miles in circumference - but, while there are a few chargers in the 'capital' of Arran (Brodrick), ZapMap said they only take RFID cards so we played it very over safe.\n\nWe put the car on some Instavolt ultra-rapid chargers near the ferry port before we boarded\n\nWhile living out of a Tesla you have to find food and washing facilities wherever you can, and sometimes it's McDonalds or nothing (even at 8am)\n\nSentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app\n\nBoarding the Ardrossan ferry, we were in excellent EV company with the four cars nearest us all being EVs. Clearly range anxiety isn't a thing in the Scottish Isles.\n\nDuring the 55 minute crossing, Sentry Mode - Tesla's anti-theft feature which records footage using the car's threat detecting external cameras and sensors - came into its own during the crossing, as did the Tesla app in general.\n\nI felt very smug knowing that the none of the many car alarms going off belonged to the Model Y because the Tesla app hadn't alerted me to any issues.\n\nWe also had far too much fun watching ourselves on the Sentry Mode cameras disembarking the ferry as we sat waiting for the cars in front to drive off.\n\nFor the rest of the day we drove around Arran, enjoying the freedom of the car and lack of time restraints, like hotel check-ins, and simply let nature lead us. We went for a walk, swam in the very cold sea, and watched the wildlife - Arran is famous for its seals.\n\nThe Isle of Arran only has four public chargers and you can only get a ferry to the mainland: There are three in Brodrick and one near Blackwaterfoot so you can really test range anxiety\n\nDriving around the Isle of Arran with no check-in times to abide by we could enjoy the scenery and outdoor pursuits to our own schedule\n\nTesla's cabin pre-conditioning feature on the app was also a godsend for when we wanted to come back to a warm car and heated seats and steering wheel after a freezing dip.\n\nWhile our day activities were quite messy, the Tesla and its vegan seats were very easy to keep clean.\n\nAs a living in a car goes it was remarkably easy to stay tidy and the vast storage throughout meant we were never short of space for our stuff.\n\nThe Model Y has 854 litres of boot space as well as a 117-litre frunk: more than enough space for all our 'glamping' stuff and the front trunk became a designated space for wet swimming costumes, towels and muddy boats.\n\nThe hooks above the passenger doors were also useful to hang our clothes to dry.\n\nThe Tesla has lots of space, and it was very easy to keep clean. Even if we left the bed in place, we still had plenty of space for our bags and the frunk meant we could separate wet clothes\n\nAlthough the Model Y has bi-directional charging (where you can power appliances from the car), we didn't take a kettle or camping chairs mainly because, without an awning or a settled camping spot, sitting outside in the bracing Scottish winter wind didn't seem very appealing.\n\nWhile the car means you can go anywhere, anytime, playing everything by ear also has its downfalls: We drove to get dinner at 6pm on the far side of the island only to be told the restaurant was fully-booked.\n\nAlthough we did eventually manage to have a very early dinner at a hotel near Brodrick, the Tesla glamping lesson of the day here would be to at least pre-book your meal reservations, especially if it's out of season.\n\nParked up against the sea, Tesla camping on the Isle of Arran is truly an amazing experience\n\nDuring the afternoon, we'd driven from the north west of Arran across to the north east and had passed many a lovely, big, isolated lay-by, noting a few that we'd be happy to park for the night in (frankly we were spoilt for choice on Arran).\n\nAmusingly (or mildly concerningly depending how you look at it), I'd turned to my friend as I eyed up one particular lay-by (the one we ended up choosing) and said; 'I'll never look at a lay-by the same way again'. She said she'd been thinking the exact same thing.\n\nIn the space of a few nights, Tesla camping had changed us - we'd become discerning connoisseurs of lay-bys. I will forever look at scenic lay-by and think 'that looks like a very nice place to spend the night in an EV'.\n\nIn the end, we chose one glorious lay-by near the sea, and with our glamping night routine down to a T, we settled in for our last sleep.\n\nWe watched Netflix's Nobody Wants This from our Air Mattress bed, thoroughly enjoying the Model Y mobile cinema offered to modern day EV nomads, and the brooding backdrop of the dark Scottish hills.\n\nWaiting to board the ferry back to mainland UK: Is Tesla glamping for the fainthearted? No. But is it a fantastic adventure? Yes.\n\nIt felt sad to say goodbye to our house on wheels on the drive home as we'd become quite attached\n\nThe next morning, after we had one last cold sea swim before boarding the ferry to begin our drive back to London, we both agreed we'd happily spend another three nights sleeping in the Tesla.\n\nLiving out of one? No. Glamping out of one again? Without a doubt.\n\nJust make sure your friends are up for an adventure and aren't at all precious..."

            "article_content": "The meme coin market has been buzzing, hasn\u2019t it? Every few months, a new quirky token emerges, setting the internet on fire and sending crypto enthusiasts into a frenzy. With the overall crypto market adapting to economic turbulence, meme coins have shown surprising resilience and creativity. Their blend of community spirit and innovative utility is a massive draw. If you thought 2023 was meme coin madness, wait till you see what 2024 has in store. Among this vibrant chaos, one coin that\u2019s stealing the show is BTFD Coin (BTFD). Let\u2019s just say, if you\u2019re chasing returns, you might want to keep reading.\n\nBTFD Coin isn\u2019t just riding the meme coin wave \u2013 it\u2019s redefining it. With a thriving presale already crossing $4.44 million and groundbreaking features like its Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, referral programme, and staking with a juicy 90% APY, it\u2019s attracting investors like flies to a barbecue. If you\u2019re looking for the best meme coins for massive income, you\u2019ll want to stick around as we explore this coin and its competitors.\n\n1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin to Watch\n\nWhat sets BTFD Coin apart? A whole lot, actually. From its quirky name (a cheeky nod to the phrase \u201cbuy the dip\u201d) to its feature-packed ecosystem, this token is the new superstar in town. Its presale launched at an eyebrow-raising $0.000004 per coin and has now reached Stage 12, priced at $0.000064. Analysts are predicting fireworks, with a listing price of $0.0006 post-presale. BTFD\u2019s referral programme and 90% staking APY are also luring savvy investors.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Play 2 Earn game is a major talking point. Although it\u2019s still in beta (launched in Stage 10), the full version promises rewards that could rival established P2E platforms. For those who love to hustle, BTFD\u2019s referral programme is pure gold. With every new investor brought on board, you earn additional rewards. And did we mention the Bulls Squad? This elite community is rallying hard to push the token\u2019s value to new heights.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because it\u2019s a juggernaut in the making. A presale performance surpassing $4.6 million, game-changing utility, and a vibrant community make BTFD Coin a no-brainer for those hunting the best meme coins for massive income.\n\nHead to the presale page and be part of the meme coin revolution. Unlock 50% more coins by using the BIG50 bonus code when you buy in.\n\n2. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Meme Coin\n\nDogecoin hardly needs an introduction, does it? As the pioneer of the meme coin world, it\u2019s been a darling of the internet and a plaything for whales. DOGE owes much of its stardom to endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk, whose tweets alone can send it soaring. Its simplicity and absurdity\u2014a Shiba Inu dog on a coin\u2014made it a pop culture phenomenon.\n\nUnlike many meme coins, Dogecoin has stayed relevant by being surprisingly practical. It\u2019s fast, has low transaction fees, and boasts one of the largest communities in the crypto world. The coin\u2019s use in tipping and small-scale payments has helped it secure a spot in everyday crypto usage. Plus, with ongoing discussions about integrating DOGE into platforms like X (formerly Twitter), it\u2019s clear this meme coin isn\u2019t just a fad.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, it\u2019s a legend. Dogecoin remains a cornerstone of the meme coin ecosystem and is one of the best meme coins for massive income for investors who value stability alongside fun.\n\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Dogecoin Killer\n\nShiba Inu entered the crypto stage as the self-proclaimed \u201cDogecoin Killer.\u201d While that may have sounded ambitious at the time, SHIB\u2019s rise was nothing short of spectacular. This Ethereum-based token launched with a decentralised vibe, and its ShibaSwap platform added a level of utility most meme coins can only dream about.\n\n2024 has been a transformative year for SHIB. Its developers are working on Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain solution to lower transaction costs and increase speed. Combine this with the ShibaSwap ecosystem and its NFT ventures, and you\u2019ve got a meme coin with serious utility backing its meme appeal. Its massive, devoted community (nicknamed the SHIB Army) and innovative features make it a top contender in the meme coin race.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because Shiba Inu has moved beyond being a meme coin. Its utility and ambitious plans for the future cement its position as one of the best meme coins for massive income.\n\n4. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Dark Horse\n\nAh, Pepe Coin. What started as an internet joke became a decentralised sensation in the meme coin market. Inspired by the infamous frog meme, PEPE has a devoted, albeit niche, following. The coin thrives on its community\u2019s creativity and humour, often launching viral campaigns that boost its visibility and trading volume.\n\nIn 2024, PEPE has proven it\u2019s not just a flash in the pan. The token\u2019s development team has hinted at potential collaborations and upcoming utilities that could elevate its status. For now, its charm lies in its meme culture and its ability to surprise investors with sudden price surges.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Pepe Coin\u2019s unpredictable nature, strong community, and potential for explosive gains make it a wildcard in the hunt for the best meme coins for massive income.\n\n5. Bonk (BONK): Solana\u2019s Meme Marvel\n\nBonk made waves as the first major meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its launch was all about giving back to the community. In fact, 50% of its initial supply was airdropped to Solana users, making it an instant hit. Unlike most meme coins, BONK\u2019s appeal lies in its unique association with Solana\u2019s fast, low-cost transactions.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about BONK is its community-driven approach. The coin has spurred a wave of activity on Solana, from NFT projects to decentralised applications. It\u2019s a meme coin that\u2019s breathing new life into its blockchain, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers.\n\nWhy did this coin make it to this list? Because Bonk\u2019s alignment with Solana\u2019s robust infrastructure and its strong community engagement make it a standout contender among the best meme coins for massive income.\n\nThe Economic Crash of 1973: Lessons for Today\u2019s Investors\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to 1973, a year marked by a global economic crash that sent shockwaves through markets. Those who seized the chaos as an opportunity to buy undervalued assets reaped massive rewards in the years that followed. The lesson? Economic downturns are goldmines for the bold.\n\nFast forward to today, and the crypto market\u2019s bearish trends mirror those turbulent times. Meme coins, particularly BTFD Coin, offer a unique chance to capitalise on these dips. With its thriving presale and robust ecosystem, BTFD isn\u2019t just a meme; it\u2019s a strategy for navigating these chaotic times.\n\nHow to Join the BTFD Coin Presale\n\nGetting your hands on BTFD Coin is a cinch. Just go to the presale page. Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet works great), enter the bonus code BIG50, and hit \u201cApply.\u201d Enter the amount you want to invest,use the BIG50 bonus code to lock in 50% extra coins during your purchase. and confirm the transaction. Boom, you\u2019re in.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on our research and market trends, meme coins are redefining investment opportunities for the modern era.

            "article_content": "Black holes are terrifying, monstrous objects with immense gravity that causes them to consume everything that crosses their event horizons .\n\nYet the physics-breaking power of the space-time ruptures is also part of their draw \u2014 sucking in scientists who want to study the role of black holes in sculpting galaxies and those searching for a unified theory of gravity . Here are the most monstrous black hole findings of the year.\n\nScientists spot an ultra-rare \"missing link\" black hole hiding in the Milky Way's center\n\nAn artist's impression of the binary system, assuming that the mysterious object is a black hole. (Image credit: Dani\u00eblle Futselaar)\n\nThe known black holes that populate the universe fall into two types: those up to a few dozen times the mass of the sun and their supermassive counterparts that can weigh up to 50 billion solar masses. But exactly how the former evolved into the latter is unclear, especially as there have yet to be any confirmed sightings of black holes in their awkward intermediate phases.\n\n\n\nEnter a new intermediate black hole candidate , which astronomers spotted inside the IRS 13 star cluster, just a tenth of a light-year from Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy . If scientists can confirm its existence, it could give vital clues to how black holes evolve.\n\nA feasting supermassive black hole is consuming material 40 times faster than should be possible\n\nAn illustration of a galaxy with a zoomed-in inset showing a black hole (Image credit: NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/J. da Silva/M. Zamani)\n\nThis year, scientists found another clue to how supermassive black holes grow to their unimaginable scales, in the form of the gluttonous monster LID-568 .\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope spotted the black hole as it appeared just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, and it was gobbling material 40 times faster than its theoretical feeding limit (called the Eddington limit). The discovery could explain why so many giant black holes appear so early in the universe's history.\n\n\"Impossible\" black holes discovered by the James Webb telescope may finally have an explanation\n\nAn illustration of two black holes about to merge into one. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nThe finding about LID-568's feeding frenzy was far from the last word on early supermassive black hole formation. Theoreticians also proposed how black holes came to be seeded across the universe without, as they typically do today, emerging from dead stars: by rapidly collapsing pockets of gas that formed primordial black holes .\n\nMost of these tiny singularities evaporated, according to the new hypothesis, but the ones that survived gorged and merged at a breakneck pace to reach their enormous scales.\n\nTiny black holes could be hollowing out planets and zipping through our bodies\n\nAn artist's illustration of primordial black holes. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nAnother theoretical proposal about primordial black holes also made waves this year: the suggestion that they might still exist . Perhaps they're hollowing out planets and zipping through our bodies and buildings, leaving only microscopic traces.\n\nIf bits of tiny black holes swarming across the cosmos can be found, they would be immediate candidates for most of the missing matter that seems to exert a gravitational pull yet barely interacts with light.\n\nBiggest black hole jets ever seen are as long as 140 Milky Ways\n\nAn artist's illustration of Porphyrion shows the gigantic jet stretching across the tendrils of the cosmic web. (Image credit: E. Wernquist/D. Nelson (IllustrisTNG Collaboration)/M. Oei 2.)\n\nSome black holes spew infalling matter out again, forming gigantic, near-light-speed plasma jets that can extend for hundreds of light-years. But one black hole jet pair astronomers spotted \u2014 named Porphyrion, after a giant in Greek mythology \u2014 really took the cake: At 23 million light-years in length, the pair is as long as 140 Milky Way galaxies laid end to end.\n\nBlack hole \"blowtorch\" is causing nearby stars to explode\n\nAn illustration of a blue laser beam shooting out of a black hole and passing a binary star system (Image credit: NASA, ESA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI))\n\nBlack hole jets aren't just incredible features. They're a powerful \u2014 yet still mysterious \u2014 force for the cosmic monsters to shape the wider universe. For the first time, researchers have observed a black hole jet causing stars in its vicinity to burst in explosions called novas .\n\nBecause the stars weren't directly hit by the beam, exactly how the jet is causing the stars to pop is unknown. By searching for answers, astronomers could gain a better understanding of how black holes affect even extremely distant surroundings.\n\nAstronomers discover why some black holes have a \"heartbeat\"\n\nA galaxy with a ray of diagonal light shining through it (Image credit: NASA/ESA/STScI)\n\nWhile feeding, black holes can heat up their \"food\" to immense temperatures to release enormous X-ray flares that last millions of years. But inside these flares lurks another, strange signal: a regular pulse of light that resembles a heartbeat. By studying one of the flares, astronomers now think they have an explanation for black hole heartbeats : They're produced by shock waves that ripple through black holes' food as they feast.\n\nEvent Horizon Telescope reveals why our galaxy's black hole is spinning so weirdly\n\nThe Milky Way and the location of its central black hole as viewed from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. (Image credit: ESO/Jos\u00e9 Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org), EHT Collaboration)\n\nOur galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A*, is a gargantuan tear in space-time that is 4 million times the mass of the sun and 14.6 million miles (23.5 million kilometers) wide. But these are pretty standard proportions for a black hole of this scale. What is unusual about Sagittarius A* is that it's spinning surprisingly fast and it's out of kilter with the rest of the Milky Way.\n\n\n\nThis year, using the Event Horizon Telescope, which in 2022 captured the first image of our galaxy's black hole , scientists found the answer: Sagittarius A* was likely born from a gigantic collision between two giant black holes , and its lopsided rotation is a key sign of its violent origins.\n\nScientists spot the first black hole \"triple\" system\n\nAn artist's interpretation of the black hole V404 Cygni surrounded by a massive star and a distant star (Image credit: Jorge Lugo/MIT)\n\nMany black holes exist in binary systems, orbiting a star companion, but researchers have now spotted one orbited by two stars , making it the first black hole triple system ever seen. Beyond creating an entirely new category in its own right, the discovery has serious implications for black hole formation.\n\nBlack holes that exist in binary systems are typically thought to have emerged from the gravitational collapse of a star. But astronomers say this triplet could offer firsthand evidence of black holes directly collapsing from gas clouds.\n\nDormant black hole roars to life\n\nAn artist's impression of a supermassive black hole, wreathed in orange gas, waking up from a long slumber (Image credit: ESO/M. Kornmesser)\n\nBlack holes are typically either active and consuming material around them, or dormant because they have already swallowed everything in their midst. It's rare to see black holes shift between the two states. But astronomers have now spotted a black hole that's waking up after a long slumber .\n\nThe reasons for the black hole's reactivation remain unclear, but astronomers hypothesize that it may have begun to capture new material. Alternatively, the light coming from near the space-time singularity star that it has snared and exploded."

            "article_content": "In What Ways Does AI Contribute to Startup Scalability?\n\nUnlock the secrets of how AI accelerates startup growth with in-depth analysis and insights from industry experts. Delve into the transformative power of AI across various business functions, from enhancing customer support to optimizing operational efficiency. This article sheds light on the pivotal role AI plays in driving scalability and innovation in today\u2019s competitive startup landscape.\n\nAI Automates Customer Support\n\nAI technologies contribute to the scalability of startups by automating repetitive tasks and enabling smarter decision-making, freeing up resources to focus on growth and innovation. One great example is the use of AI-powered customer support tools like chatbots.\n\nTake Intercom, for instance. By integrating AI-driven bots, startups can handle thousands of customer queries simultaneously without scaling their human support teams at the same pace. These bots use natural language processing to resolve common issues instantly or route more complex problems to the right person, ensuring efficient service while reducing operational costs.\n\nThis approach not only scales customer interactions as the startup grows but also gathers valuable data from these interactions, providing insights to refine products or services.\n\nChris Raulf, International AI and SEO Expert | Founder & President, Boulder SEO Marketing\n\nAI Revolutionizes Hiring Processes\n\nAI revolutionizes hiring processes, enabling startups to scale teams with unmatched speed and accuracy. It can analyze thousands of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, assess candidates, and predict cultural fit seamlessly. This ensures that scaling a workforce doesn\u2019t compromise the quality or diversity of hires. AI also reduces onboarding times by automating training modules tailored to individual roles effectively. Startups grow faster when talent acquisition becomes an AI-powered strategic advantage.\n\nWhen developing Toggl Hire, AI helped us create smarter candidate assessments tailored to skills. By analyzing test results, the system predicts a candidate\u2019s success probability for specific roles accurately. This reduced hiring times for startups using Toggl Hire, helping them scale teams quicker. The scalability of the tool itself brought exponential growth to our user base globally. It\u2019s proof of how AI-powered innovation fuels business expansion directly.\n\nAlari Aho, CEO and Founder, Toggl Inc\n\nAI Transforms Recruitment at X0PA\n\nAI has completely transformed how we approach scaling in recruitment at X0PA. By tapping into a pool of 250 million profiles worldwide, we enable companies to discover top talent even before a single job post goes live. Our AI doesn\u2019t stop at access-it curates profiles across LinkedIn and all major job boards, delivering a shortlist of only the most relevant candidates. This approach has saved recruiters over 100,000 days of manual effort, letting them focus on meaningful interactions instead of administrative tasks. Scaling with precision, speed, and reach is how we redefine modern recruitment.\n\nNina Alag Suri, CEO, XOPA AI\n\nAI Boosts Productivity and Efficiency\n\nThe biggest contribution of AI integration, whether in startups or established industries, lies in its ability to boost productivity and efficiency. Tasks that once took ten steps can now be completed in 5 or even 3, empowering employees to multitask without compromising focus\u2014a game-changer for startups.\n\nIn our case, integrating an AI chatbot for our real estate MLS website, The Canadian Home, was one of our best and most profitable decisions. As many of our users are first-time homebuyers, they naturally have countless questions. Initially, our customer support team was overwhelmed by the repetitive inquiries, making it hard to manage effectively. The AI chatbot now handles basic questions instantly, filtering out more straightforward queries and allowing our team to focus on more complex issues. This not only boosted efficiency but also increased conversions.\n\nAI is already transforming industries worldwide, and its role will only grow in the future. Adapting to these advancements is not just smart, it\u2019s essential.\n\nRobin Cherian, CEO, The Canadian Home\n\nAI Enhances Fraud Detection\n\nIn my experience, it enhances fraud detection for fintech startups. AI algorithms can quickly identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate potential fraudulent activity. AI-driven fraud detection systems like Feedzai or Kount analyze transactional data to identify suspicious activities. This saves time and resources for startups.\n\nA payments startup scaled safely by using AI to monitor real-time transactions, reducing fraud rates and building customer trust without deploying a large fraud investigation team. According to Feedzai, their technology helped the startup increase revenue by 30% and save $1.5 million in fraud losses within a year.\n\nI would point out that AI technologies help with fraud detection and assist in automating processes for startups. Many administrative tasks can be time-consuming and costly for startups, especially as they grow and onboard more customers or clients. AI-powered chatbots can handle common customer inquiries and support requests without the need for constant manual input from human employees.\n\nKevin Baragona, Founder @ DeepAI, Deep AI\n\nAI Improves Lead Qualification\n\nAI technologies help startups scale by automating repetitive tasks and providing insights that guide smarter decision-making. Startups often face limited resources, and AI allows teams to focus on high-value activities instead of getting stuck in operational bottlenecks.\n\nWe integrated AI into lead qualification. Instead of manually sorting and scoring leads, the AI models analyzed patterns from past sales data to prioritize prospects most likely to convert. This change reduced time spent on low-quality leads by 50 percent and allowed the sales team to focus on building relationships. Within six months, we saw a 30 percent increase in pipeline velocity.\n\nV. Frank Sondors, Founder, Salesforge AI\n\nAI Enhances Content Services\n\nOur development of AI-enhanced content services revealed a crucial insight about startup scaling.\n\nCombining AI efficiency with human expertise revolutionized our production capacity. Our HOTH AI Content Plus service slashed content creation time by 60% while maintaining quality standards. This breakthrough lets startups produce consistent, SEO-optimized content at scale without draining resources.\n\nNumbers tell the scaling story. By integrating AI into our content workflow, we\u2019ve helped startups produce in one month what used to take six months. The freed-up resources let them focus on growth strategies instead of content creation bottlenecks.\n\nSuccess in scaling requires strategic AI adoption. We found that using AI to handle initial drafts while keeping human editors for refinement creates the perfect balance. This model lets startups maintain quality while scaling operations \u2013 a winning formula I\u2019ve seen work across our 200,000+ client base.\n\nMy advice for startups: Start with one core process that directly impacts growth. Let AI handle repetitive tasks while your team focuses on strategy and creativity.\n\nMarc Hardgrove, CEO, The Hoth\n\nAI Empowers Efficient Scaling\n\nAI technologies empower startups to scale efficiently by automating repetitive tasks and delivering data-driven insights that enhance decision-making. For instance, integrating AI-powered chatbots in customer support allows startups to handle thousands of queries simultaneously, reducing the need for large support teams while ensuring 24/7 service. One example is a SaaS startup I worked with that implemented an AI-based lead-scoring system, which prioritized high-quality leads for the sales team. This not only increased conversion rates but also optimized resource allocation, enabling the business to scale its sales operations rapidly without proportionally increasing costs.\n\nJayanti Katariya, CEO, Moon Invoice\n\nAI Streamlines Customer Support\n\nAs someone who specializes in AI, I can say with confidence that AI adoption can really be a game-changer for startups. AI has two main advantages: it\u2019s fast and cost-friendly. Anything that has to do with repetitive tasks can be automated with AI, saving the company tons of time and human effort. At the same time, the teams can then focus on more strategic tasks that require contextual understanding, which AI obviously lacks. This way the work is distributed between humans and AI according to the strengths of both. On top of that, tasks related to data collection and analysis can be performed even better by AI. It does it faster and more accurately because there\u2019s no risk of human error. As a result, a well-executed adoption of AI can significantly speed up operations and improve the quality of work.\n\nOne example of a very common, yet extremely effective AI implementation is AI chatbots. We\u2019ve integrated one on our website as well. It can totally improve your customer service without you needing to put extra hours or effort into it. Your clients have access to real-time support 24/7, which creates a better user journey and increases customer satisfaction, both of which contribute to conversions. The company, at the same time, can focus more on improving the core products and big picture strategizing.\n\nPavlo Tkhir, CTO at Euristiq, Euristiq\n\nAI Automates Feedback Process\n\nAI has been a game-changer for Brokee in scaling our platform effectively. One example is how we\u2019ve integrated AI to automate the feedback process for our technical assessments. Instead of hiring additional team members to manually review every submission, our AI-driven system evaluates candidates\u2019 performance, generates personalized feedback, and even suggests tailored follow-up questions for hiring managers.\n\nThis automation not only ensures consistency and fairness but also allows us to handle significantly more users without compromising quality. By removing the bottleneck of manual evaluation, we\u2019ve been able to onboard more companies and engineers simultaneously, supporting our growth and expanding our impact in the hiring space. AI has made scaling not just possible but seamless.\n\nMaksym Lushpenko, Founder, Brokee\n\nAI Levels the Playing Field\n\nAI technologies have been an amazing tool to level-set startups, especially given their low cost of implementation.\n\nnDash is a bootstrapped company that often competes with brands well-funded by VCs. Integrations like OpenAI\u2019s API have enabled us to offer similar services and features without the added cost of capital.\n\nMachine learning was once accessible only to a few companies and has since been all but commoditized. We can now run powerful computations against large datasets that were all but impossible a few years ago. The biggest challenge is now just identifying implementations of value to content marketers and dreaming up the user interface.\n\nMatt Solar, Cofounder & VP of Marketing, nDash Marketing\n\nAI Transforms Customer Support\n\nIn my role at Windsor Drake, I once worked with a startup struggling to scale its customer support as their user base expanded rapidly. They were overwhelmed with routine Level 1 inquiries, and hiring more staff to keep up was becoming unsustainable. To address this, they integrated an AI-driven chatbot alongside cutting-edge voice AI technology to handle Level 1 customer requests. The voice AI, in particular, delivered human-like interactions that customers found surprisingly natural and well-received.\n\nThe impact was transformative. By automating Level 1 support, the startup freed up significant resources to focus on Level 2 and Level 3 support, where human expertise and problem-solving were crucial. This allowed them to address complex customer issues faster, improve overall service quality, and strengthen client relationships without increasing operational costs.\n\nWhat stood out most was how capital-efficient this solution was. Startups often face tight budgets, and this AI integration allowed them to scale customer service without burning through resources. For software startups especially, where customer satisfaction can make or break growth, leveraging AI for customer support isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s becoming a competitive necessity. The combination of cost-efficiency, scalability, and customer approval makes this a game-changing development that startups should actively explore.\n\nJeff Barrington, Managing Director, Windsor Drake\n\nAI Increases Marketing Scalability\n\nThe integration of AI technologies has dramatically increased the scalability of startups, particularly in marketing. Where previously a five-person team might have been necessary, many tasks can now be efficiently handled by a single individual, thanks to AI-powered tools.\n\nThis shift is particularly impactful for bootstrapped businesses, as it allows them to scale more profitably with less need for large teams or significant investment. AI enables startups to operate lean while still achieving impressive results.\n\nA concrete example from my experience is in email marketing. We used AI tools like Claude.ai to craft highly optimized onboarding sequences aimed at converting sign-ups into active clients. This whole process took about 2 hours, whereas previously this would have taken weeks. The quality of the AI-generated content was exceptional, and it significantly boosted our conversion rate from 30% to 38%.\n\nThis is just one instance of how AI can drive tangible improvements. Similar efficiencies can be found across various marketing functions, from content creation to data analysis and campaign optimization.\n\nStartups can now achieve the output and quality of much larger teams, allowing them to compete more effectively and scale more rapidly without proportional increases in headcount or costs.\n\nTom Van den Heuvel, CMO, wetracked.io\n\nAI Enables Unbelievable Automation\n\nThere is nothing that has improved our ability to scale startups like AI. You can write a Python script for any task, we have MCP setups (Model Context Protocol) that can access apps and programs on your Mac/PC to perform a plethora of tasks. It\u2019s really unbelievable. You just think of what you want automated and AI will make it happen. Sam Altman of OpenAI says we may see the first billionaire solo entrepreneur due to AI. Exciting times.\n\nNader Jaber, Founder, FlyNumber\n\nAI Optimizes Operational Efficiency\n\nThe integration of AI technologies plays a pivotal role in enabling startups to scale by optimizing operational efficiency and fortifying cybersecurity measures. It can also be used to automate routine processes and proactively address potential challenges. For businesses, this means reducing manual workload, improving resource allocation, and ensuring a secure foundation for growth. AI also enhances real-time decision-making by providing actionable insights from data, which is critical for scaling operations effectively without overburdening resources.\n\nAt GO Technology Group, we worked with an industrial manufacturing client in Chicago to implement an AI-enhanced cybersecurity solution that monitored their network 24/7 for anomalies. This allowed the organization to detect and respond to threats in real time, preventing potential breaches and downtime. The integration of AI not only streamlined their security operations but also freed up IT staff to focus on strategic initiatives, demonstrating how AI-powered managed IT services can drive both scalability and resilience in startup environments.\n\nSteve Robinson, Senior Technical Manager, Go Technology Group\n\nAI Drives Adaptive Pricing Models\n\nOne way AI drives scalability is through adaptive pricing models. I\u2019m not strictly talking about automating price changes but using AI to dynamically respond to market conditions, customer behavior, and inventory levels in real time, creating a competitive edge that startups often overlook.\n\nFor example, I worked with a SaaS startup that used AI to analyze customer segments, competitors\u2019 pricing, and seasonal demand patterns. Other than optimizing pricing for revenue, the system adapted to prioritize user acquisition in low-demand periods while maximizing revenue during peak times.\n\nDuring a major product launch, the AI model identified that a slightly lower introductory price for one user segment (freelancers) drove a 25% higher conversion rate while maintaining profitability because of the predicted long-term subscription retention. For larger enterprise clients, the AI suggested bundling features with tiered pricing, increasing adoption by 18% compared to static pricing.\n\nWhen you allow AI to continuously refine pricing, you can reduce churn rates and optimize customer acquisition costs, all without needing a massive pricing team or constant manual analysis. I\u2019d say you must explore adaptive pricing AI early. It\u2019s a strategic lever that can simultaneously improve margins and customer loyalty in ways static strategies simply can\u2019t.\n\nAljay Ambos, Lead SEO & Marketing Consultant, Twixify\n\nRelated Articles"

Investors focused on a company's financial details and its stability in the market. The most common approach was deep-diving into the company's finances, evaluating its leaders, and analyzing the competition.Some also looked at past prices and trading volumes to predict future trends.With the introduction of AI, this manual approach has changed. A few decades ago, placing a stock order meant calling your broker. Today, you can do it instantly from your smartphone or computer. With digitized markets, buying and selling stocks is seamless, and you can research companies and news online. Adding AI and Machine Learning to the mix makes trading even smarter, simplifying the process for everyone. Algorithmic trading has significantly increased over the past 10 years. Recent studies show that around 70% of the total trading volume is initiated through algorithmic trading.The data highlights the significant growth potential of the global algorithmic trading market. Valued at USD 15.55 billion in 2021, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2% from 2022 to 2030. This signals increasing adoption of algorithmic trading technologies, reflecting a shift toward more automated, efficient, and data-driven trading practices in the financial industry. The expected growth indicates confidence in the future of algorithmic trading as a crucial component of financial markets, driven by technological advancements.AI has made trading easier and more accessible, especially since COVID-19, though its full potential remains untapped in India. While there have been small-scale applications of AI in finance, the industry is gearing up for significant integration over the next five years. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is actively preparing for this shift, having recently announced the use of AI to process IPO (Initial Public Offering) documents. This technological advancement aims to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and enhance the accuracy of regulatory processes. By automating IPO document analysis, SEBI aims to increase transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide a more seamless experience for companies seeking to go public.Historically, stock trading was dominated by a select group of institutional investors with access to sophisticated tools and vast resources. However, the rise of AI is changing this landscape. Today, individuals can leverage AI-driven platforms that analyze market trends, predict price movements, and execute trades at lightning speed, leveling the playing field. AI stock trading utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence to assess real-time market data, historical trends, and other factors. By quickly and precisely processing this information, AI systems can identify trends and forecast market movements.AI's relevance in trading extends beyond efficiency; it provides individual investors with sophisticated insights and analytics that were once reserved for large firms. For example, AI systems can analyze sentiment on social media and news articles, allowing investors to gauge market sentiment and make informed decisions. This level of data accessibility empowers retail investors to make better-informed choices, enhancing their investment strategies Another key advantage in today\u2019s fast-paced markets is the ability to execute transactions with unprecedented speed and accuracy, thanks to AI\u2019s role in stock research, trade discovery, and execution. AI trading firms use various tools, including predictive analysis and AI algorithms, to monitor price changes, identify reasons for price shifts, and conduct trades while adapting to the constantly evolving market environment.Significant data points support AI\u2019s growing role in trading. For instance, India is increasingly catching up with global markets in AI adoption, although challenges such as infrastructure and data quality remain. Investor sentiment is improving as AI helps provide more accurate predictions, reducing human error. However, concerns about AI's impact on market volatility persist, especially as the technology becomes more prevalent.Despite its benefits, reliance on AI brings certain risks. Over-dependence on AI could destabilize markets, amplifying risks such as herd behavior and flash crashes. Furthermore, AI-generated misinformation and fake content pose new challenges, necessitating proactive measures and verification tools. Indian regulators, including SEBI, are preparing for stricter rules to manage these risks, ensuring the financial ecosystem remains balanced and secure.In conclusion, the future of AI in trading is promising, with the potential to significantly enhance efficiency and accessibility. As AI evolves from an enabler to a critical component of financial systems, balancing innovation with risk management will be essential. With proactive regulatory measures and a focus on harnessing AI's full potential, the stock market can continue democratizing, empowering investors of all backgrounds to engage in the financial landscape confidently.The industry is poised for substantial growth, and as highlighted by industry experts, the next five years will be crucial in defining AI\u2019s long-term impact on trading efficiency and market dynamics."

A record number of children affected by conflict are having their rights violated, including being killed and injured, out of school, missing life-saving vaccines, and being critically malnourished, Unicef said on Saturday.\n\nThe number is only expected to grow. Conflict drives approximately 80 per cent of all humanitarian needs around the world, disrupting access to essentials, including safe water, food and healthcare.\n\nOver 473 million children \u2014 more than one in six globally \u2014 now live in areas affected by conflict, with the world experiencing the highest number of conflicts since World War II.\n\nThe percentage of the world\u2019s children living in conflict zones has doubled \u2014 from around 10 per cent in the 1990s to almost 19pc today.\n\nBy the end of 2023, 47.2m children had been displaced due to conflict and violence, with trends in 2024 indicating additional displacement due to the intensification of conflicts, including in Haiti, Lebanon, Myanmar, the State of Palestine, and Sudan.\n\nChildren account for 30pc of the global population, yet on average account for roughly 40pc of refugee populations and 49pc of internally displaced people. In countries affected by conflict, on average, over a third of the population is poor (34.8pc) compared to just over 10pc in non-conflict-affected countries.\n\n\u201cBy almost every measure, 2024 has been one of the worst years on record for children in conflict in Unicef\u2019s history \u2014 both in terms of the number of children affected and the level of impact on their lives,\u201d said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell.\n\n\u201cA child growing up in a conflict zone is far more likely to be out of school, malnourished, or forced from their home \u2014 too often repeatedly \u2014 compared to a child living in places of peace. This must not be the new normal. We cannot allow a generation of children to become collateral damage to the world\u2019s unchecked wars. Children in war zones face a daily struggle for survival that deprives them of a childhood,\u201d said Russell.\n\n\u201cTheir schools are bombed, homes destroyed, and families torn apart. They lose not only their safety and access to basic life-sustaining necessities, but also their chance to play, to learn, and to simply be children. The world is failing these children. As we look towards 2025, we must do more to turn the tide and save and improve the lives of children.\u201d\n\nIn the latest available data, from 2023, the United Nations verified a record 32,990 grave violations against 22,557 children \u2014 the highest number since Security Council-mandated monitoring began.\n\nThe situation for women and girls is particularly concerning, with widespread reports of rape and sexual violence in conflict settings. Education has been severely disrupted in conflict zones. More than 52m children in countries affected by conflict are estimated to be out of school. The destruction of educational infrastructure and insecurity near schools have exacerbated an already dire situation for children\u2019s education in these regions.\n\nMalnutrition among children in conflict zones has also risen to alarming levels, as conflict and armed violence continue to be the primary drivers of hunger in numerous hotspots, disrupting food systems, displacing populations, and obstructing humanitarian access.\n\nConflicts are also having devastating effect on children\u2019s access to critical healthcare. Around 40pc of un- and under-vaccinated children live in countries that are either partially or entirely affected by conflict.\n\nThe impact on children\u2019s mental health is also huge. Exposure to violence, destruction and loss of loved ones can manifest in children through reactions such as depression, nightmares and difficulty sleeping, aggressive or withdrawn behaviour, sadness and fear, among others.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 29th, 2024"

Nevertheless, we will continue working and persevering, with the aim of bringing the parties closer to a peaceful resolution. Our one and only choice is to continue with our endeavours.\n\nUN News Have you met with civil society and women groups and what was shared from them and you during these meetings?\n\nRamtane Lamamra I engaged with Sudanese civil society actors on several occasions. It is imperative to discuss with the large spectrum of Sudanese political and civilian groups, including women, youth, and marginalized voices. Those are the people who continue to suffer from the intolerable toll of this heartbreaking war.\n\nEnding the unbearable suffering of civilians in Sudan remains a pressing priority, while we endeavour in parallel to stop the war and to launch an inclusive and credible political process.\n\nUN News The conflict has been going on for 20 months with no end in sight, despite the continued efforts from the UN and regional organizations, what needs to be changed to achieve significant progress towards a ceasefire?\n\nRamtane Lamamra It is time to put an end to this conflict, which has been going on for too long, and to the suffering of the people of Sudan. All actors should put the interests of the Sudanese people first and foremost and realize that there cannot be a military solution for this war. This is the lesson of history in Sudan and elsewhere.\n\nThere needs to be a ceasefire that stops the bloodshed, paves the way for a negotiated agreement and a credible, inclusive Sudanese-led political process that preserves the unity of Sudan. Otherwise, the repercussions of this war will be grave for Sudan and the entire region.\n\nI personally cannot resign myself to the notion that the second anniversary of the outbreak of the war next April would come and go without all concerned, including all influential global and regional actors, putting an extraordinary collective pressure on the belligerent parties and their respective supporters to seriously give peace a chance.\n\nSuch a long overdue pressure should also be directed at the foreign parties that supply the weapons and equipment, which feed the military illusions and miscalculations of the actors, at the expense of the wisdom and the value of a peaceful solution preserving the unity and territorial integrity as well as the wellbeing of Sudan and its people.\n\nI will continue to engage with all concerned actors to ensure we can move forward towards our common goal. We all have to try our best. The Sudanese people deserve no less."

            "article_content": "Over two years ago, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot that revolutionized the industry. What began as a small project swiftly grew into the fastest-growing app in history (before Threads dethroned it later that year), currently boasting 200 million active users. One thing is evident even though its effects on businesses and daily life are still evolving: ChatGPT has been a huge boon for Big Tech.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the six largest tech companies \u2013 Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia \u2013 have added over $8 trillion in market value since its launch.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWhen ChatGPT went live, it kicked off an AI boom, getting people and businesses excited about new possibilities. Nvidia, for one, has skyrocketed to become one of the world's most valuable companies, even taking the number-one spot at times. AI demand has boosted its chip sales and positioned it as the backbone of this growing tech revolution. By December 2024, Nvidia's market cap had surged by an incredible $3 trillion, recovering from a $54 billion drop in value in January 2023 relative to ChatGPT's launch in November 2022, according to a report by Visual Capitalist.\n\nMicrosoft's trajectory has been similarly remarkable. After losing $194 billion in January 2023, its market cap rebounded by $1.2 trillion by December 2024, supported by growing AI and cloud adoption. Amazon's valuation followed suit, climbing by $1.1 trillion in November 2024. Meta and Alphabet saw big gains, too, with companies growing by $1.1 trillion and $845 billion in market cap by late 2024, respectively.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nDespite its initial volatility, Apple saw a recovery. By December 2024, its market capitalization had grown from losing $345 billion in January 2023 to gaining $1.1 trillion.\n\nAs companies of all sizes rushed to implement AI solutions, cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google experienced tremendous growth. According to Crunchbase data, generative AI businesses have been consuming venture funds, making up about 35% of all VC funding this year.\n\nHaving recently raised $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, OpenAI has grown into a behemoth comparable to firms like AT&T and Goldman Sachs.\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nChatGPT vs. Google\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing shake-up is ChatGPT's rising challenge to Google's dominance in search. A survey showed ChatGPT now captures 5% of the search market, up from 1% in June, with Millennials leading the way.\n\nBut Google won\u2019t be going down without a fight. According to 71% of users, its Gemini AI and new search functions are still more popular than ChatGPT. Nevertheless, even a small shift in search market share is worth billions.\n\nOpenAI has taken aggressive steps to compete, rolling out a full search feature and partnering with Apple to make ChatGPT more accessible. Whether it can monetize these efforts as effectively as Google remains to be seen.\n\nIn the end, despite AI\u2019s huge impact, established tech firms have reaped the most rewards. High costs and competition from big firms make it difficult for startups to compete. Smaller startups often focus on niche markets like health care and law to avoid competing with the internet giants.\n\nRead Next:"

            "article_content": "I still can\u2019t quite believe that I\u2019m using an Arm-powered Windows laptop every day. After more than a decade of trying to make Windows on Arm a reality, Microsoft and Qualcomm finally nailed it this year with Copilot Plus PCs. These new laptops have excellent battery life and great performance \u2014 and the app compatibility issues that have plagued Windows on Arm are mostly a thing of the past (as long as you\u2019re not a gamer). Microsoft wanted 2024 to be \u201cthe year of the AI PC,\u201d but I think it was very much the year of Windows on Arm. If 2024 was anything to go by, 2025 is going to be even bigger for Windows on Arm.\n\nMicrosoft set the stage for the 2024 year of Windows on Arm announcements in January at CES with promises of AI PCs and the first big change to Windows keyboards in 30 years. Laptop manufacturers started putting a Copilot key on keyboards early this year, providing quick access to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant. While the Copilot experience on Windows has gone through several confusing revisions, it\u2019s still a key I accidentally press and then get frustrated when a Copilot window appears.\n\nAfter the Copilot key was met with a lukewarm reception, Microsoft reignited the Mac vs. PC war a few months later. Inside Microsoft, confidence had gradually been growing throughout the early months of 2024 that it could finally beat Apple\u2019s MacBook Air after falling behind for years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the company\u2019s new Copilot Plus PC devices at a special event in May, setting the stage for a summer of Windows on Arm laptops from every major OEM.\n\nThe processor is the key\n\nThe key to Windows on Arm\u2019s revival this year was Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processors, which were announced in April. They\u2019ve provided the type of performance and power efficiency only previously available with Apple\u2019s MacBooks and challenged Intel and AMD to do better in the x86 space. After much debate over Microsoft\u2019s MacBook Air-beating benchmarks, the reviews rolled in and showed that Windows on Arm was indeed capable of matching and beating Apple\u2019s MacBook Air. Qualcomm even hired the \u201cI\u2019m a Mac\u201d guy to promote Windows on Arm PCs, showing how confident it was in challenging Apple\u2019s laptop dominance.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best Windows laptops available right now. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm also worked closely with developers to make key apps compatible, and it\u2019s now very rare to run into an app compatibility issue that can\u2019t be solved by a native Arm64 version or Microsoft\u2019s improved emulator. Even Google, which previously shunned Windows Phone, has created Arm64 versions of Chrome and Google Drive to support Microsoft\u2019s efforts. With developers continually providing native versions of their apps, it makes it a lot easier to switch to a Windows on Arm laptop. The only big exception is gaming, where x86 still reigns supreme for compatibility and performance.\n\nIntel didn\u2019t sit still while all this Windows on Arm hype was occurring, nor AMD. Intel struck back with Lunar Lake at IFA in September, delivering impressive performance and battery life improvements. AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen AI chips are also competing directly with Qualcomm, and both AMD and Intel have the key advantage of game compatibility that Windows on Arm is definitely not ready for.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting for an M4-powered MacBook Air, Apple did refresh its cheapest MacBooks in October with a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM. Apple would probably argue it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence, but the unusual change came months after Copilot Plus PCs launched, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM at price points that challenge the MacBook Air. Apple did manage to squeeze its new M4 chip into the MacBook Pro recently, though, showing that Qualcomm has some ground to make up in 2025.\n\nApple and Microsoft have both been focusing on AI-powered features for laptops this year, and the end results have been underwhelming on both sides. While a lot of the initial Copilot Plus PC buzz was around Windows on Arm, Microsoft also rolled out some Windows AI features on these devices in June.\n\nIncomplete Recall\n\nThe flagship feature was supposed to be Recall, a feature that snapshots mostly everything you do on a laptop and then lets you recall moments or scroll through a timeline of how you\u2019ve used your PC. But because Recall was met with privacy and security concerns, undermining Microsoft\u2019s entire Copilot Plus PC marketing effort, Microsoft was forced to delay Recall several times to improve its security. In fact, it has only recently appeared in test versions of Windows.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Microsoft\u2019s stumbles with Recall will mean the company slows down with its Windows AI efforts. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri recently told me that the very future of Windows is about cloud and AI, so expect a lot more of this in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly focusing on Windows AI features like Recall. Image: Microsoft\n\nComing in 2025\n\nNext year will also be a fascinating battle between x86 and Windows on Arm. AMD and Intel are teaming up to fend off Arm-based chips from Qualcomm, and Intel is facing a period of turbulence after ejecting its CEO, facing desktop chip issues, and a wave of layoffs earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see 2025 as the year that Windows on Arm continues to eat into the laptop space. A Dell leak revealed Qualcomm is preparing new chips for 2025, and the chip maker has also been rolling out cheaper Arm-based chips to bring laptop prices down. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll see more of those at CES in January, alongside the usual slew of laptops that set the stage for the year.\n\nThe Dell leak also hinted at Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU plans, which now look set for a CES announcement. Leaks suggest we\u2019ll see RTX 50-series desktop GPUs and even the laptop variants, with OEMs rumored to be preparing new models to show at CES. Given the Windows on Arm gaming situation, a new generation of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs could help generate fresh excitement around x86 laptops throughout 2025.\n\nNvidia might also be planning to help the Windows on Arm effort. The chip maker has long been rumored to be planning to launch Arm PC chips as soon as 2025. Nvidia\u2019s expertise in AI chips and gaming could certainly shake up the Windows laptop world and make Windows on Arm even more enticing."

            "article_content": "Bright orange 'UFO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City,' raising concern among residents of the Big Apple over the holiday week.\n\nOn Friday, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted the video to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "Black holes are terrifying, monstrous objects with immense gravity that causes them to consume everything that crosses their event horizons .\n\nYet the physics-breaking power of the space-time ruptures is also part of their draw \u2014 sucking in scientists who want to study the role of black holes in sculpting galaxies and those searching for a unified theory of gravity . Here are the most monstrous black hole findings of the year.\n\nScientists spot an ultra-rare \"missing link\" black hole hiding in the Milky Way's center\n\nAn artist's impression of the binary system, assuming that the mysterious object is a black hole. (Image credit: Dani\u00eblle Futselaar)\n\nThe known black holes that populate the universe fall into two types: those up to a few dozen times the mass of the sun and their supermassive counterparts that can weigh up to 50 billion solar masses. But exactly how the former evolved into the latter is unclear, especially as there have yet to be any confirmed sightings of black holes in their awkward intermediate phases.\n\n\n\nEnter a new intermediate black hole candidate , which astronomers spotted inside the IRS 13 star cluster, just a tenth of a light-year from Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy . If scientists can confirm its existence, it could give vital clues to how black holes evolve.\n\nA feasting supermassive black hole is consuming material 40 times faster than should be possible\n\nAn illustration of a galaxy with a zoomed-in inset showing a black hole (Image credit: NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/J. da Silva/M. Zamani)\n\nThis year, scientists found another clue to how supermassive black holes grow to their unimaginable scales, in the form of the gluttonous monster LID-568 .\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope spotted the black hole as it appeared just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, and it was gobbling material 40 times faster than its theoretical feeding limit (called the Eddington limit). The discovery could explain why so many giant black holes appear so early in the universe's history.\n\n\"Impossible\" black holes discovered by the James Webb telescope may finally have an explanation\n\nAn illustration of two black holes about to merge into one. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nThe finding about LID-568's feeding frenzy was far from the last word on early supermassive black hole formation. Theoreticians also proposed how black holes came to be seeded across the universe without, as they typically do today, emerging from dead stars: by rapidly collapsing pockets of gas that formed primordial black holes .\n\nMost of these tiny singularities evaporated, according to the new hypothesis, but the ones that survived gorged and merged at a breakneck pace to reach their enormous scales.\n\nTiny black holes could be hollowing out planets and zipping through our bodies\n\nAn artist's illustration of primordial black holes. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nAnother theoretical proposal about primordial black holes also made waves this year: the suggestion that they might still exist . Perhaps they're hollowing out planets and zipping through our bodies and buildings, leaving only microscopic traces.\n\nIf bits of tiny black holes swarming across the cosmos can be found, they would be immediate candidates for most of the missing matter that seems to exert a gravitational pull yet barely interacts with light.\n\nBiggest black hole jets ever seen are as long as 140 Milky Ways\n\nAn artist's illustration of Porphyrion shows the gigantic jet stretching across the tendrils of the cosmic web. (Image credit: E. Wernquist/D. Nelson (IllustrisTNG Collaboration)/M. Oei 2.)\n\nSome black holes spew infalling matter out again, forming gigantic, near-light-speed plasma jets that can extend for hundreds of light-years. But one black hole jet pair astronomers spotted \u2014 named Porphyrion, after a giant in Greek mythology \u2014 really took the cake: At 23 million light-years in length, the pair is as long as 140 Milky Way galaxies laid end to end.\n\nBlack hole \"blowtorch\" is causing nearby stars to explode\n\nAn illustration of a blue laser beam shooting out of a black hole and passing a binary star system (Image credit: NASA, ESA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI))\n\nBlack hole jets aren't just incredible features. They're a powerful \u2014 yet still mysterious \u2014 force for the cosmic monsters to shape the wider universe. For the first time, researchers have observed a black hole jet causing stars in its vicinity to burst in explosions called novas .\n\nBecause the stars weren't directly hit by the beam, exactly how the jet is causing the stars to pop is unknown. By searching for answers, astronomers could gain a better understanding of how black holes affect even extremely distant surroundings.\n\nAstronomers discover why some black holes have a \"heartbeat\"\n\nA galaxy with a ray of diagonal light shining through it (Image credit: NASA/ESA/STScI)\n\nWhile feeding, black holes can heat up their \"food\" to immense temperatures to release enormous X-ray flares that last millions of years. But inside these flares lurks another, strange signal: a regular pulse of light that resembles a heartbeat. By studying one of the flares, astronomers now think they have an explanation for black hole heartbeats : They're produced by shock waves that ripple through black holes' food as they feast.\n\nEvent Horizon Telescope reveals why our galaxy's black hole is spinning so weirdly\n\nThe Milky Way and the location of its central black hole as viewed from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. (Image credit: ESO/Jos\u00e9 Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org), EHT Collaboration)\n\nOur galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A*, is a gargantuan tear in space-time that is 4 million times the mass of the sun and 14.6 million miles (23.5 million kilometers) wide. But these are pretty standard proportions for a black hole of this scale. What is unusual about Sagittarius A* is that it's spinning surprisingly fast and it's out of kilter with the rest of the Milky Way.\n\n\n\nThis year, using the Event Horizon Telescope, which in 2022 captured the first image of our galaxy's black hole , scientists found the answer: Sagittarius A* was likely born from a gigantic collision between two giant black holes , and its lopsided rotation is a key sign of its violent origins.\n\nScientists spot the first black hole \"triple\" system\n\nAn artist's interpretation of the black hole V404 Cygni surrounded by a massive star and a distant star (Image credit: Jorge Lugo/MIT)\n\nMany black holes exist in binary systems, orbiting a star companion, but researchers have now spotted one orbited by two stars , making it the first black hole triple system ever seen. Beyond creating an entirely new category in its own right, the discovery has serious implications for black hole formation.\n\nBlack holes that exist in binary systems are typically thought to have emerged from the gravitational collapse of a star. But astronomers say this triplet could offer firsthand evidence of black holes directly collapsing from gas clouds.\n\nDormant black hole roars to life\n\nAn artist's impression of a supermassive black hole, wreathed in orange gas, waking up from a long slumber (Image credit: ESO/M. Kornmesser)\n\nBlack holes are typically either active and consuming material around them, or dormant because they have already swallowed everything in their midst. It's rare to see black holes shift between the two states. But astronomers have now spotted a black hole that's waking up after a long slumber .\n\nThe reasons for the black hole's reactivation remain unclear, but astronomers hypothesize that it may have begun to capture new material. Alternatively, the light coming from near the space-time singularity star that it has snared and exploded."

            "article_content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nImagine standing on a railway platform watching a trolley go past. A girl on the trolley drops a bright red ball. To her, the ball falls straight down. But from the platform, you see the ball traverse an arc before hitting the trolley floor. The two of you observe the same event, but from different reference frames: one anchored to the trolley and the other to the platform.\n\nThe idea of reference frames has a storied history in classical physics: Isaac Newton, Galileo, and Albert Einstein all relied on them for their studies of motion. A reference frame is essentially a coordinate system (a way of specifying positions and times relative to some zero point, or \u201corigin\u201d) that might itself be in motion. Einstein used reference frames to develop his theories of relativity, which revealed that space and time are not fixed backdrops to the universe, but rather elastic entities that can stretch, scrunch, and warp.\n\nBut quantum physics has for the most part ignored reference frames. Alice and Bob, the fictional observers in many experiments in quantum physics, typically have different physical locations, but they\u2019re assumed to have a common reference frame. This is now changing. Quantum physicists are realizing that they can\u2019t ignore the fact that the reference frame Alice is anchored to (akin to the trolley or the platform) might have multiple possible locations at once. Or that the clock Bob is using to measure time might be subject to quantum uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIn the quantum world, the reference frames should [also] be described by the formalism of quantum theory,\u201d said Renato Renner, a theoretical physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.\n\nIn a paper this year, the physicist \u010caslav Brukner at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information and the University of Vienna and colleagues showed that quantum reference frames put a new perspective on long-studied quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. The findings lead Renner to suspect that quantum reference frames might help resolve some of the weird paradoxes that arise in quantum thought experiments."

            "article_content": "Over two years since the introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2013 a quick and easy way to ask an AI model almost anything \u2013 artificial intelligence has continued to dominate talks, headlines and economic research and will likely continue to do so throughout the following year.\n\nFrom algorithms powering search engines to sophisticated tools diagnosing medical conditions, artificial intelligence is reshaping industries, redefining work and challenging our understanding of intelligence itself.\n\nAI is no longer a futuristic fantasy; it is rapidly becoming an integral part of life. But with breakneck innovation, the near future likely holds even more transformative change shaped by the key trends driving this revolution.\n\nWhile generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have mainly shaped these trends until now, what appears to be the dawn of a new era is so-called agentic AI.\n\nDescribed basically as \"a combination of different AI techniques, models, and approaches,\" it is seen as \"a new breed of autonomous agents that can analyze data, set goals and take action to achieve them, all with minimal human supervision.\"\n\nAccording to many companies, experts and recent reports, this trend looks to be the dominant trend that could shape the artificial intelligence sector next year.\n\nBut what more to expect? Let's break it down:\n\nOpenAI transition\n\nTalking about AI means talking about the company, which some call \"consequential\" in the field \u2013 and yes, that's OpenAI.\n\nSam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, has just recently said surprise advancements could be in store next year.\n\n\"I expect that in 2025 we will have systems that people look at, even people who are skeptical of current progress, and say, 'Wow, I did not expect that,'\" Altman said, speaking at the New York Times' DealBook Summit earlier this month.\n\nReflecting on the time when ChatGPT was launched, Altman also said, \"My guess is we will hit AGI (artificial general intelligence) sooner than most people in the world think, and it will matter much less.\"\n\nHis remarks came ahead of the announcement of the startup's new o3 model and details on the transition from being a non-profit entity, as it has been classified so far.\n\nUnder the plan announced on Friday, OpenAI said it looks to revamp its structure, saying it would create a public benefit corporation to make it easier to \"raise more capital than we'd imagined\" and remove the restrictions imposed on the startup by its current non-profit parent.\n\nAI future, multimodality\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anybody knows the truth. I\u2019m sure there will be another explosion at some point where there\u2019s a fundamental change in the architecture of the models. Don\u2019t know when and don\u2019t know where,\" Pascale Fung, director of the Center for AI Research (CAiRE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told Anadolu Agency (AA) when asked about the future of AI.\n\nAI systems capable of processing multiple data types simultaneously, such as text, images, audio and video, have become a driving force in the industry toward what has been called multimodality.\n\nFung, also a senior director of AI research at Meta-FAIR, a research initiative by Facebook's parent company Meta, highlighted the significance of such a shift.\n\n\"That\u2019s not just text. It\u2019s not just a chatbot, but it can also see what you see and hear what you hear.\"\n\nMultimodal systems, like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, already integrate vision and auditory perception with text-based capabilities.\n\nThese technologies analyze visual or auditory data in real-time, enabling applications like assisting visually impaired individuals by describing their surroundings or reading text aloud.\n\nAI agents\n\nOne step forward from chatbots, AI agents are redefining assistance by managing complex, multistep tasks.\n\nUnlike chatbots that answer questions, AI agents can perform complex tasks, like booking a family vacation or managing executive schedules, Fung explained. These agents function as \"smart humans,\" using tools to solve problems and create value.\n\nPascale Fung, senior director of AI Research at Meta and a chair professor of Electronic & Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST) delivers a speech during a panel on artificial intelligence at TRT World Forum, Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye, Nov. 30, 2024. (AA Photo)\n\nIn a recent report, Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry at Microsoft Copilot, described agents as \"the apps of the AI era.\"\n\n\"Agents will begin to transform every business process, revolutionizing the way we work and manage our organizations,\" he added.\n\nThe possibilities are vast. As virtual travel planners, AI agents could optimize itineraries. As executive assistants, they can schedule meetings and manage workflows with nuanced judgment, able to juggle a multitude of factors playing into the decisions these would involve.\n\nEchoing these views and providing details on the concept of AI agents, Kristina Tikhonova, Microsoft General Manager for Southeast Europe, told earlier in an interview with Daily Sabah that \"AI agents represent a new era where AI systems work together seamlessly, with one AI agent able to request actions from others.\"\n\nSome large companies have already launched their agent products in this direction. Salesforce, for example, created Agentforce, and Microsoft has shared the concept of creating autonomous agents with Copilot Studio.\n\nNew frontiers\n\nYet, despite significant advancements, current AI systems still fall short of matching human intelligence in most areas \u2013 something that could only be achieved by what has been called artificial general intelligence or AGI.\n\nAt the same time, a dilemma also prevails over the question of the actual benchmark for achieving this.\n\nOften referred to as the \"holy grail\" of AI, developing an AGI system would represent a significant leap toward artificial superintelligence (ASI), systems capable of surpassing human cognitive abilities across multiple domains.\n\nWhile AGI is defined by its ability to achieve human-level intellectual performance, ASI goes further, outperforming humans in reasoning, problem-solving and creative tasks.\n\nOpenAI's Altman has predicted that superintelligence could emerge within a \"few thousand days,\" marking a profound paradigm shift.\n\nIn the near term, AI systems are expected by 2025 to solve increasingly complex problems with advanced reasoning skills.\n\nAdvanced AI models, such as OpenAI o1, already exhibit capabilities that mimic human reasoning, enabling tasks such as contract analysis, scientific discoveries and multistep project execution. Such capabilities are expected to develop in the coming years.\n\nComputational power, spending\n\nMoreover, behind AI\u2019s rapid advancements lies unprecedented progress in computational power.\n\nGoogle recently revealed its landmark quantum chip, Willow, able to complete a benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task that would take today\u2019s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, the company claimed.\n\nThis breakthrough highlights the potential to overcome current computational limits, enabling advanced AI models to tackle previously insurmountable challenges.\n\nGoogle Quantum AI's Hartmut Neven (L) and Anthony Megrant (R) examine a cryostat refrigerator for cooling quantum computing chips at Google's Quantum AI lab in Santa Barbara, California, U.S., Nov. 25, 2024. (Reuters Photo)\n\nHowever, the energy demands of such systems raise environmental concerns. Industry leaders like Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia are expected to prioritize sustainable, energy-efficient technologies to mitigate these impacts.\n\nSome of these tech giants, alongside Amazon and Meta, have already moved toward nuclear energy as data centers powering artificial intelligence and cloud computing are pushing energy demand and production to new limits.\n\nOn the other hand, all this has resulted in unprecedented AI-related spending, which made artificial intelligence and crypto a top story of the tech market in 2024.\n\n\"Some of the biggest winners in this year\u2019s stock market rally that\u2019s seen the Nasdaq jump 33% and other U.S. indexes notch double-digit gains have direct ties to the rapid advancements in AI. Chipmaker Nvidia is among them, but it\u2019s not alone,\" a report by CNBC said recently.\n\nA slowdown?\n\nHowever, after two years of fierce upward momentum, some analysts continue to wonder whether an AI slowdown is imminent.\n\nA recent report by The New York Times, titled \"Is the Tech Industry Already on the Cusp of an A.I. Slowdown?\" said, \"Interviews with 20 executives and researchers showed a widespread belief that the tech industry is running into a problem that too many were unthinkable just a few years ago. They have used up most of the digital text available on the internet.\"\n\nIt also cited Demis Hassabis, one of the most influential AI experts in the world and this year's recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for AI research contributions to protein structure prediction, to have a warning for the rest of the tech industry.\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 co-laureate British AI researcher Demis Hassabis gestures as he gives his Nobel Prize lecture in Aula Magna, Stockholm University, Sweden, Dec. 8, 2024.

From aspects involving jobs to a possible tremendous impact on fields such as health care, AI is on track to be more integrated and involved in everyday lives as time passes.\n\nFung, for example, underlined AI\u2019s potential in agriculture: to revolutionize productivity, disease detection and water regulation.\n\n\"It can help eradicate hunger by ensuring more equitable food production and distribution,\" Fung explained. Improvements in logistics could also reduce food waste, addressing global challenges of hunger and inefficiency, she said.\n\nThe integration of AI into daily life has also sparked concerns about job displacement.\n\n\"Every major technological achievement has resulted in significant job shifts,\" Altman acknowledged.\n\nHowever, Fung emphasized that while AI will replace some roles, it will also create new opportunities. \"A lot of jobs we have today didn\u2019t exist 100 years ago,\" she said, urging that what is important is to be prepared for change.\n\nShe suggested that education systems must adapt to prepare individuals and teach them \"what makes us human.\"\n\nShe said schools should teach people the \"collective wisdom of humanity\" such as philosophy, the arts, literature, science, and mathematics and advised people to become more critical, creative and knowledgeable to deter the effects of AI."
