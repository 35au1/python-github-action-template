            "article_content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed how we handle natural language processing. They can answer questions, write code, and hold conversations. Yet, they fall short when it comes to real-world tasks. For example, an LLM can guide you through buying a jacket but can\u2019t place the order for you. This gap between thinking and doing is a major limitation. People don\u2019t just need information; they want results.\n\nTo bridge this gap, Microsoft is turning LLMs into action-oriented AI agents. By enabling them to plan, decompose tasks, and engage in real-world interactions, they empower LLMs to effectively manage practical tasks. This shift has the potential to redefine what LLMs can do, turning them into tools that automate complex workflows and simplify everyday tasks. Let\u2019s look at what\u2019s needed to make this happen and how Microsoft is approaching the problem.\n\nWhat LLMs Need to Act\n\nFor LLMs to perform tasks in the real world, they need to go beyond understanding text. They must interact with digital and physical environments while adapting to changing conditions. Here are some of the capabilities they need:\n\nUnderstanding User Intent\n\nTo act effectively, LLMs need to understand user requests. Inputs like text or voice commands are often vague or incomplete. The system must fill in the gaps using its knowledge and the context of the request. Multi-step conversations can help refine these intentions, ensuring the AI understands before taking action.\n\nTurning Intentions into Actions\n\nAfter understanding a task, the LLMs must convert it into actionable steps. This might involve clicking buttons, calling APIs, or controlling physical devices. The LLMs need to modify its actions to the specific task, adapting to the environment and solving challenges as they arise.\n\nAdapting to Changes\n\nReal world tasks don\u2019t always go as planned. LLMs need to anticipate problems, adjust steps, and find alternatives when issues arise. For instance, if a necessary resource isn\u2019t available, the system should find another way to complete the task. This flexibility ensures the process doesn\u2019t stall when things change.\n\nSpecializing in Specific Tasks\n\nWhile LLMs are designed for general use, specialization makes them more efficient. By focusing on specific tasks, these systems can deliver better results with fewer resources. This is especially important for devices with limited computing power, like smartphones or embedded systems.\n\nBy developing these skills, LLMs can move beyond just processing information. They can take meaningful actions, paving the way for AI to integrate seamlessly into everyday workflows.\n\nHow Microsoft is Transforming LLMs\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s approach to creating action-oriented AI follows a structured process. The key objective is to enable LLMs to understand commands, plan effectively, and take action. Here\u2019s how they\u2019re doing it:\n\nStep 1: Collecting and Preparing Data\n\nIn the first phrase, they collected data related to their specific use cases: UFO Agent (described below). The data includes user queries, environmental details, and task-specific actions. Two different types of data are collected in this phase: firstly, they collected task-plan data helping LLMs to outline high-level steps required to complete a task. For example, \u201cChange font size in Word\u201d might involve steps like selecting text and adjusting the toolbar settings. Secondly, they collected task-action data, enabling LLMs to translate these steps into precise instructions, like clicking specific buttons or using keyboard shortcuts.\n\nThis combination gives the model both the big picture and the detailed instructions it needs to perform tasks effectively.\n\nStep 2: Training the Model\n\nOnce the data is collected, LLMs are refined through multiple training sessions. In the first step, LLMs are trained for task-planning by teaching them how to break down user requests into actionable steps. Expert-labeled data is then used to teach them how to translate these plans into specific actions. To further enhanced their problem-solving capabilities, LLMs have engaged in self-boosting exploration process which empower them to tackle unsolved tasks and generate new examples for continuous learning. Finally, reinforcement learning is applied, using feedback from successes and failures to further improved their decision-making.\n\nStep 3: Offline Testing\n\nAfter training, the model is tested in controlled environments to ensure reliability. Metrics like Task Success Rate (TSR) and Step Success Rate (SSR) are used to measure performance. For example, testing a calendar management agent might involve verifying its ability to schedule meetings and send invitations without errors.\n\nStep 4: Integration into Real Systems\n\nOnce validated, the model is integrated into an agent framework. This allowed it to interact with real-world environments, like clicking buttons or navigating menus. Tools like UI Automation APIs helped the system identify and manipulate user interface elements dynamically.\n\nFor example, if tasked with highlighting text in Word, the agent identifies the highlight button, selects the text, and applies formatting. A memory component could help LLM to keeps track of past actions, enabling it adapting to new scenarios.\n\nStep 5: Real-World Testing\n\nThe final step is online evaluation. Here, the system is tested in real-world scenarios to ensure it can handle unexpected changes and errors. For example, a customer support bot might guide users through resetting a password while adapting to incorrect inputs or missing information. This testing ensures the AI is robust and ready for everyday use.\n\nA Practical Example: The UFO Agent\n\nTo showcase how action-oriented AI works, Microsoft developed the UFO Agent. This system is designed to execute real-world tasks in Windows environments, turning user requests into completed actions.\n\nAt its core, the UFO Agent uses a LLM to interpret requests and plan actions. For example, if a user says, \u201cHighlight the word \u2018important\u2019 in this document,\u201d the agent interacts with Word to complete the task. It gathers contextual information, like the positions of UI controls, and uses this to plan and execute actions.\n\nThe UFO Agent relies on tools like the Windows UI Automation (UIA) API. This API scans applications for control elements, such as buttons or menus. For a task like \u201cSave the document as PDF,\u201d the agent uses the UIA to identify the \u201cFile\u201d button, locate the \u201cSave As\u201d option, and execute the necessary steps. By structuring data consistently, the system ensures smooth operation from training to real-world application.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nWhile this is an exciting development, creating action-oriented AI comes with challenges. Scalability is a major issue. Training and deploying these models across diverse tasks require significant resources. Ensuring safety and reliability is equally important. Models must perform tasks without unintended consequences, especially in sensitive environments. And as these systems interact with private data, maintaining ethical standards around privacy and security is also crucial.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s roadmap focuses on improving efficiency, expanding use cases, and maintaining ethical standards. With these advancements, LLMs could redefine how AI interacts with the world, making them more practical, adaptable, and action-oriented.\n\nThe Future of AI\n\nTransforming LLMs into action-oriented agents could be a game-changer. These systems can automate tasks, simplify workflows, and make technology more accessible. Microsoft\u2019s work on action-oriented AI and tools like the UFO Agent is just the beginning. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect smarter, more capable systems that don\u2019t just interact with us\u2014they get jobs done."

I liked the people, even as I questioned their accounts.\n\nI recalled that in 1973 when he was governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter reported that he had once seen a UFO. \"It didn't have any solid substance to it,\" he said in filed statement, \"it was just a very peculiar-looking light.\"\n\nI phoned a contact, some messages went back and forth and, within days, the former president's familiar voice was on the line.\n\nThis is totally off-the-record, I assured Mr. Carter. \"But you were president for four years. You had access to all the national security intelligence. Could these people be right? Mr. President, is there anything we should know?\"\n\nThe president chuckled and replied, \"No. But remember,\" he added, \"a UFO is simply something we haven't identified. There are dozens of unexplained incursions of our airspace every year. They're usually some experiment. You'd be surprised,\" he said, \"how often the Navy doesn't know what the Air Force is up to, and so forth.\"\n\n\"So based on what you've seen,\" I ventured, \"you have no reason to think there's life... out there?\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" Mr. Carter gently corrected me. \"But if there is, it has nothing to do with UFOs. If there's some other civilization out there, I doubt they'd send big, bulky airships. They'd probably just keep watch and leave us alone.\"\n\nI was struck by President Carter's thoughtfulness, and chanced a last question.\n\n\"But if there were other civilizations out there,\" I asked, \"would the government have to keep it a secret? So we wouldn't panic, or feel worthless?\"\n\n\"The way I see it,\" said Jimmy Carter, \"there's nothing to fear. If there is life out there, we're still all part of the same master plan. God's hands are big enough to hold us both.\"\n\nAs America paid tribute to Jimmy Carter this week, I thought of our brief conversation years ago as a blessing \u2014 and a glimpse into his open, indomitable heart.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR"

There is no doubt in the world that this house is a very haunted house. It always has been.\n\n\"It started off with smaller things that nobody really cared about.\n\n\"The doors would open, the kettle would turn itself on, the implements by the fire would swing back and forward, the doors would open and shut, the latches on the doors would go up, the taps would turn on. All that general stuff.\n\n\"All of the sudden the room would go freezing cold and you could see the black thing there. That started off quite soon, within days really. I knew the first day.\n\n\"I've been the guardian of this special house since 2004. It's now time for me to let somebody else look after it.\"\n\nThirteen witches were kept there before they were put on trial.\n\nThe most famous was Ursula Kemp who was tried for witchcraft and hanged in 1582 along with two others.\n\n7 Vanessa claimed mysterious blood spatters appeared on the walls Credit: swns\n\n7 The kitchen possesses plenty of character Credit: swns\n\n7 The most recent owners used the two-bed property as a holiday let\n\nThe Cage remained as a prison for men, women and children up until 1908 before it became a private residence.\n\nThe house featured in Channel 4 documentary True Horror 'The Witches Prison' which aired on Halloween night in 2018.\n\nParanormal experts have visited from all over the world.\n\nVanessa has also penned a book \u2018Spirits of the Cage\u2019 about the events.\n\nShe left the home with son Jesse in 2008 to move into rented accommodation and has since desperately been trying to flog it.\n\nThe cottage itself comprises three reception rooms, a kitchen, a ground floor cloakroom, plus two bedrooms and a bathroom on the split level first floor.\n\nA plaque on the building describes the plight of Ursula Kemp, who was imprisoned in The Cage on suspicion of witchcraft before being hanged in Chelmsford in 1582.\n\nEstate agent Florent Lambert, director of Home Domus, said: \u201cVanessa did try to sell The Cage numerous times since 2008 and with a number of different estate agents.\n\n\u201cMost agents advised her to sell at auction at ridiculous prices or were not at all interested as they predicted it could not be sold.\n\n\u201cI took it as a challenge and a mission to find the way to best sell it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "At one point in Choo Mantar, we see the chilling hide-and-clap scene from The Conjuring being played on a tablet. It\u2019s a terrific scene that relies more on concept than sound. Karvaa Navaneeth\u2019s latest horror drama needed such out-of-the-box thinking to achieve its full potential.\n\nChoo Mantar has all the tropes of a typical horror film. You have a haunted mansion built during the British era. Expectedly, there is a backstory to it. Unusual happenings inside the bungalow trap a family of four, and a paranormal activist has to crack the mystery.\n\nSharan plays the ghostbuster who decides to fix the dreaded reputation of the mansion. Called Dynamo, he is hailed as one of the best paranormal researchers in the country. His subordinates are essayed by Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, and Kiran Chandrashekhar.\n\nChoo Mantar (Kannada) Director: Karvaa Navaneeth Cast: Sharan, Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, Meghana Gaonkar, Runtime: 142 minutes Storyline: Four friends enter a haunted house looking for a treasure. Unexpected events threaten their lives\n\nChoo Mantar begins as a horror comedy, with Chikkanna and Sharan delivering witty lines, but the humour soon loses its sheen because the dialogues turn from cheeky to silly. The film takes quite a while to get going, with the first big twist arriving at the interval point. The surprise, though, is worth the wait, and Navaneeth sets the film up nicely, only to deliver an underwhelming second half.\n\nThe film lacks solid jump scares. Showing the ghosts as hideous monsters, Choo Mantar takes the old-school route to scare people. Despite the valiant performances of Meghana Gaonkar and Aditi Prabhudeva, the movie doesn\u2019t grip you with fear.\n\nALSO READ:Finding Bengaluru in Kannada cinema\n\nIt\u2019s confusing why director Navaneeth treats the film as a thriller. Every plot point in the story leads to a surprise. While such twists aren\u2019t bad, Choo Mantar fails to do the basic duty of a horror film: to scare the audience. The movie is well mounted with the cinematography and the background score doing justice to the backdrop. The rousing climax is whistle-worthy but feels force-fitted to produce an impact similar to what we experienced in Kantara (2022).\n\nI enjoyed the final surprise, a nod to a yesteryear horror hit involving a superstar. Sharan\u2019s character, in fact, has a lot of similarities to that famous character from the popular movie. Though gimmicky, the sequel idea feels quite juicy to think of, especially if you consider the probability of a horror universe in Kannada cinema. In case there is a continuation, the franchise must have a perfect balance of suspense and horrifying drama.\n\nChoo Mantar is currently running in cricket"

            "article_content": "Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info\n\nWith staycations steadily becoming a thing of the past, experts pinpointed the cheapest hidden gems across Europe that offer return flights for under \u00a375. Money-saving experts at Savoo delved into the details of upcoming flights and travel trends for 2025 to find the cheapest flights, and the top tips for getting your holiday in under budget.\n\nSpain\n\nDespite holding some of the most popular cities for Brits to vacay in, Spain earned not one but two spots on the list of cheapest return prices. In first place is the seaside Costa del Sol, with return flights going as low as \u00a351.\n\nIt takes roughly the same amount of time to fly to Costa del Sol from London as it does to get you to Manchester via train, only with a hefty price difference as the money-saving experts noted an average one-way train up north costs \u00a354.50. Mallorca also made the list with potential return flights from \u00a362 if you pick your times and dates right.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nOne of the more high profile destinations on the list is the capital city of the Czech Republic, Prague, with return flights starting at \u00a357. Including average hotel prices, cheap and mid-range food to keep you going as well as some beers and coffees over a weekend trip will set you back \u00a3254.27 according to the money experts.\n\nPoland\n\nKrakow comes in third place at \u00a359.50 for return flights and the alternative in Warsaw has a slightly higher premium at \u00a364.30. But both areas also earned a spot on Savoo\u2019s cheapest long weekend getaways in second at \u00a3231.57 and third place with \u00a3242.60 respectively including hotels, food and drinks.\n\nSlovakia\n\nRounding out the top five is Barislava in Slovakia with \u00a363.40 return flights available. The historic city also came in just under Prague for the cheapest weekend getaway, costing roughly \u00a3267.89 for three days and two nights.\n\nFinally, Budapest in Hungary, Vilnius in Lithuania, Riga in Latvia and Lisbon in Portugal rounded out the latter part of the top 10 with return flights ranging between \u00a365 and \u00a371. The experts warned that while hidden gems and lesser-known destinations like Bratislava are likely to have cheaper flights all-year round, there are some ways to bag a bargain on even the most popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe experts shared their top five money-saving tips while booking flights. Starting with the most obvious in avoiding popular dates like Fridays or school holidays when trips are likely to be more expensive due to increased demand.\n\nIf you can be even more flexible with dates, the experts recommended: \u201cLast-minute deals can save you a ton of money. So if you\u2019re brave, try to hold off booking until a couple of weeks before you want to go.\u201d\n\nJust like avoiding popular travel dates, avoiding the popular airports can save some change for your getaway. The experts explained: \u201cConsider an airport close by. For example, if you\u2019re headed to Orlando, you don\u2019t just need to fly into Orlando International Airport. Both Melbourne and Tampa have airports with flights from the UK, which can cost a lot less.\u201d\n\nLayovers generally tend to be cheaper than direct flights, up to 50% in some cases, they claimed, although it is more time-consuming. Using voucher codes, discounts and comparison sites can also earn back some cash for your trip.\n\nOne subtle way to ensure you\u2019re not getting priced out of a getaway is to look for flights using an incognito mode browser tab, the experts recommended. This avoids installing permanent cookies on your browser so you\u2019re less likely to be shown inflated prices sometimes given to people who are consistently browsing some flights."

These can include minimum spends, multibuy offers, or product-specific promotions (i.e. 10% off selected tablets). You can view all associated requirements by clicking \u201cView terms and conditions\u201d below your code.\n\nIf this does not solve your issue, you can contact our customer service team by emailing coupons.tomsguide@futurenet.com.

Talk about shopping with peace of mind!\n\nNewsletter sign-ups: Get all the latest offers, news, and product information sent straight to your inbox when you sign up for the Microsoft newsletter.\n\nHow to use Microsoft coupons 1) Once you\u2019ve found the offer you\u2019d like to use, click the \u2018Get Code\u2019 button underneath the offer. This will make a pop-out box appear, showing the code. It will also open a tab on the Microsoft website. 2) Click the \u2018Copy\u2019 button in the pop-out box to copy the coupon. 3) Time for shopping! Once you have everything, head to the checkout. Once you\u2019ve got to the payment section, you can paste your code in.\n\n\n\nHow we source coupon codes\n\nAll the codes you see on PC Gamer have been sourced by our dedicated coupons team. Using our affiliate networks, partnerships with brands, and the world wide web, we track down the latest and best coupon codes and ways to save on your online orders. Our pages are updated multiple times a week, and our commercial team also uses their connections to negotiate exclusive codes with big name brands, so you can find all the best available codes and promotions listed in one place.\n\nHow we test coupon codes\n\nTo ensure that every code you see is ready to use, our team tests each one before uploading it to a page. Whether it's for free shipping, a multibuy offer, a student discount, or savings in the sales, we check that the code can be applied at the checkout and works as described. We don\u2019t include any one-time or user-specific codes, so you haven\u2019t got to worry about anyone else beating you to the punch, and you\u2019ll find codes for products across all kinds of categories.\n\nWe also include all the information about a coupon, such as terms and conditions and the expiry date, on the page below the offer description. Simply click \u2018Terms & Conditions\u2019 and you\u2019ll expand the code box, where you\u2019ll be able to read any specific instructions or requirements associated with your chosen coupon. We do our best to update this information whenever any changes are made, with each page checked at least twice a week.\n\nWhat to do if a coupon code doesn\u2019t work\n\nDespite our best efforts, sometimes coupons won\u2019t work as expected. Expiry dates and terms and conditions can be changed by the retailer, or the code may simply no longer be accepted. Should you run into any issues, don\u2019t worry - our customer service team is available to offer support.\n\nThe first port of call should always be to check the coupon\u2019s terms and conditions to make sure you meet all requirements. Codes may be product-specific (i.e. 5% off gaming laptops), require a minimum order value (i.e. when you spend $50 or more), or need you to verify your status (i.e. verify with a valid military email address). Click the \u2018terms & conditions\u2019 text below the \u2018Get Code\u2019 button to view all available information.\n\nIf you\u2019re still having issues once you\u2019ve confirmed that you meet the necessary requirements, you can get in touch with our team by sending an email to coupons.pcgamer@futurenet.com. Include a summary of which code you tried to use, where you found it, and what went wrong, and we\u2019ll reply as soon as we can to help out.\n\nHow we make money\n\nPC Gamer earns money from its coupon pages through a commission model. We have deals in place with every retailer that has a corresponding coupon page on our site. When you shop with one of these retailers and use one of our codes to get a discount, the brand will pay us a percentage of the final order total in commission.\n\nUsing this model means that redeeming a discount through PC Gamer never costs you a thing. We don\u2019t charge any fees to apply a code, and all our money is made directly from retailers, not our audience. You\u2019ll only ever pay for the products or services you buy, with lower prices just as they\u2019re described on the page."

            "source": "CNET",
            "article_content": "Though it sometimes feels like everyone's following the same trend (AI), the technology we saw at CES 2025 was remarkably diverse, from practical devices for your home to mind-bogglingly powerful laptops to the next revolutions in health tech.\n\nSome of the concepts at CES might come years in the future (or never), while many other products are available for sale right now. Here are the six biggest trends from CES that we think will make the largest impact in 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for the very top products from the trade show, be sure to check out the official 2025 Best of CES Awards, selected by the CNET Group.\n\nRobots keep getting better, smarter, cuter, smaller and creepier\n\nMost of the non-novelty robots shown at CES bear a functional resemblance to the robots used commercially -- by that I mean you can tell they're the product of the same research in movement and AI as they pick things up, fold, clean and so on. Expensive models like Mi-Mo, Beatbot, R2D3 and more.\n\nSamsung's yellow Ballie home robot is going to ship this year. James Martin/CNET\n\nMore consumer-friendly models were less functional, like the tiny, fuzzy bots that you hang on your handbag as a fashion statement or the adorable model with huge anime eyes that follows you around on wheels but seems like a surveillance nightmare (the TCL AI Me). There were also the concepts of yesteryear that finally edged toward saleability, such as Samsung's Ballie -- a spherical bot with a projector in its belly, like a baby Teletubbie.\n\nWatch this: Sorry, There Are No 'Best Robots' at CES This Year 03:22\n\nOn the \"whut?\" front perches a tiny robot whose function is simply to blow on hot beverages.\n\nBut the models that resonated the most with us were home helpers that don't cost tens of thousands of dollars, like Roborock's Saros Z70 robot vacuum cleaner -- it sports an arm that can pick up your socks -- or Eureka's J15 Max Ultra, which detects spills and untangles its own brushes. And one of the most innovative was the Lymow One, a robot mower that cuts the grass and feeds mulched matter back to your lawn. There's always a ton of laundry robots -- unsurprising given how much everyone hates laundry -- like Tenet's AI Laundry Robot, which washes and folds.\n\nAnd we can't forget the token \"most human-looking\" robot, Realbotix's $175K Aria robot, which is designed for \"companionship and intimacy\" -- and looks it, given she's built along the lines of an old-school Barbie.\n\nUltimately, we chose not to pick a best robot because of how removed they were from interaction. In fact, many of the expensive models were in more of a zoo environment: Look at the magical creature in its habitat, repeatedly picking things up and moving them elsewhere. That's the kind of thing we've been seeing for years.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nNvidia doesn't make robots, but it's been working on its robot LLMs and operating systems for years. And every time Nvidia trots out this visual at its events, I can't help but think that Nvidia is building a robot army. Well, that and Metropolis.\n\nAI inside, again, but more powerful\n\nThere seemed to be less hype about AI in devices (though it's possible I have successfully learned to tune it out), but about the same in mobile apps like Delta's AI concierge. However, it was everywhere in laptops thanks to the annual chip updates from Intel and AMD -- which of course brought the usual faster, better and improved battery life -- plus bundles of \"try it!\" software for your out-of-the-box AI experience.\n\nWatch this: Everything Announced at Nvidia's CES Event in 12 Minutes 11:47\n\nBut in this respect, Nvidia stole the show for its Cosmos AI model (Nvidia has been working on and licensing its various models for autonomous cars, robots and more for years, but this seemed to be its biggest \"moment\"), as well as its unveiling of the newest generation of consumer graphics.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Hands-Down Won AI at CES 2025, and Also the Show Itself. Here's Why That Matters\n\nThe GeForce RTX 50 series not only promises the typical performance bump PC gamers expect, but thanks to the new Blackwell generation of GPUs, it brings more powerful and better generative AI capabilities down to your local system. That means cheaper entry for developers, the ability for end users to run bigger models, as well speed improvements (via Nvidia's DLSS 4) and more sophisticated capabilities for games.\n\nWatch this: These New Smart Glasses Want to Be Your Next AI Companion 02:31\n\nThere weren't a lot of new smart glasses, but Halliday's stood out for the way they present information: Rather than on the screen, they have a tiny monochrome display that shows text.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Smart Glasses Moment Is Here. But They're Still Missing Something Big\n\nThe big AI news for cars at CES wasn't, for once, autonomininity: It was Volkswagen bringing ChatGPT to its voice assistant for more complex, natural-language help.\n\nRead more: Nvidia's CEO Explains How Its New AI Models Could Work on Future Smart Glasses\n\nCouch potato 'tainment\n\nOne of CES' core pillars is entertainment (it used to be baked right into the name), which generally means TVs and audio. There weren't any new screen technologies, but there were improvements and innovations with existing ones.\n\nThe suction cups on the back of the Displace TV James Martin/CNET\n\nTweaks to OLED came to TVs, with LG's G5 OLED's quality bump impressing us the most for its better brightness and contrast, along with HiSense's 116-inch MicroLED model. But the TV that seemed to make the biggest impact on us were Displace's hang-anywhere-thanks-to-huge-suction-cups TVs, shipping versions of prototypes we've seen in past years.\n\nWatch this: Displace TV's 55-Inch Television Hangs From a Wall Using Suction Cups 03:15\n\nI think its impact was partly due to the enormous opportunity for \"suck\" puns.\n\nThere was the usual complement of gaming desktops, laptops and monitors, the latter offering the typical year upgrade to higher refresh rates (500Hz and 600Hz).\n\nWatch this: Lenovo's New Legion Go S Gaming Handheld Is Lighter and Smaller but Packs a Big Surprise 03:30\n\nBut the biggest hit was Lenovo's new handheld console. The company is the first to offer (or at least announce) a SteamOS-based model, one of the new Legion G S models. Acer's Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handheld, however, earned some mockery, because you can't really respect a \"handheld\" if it's bigger than your head.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Time for an Xbox Handheld Is Now\n\nBut it was also kind of hard to sustain excitement about gaming hardware at CES this year, because of a shiny new thing possibly on the horizon. Rumors say the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming soon.\n\nHealth and beauty, the staples of CES\n\nSometimes I think CES specializes in sleep, skin and smart rings, plus technology designed to make you feel like a loser -- so many smart mirrors, though none yet use generative AI to simulate your mother's critical voice or to show you what you could look like if you just tried harder. But maybe that's just me.\n\nThere may not have been as many this year, but there were some standouts. Withing's Omnia smart mirror combines a scale and a mirror to not only tell you if you're overweight and in bad health, but to show you as well. There's always a device for analyzing your skin to tell you what to buy to fix it, such as L'Oreal's BioPrint. (To be fair, I don't know what it's suggestions are.)\n\nWatch this: I Said Yes to Trying a Smart Ring You Can Propose With 01:45\n\nAnd, oh, the rings. One way to attract attention among the plethora of rings designed to monitor your health is to make it gold and platinum, like the UltraHuman Rare ring: Nothing's more romantic than a ring that says, \"Marry me\" and \"Please don't die,\" simultaneously. Or alternatively, \"Show me off on Instagram.\"\n\nDon't forget the annual dose of flatware that makes you healthier. This year's entrant is Kirin Electric Salt Spoon, intended to give you that salty taste without any of the nasty sodium -- by zapping your tongue with a bit of electricity. On the other hand, if they could do that for chocolate, I'd be first in line.\n\nLisa Eadicicco/CNET\n\nAnd while the Nike x Hyperice's \"boatlike booties are basically recovery high-tops festooned with buttons and designed to help your weary tootsies recover from soreness and strain,\" they sound pretty awesome.\n\nBut there were some truly practical and innovative new products, like the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which stay in, are flush with your ears for side sleepers and have sensors and other tech to help improve the quality of your sleep. Our team also called out the YoctoMat, a smart yoga mat that provides feedback on your poses. And while I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as health or beauty, in the interest of hydration, the Roam SodaTop is a bottle cap with a CO2 cartridge so you can carbonate your water on the go.\n\nHome is where the heat is\n\nHome tech tends to cover a lot of bases, many of them robotic. No one really likes to vacuum, do laundry or mow the lawn like the AI-driven robot vacuums and lawnmower I mentioned above.\n\nRead more: Commentary I Really Don't Want an AI Pot to Turn My Plant Into a Tamagotchi From Hell\n\nVideo smart locks seemed to be the focus of home security upgrades this year -- we call out Lockly's Vision Prestige and TCLs Smart Lock D1 Ultra -- providing more information than existing models. Notable, also, because someone breaking in doesn't use the video doorbell.\n\n23 Fascinating Home Tech Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025, the Biggest Tech Show on Earth +21 More See all photos\n\nCooling and heating were hot as well, especially Samsung's DHS Mono R32 HT heat pump, which heats outside air, condenses it to water and feeds it to your water tank. As an apartment dweller, I'm partial to the Gradient All-Weather 120V Window Heat Pump, which supplies heat when the weather gets frosty. Cooling and heating go hand-in-hand with utility bills and power backup -- I was really intrigued by the BioLite, which provides battery backup for a couple of key appliances, like the refrigerator.\n\nAnd Savant's Smart Budget is designed to save you money by routing power automatically (and manually) to balance output, thereby potentially saving you the expense of rewiring your home to support new, power-sucking devices. Plus, Aqara introduced the Touchscreen Dial V1, a clever and useful dial that can control all your smart devices\n\nAnd lest we forget the bread-and-butter of small appliances. There are always plenty, though really it's the oddballs and gimmicks that catch more attention than the mundane. This year, we saw the phone-controlled Panasonic HomeChef 4-in-1 Multi-Oven, the Apecoo tortilla and roti maker (food samples really seemed to attract us), LG's \"Perfect Fancy Microwave for Social Media\" with a 27-inch display and much, much more.\n\nThe future and the future's future\n\nThe big deals for cars (and other things that tote people) tend to be new technologies and other future-flung concepts. BMW gave us panoramic IDrive with operating system X, a three-tier, ultra wide holographic 3D windshield display that's actually not too far out from your next BMW, and Hyundai Mobis holographic windshield display one-ups it by constraining the angle of view to the driver.\n\nWatch this: Aptera Solar EV Gets All the Energy It Needs From the Sun 04:45\n\nWe see flying cars at the show every year, but sadly we're no closer to me getting one. This year's concept-du-jour was the Xpeng AeroHT, a massive six-wheeler with an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in its trunk. Aptera's solar EV isn't a flying car, but it really looks like it should have wings.\n\nThe Pebble Flow Electric RV concept -- solar chargeable -- came back for a visit, as did Sony's Afeela, and the latter is ready for your money, if not delivery. Honda trotted out prototypes of its 0 series EVs (one step closer to reality than the concept we saw last year), a sports sedan and a van. See the new photos.\n\nBut a new motor concept claims to vastly increase the range of EVs -- arguably more important than all the shiny paint and glowy dashboards.\n\nGeoffrey Morrison/CNET\n\nAnother concept that appealed to me personally was Nanosys' next-gen MicroLED, dubbed UV LED, which uses ultraviolet light to energize RGB quantum dots to precise frequencies: Different lIght frequencies are how we perceive color. MicroLED may potentially supplant OLED in big screens and small. It somewhat upstaged Samsung's MicroLED watch concept with an uber-bright screen. Samsung also brought us a somewhat disturbing-looking stretchable screen for a 3D-ish view and a transparent MicroLED screen. Lenovo's concept ThinkBook with a rollable screen looks and gesture controls appear sleek.\n\nIn a class by itself, the Flint Paper Battery claims to be a new, sustainable power source that may eventually replace lithium ion with cellulose.\n\nWatch this: I Made Things Weird Trying TSA's New Shoe Scanner Machine 03:53\n\nFinally, I will never forget Bridget Carey smuggling Gummy Worms in her shoe to test TSA's new scanner -- after complaining about the ick factor of shuffling our socks or bare soles across a floor that's had thousands of other shoes scrape across it. Gummy Worms in your shoe has a pretty high ick factor, too."

            "article_content": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have partially supported Elon Musk\u2019s claims in his ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI, as he seeks to block the artificial intelligence (AI) startup\u2019s transition to a for-profit entity.\n\nIn a court filing on Friday, the agencies argued that overlapping board directors could harm market competition, even if the individuals in question have since stepped down.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawsuit accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of violating antitrust laws, highlighting Reid Hoffman\u2019s simultaneous board memberships at both companies between 2017 and 2023.\n\nHoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, is alleged to have created conflicts of interest during his tenure.\n\nAdditionally, the suit points to Deannah Templeton, a Microsoft executive, who served as a non-voting participant on OpenAI\u2019s board from December 2023 to July 2024.\n\nThe DOJ and FTC\u2019s position\n\nWhile the agencies did not explicitly oppose OpenAI\u2019s restructuring, their filing emphasizes concerns about anti-competitive practices stemming from inappropriate board overlaps.\n\nThe DOJ and FTC noted in their filing: \u201cWhere a defendant voluntarily ceases illegal conduct, it still bears a heavy burden to demonstrate it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behaviour could not reasonably be expected to recur.\u201d\n\nThe FTC is also investigating OpenAI as part of several probes into AI investments by Microsoft and other technology giants.\n\nThe agency has been examining whether OpenAI misled consumers about its services and whether inappropriate board overlaps involving Hoffman and Templeton violated antitrust regulations.\n\nHoffman has publicly criticized FTC Chair Lina Khan, even calling for her removal from the agency.\n\nMusk\u2019s fight against openAI\u2019s conversion\n\nThe lawsuit forms part of Musk\u2019s broader campaign against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Musk has alleged that OpenAI has strayed from its nonprofit origins, claiming it abandoned its founding mission of advancing AI for the public good when it began receiving billions in funding from Microsoft starting in 2019.\n\nMusk\u2019s recent filing seeks an injunction to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model, labeling the move \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nA hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Tuesday in Oakland, California.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI has dismissed Musk\u2019s lawsuit as baseless, arguing that his claims are inconsistent with his past support for a corporate structure that allowed for-profit operations.\n\nThe company has defended the board stints of Hoffman and Templeton, stating they did not breach antitrust laws.\n\nOpenAI has so far refrained from commenting on Friday\u2019s filing but maintains that its restructuring aligns with its strategic goals.\n\nA long-running dispute\n\nThis legal battle marks the latest chapter in Musk\u2019s history with OpenAI. The billionaire, who departed from the company in 2018 and later founded rival AI firm xAI in 2023, first filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in February before withdrawing it in June.\n\nThe litigation was reintroduced in federal court in August.\n\nMusk argues that without immediate judicial intervention, OpenAI\u2019s market dominance could stifle competition, making it nearly impossible for rivals to compete with what he describes as Altman\u2019s \u201cbehemoth.\u201d\n\nThe case, Musk v. Altman, continues in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, with significant implications for AI regulation, corporate governance, and the future of the technology sector."

            "article_content": "Geographies with a demographic dividend, such as India and Sub-saharan African nations, will supply nearly two-thirds of new workforce entrants in the coming years, according to the latest Future of Jobs report from the World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\n\n\nThe report tags demographic shifts as one of the most crucial aspects in transforming global economies and labour markets. \u201cTwo demographic shifts are increasingly seen to be transforming global economies and labour markets: ageing and declining working age populations, predominantly in higher-income economies, and expanding working age populations, predominantly in lower-income economies,\u201d it says.\n\nThe WEF observes that these trends drive an increase in demand for skills in \u201ctalent management, teaching and mentoring, and motivation and self-awareness\u201d.\n\nThe WEF also observes that the Demographic shifts have a direct impact on global labour supply. \u201cCurrently balanced between lower-income (49 per cent) and higher-income (51 per cent) working-age populations, this distribution is expected to shift by 2050, with lower-income countries projected to hold 59 per cent of the global working-age population,\u201d says the report.\n\nAccording to the report, Increased digital access, geopolitical tensions, and climate mitigation efforts are the primary trends expected to shape the future of jobs in India by 2030. The WEF observes that similar to their peers, companies operating in India are heavily investing in AI, robotics, autonomous systems, and energy technologies.\n\nNotably, data from Coursera suggests that the demand for AI skills has accelerated globally, with India and the United States leading in enrolment numbers.\n\n\u201cHowever, the drivers of demand differ. In the United States, demand is primarily driven by individual users, whereas in India, corporate sponsorship plays a significant role in boosting GenAI training uptake,\u201d says the WEF report.\n\nThe Future of Jobs report also observes that employers in India are planning to outpace global adoption in certain technologies, with 35 per cent expecting semiconductors and computing technologies and 21 per cent expecting quantum and encryption to transform their operations. \u201cThe country\u2019s projected fastest-growing job roles\u2014including big data specialists, AI and machine learning specialists, and security management specialists\u2014align closely with these trends.\n\nTo address talent needs, companies operating in India expect tapping into diverse talent pools (67 per cent, compared to 47 per cent globally) and adopting skills-based hiring by removing degree requirements (30 per cent, compared to 19 per cent globally) to be effective,\u201d says the report."

            "article_content": "The collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has alarmed many regional countries, including the UAE and Egypt - but Israel is particularly concerned by this development.\n\nAn Israeli government committee has even suggested that a Syria ruled by Sunni Islamists who don\u2019t recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist could potentially pose a bigger threat to the country than Iran, Israel\u2019s archenemy.\n\nThe committee was particularly unnerved by Turkey\u2019s influence in Syria, claiming that Ankara could use the new Syrian government as a proxy force \u201cto restore the Ottoman Crown to its former glory\u201d - whatever that means.\n\nThe report noted that Ankara could rapidly rearm the new Syrian government, potentially triggering a direct conflict between Israel and Turkey.\n\nBut is this a realistic scenario? In short, the answer is no.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nAlthough Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gradually weakened Turkish-Israeli bilateral relations - cutting trade ties, denying air travel to senior Israeli officials, accusing Tel Aviv of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and delivering fiery populist speeches hinting that the Turkish army could one day aid the Palestinian people - there is no indication that Ankara seeks a military confrontation with Israel.\n\nApart from the fact that both Turkey and Israel are US allies, and the two sides have never engaged in a military conflict, Ankara has no appetite for such adventures - especially while the region is already grappling with an ongoing war between Iran and Israel, alongside the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.\n\nTurkey's objectives in Syria\n\nTurkey\u2019s aims in Syria are very clear, and they have been communicated both publicly and privately to all actors involved.\n\nFirstly, as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted, Ankara wants a stable Syria that poses no threat to other nations. Secondly, Turkey envisions a democratic, unitary and civil state in Syria - one that embraces minorities and all ethnic groups, while preventing the formation of a Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) statelet.\n\nAfter hosting millions of Syrian refugees for more than a decade and conducting multiple military operations, which have cost Turkish lives and hundreds of millions of dollars, Ankara wants a Syria that can economically and socially flourish. A conflict with Israel, whether direct or indirect, does not align with that goal.\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake\n\nSo far, Turkey\u2019s actions have supported these objectives.\n\nAnkara initially - and to a large extent - turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s aerial campaign to destroy remnants of the Assad regime\u2019s military facilities. But after Israel expanded its targets significantly, Fidan announced that Turkey had relayed a message to Israel that such attacks must stop.\n\nFidan acknowledged Israeli concerns that arms, such as chemical weapons, could fall into the wrong hands. Notably, Israel has avoided striking any Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) targets.\n\nFurthermore, Turkey has reportedly taken the first steps to establish a deconfliction mechanism with the Israeli military in Syria. Reports also point to routine engagements between Turkish and Israeli intelligence agencies.\n\nIn addition, according to my sources, Ankara has encouraged HTS leaders, including Ahmed al-Sharaa, to issue statements advocating calm with Israel. Several HTS figures have publicly said they are not seeking a clash with Israel.\n\nRisks of fragmentation\n\nMeanwhile, according to my Turkish contacts, there are indications that Damascus may seek to engage Ankara militarily, potentially moving Turkish advisers to Syrian military academies and airbases, to help re-establish a unified Syrian army under the Syrian defence ministry.\n\nTurkey is mindful of Israeli concerns regarding such cooperation. What I hear is that Turkey's deployments will be limited. They would not go beyond Hama and, to some extent, Damascus - an effort to reassure Israel that Ankara\u2019s actions are not hostile.\n\nBut Israel must come to terms with the fact that Ankara will not tolerate a PKK-controlled statelet in northern Syria. Turkey has consistently insisted that Kurdish groups must be integrated into a unified Syrian state.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Syria threaten regional stability and will ultimately backfire Read More \u00bb\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake.\n\nAnother report in Israel Hayom this week also talked about Israel's plan for an international conference to divide Syria into canons.\n\nA fragmented Syria would be a breeding ground for armed groups, further destabilising the region and creating long-term risks for Israel. By contrast, a democratic and inclusive Syria serves everyone\u2019s interests.\n\nUnfortunately, it is clear that Israel\u2019s leadership prefers dealing with autocratic regimes, which are more transactional and reliable in their oppressive policies - making Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and the occupied West Bank easier to justify and swallow.\n\nIt is true that Turkey now has a friend in Damascus. Erdogan stands to benefit from this relationship on multiple fronts: domestically, economically and regionally.\n\nBut this does not mean that the new Syrian government will become a Turkish proxy. On the contrary, if fortune is on our side, Syria will - for the first time - have a legitimate administration focused on one thing only: rebuilding the country as a place of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "Warning: this article contains images some readers might find distressing.\n\nUK scientists have made a major breakthrough while investigating inflammatory bowel disease, which could change the lives of thousands.\n\nBecause of this finding, it is no longer 'not clear' what causes the condition, according to scientists and we could very well be on the way to finding a suitable treatment plan that helps so many people get rid of their painful symptoms.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe breakthrough could change the lives of those who suffer from IBD, as effective treatments might have been right in front of us all along without anyone even knowing.\n\nThe answer to the IBD question was revealed after the researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and University College London found that there is a weak spot in the DNA of people who suffer from IBD, while they were trying to figure out where the condition originates from.\n\nThe researchers made a breakthrough (SEBASTIAN KAULITZKI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty)\n\nThey revealed that this DNA glitch was present in 95 percent of people who have the disease, and now they reckon they have finally gotten to the bottom of what causes the illness to occur.\n\nAdvert\n\nThis horrid condition causes people to feel uncomfortable, bloated, pain in their abdomen and it can also make them vomit too if they eat certain foods.\n\nSo, finding a proper treatment would save so many people from having to live with debilitating symptoms.\n\nDr James Lee, the group leader of the genetic mechanisms of disease laboratory at Francis Crick, explained that his team 'stumbled' on the groundbreaking discovery after taking a closer look at a 'gene desert'.\n\nThis is scientific jargon for a stretch of DNA on chromosome 21, which does not code for proteins and has previously been linked to health problems, such as IBD and other autoimmune diseases.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe research, which was detailed in Nature, said that scientists realised a particular section of DNA - dubbed an 'enhancer' - acts similarly to a volume control for nearby genes.\n\nBut this booster was only seen in immune cells, or white blood cells, known as macrophages - where it amplified a gene called ETS2 and dually raised the risk of IBD.\n\nMacrophages flood the linings of the intestines and release chemicals called cytokines, which trigger massive inflammation - and as we all know, too much of this for prolonged periods is uncomfortable to say the least.\n\nResearchers found that the 'enhancer' section of DNA is the macrophage's 'master regulator' of inflammation after conducting thorough genetic analysis, which Dr Lee said sits 'at the top of the pyramid'.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey found that there is a DNA weakness (NEMES LASZLO/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY / Getty)\n\nDr Lee added: \"This is undoubtedly one of the central pathways that goes wrong for people to get inflammatory bowel disease. It is the process by which one of the most important cells that causes inflammatory bowel disease goes wrong.\"\n\nDubbing it a 'holy grail' discovery, he explained that drugs which are already approved for other illnesses such as cancer were able to calm this excessive inflammation - but they need to be tweaked to perfection to target the macrophages.\n\nDr Lee said he hopes that clinical trials will be underway within five years.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey are now keen to set up human trials after realising drugs which already exist seem to reverse the disease in laboratory experiments - so it's looking up for those with IBD.\n\nIf you didn't know, around half a million people in the UK are suffering from some form of inflammatory bowel disease, but Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both the most common.\n\nSufferers typically experience symptoms such as diarrhoea, stomach pain or cramps, blood in their poo, bleeding from their bottom, fatigue and excessive weight loss without trying.\n\nThere's obviously a big overlap between the signs of IBD and other similar conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but you can differentiate between the two as IBD causes inflammation in the bowels.\n\nAccording to the NHS website at the time of writing, it is 'not clear' what causes the disease, but it 'happens when your immune system attacks your bowel, which causes it to get inflamed'.\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to update the website as now it\u2019s very much clear."
