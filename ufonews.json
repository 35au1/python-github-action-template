        "article_content": "Although Windows 11 2024 Update (version 24H2) is laser-focused on further integrating AI, the feature update also comes with many non-AI features that will continue to enhance the overall experience across the desktop.\n\nFor example, in version 24H2, Microsoft finally brings the Sudo (Superuser Do) command like the one available on macOS and Linux. The Energy Saver mode will help you save energy whether you have a laptop or a desktop computer with a battery. File Explorer can finally create archival formats like 7zip and TAR. You will also find a new universal print driver that no longer requires you to supply the device driver from the manufacturer, and the operating system now supports Wi-Fi 7, among other things.\n\nIn this guide, I will dive into the most interesting non-AI features that are part of Windows 11 version 24H2.\n\nIn the latest version of Windows 11, you will find these new features.\n\n1. Sudo for Windows 11\n\nWindows 11 is finally getting the same Sudo command that Unix-based systems have had for more than three decades.\n\nThe new Sudo command has been designed to help you run commands in the elevated mode without having to re-open the Windows Terminal as an administrator.\n\nUsing this command, you can delete protected files, invoke elevated commands, and launch a new terminal window. However, it's very limited compared to the Sudo command available on Linux or macOS.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nYou must enable this feature manually from Settings > System > For developers and turn on the \"Enable sudo\" toggle switch.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nIt's also possible to change the behavior of the command to run applications:\n\nInline: This option runs virtually any command in elevated mode, such as Linux and macOS.\n\nThis option runs virtually any command in elevated mode, such as Linux and macOS. With input disabled: This option runs the command elevated, but it will close the ability to receive input from the current console.\n\nThis option runs the command elevated, but it will close the ability to receive input from the current console. In a new window (default): This option will launch a new window to run the command elevated.\n\nIf you want to try this command, open the Windows Terminal in Command Prompt or PowerShell and run this sudo netstat -ab command.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\n2. Energy Saver\n\nOn Windows 11 version 24H2, Energy Saver is a new mode to save energy on laptops and desktop computers without a battery.\n\nThe new power-saving mode isn't entirely new. It's based on the existing \"Battery Saver\" and \"Power mode\" features. In other words, Energy Saver extends battery life and reduces energy usage at the cost of performance.\n\nYou can enable the feature from Settings > Power & battery (or Power), click the \"Energy saver\" toggle switch and then configure the feature.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nIf you have a laptop, you will be able to specify when to turn on the feature as the battery drops, or you can choose to have the feature running all the time.\n\nOn desktop computers without a battery, you can only turn on the feature manually to conserve energy.\n\n3. Archival format creation support\n\nAs part of the improvements for File Explorer, the feature update is introducing a new wizard to create archival formats, including 7zip and TAR. Of course, this is in addition to Zip files.\n\nIf you want to create an archival format, you can right-click a file, folder, or selection of files and folders and then choose the \"7z\" and \"TAR\" options to create the archive with the default settings.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nIf you choose the \"Additional options,\" you will open the wizard with the options to select the archival format, including 7zip, different types of TAR formats, or Zip.\n\nDepending on the format you're trying to create, you can also select the compression method and the compression level.\n\nYou can also control the symbolic and hard links for the archival format.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nFinally, you only have to click the \"Create\" button.\n\nIt's important to note that it's not possible to work with passwords. If you have to open or create archival formats with encryption using a password, you will still need to source to a third-party solution.\n\n4. Color profiles on Settings\n\nAlthough the ability to add color profiles has been available for a long time, it was available through the Control Panel, but now, Windows 11 is porting the feature into the Settings app.\n\nStarting with version 24H2, you can manage color profiles from Settings > Display > Color profile. On the page, you can choose the display you want to configure and then click the \"Add profile\" button to import the \"ICM\" or \"ICC\" file to your computer.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nYou can import as many profiles as you need, and you can change between them from the section below.\n\nOn the page, you will also find an option to open the legacy app to calibrate the display.\n\n5. Windows Protected Print mode\n\nThe Windows Protected Print mode (WPP) mode is a new universal driver that allows you to set up printers without installing third-party software. You connect the printer to the computer and start using it right away.\n\nThe new universal modern print stack streamlines the print setup process and increases security for these peripherals. The only caveat is that it's only available for Mopria printers.\n\nIf you have a Mopria printer, you can enable this feature from Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Printers & scanners. Then, click the \"Set Up\" button for the \"Windows protected print mode\" setting and continue with the on-screen direction steps.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nWhen using this feature, the system will delete all the existing print drivers from the computer.\n\nIn addition, inside the printer properties page, Windows 11 is also adding a new \"Additional printer settings\" section with the option to rename the printer or pause a print job. In the past, these features were available through the Control Panel.\n\n(Image credit: m)\n\n6. Wi-Fi 7 support\n\nAnother exciting non-AI feature coming to version 24H2 is support for Wi-Fi 7. This is the latest IEEE 802.11be Extremely High Throughput (EHT) standard for wireless connectivity, boasting a theoretical maximum speed of over 40 Gbps.\n\nThe support also requires a Wi-Fi 7 network adapter and a wireless access point that supports the standard.\n\nIt's important to note that as part of the wireless improvements, the Quick Settings flyout includes a new refresh button to refresh the list of available networks.\n\nAlso, on Settings > Network & internet > Wi-Fi, inside the wireless properties, the \"Wi-Fi network password\" setting is at the top of the page, and clicking the \"Show\" button to reveal the wireless password.\n\n(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nIn addition to the password, you will also notice a QR Code that you can scan with any camera app on another device to share the wireless credentials.\n\nI'm only curating the non-AI features that I believe are the best ones. This feature update packs many different features, including those with AI capabilities (such as Windows Recall) and many improvements to existing features.\n\nImportant: The Windows 11 2024 Update has become partially available on June 18, 2024, for Copilot+ PCs, but it won't include all the intended features, including Windows Recall, as it has been postponed until further notice. In September or October, the feature update will become more broadly available for existing devices. As a result, some of the new features and changes may not be available to everyone on day one. Also, some features (especially AI features) may require new hardware to be available.\n\nMore resources\n\nFor more helpful articles, coverage, and answers to common questions about Windows 10 and Windows 11, visit the following resources:"

Read preview\n\nThis summer, Amazon Web Services rolled out a new internal campaign.\n\nThe initiative, called \"Find One, Launch One, Ramp One,\" introduced goals, prizes, and other incentives for Amazon's huge cloud-support teams across North America.\n\nThe ultimate aim was to sell more of the company's new AI offerings. Sales architects, customer success managers, and other roles were recruited into the broad push.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\n\"This is a great time to partner with our sales teams for this #OneTeam effort,\" AWS explained in an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese AWS staffers were asked to find at least one sales opportunity each month for Q, Amazon's AI assistant, and Bedrock, the company's AI platform.\n\nThen, the initiative asked employees to launch one Bedrock or Q customer workload.\n\nThe final requirement, the \"Ramp One\" part, pushed teams to generate real revenue from these workloads.\n\nAWS created a leaderboard for everyone to see the top performers. With December 1 as the deadline, the company dangled prizes, including an evening of pizza and wine at an executive's home (with guitar playing as a possibility).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA race for AI supremacy\n\nThis initiative is just one example of AWS trying to squeeze more out of its massive sales and support teams to be more competitive in AI. There's more pressure and urgency to sell AI products, along with new incentives, according to several internal documents and more than a dozen current and former AWS employees.\n\nMessaging from AWS CEO Matt Garman, previously the cloud unit's top sales executive, is to move even faster, these people said. They asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nMuch is at stake for Amazon. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, alongside a slew of smaller startups, are all vying for AI supremacy. Though Amazon is a cloud pioneer and has worked on AI for years, it is now at risk of ceding a chance to become the main platform where developers build new AI products and tools.\n\nMore pressure\n\nThe revamped sales push is part of the company's response to these challenges. As the leading cloud provider, AWS has thousands of valuable customer relationships that it can leverage to get its new AI offerings out into the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany AWS sales teams have new performance targets tied to AI products.\n\nOne team has to hit a specific number of customer engagements that focus on AWS's generative AI products, for instance.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere are also new sales targets for revenue driven by genAI products, along with AI customer win rates and a goal based on the number of genAI demos run, according to one of the internal Amazon documents.\n\nAnother AWS team tracks the number of AI-related certifications achieved by employees and how many other contributions staff have made to AI projects, one of the people said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHitting these goals is important for Amazon employees because that can result in higher performance ratings, a key factor in getting a raise or promotion.\n\nMore employees encouraged to sell AI\n\nEven roles that traditionally don't involve actively selling products are feeling pressure to find AI sales opportunities, according to Amazon employees who spoke with BI and internal documents.\n\nAWS software consultants, who mostly work on implementing cloud services, are now encouraged to find sales opportunities, blurring the line between consultants and traditional salespeople.\n\nThe \"Find One, Launch One, Ramp One\" initiative includes AWS sales architects. These staffers traditionally work with AWS salespeople to craft the right cloud service for each customer. Now, they're being incentivized to get more involved in actual selling and are being measured on the results of these efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Customers are interested in learning how to use GenAI capabilities to innovate, scale, and transform their businesses, and we are responding to this need by ensuring our teams are equipped to speak with customers about how to succeed with our entire set of GenAI solutions,\" an AWS spokesperson told BI.\n\n\"There is nothing new or abnormal about setting sales goals,\" the spokesperson added in a statement. They also stressed that AWS sales architects are not \"sellers,\" and their job is to \"help customers design solutions to meet their business goals.\"\n\nThere are \"no blurred lines,\" and roles and expectations are \"clear,\" the spokesperson also said.\n\nSelling versus reducing customer costs\n\nOne particular concern among some AWS salespeople revolves around the company's history of saving cloud customers money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome staffers told BI that they now feel the company is force-feeding customers AI products to buy, even if they don't need them. The people said this represents a shift in AWS's sales culture, which has mostly looked for opportunities to reduce customers' IT costs over the years.\n\nIn some cases, salespeople have also been asked to boost the attendance of external AWS events. Several recent AWS-hosted AI events saw low attendance records, and salespeople were told to find ways to increase the number of registrations by reaching out to customers, some of the people said.\n\nAWS's spokesperson said customer attendance has \"exceeded our expectations for a lot of our AI events,\" and the number of participants at the re:Invent annual conference \"more than doubled.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also said the notion that Amazon has moved away from its goal of saving customers money is \"false.\" The company always starts with \"the outcomes our customers are trying to achieve and works backwards from there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA hammer and a nail\n\nGarman, Amazon's cloud boss, hinted at some of these issues during an internal fireside chat held in June, according to a recording obtained by BI. He said there are sales opportunities for AWS in \"every single conversation\" with a customer, but AWS has to ensure those customers get real value out of their spending.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Too often we go talk to customers to tell them what we've built, which is not the same thing as talking to customers,\" Garman said. \"Just because you have a hammer doesn't mean the problem the customer has is the nail.\"\n\nAWS's spokesperson said the company is \"customer-obsessed\" and always tries to consider decisions \"from our customers' perspectives, like their ROI.\" Some of AWS's competitors don't take that approach, and it's a \"notable contrast,\" the spokesperson added, pointing to this BI story about a Microsoft customer complaining about subpar AI features.\n\nMore pressure but also more rewards\n\nAmazon is also doling out bonuses and other forms of potentially higher pay for AI sales success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAWS recently announced that salespeople will receive a $1,000 performance bonus for the first 25 Amazon Q licenses they sell and retain for 3 consecutive months with a given customer, according to an internal memo seen by BI. The maximum payout is $20,000 per customer.\n\nFor Bedrock, Amazon pays salespeople a bonus of $5,000 for small customers and $10,000 for bigger customers when they \"achieve 3 consecutive months of specified Bedrock incremental usage in 2024,\" the memo explained.\n\nSome AWS teams are discussing higher pay for AI specialists. Sales architects, for example, in AI-related roles across fields including security and networking could get a higher salary than generalists, one of the people said.\n\nAWS's spokesperson told BI that every major tech company provides similar sales incentives. Amazon continually evaluates compensation against the market, the spokesperson added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFear of losing to Microsoft\n\nSatya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nInside AWS, there's a general concern that Amazon was caught off guard by the sudden emergence of generative AI and is playing catch-up to its rivals, most notably Microsoft, according to the people who spoke with BI.\n\nSome Amazon employees are worried that Q is losing some customers to Microsoft's Copilot because of a lack of certain AI features, BI previously reported.\n\nMicrosoft has an advantage because of its wide range of popular business applications, including the 365 productivity suite. That makes it potentially easier for Microsoft to show customers how AI can improve their productivity, some of the Amazon employees told BI. AWS, meanwhile, has struggled to build a strong application business, despite years of trying.\n\nAWS's spokesperson challenged that by noting that AWS has several successful software applications for companies, including Amazon Connect, Bedrock, and SageMaker. The spokesperson also said Amazon Q launched in April and is already seeing robust growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's \"no secret that generative AI is an extremely competitive space,\" the spokesperson added. \"However, AWS is the leader in cloud and customer adoption of our AI innovation is fueling much of our continued growth. AWS has more generative AI services than any other cloud provider, which is why our AI services alone have a multibillion-dollar run rate.\"\n\nMore Speed\n\nA major AWS reorganization earlier this year hasn't helped the AI sales effort, according to some of the people who spoke with BI.\n\nThe big change switched AWS to more of an industry focus rather than a regional one. That caused confusion inside the company, and some large customers lost their point of contact, the people explained. AWS is still figuring out how to run as a more cohesive group, resulting in a slower sales cycle, they added.\n\nAWS's spokesperson said it's \"inaccurate\" to say its sales process has slowed, adding that year-over-year revenue growth accelerated again in the most recent quarter, and the business is now on pace to surpass $100 billion in sales this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his June fireside chat, Garman stressed the importance of speed and urged employees to \"go faster.\"\n\n\"Speed really matters,\" Garman said. \"And it doesn't necessarily mean work more hours. It means how do we make decisions faster?\"\n\nDo you work at Amazon? Got a tip?"

        "article_content": "To keep the ghosts at bay, read on for Entertainment Weekly\u2019s list of the 30 best paranormal movies, ranked.\n\nParanormal movies mainly preside in the horror and thriller genres, but there are a few comedic or dramatic exceptions. Almost all of them offer audiences an indelible glimpse of the supernatural that real life, for better or worse, doesn\u2019t afford us. There\u2019s nothing like that implacable tingle, that crawling dread, of films like these.\n\nOne has to wonder how ghosts and ghouls have time to haunt us when they\u2019re so preoccupied acting in paranormal movies. Certainly, the genre lets us live vicariously through (often ill-fated) characters who either summon or accidentally encounter some of the other side\u2019s residents.\n\n30. Paranormal Activity (2007) Everett Collection Oren Peli\u2019s genre-defining found footage thriller stars Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat as a couple who believes their suburban home might be beset by malevolent forces of some kind. With the help of a handy digital camera, the pair set out to find the source of the nightly disturbances. The Paranormal Activity franchise has gone so far down the rabbit hole that it\u2019s easy to forget its ultra-simple, stripped-back roots. Peli structures his picture in the seamless style of old-school horror-thrillers, first by establishing the characters and then spinning scares from their relationship that further exacerbate the bumps in the night. Where to watch Paranormal Activity: Max\n\n29. Session 9 (2001) Everett Brad Anderson\u2019s skin-crawling ghost story follows a group of sanitation workers (led by David Caruso and Josh Lucas) who encounter some creepy goings-on, and even spookier recordings of therapy sessions, when they\u2019re sent to clean out a disused mental asylum. Journeyman director Anderson outdid himself with this rollicking yet understated horror-fest, which executes its finest scares without using much more than its ingeniously unsettling sound design. Where to watch Session 9: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n28. The Frighteners (1996) Everett Peter Jackson\u2019s jolly horror-comedy finds an architect turned exorcist (Michael J. Fox), who\u2019s able to communicate with departed spirits, trying to solve the mounting body count in his idyllic small town while romancing the widow (Trini Alvarado) of one of the victims. Nobody does their respective jobs as well as Jackson and Fox do theirs, and to see these two working together is almost too much goodness to behold. The Frighteners is just as goofy and splattery as you want a Jackson genre picture to be, anchored in a solid mystery and Fox\u2019s preternatural ability to command the screen. Where to watch The Frighteners: Tubi\n\n27. Insidious (2010) Everett Collection Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) move their family to what should be an idyllic suburban home; but when one of their children falls ill, the Lamberts uncover a much darker reason behind his ailment. James Wan\u2019s haunted house picture essentially birthed Blumhouse\u2019s brand of inexpensive, wildly lucrative horror. In the same vein of Paranormal Activity, Wan\u2019s film launched a sprawling franchise with a simple, effective formula that packed an additional wallop for having been absent from cinemas for some time by the 2010s. Where to watch Insidious: Peacock\n\n26. It Follows (2014) Everett David Robert Mitchell\u2019s astonishing paranormal picture has spawned a litany of imitators, none of which match It Follows\u2019 distinctive mix of mood, high-concept plotting, and propulsive fear. Jay (Maika Monroe) has sex with her boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) only to discover he\u2019s passed along a fatal curse that she can only shake by sleeping with another person. And so it begins its shape-shifting pursuit \u2014 slow, deliberate, agonizingly persistent. Mitchell conjures a maddening sense of dread out of the simplest techniques; once we\u2019ve seen the entity walking toward Jay, every person casually moving in the background feels like a threat. Of course, It Follows is as much about growing up as it is about fear and sex \u2014 or, rather, it\u2019s about what\u2019s scary about growing up, the dying of the youthful presumption of safety, protection, and immortality. Where to watch It Follows: Netflix\n\n25. The Amityville Horror (1979) Everett Collection This classic haunted house tale tells the unfortunate \u201ctrue\u201d story of George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin and Margot Kidder), who buy a rambling house on Long Island only to discover its murderous past and supernatural inhabitants. A tremendously effective horror story that takes its time to eke out substantial frights, Stuart Rosenberg\u2019s completely over-the-top vision of yuppie-dom gone awry kicked off one of Hollywood\u2019s most dubious franchises. Though a few of the sequels have their merits, Amityville in Space and Amityville Karen remain for completists only. Where to watch The Amityville Horror: Max\n\n24. Sinister (2012) Phil Caruso/Summit Entertainment Scott Derrickson\u2019s brilliant found footage-cum-haunted house tale stars Ethan Hawke as a morally murky true crime journalist who moves with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and kids into the home where a brutal family murder took place, the inspiration for his latest book. Things go badly, and only get worse when Hawke finds a box of 16mm snuff films in the attic. Derrickson is a woefully underrated horror director, and Sinister is his crowning achievement. The gory recordings are photographed in a surrealistic, utterly chilling manner, and, set to Christopher Young\u2019s masterful industrial score, they carry an uncommon power. Where to watch Sinister: Max\n\n23. Child\u2019s Play (1988) United Artists/Everett Tom Holland\u2019s franchise kick-off finds the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transferred into a cherubic Good Guys doll named Chucky. When the toy makes its way into the home of Andy (Alex Vincent) and his exhausted mother (Catherine Hicks), only a dedicated detective (Chris Sarandon) can stop the bloodshed. Holland treats the idea of a loony murderer\u2019s spirit occupying a doll\u2019s form with an uncommon seriousness. Though some of the later installments veered into comedy, this original makes a compelling case for taking Chucky very seriously indeed. Where to watch Child\u2019s Play: Tubi\n\n22. Final Destination 2 (2003) Everett Collection David R. Ellis\u2019 wildly entertaining first sequel in the admirably consistent franchise follows a group of spring-break revelers (led by A.J. Cook and returning star Ali Larter) who manage to avoid a catastrophic highway pileup only to find themselves being picked off, one by one, by that dreaded specter known as Death. Breathtakingly gory and hell-bent on a very particular type of early-aughts destruction, Final Destination 2 is a slasher movie crossed with something approaching a supernatural action film. It\u2019s remarkably entertaining and always rewatchable, with a few murder set pieces that will make you genuinely wince. Where to watch Final Destination 2: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21. Ringu (1998) Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter, sets out with her ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) to investigate the ghostly phenomenon of a disturbing videotape that seemingly killed her niece. Hideo Nakata\u2019s seminal fright flick kicked off a sprawling franchise across several continents, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Ringu possesses a singular sort of fear that few films can pull off. Watching it leaves you with that unshakeable, unpleasant feeling of recalling too vividly a particularly disturbing nightmare. Where to watch Ringu: Tubi\n\n20. The Others (2001) Everett Collection Grace (Nicole Kidman) moves with her children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), who possess a sunlight allergy, into an isolated country cottage as she awaits the return of her husband from fighting in WWII. There, the arrival of a governess (Fionnula Flanagan) and her peers kicks off a series of horrifying supernatural occurrences that threaten to unravel Grace\u2019s reality. A wonderfully paced, brazenly old-fashioned ghost story, The Others feels timeless as all the best horror films do. Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar directs with a lush eye for atmosphere and details, while the oft-imitated twist ending feels earned and emotionally cathartic. Where to watch The Others: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n19. The Eye (2002) Everett The Pang Brothers\u2019 ultra-spooky immersion into the supernatural underworld stars Angelica Lee as Mun, a prodigious blind musician who is gifted sight with a radical corneal transplant. Yet as she\u2019s tormented by visions of the dead, Mun wonders if sight is worth her mental sanity. One of Hong Kong\u2019s signature modern thrillers, The Eye got swept up in American audiences\u2019 fascination with Asian horror from the late \u201990s through the aughts, later receiving an obligatory remake in 2008 starring Jessica Alba. Like most modern horror encores, that version is best left unseen; it can\u2019t match the Pangs\u2019 contemporary twist on classical, spine-tingling fright. Where to watch The Eye: Not available to stream\n\n18. The Beyond (1981) Everett Collection Lucio Fulci\u2019s paranormal masterwork concerns a young woman (Catriona MacColl) who inherits a palatial hotel that sits above the gates of hell. Predictably, things don\u2019t go so well for her. To define what the experience of The Beyond is actually like is\u2026 well, if you\u2019ll forgive the paraphrased steal from Casablanca, it\u2019s like any other Italian horror movie, only more so. Fulci embraces nightmare logic as enthusiastically as any filmmaker of his genre or generation, and this film is him at his gorily most unhinged. He indulges his penchant for toe-curling eyeball violence and subtly effective set design in this everything-and-the-kitchen-sink haunted house riff. Where to watch The Beyond: Peacock\n\n17. Jennifer\u2019s Body (2009) Doane Gregory/TM and Fox Atomic/Courtesy Everett Collection Karyn Kusama\u2019s supernatural high-school dark comedy, written by Diablo Cody, is utterly excellent despite its initially lackluster reviews. Amanda Seyfried plays Needy Lesnicky, the dowdy best friend to the popular/hot/cool/flexible Jennifer Check (Megan Fox). When Jennifer is sacrificed as part of a devilish ritual by a skeevy rock band, she returns as a succubus with a taste for teenage boys\u2019 flesh. Jennifer\u2019s Body is one of those perfect fusions of time and place, capturing that mid-aughts period when pop culture was paradoxically alt. Cody also flexes her sprawling knowledge of the horror genre, making for a riotously entertaining film with a ferocious satirical undercurrent. Where to watch Jennifer\u2019s Body: Tubi\n\n16. Talk to Me (2022) A24 This recent A24 effort from Australian directors Danny and Michael Philippou is one of the studio\u2019s scariest outputs yet. A mummified hand that can imbue its possessors with both horrifying glimpses of the afterlife and a drug-life euphoria threatens to undo a suburban family when a young boy (the stupendously natural Joe Bird) spends too long on the other side and becomes possessed. Remarkably unsettling and shockingly brutal, Talk to Me is a singular horror film that ranks among this decade\u2019s finest. With a smart application of style and humor, the Philippous crafted a relentless modern chiller. Where to watch Talk to Me: Paramount+\n\n15. Suspiria (1977) 20th Century Studios Dario Argento\u2019s groundbreaking opera of furious sight and sound concerns young Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), who upon being sent to a prestigious German ballet academy discovers that it is but a front for a coven of youth-siphoning witches. Argento\u2019s galvanizing picture remains a masterclass in harnessing the power of image and music to beguile an audience. It also feels as fresh and exciting today as it did almost 50 years ago. Where to watch Suspiria: Xumo Play\n\n14. Lake Mungo (2008) Mungo Productions After their teenage daughter (Talia Zucker) drowns, a family begins experiencing strange events in their home. They call in a paranormal psychologist, who uncovers disturbing secrets while parsing through their surveillance camera and cell phone footage. This is a particularly somber and understated movie, resembling domestic dramas like Ordinary People more than traditional horror films. With a canny mix of found footage and faux-documentary, Lake Mungo transports the audience into its spare, chilling universe. Where to watch Lake Mungo: Tubi\n\n13. Hereditary (2018) Toni Collette; Hereditary. A24 Ari Aster\u2019s astonishingly original yet somehow terrifically old-fashioned ghost-and-witchcraft story stars Toni Collette as a bereaved mother who turns to the paranormal in the hopes of contacting family members she\u2019s recently lost. As the supposedly well-intentioned woman leading her to doom, Ann Dowd commits to one of the most insidious villain performances in modern horror history. The movie that established Aster as an art-house freakout auteur, Hereditary is breathtakingly, exhaustively intense and frequently just as emotional. That Collette didn\u2019t collect an Oscar nomination for this role is a stain on the Academy. Where to watch Hereditary: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n12. The Orphanage (2007) Everett Collection J.A. Bayona directed this Spanish production about a young woman (Bel\u00e9n Rueda) who buys the orphanage in which she grew up with the intention of converting it into a home for infirm children. When her son goes missing, she turns to the many ghosts residing within the home to aid her desperate search. More than a bit inspired by Guillermo del Toro\u2019s The Devil\u2019s Backbone, The Orphanage weaves a similarly melancholy and thematically rich haunted house tale that calls on the country\u2019s complicated past to inflect its plot with verisimilitude. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s exceptionally scary. Where to watch The Orphanage: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n11. Jacob\u2019s Ladder (1990) Everett Adrian Lyne\u2019s mind-warping erotic thriller stars Tim Robbins as a Vietnam vet plagued with horrifying hallucinations once he returns stateside. As he discovers he's not the only member of his platoon to experience such oddities, Jacob is further removed from his already tenuous reality. A thoughtful and enveloping exploration of psychosis, Lyne\u2019s film remains a high-water mark in the psychological freak-out genre. Robbins grounds the eccentric proceedings with his reliable everyman persona, while Lynne one-ups his signature opulent visual style in such a way that he often wrong-foots the audience\u2019s genre expectations with nothing more than a simple camera move. Where to watch Jacob\u2019s Ladder: Amazon Prime Video\n\n10. The Sixth Sense (1999) Everett Collection Young Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is plagued by visions of those who died violent deaths. His exasperated mother (Toni Collette) seeks help in the form of a psychologist (Bruce Willis), who may have more in common with Cole than he thinks. M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s classic ghost story popularized a now-ubiquitous twist ending and got all of us swearing we saw dead people. It\u2019s still a hard-edged, substantially creepy fable with a heart-wrenching central performance from Osment and some of Willis\u2019 best dramatic acting. Where to watch The Sixth Sense: Max\n\n9. Cat People (1942) Everett Collection A well-intentioned husband (Kent Smith) accidentally ignites his wife\u2019s (Simone Simon) supernatural curse, in which she transforms into a large feline when aroused. She then goes about stalking her nemeses, including the beautiful woman (Jane Randolph) with whom her partner has become infatuated. Jacques Tourneur\u2019s fabulously creepy and macabre exploration of jealous sexual awakening features some unbelievably detailed sets and camerawork that seem innovative even today. Far from the staid paranormal horrors produced during this period, Cat People is ferocious and mysterious in equal measure. Where to watch Cat People: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n8. Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968) Courtesy Everett Collection Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s satirical shocker stars Mia Farrow as a young housewife who begins to believe her dream pregnancy is a cover for something much more nefarious, as her actor husband (John Cassavetes) brings an eccentric elderly couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) uncomfortably into their lives. Polanski\u2019s picture is elegant yet abrasive, an uncommonly lovely combination. Farrow is terrific in the lead role, getting the audience almost instantly on her side as the director ratchets up the tension to an unbearably chilling climax. Where to watch Rosemary\u2019s Baby: Paramount+\n\n7. Poltergeist (1982) Everett Collection Tobe Hooper\u2019s story about a suburban family (helmed by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) beset by paranormal activity in their new home, which may or may not be built on an ancient burial ground, is completely insane. It\u2019s one of the first horror movies to feel like an out-and-out action (or even disaster) movie, with crumbling sets and flashing lights right out of a Clive Barker climax. Poltergeist has endured, though, because its scares are rooted in this authentic family unit\u2019s terror. We feel for them, and the dissolution of their \u2014 \u201980s American dream. Where to watch Poltergeist: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n6. The Innocents (1961) 20th Century Fox Film Corp./Courtesy Everett Based on Henry James\u2019 The Turn of the Screw, Jack Clayton\u2019s spine-chilling ghost story (with a script by Truman Capote, among others) stars Deborah Kerr as a governess sent to an isolated estate to care for two odd children (Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin). There, she encounters \u2014 what else? \u2014 disembodied voices and vengeful spirits. Clayton\u2019s exceptionally frightening haunted house picture established many of the genre\u2019s most beloved tropes, a great deal of which are still in circulation today. Nearly every film on this list has arguably drawn inspiration from The Innocents. Here, Clayton creates a masterful mood of dread and dense mystery within a rich and oddly cozy atmosphere. Where to watch The Innocents: Not available to stream\n\n5. Hausu (1977) Everett There\u2019s no other way to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi\u2019s film except for \u201cgenuinely f\u2014ing crazy.\u201d Even to call it a haunted house movie seems tame; it\u2019s more of a spiritual home invasion, really. A group of seven schoolgirls \u2014 all with cheeky names like Kung Fu and Mac (for \u201cstomach,\u201d because she likes to eat) \u2014 venture to the home of one girl\u2019s aunt, where they\u2019re beset by disembodied, bottom-chomping heads, possessed mattresses, and hungry ghosts. Obayashi\u2019s picture is an authentically singular experience, and also a rather sweet one. It plays like a live-action, exaggeratedly silly Studio Ghibli movie. Where to watch Hausu: Max\n\n4. The Haunting (1963) Everett Collection Robert Wise\u2019s adaptation of Shirley Jackson\u2019s masterful novella finds a specially selected group of people brought together to spend a night at the famously haunted Hill House. Each has their different motives \u2014 Eleanor (Julie Harris) wishes to separate from her overbearing family; a gregarious psychic (Claire Bloom) hopes to write a bestselling book; Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) wants to uncover the home\u2019s paranormal truth. Joined by the home\u2019s heir (Russ Tamblyn), they set about uncovering the home\u2019s insidious past. Wise crafts an elegant and memorable ghost story here, retaining much of Jackson\u2019s scabrous dialogue while improving upon the suspense set pieces established in her book.\u200b\u200b It\u2019s one of the spookiest, and most elegant, haunted house pictures ever made. Where to watch The Haunting: Tubi\n\n3. The Shining (1980) Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) encounters the Grady twins (Lisa and Louise Burns) inside the Overlook Hotel in 'The Shining.'. Warner Brothers/courtesy Everett Stanley Kubrick\u2019s supernatural opus continues to spark scrutiny and debate almost 50 years later. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a has-been writer, takes a job at the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker so he can write his next novel. Soon, his family (wife Shelley Duvall and son Danny Lloyd) experiences gory hallucinations and unexplainable events within the corridors. Kubrick\u2019s film is a devastatingly rendered portrait of an artist\u2019s descent into psychosis, one that\u2019s implicit through the pursuit of crafting a great work. The Shining is every bit as meticulous and fetishistic as its reputation would suggest, with Kubrick using his stern directorial hand to create a sense of unease on screen. Where to watch The Shining: Max\n\n2. Evil Dead II (1987) Everett Sam Raimi\u2019s gleeful, gore-gag-laden romp (essentially a higher-budget, more jocular spin on his 1981 original) finds Bruce Campbell\u2019s Ash once again battling a group of Deadites in a remote cabin. Raimi strikes an inimitable tone of feel-good fun that precious few films are able to attain, let alone those in the horror genre. The director previously compared this movie to The Three Stooges with viscera standing in for custard pies, and that\u2019s the precise vibe one feels upon viewing. There\u2019s nothing offensive or off-putting in Evil Dead II, only a merry sense of the possibilities paranormal filmmaking presents. Where to watch Evil Dead II: Plex"

        "article_content": "Wounds that resist healing have long posed a significant challenge in medical care, but a recent discovery offers a solution that combines luxury with cutting-edge science.\n\nResearchers have tapped into the remarkable healing properties of gold nanoparticles mixed with antioxidant-rich red wine.\n\nThis unexpected fusion of precious metal and natural compounds paves the way for a revolutionary approach to treating chronic wounds and other medical conditions.\n\nTraditional medicine and new technology\n\nIn the heart of South Africa, the University of the Western Cape hosts a team of researchers driven to make significant strides in medical science.\n\nThe team\u2019s dedication to exploring novel solutions for persistent health challenges has led them to a fascinating discovery that blends traditional medicine with cutting-edge technology.\n\nTheir latest research was focused on a concoction combining gold nanoparticles with the potent antioxidants found in red wine. The innovative formula has shown tremendous potential, as lab tests revealed that it significantly accelerated wound healing.\n\nRemarkably, in just 72 hours, wounds treated with this unique mixture of gold and red wine healed almost entirely \u2013 a promising and exciting outcome that could pave the way for future advancements in chronic wound care.\n\nThe dangers of chronic wounds\n\nChronic wounds, defined as those that fail to heal within three months, represent a widespread and persistent health challenge, affecting approximately 3.8 million patients each year.\n\nChronic wounds often stall in the inflammatory phase, a stage where the body\u2019s natural healing processes become hindered. This prevents progression to the crucial remodeling phase where new tissue begins to grow and repair the damaged area.\n\nFor individuals with underlying conditions like diabetes, this issue becomes even more serious. Poor blood circulation, a common complication of diabetes, exacerbates the healing process, leaving these wounds vulnerable to infections.\n\nIn severe cases, the inability to heal can lead to devastating outcomes, including the risk of limb amputation. Identifying solutions for chronic wound care is a medical priority.\n\nThe wound healing power of gold\n\nThe research team hypothesized that gold could act as the ideal catalyst to jump-start the healing process for chronic wounds.\n\nGold\u2019s renowned anti-inflammatory properties, combined with its natural compatibility with human tissues, have made it a valuable element in medical treatments for centuries.\n\nIts unique ability to reduce inflammation without causing adverse reactions allows gold to interact harmoniously with the body, promoting faster recovery.\n\nHistorically, gold has played a significant role in medicine, with gold particles being used as early as the 20th century to treat chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis in the UK.\n\nBuilding on this legacy, the research team explored how gold could unlock similar benefits in the realm of wound care, providing a modern twist to an age-old remedy.\n\nPowerful antioxidants of red wine\n\nRed grapes, the foundation of many popular wines, are rich in powerful antioxidants like resveratrol. These naturally occurring compounds play a crucial role in protecting the body from oxidative stress by neutralizing harmful free radicals.\n\nFree radicals can damage cells and impede the healing process, but the antioxidants in red wine help to counteract these effects.\n\nBy combating these damaging molecules, resveratrol and other antioxidants support the body\u2019s ability to repair itself.\n\nThe antioxidants ensure that tissues receive a sufficient oxygen supply, which is essential for regeneration and recovery, ultimately boosting the healing process and enhancing the body\u2019s natural defenses.\n\nCombining gold and red wine\n\nThe team tested their hypothesis by drying red wine to obtain extracts, which were then mixed with chloroauric acid, a gold-containing chemical.\n\nThe blend was applied to a lab dish containing human skin cells, with a scratch in the middle to simulate a wound.\n\nCells treated with this golden mixture saw an 80% wound closure within 72 hours, compared to 50% with wine alone.\n\nThe combination of cabernet sauvignon and gold proved even more effective, healing wounds almost entirely in the same time frame.\n\nThe future of wound care\n\nRenowned vascular surgeon Stella Vig of Croydon University Hospital praised the novel use of red wine and the innovative production of gold nanoparticles. Both silver and gold nanoparticles could play a critical role in reducing wound infections.\n\nDr. Ahmed Osman from Queen\u2019s University, Belfast added that gold particles encourage cell growth and enhance the natural healing process of the skin.\n\nThis revolutionary approach to wound healing, combining gold and red wine, holds remarkable promise for the future of wound care.\n\nWhile further research is needed, the implications are significant, opening new avenues for advanced medical treatments.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

Read preview\n\nIt's shaping up to be a bustling period for new hedge funds. Nearly 150 launches are expected to spin out of larger, $1 billion-plus funds between 2024 and the first half of 2025, according to hedge fund research firm PivotalPath.\n\nBut the actual fundraising environment is more complicated. Many of those new launches are being seeded by existing multistrategy giants who have excess capacity to deploy thanks to strong performance \u2014 7.8% annually over the past five years, according to PivotalPath's multistrat index. By comparison, PivotalPath CEO Jon Caplis explained, institutional allocators, constrained by illiquid private investments, have less liquidity to offer right now.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThat's partially how you explain one of the most anticipated launches in recent years \u2014 multistrat Jain Global \u2014 falling well short of fundraising expectations, even as overall new launches are up.\n\nStartup funds have allies in investment bank prime brokerage units, a crucial lifeline to hedge funds and a growing business on Wall Street. Prime brokers don't simply finance trades but also serve as a consigliere, especially in the early stages of a fund's life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorgan Stanley has long been home to one of the top prime brokerages, and serving hedge funds is key to the bank's equities ambitions. The business has gained renewed focus under new CEO Ted Pick.\n\nTheir prime services team, led since 2021 by global coheads Penny Novick and Kim Shaw, caters to established titans but also advises on roughly 50 to 75 hedge fund launches globally each year, depending on the environment. That part of the business is akin to a venture-capital model \u2014 work with a broad swath of upstarts to win over the long-term trust and favor of the next D.E. Shaw or Viking Global.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMorgan Stanley's prime team helps funds raise capital and finance their operations. They also provide counsel and advice to new managers to improve their odds of success.\n\nWhile a new launch's viability will ultimately come down to investment performance, there are factors that can trip up an otherwise promising launch \u2014 or, if handled shrewdly, set them up for prosperity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Insider recently spoke with Novick and Shaw about the pitfalls they see emerging managers encounter and the advice they prescribe over and over again.\n\nIn an environment where institutional investors are becoming increasingly discerning with their capital allocations, nailing the intangibles is critical.\n\nThese are 3 of the top stumbling blocks for startup fund managers and how to handle them, according to Novick and Shaw. The responses are in their own words, edited for length and clarity:\n\nIt's tempting to cut corners on costs on the non-investment side of the business \u2014 don't\n\nPenny Novick:\n\nSome new fund managers at first don't always fully appreciate that getting the non-investment side of the business right is super important. Hiring a strong COO, CFO, and operations people who are well-integrated into the business is crucial for not only the launch but also the long-term success of the business. Additionally, choosing the right systems, vendors, and partners is really going to have a big impact on the ability of that manager to be able to execute on their strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's similar to when a PM goes to a different platform, and they find that sometimes, even when they're effectively deploying the same strategy, they may be more successful at one firm versus the other. It all comes down to the tools available to them and the support they have around them.\n\nHaving strong leadership to run the non-investment side of the business with the requisite expertise and tenure will allow the PM to focus on the portfolio construction and performance without distraction.\n\nDon't go cold on your allocators\n\nKim Shaw:\n\nNew fund managers are meeting with allocators pre-launch to raise capital, but as they transition to focusing on their portfolio, it's easy to cease communication with prospects.\n\nThis can be particularly true for firms that enjoy marketing success pre-launch. They raise capital and want to close that chapter, either because PMs believe marketing is a distraction to performance or they assume that successful hedge funds don't need to be proactive. While this may have been true a decade ago, the industry is mature, and there are more funds than capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut beyond that, continuing to engage with prospects is simply a sound business strategy. Existing and prospective allocators can be important thought partners. The more they know about a manager and the portfolio, the more willing they are to step up as a source of liquidity.\n\nHone your story and embrace the tough questions\n\nPenny Novick:\n\nFor new founders who haven't been directly involved in speaking to allocators in the past, this can be a different kind of challenge. They need to deliver a digestible, compelling presentation that not only details their investment strategy and process, but also distinguishes themselves from similar existing strategies, such that an allocator can be in a position to bring the opportunity to their investment committee to make the case for adding them to their portfolio.\n\nOur capital introduction team provides our emerging managers with critical advice on what and how to present to investors and gives them opportunities to do practice runs, so that they can work out the kinks and deliver their message succinctly in what can feel like a high-pressure situation.\n\nParticularly in a tough capital-raising environment, it's important to make a compelling business case and address difficult questions in a non-confrontational manner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim Shaw:\n\nArticulating your edge is critical. Describe how your strategy is unique \u2014 what are the key differentiators \u2014 and substantiate this with data."
