        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

Once Rose learned about the collaboration, he wanted in as well.\n\n\"When Slash came to the recording studio in Frankfurt to record with me, he said, 'Oh, I told Axl I'm coming here today to do this with you,'\" Schenker tells UCR. \"And Axl said, 'Oh, can I sing a song?' So I said, 'Oh, really? Ask Axl which song he wants to sing.'\"\n\nRose recorded vocals for multiple tracks, though only one \u2014 the seven-and-a-half-minute epic \"Love to Love\" \u2014 appears on My Years With UFO. \"He ended up singing 'Only You Can Rock Me,' 'Too Hot to Handle' and 'Love to Love,'\" Schenker explains. \"And I guess because they were in middle of a tour, he didn't like his performances. He wanted to focus on one song. He's a perfectionist. ... I liked them all, but I left it up to him. And he said 'Love to Love' is the one. So eventually, he had it all together and texted us or gave us a message that his version was ready.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 10 Rare Axl Rose Performances Only Hardcore Fans Know\n\nHow UFO Influenced 'Hardcore Fans' Guns N' Roses in the Studio\n\nIf anybody could get the two figureheads of Guns N' Roses to guest on an album, it would be Schenker, who says that Slash and Rose have been \"hardcore fans\" of his work for decades. In fact, Slash has been guesting in Schenker projects since before Guns N' Roses even rocketed to stardom.\n\n\"In the '80s I did a video, 'Rock Will Never Die,' with Michael Schenker Group,\" Schenker explains. \"And in the background, there were a bunch of celebrities, but they were doubles, like a Michael Jackson double. But there was one, Slash, that was the real one. He is a real fan, and he heard about this, and he came ... and you can see him rocking there.\"\n\nWatch Michael Schenker Group's 'Rock Will Never Die' Video\n\nSchenker says the sound of UFO's classic albums also had a profound impact on Guns N' Roses. \"Slash has always expressed his love \u2014 Axl and Slash and Guns N' Roses,\" he continues. \"They really loved the UFO productions, in the studio and the live recordings. And Ron Nevison [UFO producer] had a tape op called Mike Clink, and so he actually ended up producing Guns N' Roses. And because Mike Clink had all the information on how Ron Nevison did it, Guns N\u2019 Roses were basically kind of trying to stick as close as possible to UFO's sound, and, of course, added their own individual ideas to it. But basically, they are really, really hardcore fans.\""

It made him \u2018believe everything\u2019 as he was sure he\u2019d captured ghosts of the soldiers.\n\nBut when LADbible presented this footage to Help! My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris, it seems Yuelling may not have captured the figures after all.\n\nAdvert\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai says he watched the video \u2018several times\u2019 before coming up with a \u2018logical explanation\u2019.\n\n\u201cThese are not spirits,\u201d he begins. \u201cDespite Gettysburg being rife with history and loads of paranormal stories over the years. I think what I'm seeing there is moisture on the windscreen.\u201d\n\nHe reckons they were ghosts. (SWNS)\n\nYeah, pretty underwhelming. Ghai explains that the video seems to be from inside the car and it appears to be foggy.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThere's definitely moisture that seems to be running down the face of the windscreen,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I think it's a combination of the environmental factors and what he's actually seeing through the mist and the fog.\u201d\n\nAnd historian and psychologist Harris agrees that as amazing as the video seems in such a historical location, there\u2019s just \u2018too many environmental factors\u2019 involved.\n\n\u201cIt looks brilliant,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a good, impressive clip but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghost.\u201d But Harris does appreciate it\u2019s pretty disappointing for investigators to be sceptical about this type of stuff.\n\n\u201cWe see so many photographs and video clips, and especially, obviously now with mobile phones and these, you know, people are recording their own things all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvert\n\nGhai and Harris know what they're on about. (discovery+)\n\nWell, there you have it, those \u2018ghosts\u2019 at Gettysburg aren\u2019t really ghosts \u2013 at least not in that video anyway.\n\nIf you do want to see Ghai and Harris in action with what they believe to actually be ghosts and spirits, a new season of Help! My House is Haunted just started streaming on discovery+. It sees the pair, along with psychic medium and exorcist, Ian Lawman, \u2018go above and beyond to solve some of the most chilling and challenging cases ever documented on TV\u2019.\n\nSeries six of Help!

        "article_content": "Disorder in the court: Henry Stick, a defense attorney, in his demon form in one of the last episodes of Evil . (Courtesy Paramount+)\n\nTHE FIRST THREE SEASONS OF EVIL were inventive, entertaining, and devilishly fun, which makes it all the more disappointing that its fourth and final season ended with a whimper and not a demonic howl. Even though the acting and production design remained consistently excellent, the show\u2019s captivating tension, compelling characters, and intricate plotlines fizzled in the end.\n\nA priest, a forensic psychologist, and a tech specialist (no, this isn\u2019t the setup to a joke) are Evil\u2019s protagonists. David Acosta, Dr. Kristen Bouchard, and Ben Shakir (Mike Colter, Katja Herbers, and Aasif Mandvi, respectively) are contracted by the Catholic Church to investigate whether cases of demonic possession are real, fraudulent, or have scientific explanations; think the In X-Celsis Deo-Files. Created by husband and wife team Robert and Michelle King (who also created The Good Wife and its spinoff, The Good Fight), each episode of Evil examines a new, discrete case while also delving into the main characters\u2019 personal lives, the developing relationship among them, and the machinations of the series\u2019 supervillain, Leland Townsend (Michael Emerson), another forensic psychologist who has diabolical global domination via cyberspace on his bucket list.\n\nEvil\u2019s writers masterfully blended horror with humor, the supernatural with the every day, science with religion, and heart with smarts. Even though David, Kristen, and Ben dealt with increasingly bizarre situations, their characters rang true to life. The interpersonal relationships are touching and complex and kept Evil plausible despite its paranormal underpinnings. We feel Kristen and David\u2019s deep but forbidden love for each other. We see David struggle with his religious faith, Ben with his scientific skepticism, and Kristen with her moral code. We relate to Kristen\u2019s knotty relationship with her mom, Sheryl (the always spectacular Christine Lhati), and her horror as she becomes increasingly entangled with Leland. We are repelled by Leland\u2019s motivations, but recognize his perverted intelligence and twisted sense of humor thanks to Michael Emerson\u2019s bravura performance. And we sympathize with Kristen and Ben\u2019s insistence on explaining away incomprehensible occurrences with rational, scientific explanations. In the Age of Trump, where there is no bottom, desperately hoping that common sense, heart, and justice win over irrationality, hatred, and chaos makes complete sense to me.\n\nAs with every show the Kings produce, Evil is a class act. The casting is impeccable: From series regulars to guest stars to even one-line roles, everyone was top-notch. The Kings took full advantage of filming in New York City by populating the show with brilliant New York theater actors (John Glover, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Jeremy Shamos, Jayne Houdyshell, Brian D\u2019Arcy James, Patrick Breen, and Denis O\u2019Hare, to name just a few). These actors have real faces full of character and know implicitly how to play a scene with integrity and theatrical awareness, which is crucial in horror where the stakes are so heightened.\n\nEvil\u2019s production design also has a theatrical flair. Sharp angles of light at night create deep shadows where terrifying creatures can lurk. The camera often gazes up, sometimes making the audience feel small and powerless, and sometimes directing our eyes heavenward, as one looks up at a stained-glass window in a cathedral.\n\nKristen lives in a crowded two-bedroom house in Queens with her four daughters and a peripatetic mountain-climbing husband. The living room ceiling decorated with cut-out stars is undoubtedly a shared mother-daughter crafting project. The house is cluttered and redolent of happy chaos, full of life. However, it sits under an elevated train line so when trains pass, their rattling and reverberations shake the home and everyone inside, presaging something dark that might befall this family. In contrast, Leland\u2019s grand Park Avenue apartment is luxurious but cold. It\u2019s a place designed to impress and intimidate, to signal the wealth, sophistication and power of its owner (and to keep hidden his former life as an insurance adjuster in Des Moines).\n\nKatja Herbers, Aasif Mandvi, and Mike Colter in Evil . (Courtesy Paramount+)\n\nTHROUGH THE FIRST THREE SEASONS, the Kings blended horror and humor seamlessly and elegantly. The scares were genuine, but so were the laughs. The various Satanic ambassadors who haunt, taunt, and wreak havoc on characters\u2019 lives have real verve for their jobs, and they play their nihilistic humor to the hilt. The writers often give these fantastical creatures human, ordinary names, like George, Norm, and Abbey, while giving the main ghouls in charge no name. For example, the demon tasked with bringing about the emergence of Satan into the world is named the \u201cManager.\u201d The show treats the Apocalypse as an end-of-year item to be ticked off a corporate to-do list. In fact, the Manager works for a company called DF (\u201cDark Father\u201d), with a board made up of demons disguised as white, middle-aged, besuited businessmen. When Sheryl joins DF, working for the Devil is less upsetting than realizing she has no chance of ever advancing in the company, and neither does any other woman in the office. Over her desk, there is a literal glass ceiling. Evil makes the perfect dark observation: In Satanism as in the supposedly beatific entity of the Catholic Church, women are similarly thwarted by the patriarchy.\n\nEvil handled weighty subject matter with dexterity, sensitivity, and smarts. As befitting its title, the show explores the concept of evil in its various forms: racism, misogyny, sociopathy, genocide, man-made environmental collapse, soulless tech overlords exploiting the vulnerabilities of their consumers, the rage of lonely online incels, capitalist greed, cannibalism, and even the sins of the Catholic Church (a brave move considering the Kings are devout Catholics). It consistently takes chances, defies expectations, and produces real pathos and terror. It was appointment television for me and my 16-year-old, and several times we both responded out loud to its cliffhanger endings with an appreciative \u201cWhoa. . .\u201d\n\nSadly, despite a couple of excellent episodes (\u201cHow to Survive a Storm\u201d and \u201cHow to Dance in Three Easy Steps\u201d), Evil lost its way in its final season. It becomes occasionally melodramatic and plodding, focusing more on the protagonists\u2019 emotional dilemmas and less on adventurous horror. Perhaps it had to do too much in too short a time, given the unfortunate cancelation notice. But beloved characters are dropped unceremoniously, there are gaping plot holes, and unnecessary storylines are added that make the last four episodes muddled and unsatisfying. Spoilers, and complaints, ahead: Kristen gets over Andy\u2019s betrayal with unnatural speed. After the cliffhanger at the end of season two, nothing happens between her and David, a missed opportunity. What happens to Ben\u2019s migraines and Jinn apparitions when he removes his tinfoil hat? Why is Dr. Boggs surprised to see demons with Sheryl when he invited them into his life to cure his earlier writers\u2019 block? What happened to Lexis\u2019s tail and potential demon status from season one? The show became a tad too religiously tinged for my taste, and there are many red herrings. They abandon the wonderful trope of having a grim pop-up book introducing the demonic dilemma of each episode. They even truncated Evil\u2019s brilliant theme song by David Buckley, which takes away from the music\u2019s dramatic crescendo and so the resolve in its final flourish is less satisfying. This sums up how I feel about the fourth season in general. Instead of offering closure, Evil\u2019s finale felt artificial and pat.\n\nStill, three brilliant seasons out of four is an embarrassment of riches, and I appreciate Evil\u2019s nerve, style, and moxie. The show pushed the boundaries of what psychological horror could be on network television (though the show migrated from CBS to Paramount+ after the first season). It counterbalanced serious social issues with wit, and thrived in the expert pacing of its directors and its cast. How do we find hope when despair seems to be closing in around us? How do we navigate a world where technology and dark forces are so intricately entwined; where evil lurks in the iCloud? According to Evil, you hire a priest, a psychologist and a technology specialist to save you, and in the process, they save themselves, too! Despite my disappointment that the finale didn\u2019t stick the landing, Evil manages an impressive balancing act: science, faith, and technology can work in harmony to solve terrifying mysteries while showing its audience a sinfully good time.\n\nShare"

        "article_content": "Does Lost have you feeling lost, even 20 years later? You\u2019re not alone. In its journey from one of television\u2019s best pilots to one of the medium\u2019s worst finales, ABC\u2019s hit castaway drama created a mythology that vexed even the fans who dissected each revelation on message boards in the late 2000s.\n\nThat mythology centered on a good-versus-evil battle at its core, but complicated matters were time travel, alternate realities, mysterious numbers, dueling factions of island inhabitants, and paranormal phenomena.\n\nIn fact, the narrative got so convoluted that fans had to turn to transmedia experiences and DVD extras \u2014 including the 12-minute epilogue, \u201cThe New Man in Charge\u201d \u2014 to grasp answers not provided in the six seasons of the mainstream storyline.\n\nSo as we mark the 20th anniversary of Lost\u2019s series premiere on September 22, we\u2019re taking a swing at some of the show\u2019s biggest mysteries, including the polar bear and smoke monster from that first episode. (Spoilers ahead!)\n\nWhat was the Island?\n\nAt its most basic level, the Island is the tropical isle where the Oceanic Flight 815 and various other vessels crashed across the centuries. The Island\u2019s inhabitants included ancient Romans, ancient Egyptians, and probably people of other cultures, given the languages found scrawled on relics the castaways came across. The Island has immense electromagnetic power that can heal humans of their afflictions but can also bring down airplanes, disrupt communications, and even affect the Island\u2019s geographical and temporal location. And according to Jacob (Mark Pellegrino), the Island is a cork that keeps the world\u2019s darkness \u201cwhere it belongs.\u201d\n\nWho was Jacob? The Man in Black?\n\nJacob and his twin brother, known only as the Man in Black (Titus Welliver), were children of ancient Roman woman, Claudia (Lela Loren), who survived a shipwreck on the Island. Claudia was soon killed by an earlier inhabitant, a protector of the island known only as Mother (Allison Janney), who then raised the boys as her own. The two boys grew apart as the future Man in Black chose to live among Claudia\u2019s people to try to find a way off the Island, and he eventually killed Mother. Jacob, who became Mother\u2019s successor as the island\u2019s protector, reacted to that matricide by throwing his brother into the so-called Heart of the Island, turning him into the smoke monster. And so Jacob \u2014 who believed in the goodness of humanity \u2014 and the Man in Black \u2014 who believed humanity is inherently corrupt \u2014 were permanent, ageless residents of the Island. And because of rules set in place by Mother, Jacob and the Man in Black were unable to kill each other, and so they used the Island\u2019s mortal inhabitants to do their bidding.\n\nWhat was the smoke monster?\n\nThe smoke monster was the transmogrified version of the Man in Black, whom the Oceanic 815 survivors saw as it moved about the Island, attacking some survivors and sparing others. In both his corporeal and smoky forms, the Man in Black tried Jacob and his possible replacements in a continued effort to leave the island. But in the series finale, the Man in Black, then in the guise of John Locke (Terry O\u2019Quinn), inadvertently made himself mortal as he deactivated the Heart of the Island, giving Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) a chance to kill him.\n\nWhat brought Oceanic 815 to the Island?\n\nDesmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), a more recent shipwreck survivor, realized too late that the button in the DHARMA Initiative\u2019s Swan station actually did need to be pressed every 108 minutes, because when he decided to let the timer run out one day, a resulting surge of electromagnetic energy caused Oceanic 815 to crash on the Island. But Jacob either orchestrated the crash or at least knew it would happen because he manipulated candidates for the job of Island protector to be aboard the doomed flight.\n\nWho were the Others?\n\nThe Others were a group of Jacob devotees \u2014 Jacobites, one might say \u2014 who predated the Oceanic 815 survivors as inhabitants of the island. They protected the Island from outside threats and from the Man in Black. They were also able to leave and return to the Island. Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), an early shipwreck survivor, became an intermediary between Jacob and the rest of the Others, and other Others leaders over the years included Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson).\n\nWhat was the DHARMA Initiative?\n\nThe DHARMA Initiative was a group of scientific researchers who conducted their studies of meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, zoology, electromagnetism, and other subject areas on the Island for decades. They met their end when the Others \u2014 and Ben, a DHARMA defector \u2014 killed almost every one of them with poison gas from their own Tempest station. After the initiative\u2019s collapse, the Others moved into their facilities, including the Barracks, the aforementioned Swan, and many other stations on the Island.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Hurley\u2019s numbers?\n\nHurley Reyes (Jorge Garcia) used the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 in a lottery and won a nine-figure (but ultimately cursed) jackpot. He\u2019d gotten the numbers from his time in a mental institution, in which a fellow patient chanted them. That patient had once intercepted a DHARMA radio transmission broadcasting the numbers from the Island. And to DHARMA, the numbers were part of the Valenzetti Equation, which theorized to predict the time of human extinction, as Lost fans learned in the alternate-reality game The Lost Experience. But the numbers, which popped up all over the Island and the rest of the world, also had mythological meaning: Jacob used them as identifiers for the final six candidates, Hurley included.\n\nWhy are there polar bears?\n\nThe DHARMA Initiative brought polar bears to the Island \u2014 well, to the Hydra station on a smaller island just offshore, to be exact \u2014 as part of their studies. They kept the bears in cages \u2014 which the Others later used to imprison Kate and fellow castaway Sawyer Ford (Josh Holloway) \u2014 as part of the initiative\u2019s electromagnetic studies, as revealed in \u201cThe New Man in Charge.\u201d Specifically, they trained the polar bears were to push the frozen wheel under the Orchid station, the wheel that moves the Island in space and time.\n\nWhat were the flash-sideways?\n\nAfter umpteen flashbacks and flash-forwards, Season 6 introduced a narrative device dubbed \u201cflash-sideways,\u201d which at first seemed like alternate histories for the main character in a reality in which Oceanic 815 never crashed. In the series finale, though, Jack\u2019s father, Christian Shepherd, told him what\u2019s actually happening. \u201cThis is the place that you all made together, so that you could find one another,\u201d he said. In other words, the flash-sideways reality was an afterlife limbo, of sorts, where Jack and the other characters could reunite before \u201cmoving on.\u201d\n\nWere they all dead?\n\nBy the end of the series, yes. But the Oceanic 815 survivors were very much alive when they arrived on the Island, but eventually they all died, whether by natural causes or otherwise. (\u201cSome of them before you, some long after you,\u201d Christian told Jack.) In the flash-sideways world, our heroes got visions of their Island lives, and those visions led them to a church where they and assorted loved ones all happily reunited and \u201cmoved on\u201d together."

Credit: Vanderbilt University Department of Biological Sciences\n\nIn a study led by Sarah Worthan, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Behringer Lab at Vanderbilt University, scientists have successfully evolved microbial cultures that possess the ability to sense pH changes, enabling rapid responses to environmental fluctuations.\n\nAlong with highlighting the power of lab-driven evolution, this discovery also led to finding similar mutations in nature in emerging pathogens and coral symbionts\u2014organisms that navigate challenging pH shifts in their environments and are otherwise difficult to study.\n\nThe new paper, \"Evolution of pH-sensitive transcription termination in Escherichia coli during adaptation to repeated long-term starvation,\" was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science on September 19, 2024. The driving result from this work is the discovery of a mutation in the independently evolved populations of bacteria that occurs when the bacteria are exposed to feast and famine cycles.\n\nAccording to the paper, this mutation, where an arginine amino acid is replaced with a histidine, occurred on the Rho protein, which is involved in terminating RNA transcription. Arginine to histidine mutations have also been observed in cancers and have been shown to confer an adaptive pH sensing ability to oncogenic proteins. In bacteria, these arginine to histidine mutations can sense pH and alter the activity of the Rho protein to rapidly impact how genes are expressed.\n\nEvolved in the lab\n\nCo-author Benjamin Bratton, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology at the VU Medical Center, led imaging for the lab experiments and analysis of the pH assays while co-author Marc Boudvillain, Ph.D., CNRS Research Director at the Centre de Biophysique Mol\u00e9culaire in Orl\u00e9ans, France and a chemist by training, led biochemical experiments demonstrating Rho's altered activity across pH environments.\n\nAccording to Megan Behringer, Ph.D., assistant professor of Biological Sciences and the principal investigator of the study, \"This mutation in rho repeatedly arose in our laboratory evolution cultures. We screened a lot of phenotypes and struggled to identify the Rho mutation's specific effects. We then reached out to Marc, and he asked if we had considered that the effects might vary with pH.\n\n\"That's when we returned to our genomic data and noticed that every mutation in rho co-occurred with a mutation in a gene named 'ydcI.' Not much is known about this gene, but very recent studies suggested that it may have a role in pH homeostasis. Marc offered to screen our Rho protein in vitro for pH and when he and [co-author] Mildred came back with the results, we began to piece the whole story together.\"\n\n\"Dr. Behringer reached out to me a few weeks after my lab opened at Vanderbilt with this interesting observation about solution pH, but wondered if there was a way we could measure pH inside individual cells,\" Bratton observed.\n\n\"Measuring single bacterial cell physiology happens to be one of the major skills of the Bratton lab, so this collaboration has been great. Even though bacteria interact with each other through their extracellular environment, individual cells have some control over their intracellular environments.\"\n\nBoudvillain added, \"We were happy to contribute the biochemistry experiments showing that the Arg-to-His mutation indeed regulates Rho activity in a pH-dependent manner in vitro.\"\n\nRLTS selects for mutations in rho and ydcI. Credit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2024). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2405546121\n\nFound in nature\n\nAfter the lab experiments, the team then went to search for these mutations in natural systems.\n\nAccording to Behringer, \"We found it in this neglected pathogen, Bartonella baciliformis, which causes Carrion's Disease in the Andean valleys of South America. This species of bacteria was already known to pH sense as it must rapidly adjust from the high pH insect gut to the neutral pH of human blood when it's transmitted by its sand fly vector.\"\n\nThese results also have implications in the world of marine sponges. According to the paper, the pH of the ocean forms gradients in particular areas, like inside hydrothermal vents or the inside of sponge bodies. Micro-organisms that live in and around these areas need to be able to quickly adapt to both environments. Their evolved gene expression allows this transition; however, climate change could alter these dynamics is serious ways.\n\n\"If the ocean pH begins to look more like the sponge pH, this can endanger the bacteria and their symbionts,\" Behringer said. \"The bacteria may lose the environmental cue that induces the correct behavior for their current environment.\"\n\nBoudvillain said that this collaboration started as something of a happy accident. Behringer first reached out to Boudvillain to see a supplemental figure that had disappeared from a website. Upon connecting, the two realized their research trajectories aligned well.\n\n\"I was very happy to participate with this interdisciplinary work. I have learned a lot from Ben, Sarah and Megan,\" he said. \"It has been a great pleasure and opportunity to work with these young and dynamic colleagues.\"\n\nMore information: Sarah B.

        "article_content": "Josh Reynolds is a dagger expert.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cdagger\u201d as in the NFL passing concept, of course.\n\nIn Detroit, Reynolds got all the glory on the play. Somebody else handled the clear-out vertical, running a safety down the field to create a void about 18-20 yards past the line of scrimmage, a couple of yards inside the numbers.\n\nThen Reynolds, lined up outside, would run a deep in-cut into that void, find the ball and make hay.\n\n\u201cThat was one of my routes, for sure. I was the dagger,\u201d Reynolds told The Denver Post.\n\nNow in Denver, he\u2019s the clear-out man. The ball never goes to that guy.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen in eight years,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the dirty work. Like an off-the-ball screen to free up a shooter in basketball or a rugged forward jostling for position in front of a goaltender in hockey.\n\n\u201cLove of the game route, man,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nCourtland Sutton is the Broncos\u2019 dagger man.\n\nHe starts outside of Reynolds when the Broncos run this tried-and-true zone-beater. Gets up the field, lets Reynolds do his thing, then snaps inside. During camp and the preseason, rookie quarterback Bo Nix showed an affinity for the play, hitting Sutton on his route in rhythm time and time again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude,\u201d Reynolds said of Sutton. \u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude that can stick his foot in the ground and come flat. That\u2019s the whole key to running dagger.\u201d\n\nSo far in the regular season, though, Denver\u2019s passing game has been blunted. Its production on dagger and Sutton\u2019s production as a whole? Duller than anticipated.\n\nSutton\u2019s got five catches on 16 targets through two games and just 64 yards. With a small sample size, one big game can turn those numbers around, but the early per-game and per-target rates are well off Sutton\u2019s career norms.\n\nMore pertinent so far is the general inability to get the ball into Sutton\u2019s hands in the first place. Nix targeted him 12 times in Week 1 at Seattle, but he finished with only four catches. Then against Pittsburgh, the ball didn\u2019t even get thrown in Sutton\u2019s direction until midway through the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThere are routes when he\u2019s primary and you\u2019re hoping that you catch the right look and he gets the throw. It doesn\u2019t always work like that,\u201d offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a big part of every game plan and sometimes the flow of the game is such that he doesn\u2019t get the throws like we thought he would.\u201d\n\nOf course, given the overall issues the Broncos have had offensively, nobody is off to a blazing start. But Sutton\u2019s pace out of the gates is noteworthy particularly because of his offseason \u2014 he skipped all voluntary team activities to advocate for a contract extension that never came \u2014 and because he looked terrific during training camp.\n\nNow, though, it\u2019s a struggle.\n\nNix has thrown three interceptions while targeting Sutton. The receiver could have been credited with a target on the final-play pick Nix threw against Pittsburgh, too.\n\n\u201cHe plays \u2018X\u2019, but he can play other spots,\u201d head coach Sean Payton said of Sutton. \u201cA lot of (the lack of production) gets back to the third downs. (Wednesday night) we\u2019ll be game-planning third down, and we have to be better in that area to add more snaps throughout the course of the game.\u201d\n\nIndeed, half of Sutton\u2019s targets so far have come on third down and on those snaps, Nix is 2 of 8 for 43 yards and a pick.\n\nLast year, Sutton caught eight of his 10 touchdowns in the red zone. Through two games this year: One catch on five targets for 10 yards, two interceptions and another that was nearly picked.\n\nSutton is a moneymaker in the intermediate part of the field. He\u2019s a big target and he\u2019s got the ability to create space, but he\u2019s not the type of receiver to flat run by a defensive back.\n\nDagger is a perfect example.\n\nNix has tried him on it three times already in two games. Against Seattle, Nix airmailed the first and then the second came up short because of pressure up the middle. Finally, against Pittsburgh, they got the look they wanted and Nix pinned a perfect ball on him for 26 yards.\n\nOverall, though, anything beyond 5 yards in the air has been inconsistent at best for Nix and the Denver offense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one thing,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cI think it\u2019s everything working together \u2014 timing, protection routes. There\u2019s not one thing that goes into it. It\u2019s like most things on offense, it\u2019s 11 guys working together.\u201d\n\nUntil they do, Sutton will likely continue to operate in a kind of limbo.\n\nHe\u2019s in that mode career-wise, too.\n\nDenver added up to $1.5 million in incentives for him to end what he described as an offseason \u201cstalemate.\u201d If the Broncos\u2019 offense wallows, though, that\u2019s money he won\u2019t see much or any of.\n\nA recent under-the-radar move could impact his future roster status, too.\n\nDenver in Week 1 made Sutton more expensive to cut or trade after the season but also took a spring or summer extension off the table.\n\nTight on cap space but wanting to sign cornerback Pat Surtain II to a mega extension, the Broncos created room by converting $11.875 million of Sutton\u2019s $13 million base salary to signing bonus. Importantly, they also added three void years to his contract to maximize the cap savings in the short term.\n\nThat contract adjustment, though, means Sutton is now ineligible for an extension for a year due to a rule that says contracts can\u2019t be renegotiated more than once per 12 months.\n\nSo now Sutton carries a $20.2 million cap hit for 2025, per OvertheCap. The Broncos could save $6.875 million if they cut him after this season but would incur $13.325 million in dead cap, too. That\u2019s nearly $10 million more than before the contract adjustment and that prorated bonus money would stay on the books if the Broncos traded him, too.\n\nSimultaneously, though, the sides couldn\u2019t formalize a contract extension until the 2025 regular season even if they wanted to.\n\nThat will be more pertinent in January than it is now. For the moment, the focus is just on getting the Broncos\u2019 top receiver going.\n\nPerhaps it will start with a dagger.\n\nNot rating well\n\nCourtland Sutton has the lowest quarterback rating on passes when targeted this season among all receivers in the NFL with 10 or more targets through Week 2. Here\u2019s a look at how the Broncos receiver stacks up:\n\nPlayer Team Targets Catches Yards Ints QB rating Courtland Sutton Denver 16 5 64 3 5.2 Diontae Johnson Carolina 12 5 34 2 9.7 Tyler Boyd Tennessee 10 5 44 1 22.5 Michael Pittman Jr. Indianapolis 15 7 52 1 27.6 Elijah Moore Cleveland 14 9 53 2 31.8\n\n(Can\u2019t see chart in mobile?

        "article_content": "NordVPN is one of the most popular and best virtual private networks (VPNs) available, while Proton VPN is a relative newcomer that launched several years after it. Both have thousands of servers worldwide and boast high-speed streaming and download capacity without sacrificing security and privacy.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard to choose between these leading VPNs when the pricing is so close. I recently reviewed NordVPN and Proton VPN, so I\u2019ll share details about pricing and renewal costs, hands-on speed tests, and customer service responsiveness.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUltimately, I\u2019ll share my recommendation for the best VPN to fit your budget while protecting your privacy and delivering consistently great performance.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nStarting at the free tier, Proton VPN takes the lead with a full-featured app that can connect to 136 servers in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. There\u2019s no data cap or artificial limits placed on speed. Proton VPN is among the best free VPNs with few restrictions. NordVPN doesn\u2019t have a free version.\n\nBoth offer a 30-day money-back guarantee but no trial period. That means you have to pay for a subscription to try the full version of either VPN. Each company supports 10 devices with paid service so you can use the VPN on all your devices and share with family members.\n\nNordVPN costs $13 per month, while Proton VPN comes in at $10 monthly. The best value comes with a longer subscription. NordVPN starts at $60 for the first year, but renews at $139.08. The equivalent monthly cost is $5 initially, but increases to $12 thereafter. A two-year subscription starts at $97 and includes three free months. That works out to $3.60 monthly, a great deal for 27 months. But watch out for the renewal cost, which skyrockets to $313.\n\nProton VPN has a less expensive $10 monthly plan and matches NordVPN\u2019s $60 annual subscription. The two-year plan costs $108. Proton doesn\u2019t charge more when you need to renew, so both monthly and renewal costs are better.\n\nBoth services have software bundles that add more features if you pay more.\n\nFeatures\n\nWhen I reviewed NordVPN, I was more than satisfied with its speed and reliability. I consistently enjoyed quick server connections and download speeds measuring 32% to 52% of my gigabit Ethernet connection. That\u2019s hundreds of megabits per second worldwide.\n\nAs impressive as NordVPN\u2019s performance was, Proton VPN nearly matched it by delivering 26% to 50% of my unprotected internet download speed. Proton VPN suffered from slow uploads, a common complaint with even the best VPNs.\n\nWhile NordVPN managed up to 29 Mbps uploads, the best I got with Proton VPN was 14 Mbps. To be fair, server connections are generally optimized for downloading content, with only a bit reserved to keep the connection responsive as you search and browse.\n\nBoth feature solid VPN connections to thousands of servers in over 100 countries. To get around administrative firewallls, NordVPN has the NordLynx protocol and Proton VPN has Stealth.\n\nSupport\n\nNordVPN has an advantage when it comes to customer service. You can search and browse the support center for help documents. If you run into a problem that you can\u2019t figure out on your own, NordVPN offers 24/7 live chat. I tested the response time and found it to be quick and informative.\n\nProton VPN provides live chat support for paid subscribers, but only during business hours. Still, you can get help quickly during a 15-hour window daily. I received fast and thorough replies to my questions.

Publisher Square Enix confirmed on the official Final Fantasy 16 X (formerly Twitter) account on Friday that there is now a small update for PlayStation 5 players to install.\n\n\u201cIn response to the crashes and graphical bugs that were occurring on the PlayStation 5 version of Final Fantasy 16, [Sony Interactive Entertainment has]released a new system update. Please try downloading and installing this update,\u201d the post reads. It added that it\u2019ll continue to look into the problems along with SIE.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n[Notice] PlayStation\u00ae5 version of FF16 In response to the crashes and graphical bugs that were occurring on the PlayStation\u00ae5 version of FINAL FANTASY XVI, SIE have released a new system update. Please try downloading and installing this update. \u2014 FINAL FANTASY XVI (@finalfantasyxvi) September 20, 2024\n\nSony, for its part, didn\u2019t comment on the situation beyond releasing system update 24.06-10.01.00. In the official patch notes, it just says: \u201cWe\u2019ve improved system software performance and stability.\u201d\n\nWhile PS5 players said they saw issues in other games, like Death Stranding: Director\u2019s Cut and No Man\u2019s Sky, Square Enix is the only studio that publicly acknowledged them in response to this particular update. \u201cFollowing the recent release of the PlayStation system update, there have been reports of the game crashing and graphical issues. We are currently working with [Sony Interactive Entertainment] to investigate,\u201d it posted earlier this week.\n\nThe bugs began with last week\u2019s release of PS5 system update 24.06-10.00.00. It added the Welcome Hub to the console\u2019s home screen for increased customizability options, party share, and previously-beta features like personalized 3D audio profiles and adaptive controller charging for PS5 Slim users. One particularly egregious example saw one player\u2019s Final Fantasy 16 environment, for lack of a better term, glitch out of existence. There were so many players experiencing these issues that the game\u2019s subreddit put together a thread to coordinate action."
