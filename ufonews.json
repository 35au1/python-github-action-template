        "article_content": "Ominous images of a perfectly spherical UFO, seemingly dotted with yellow 'landing lights,' have left some researchers certain one is 'the first selfie with a UFO in history.'\n\nTaken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011, the snaps show the apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n,' a chilly waterfall in Brazil's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina National Park.\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.'\n\nAnd by Meireles' own account, his sighting in one of South America's most scenic ecological preserves led to a raid on his home by 'soldiers in camouflage and black.'\n\nPhotos, taken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011 (pictured), show the an ominous apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' - a chilly waterfall in the South American nation's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nIn a recent, March 2022 post to the group UFOs Bahai on Facebook, Meireles boasted that his candid snap was 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.' Above, a second and less clear 'UFO selfie' from Meireles' alleged encounter with a flying orb in Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.' Above, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nSkeptics on social media, however, have alleged that the photos are everything from 'sky lanterns' held aloft by hot air from candles to outright doctored images.\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to Meireles for further comment \u2014 but the researcher, who serves as admin for 'el Grupo de Pesquisa Tecnol\u00f3gica Extra Avan\u00e7ada' ('the Extra-Advanced Technology Research Group') on Facebook has not replied.\n\nBut, in a March 2022 post, Meireles boasted that his candid snaps were 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.'\n\nAnd, in a submission to Brazilian nonprofit Museu da Pessoa (Museum of the Person) the UFO researcher recounted his trips back to the national park for repeated, but less-well-documented, encounters with these UFOs and their occupants.\n\nThose expeditions, documented in his book Fieldworkers: Pesquisadores de Campo in 2016, according to Meireles, led to further unwanted encounters with the military.\n\n'The result of the interrogation was [...] Fractures: 4 left ribs and left knee [...] Perforation with bleeding in the left lung,' and worse, Meireles told the nonprofit.\n\n'I was hospitalized for 12 days at the Chapada Regional Hospital, in Seabra-Ba, my medical history is there for anyone who wants to investigate,' according to the Brazilian UFO researcher.\n\nMeireles' version of his UFO experiences at the national park, includes more surreal encounters with beings and a prophecy of global environmental cataclysm: 'a natural collapse, with a lack of renewable resources, drinking water, and wood for construction,' as he told the nonprofit museum.\n\nFact or fiction, his story has a fitting setting in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park, established in September 1985 to protect a host of rare, endangered species native to these Atlantic Forest plateaus 3,000 feet about sea level.\n\nBrazil's giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), its giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) are all protected species that call the park home.\n\nAbove, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, lateral blur on the apparent craft appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another photo alleged to be from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, another image of lateral blur on the apparent 'alien spacecraft' - which appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter\n\nOne account of the 2011 sighting, attributed to Meireles, described a UFO whose onboard devices or novel means of propulsion managed to either accidentally or intentionally leave him stranded in the park.\n\n'I got out of the car and photographed,' according to a Reddit posting quoting Meireles. 'It was an indescribable wonderful emotion to have photographed a UFO so clearly visible.'\n\nBut, the account continues: 'About 40 minutes later, still on the road, my car turned off, I braked, I tried to turn the key and nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n'I saw a light on the hood and I looked up and there was a UFO standing on top of my car, I opened the door and ran,' the account continues.\n\n'I even stopped to take a Selfie with them. My car was towed by a tractor the next day, it burned all electrical parts.'\n\nThis version of his encounter states that Meireles was travelling to the historic district near the national park, Serra de Igat\u00fa, although a 2016 posting apparently by Meireles on Facebook asserts the images were taken on his was to the waterfall at the park known as 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n.'\n\nAbove, 'Mosquito Waterfall,' one of many waterfalls like the 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' from Meireles' UFO encounter, visited by tourists of Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAbove, a final known image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter, this time with less fog or low-lying cloud cover along the trail in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAn aerial view of Chapada Diamantina National Park in Bahia state, Brazil\n\nAbove, tourists admire the 'Poco Encantado' (aka 'the Enchanted Well') a sunken, subterranean pool and tourist destination at Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nSome champions of Meireles' UFO research have attributed the murky stories around his incredibly crisp and visually compelling photographs to the alleged hostile encounters with the military.\n\nH\u00e9lio Nunes de Camargo, the self-decribed founder of UFOs na Chapada \u2013 Centro Ufol\u00f3gico da Chapada Diamantina, wrote that Meireles' UFOs Bahai research group disbanded over the alleged military harassments and violence.\n\n'They are leaving UFOlogy to live their own lives away from threats and intrigues,' Nunes de Camargo wrote in a 2014 post to his group's Facebook page.\n\nThe UFO researcher recounted the deaths and abductions that UFOs Bahai is alleged to have faced, adding: 'They told me that families are suffering a lot and they don't want to make other families suffer.'\n\nOther UFO researchers online, however, have had trouble with this explanation.\n\n'The fact that he's [Meireles] still uploading those photos to his Facebook account every few months proves that might not be correct,' Reddit user spriz2 opined.\n\n'I've written to Edie multiple times on Facebook over the last year to try and gain more knowledge on this event,' the Redditer explained. 'He's ignored every message and comment.'\n\nOthers, however, not only found the case credible but believed they had seen this same UFO themselves.\n\n'Holy F***, this is identical to what I saw right before Covid hit,' one Redditer, who goes by ehtseeoh, said.\n\nThe poster said that the bottom of the craft he saw 'rotated when it glowed red with an orange center, and then it did a quick zig zag and it was gone,' making 'zero sound' as it vanished in an instant.\n\n'I screamed laughed and cried,' the poster said. 'FINALLY the orb I've been looking for online, this guy has a selfie with it haha.'\n\nDailyMail.com also reached out to noted UFO skeptic and computer programmer Mick West of Sacramento, California, who weighed-in saying: 'They look photoshopped to me, but could be practical effects.'\n\nThe prolific, skeptically minded, UFO researcher and former video game designer noted that UFO cases like this, with limited information like static images and inconsistent eye-witness testimony, should always be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n'In cases like this we need actual evidence that the photos are NOT fake before attempting to explain them,' West told DailyMail.com via email."

        "article_content": "The opportunity arose for Swallow after a chance meeting with Gerry's son Jamie Anderson, now head of his late father's company Anderson Entertainment \u2013 with the two men sharing an agent, Swallow arranged a meeting with Jamie to express his enthusiasm for Gerry's works.\n\nThe conversation eventually turned to the idea of crafting new stories set within the timeline of the original shows, with Swallow keen to explore the worlds of UFO and Space: 1999, two series which had \"the strongest impact\" on him in the early 1970s.\n\n\"Jamie came back to me and said, 'We've got this idea about doing these novellas \u2013 would you like to take a crack at it?'\" Swallow recalls. \"I pretty much bit his hand off.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"It's been a lot of fun for me \u2013 It gave me a great excuse to go back and rewatch the shows and kind of steep myself in them again. I tried very hard to make sure that I wrote these new stories in the style of that early 1970s sci-fi.\n\n\"I wanted to make it feel like these two manuscripts had been lying in a box somewhere since 1972... so if you love these shows, you could watch the TV show and then pick up the book, and it would feel like a seamless experience.\"\n\nThe cast of Space: 1999. Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nFirst aired in 1970-71, UFO \u2013 the first wholly live-action show produced by the Andersons following the Supermarionation success of Thunderbirds, Stingray and others \u2013 followed the covert efforts of top-secret military agency SHADO to prevent an alien invasion of Earth.\n\nThough a second season never materialised, initial concepts for further episodes eventually formed for the basis for the next show on the slate: Space: 1999 (aired 1975-1977) saw the moon, and the 311 inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha, sent hurtling out of Earth's orbit towards the unknown dangers of the galaxy.\n\nSwallow's new efforts, he says, \"dovetail with the source material\", with the hope being that you \"feel like you're reading an episode of the TV show that never got made\".\n\n\"I tried to do a little more than maybe they could have done on the TV shows, so I've got a few elements in both books which would have blown the budget had it been the television episode,\" he adds. \"But I've got the best budget ever, which is my readers' imagination.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine sees Commander John Koenig (as played on television by Martin Landau) and the people of Moonbase Alpha face an uncertain fate when a planet-killing alien weapon at the heart of a sinister cloud diverts their lost moon on to a fatal trajectory, while UFO - Shadowplay see SHADO commander-in-chef Ed Straker (played by Ed Bishop in the series) awaken from a coma with missing memories and suffering from strange hallucinations that threaten his grip on reality.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn telling these stories, Swallow was allowed to \"play with somebody else's toys\", but knew he couldn't \"leave sticky fingerprints all over them\" \u2013 and that the continuity of the television shows imposed certain limitations.\n\n\"In terms keeping inside the canon, I think that's part and parcel of taking on one of these jobs,\" he explains.\n\n\"You're not going to break it. You're going to work inside the lines. And some people have said to me, you know, isn't that like a straightjacket for you? Isn\u2019t it an intellectually bereft way of writing? And I think the exact opposite is true.\n\n\"It's challenging to me working inside the box. My first thought is, how do I push at the edges of that box? How do I kind of work inside the lines but still deliver something that reveals something new about these characters while acting in respect to the core material?\"\n\nCould these two books be just the beginning of a range of new adventures? Swallow is certainly hopeful, and suggests there's a hunger among other authors to engage with the worlds of Gerry Anderson.\n\nUFO and Space: 1999 novellas. Anderson Entertainment\n\n\"I had an absolute blast doing this \u2013 sometimes working on these type of projects can be a real pain, if you're working with somebody who's watching every tiny little detail, but there was such great creative freedom here, and it was such a fun bunch of people to work with.\n\n\"I would love to do it again, and I've heard from friends of mine who are other writers who are saying, 'Oh, that's a great franchise, we\u2019d love to be part of that.' So I think there's a market for it, there's an audience for it, and there's definitely a love for these stories, so we could tell more.\"\n\nGiven that UFO and Space: 1999 are effectively sister series, albeit a shared continuity was never established between the shows on television, might a crossover story even be on the cards in future?\n\n\"I've always thought these two shows feel like they took place in the same world,\" says Swallow. \"If you look at the timeline of it, Ed Straker was running SHADO in 1980 and Moonbase Alpha\u2019s in 1999\u2026 maybe these guys knew each other?\n\n\"I think that would be fun, to explore the idea of finding some sort of way to connect them... because of course UFO\u2019s story was never brought to a conclusion. You had this ongoing sort of Cold War story with these alien invaders and the show finished after one season and we never found out... were they defeated? What happened? And then Space: 1999 rolls along, [set] a decade later...\n\n\"Well, did something happen between the point of those stories? That would be fun to explore, I think.\"\n\nGet sci-fi news direct to your inbox The best sci-fi news and features this side of the Outer Rim.

I think that would work, definitely. You could update that to the modern day and you wouldn't really need to change an awful lot.\"\n\nAs for Space: 1999, though he argues you'd need \"brush over the scientific elements that were maybe a bit wobbly in the show\" \u2013 chiefly a nuclear explosion blowing the moon out of Earth's orbit \u2013 he adds: \"The core concept about a group of people stranded in this satellite moving through space, who have no control where they're going, coming up against danger and meeting people, and finding a way to survive again... that's a compelling idea.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine and UFO - Shadow Play novellas are available to buy from gerryanderson.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out more of our Sci-Fi coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on.

        "article_content": "Former National Security Advisor and retired Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster became the latest official to make eyebrow-raising comments about UFOs, now formally rebranded as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d or UAP.\n\nAsked about UAP during a Sept. 6 appearance on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d McMaster stated that \u201cthere are phenomena that have been witnessed by multiple people that are just inexplicable by any kind of science available to us.\u201d\n\nMcMaster\u2019s intriguing comments come at a critical moment in a growing national discussion about UAP. The Senate is poised to take up the bipartisan Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, arguably the most extraordinary legislation ever introduced in Congress.\n\nSponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), the Disclosure Act alleges that a decades-long government \u201clegacy program\u201d has secretly retrieved and is attempting to reverse-engineer UAP of \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cnon-human\u201d origin. Not only is \u201cnon-human intelligence\u201d formally defined, but the attention-grabbing term appears two dozen times throughout the 64-page legislation.\n\nAstoundingly, the Disclosure Act would also require the federal government to take possession of \u201cany and all\u201d recovered UAP and \u201cbiological evidence of non-human intelligence\u201d transferred to private defense contractors.\n\nWith multiple seemingly credible sources corroborating the existence of such secret programs, it is imperative that Congress pass the legislation without delay.\n\nThe introduction of the Disclosure Act, along with fascinating public comments like those from McMaster, marks a seismic shift in the official tone on the UFO phenomenon.\n\nFor over six decades, the U.S. government implemented a formal policy of \u201cdebunking,\u201d \u201cridiculing\u201d and dismissing even the most credible UAP incidents, frequently with demonstrably absurd and unscientific explanations.\n\nBut the December 2017 publication of a bombshell New York Times article fundamentally transformed the discourse on this long-stigmatized topic.\n\nAsked in 2020 about seemingly inexplicable, years-long U.S. Navy encounters with UAP, former CIA Director John Brennan made a jaw-dropping statement, suggesting that \u201ca different form of life\u201d might be behind the perplexing incidents.\n\nOver a decade after they were first formally reported, naval aviators\u2019 daily observations of UAP exhibiting amazing flight characteristics off the East Coast remain officially unexplained.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence under former President Trump, injected fascinating context into recent military encounters with the UFO phenomenon. In a 2021 interview, Ratcliffe stated that UAP \u201chave been picked up by satellite imagery [and] frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain, movements that are hard to replicate, that we don\u2019t have the technology for.\u201d\n\nU.S. intelligence analysts, Ratcliffe continued, have \u201chigh confidence\u201d that foreign adversaries such as China or Russia were not behind one of the most extraordinary, best-documented UAP incidents.\n\nAlarmingly, Ratcliffe stated that UAP exhibit \u201ctechnologies that we don\u2019t have and, frankly, that we are not capable of defending against.\u201d\n\nIn late 2021, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson suggested directly that recent military encounters with UAP could have extraterrestrial explanations.\n\nSimilarly, the prospect of a sitting high-level national security official openly discussing otherworldly origins for UAP was long unthinkable. But current Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines raised eyebrows in 2021 when she pointedly did not rule out \u201cextraterrestrial\u201d origins for UAP.\n\nFormer presidents Clinton, Obama and Trump generated headlines when asked about the phenomenon in recent years. Echoing McMaster, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley said last August that some reported UAP incidents are \u201creally kind of weird and unexplainable.\u201d\n\nSuch notable comments from top-level officials align with publicly available data. Sophisticated mathematical analyses of the most recognizable UAP footage and best-documented incidents, for example, corroborate fighter pilot and radar operator accounts of craft exhibiting highly advanced technology. Moreover, several other perplexing UAP videos, in tandem with supporting context and data, stubbornly resist prosaic explanations.\n\nPerhaps most alarmingly, mysterious objects exhibiting seemingly astonishing technology conducted a series of brazen incursions around sensitive U.S. military assets \u2014 including nuclear missile silos \u2014 in recent years.\n\nIn light of these remarkable developments, Congress must get to the bottom of the decades-long UFO mystery and pass the UAP Disclosure Act.\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the Department of Defense.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The report recommends several policy interventions for accurate AI adoption in Indian healthcare ecosystems. These include incentivising and standardising EHR adoption across healthcare providers to create a unified and robust health data infrastructure Further, investing in the AI workforce through upskilling, and facilitating public-private partnerships to foster innovation and accelerate the development of India-centric AI solutions. Establishing clear regulatory frameworks regarding data privacy, accountability, and ethical considerations for AI usage in healthcare should all be taken into consideration.\u201cAI has the potential to markedly improve productivity, efficiency, workflow, accuracy, and speed, both for physicians and for patients,\u201d said Professor DVR Seshadri, Director, ISB-Centre for Business Markets (ISB-CBM). \u201cThe right adoption of AI innovations in healthcare with proper policy interventions can go a long way in reaching the hinterlands of India, ensuring timely availability of treatment and fostering a good quality of life.\"The report highlights the potential of AI via important statistics for the argument for AI adoption in healthcare, like the doctor-patient ratio and the nurse-patient ratio. India has one doctor for every 1,457 people, significantly lower than the WHO recommended ratio of one doctor per 1,000 people. Similarly, India has 1.7 nurses per 1,000 people, compared to the recommended ratio of three nurses per 1,000 people. AI has the potential to bridge this gap.Based on in-depth interviews with leading hospitals and a comprehensive analysis of the AI startup ecosystem, the study found emerging AI applications in healthcare such as disease detection, process optimisation, patient-facing applications powered by chatbots, and treatment interventions by assisting in personalised treatment.Presently, around 4,000 companies in India are dedicated to developing AI solutions for healthcare. Additionally, there are government initiatives to support this transition, with the Ayushman Bharat Scheme and National Digital Health Infrastructure, among others.Technology is no longer considered a luxury. The healthcare industry must expand its frontiers into AI to achieve genuine breakthrough performances,\u201d said Professor Manish Gangwar, Executive Director, ISB Institute of Data Science. \u201cHealthcare leaders should consider tapping the vibrant start-up ecosystem and build congenial ecosystems that can usher in positive disruption and facilitate a healthy India and a brighter tomorrow.\"However, despite the promising practices and initiatives of AI integration in healthcare in India, there are several critical roadblocks for AI adoption in India that the study identifies, like data accessibility, skills gap, high infrastructure and development cost, regulatory uncertainty regarding data privacy and accountability in case of AI errors."

        "article_content": "According to Blue Plant\u2019s VP, telcos will lean into AI in the RAN much more \u2018aggressively\u2019 in the 6G era\n\nEven as 5G has yet to deliver on many of its promises, the balance is shifting; more and more conversations are beginning to favor the topic of 6G and how AI will be a cornerstone of this next generation. And it\u2019s true that embracing AI will be key to achieving the RAN modernization necessary for 6G systems, but what are telcos prioritizing as they introduce more and more AI capabilities into the RAN?\n\nAn open, democratized AI environment\n\nAccording to Blue Plant\u2019s Vice President Kailem Anderson, telcos will lean into AI in the RAN much more \u201caggressively\u201d in the 6G era. \u201cIn 6G, you\u2019re going to see the vendors and more importantly the telcos really embrace the openness in RAN in terms of disaggregation of the equipment \u2014 it\u2019s not there yet in 5G, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d he said, adding that as the industry moves from 5G to 6G, there will be \u201ctrue disaggregation of the RAN.\u201d\n\nFurther, telcos today rely on the AI capabilities built into the software they purchase from their RAN vendors, which results in a closed environment and a lack of control for the telco. \u201cI believe, moving forward, you\u2019re going to see this democratizing of AI play out not only in the RAN but in the entire network where instead of being beholden to the vendors that create the algorithms, the AI will open up,\u201d Anderson told RCR Wireless News.\n\nIn this scenario, telcos will be able to bring their own AI and apply it to the data sets that are being leveraged within the RAN, which he predicted will result in a new dynamic, leading to the rapid acceleration of AI within the RAN.\u201cBeing able to leverage that data for customer care systems, or to drive value-added automation, maybe even automation that is inter-carrier \u2014 from carrier-to-carrier \u2014 because you\u2019re not innovating just at the pace that the vendor is providing their AI into their equipment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can accelerate on top of that.\u201d\n\nReducing energy consumption\n\nAnother priority for telcos as they consider the future of networks, according to Alex Jinsung Choi, chair of the AI-RAN Alliance and principal fellow of SoftBank Corp.\u2019s Research Institute of Advanced Technology, is the reduction of OPEX.\n\n\u201cAnd energy consumption is one of the biggest factors of OPEX,\u201d he continued. \u201cAI will play a big role in making RAN operations more sustainable. Through predictive analytics, AI can predict the most energy-efficient times and places to operate network components; it can switch systems into low-power mode during times of low usages, such as overnight to conserve energy.\u201d\n\nBut, according to David Soldani, the SVP of next generation advanced research at Rakuten Mobile, telcos need a greater degree of operational freedom in order to realize energy savings. Currently, the only real option for power reduction involves switching a monolithic base station or cell site on or off. \u201cBut if you have really a composable, disaggregated infrastructure, where there is a decoupling between the hardware and software, but more importantly the platform and the workloads, I now have a high degree of freedom and can achieve optimal energy consumption at the given rate of service for the end user,\u201d he told RCR Wireless News.\n\nHe explained further that switching cell sites on and off invites a \u201ctremendous\u201d amount of risk, and so, telcos want AI to deliver more \u201cliquidity\u201d when it comes to energy consumption by using it to predict \u2014 at various network levels \u2014 where such an action should be taken. \u201cFor example, [Rakuten is] using AI to determine if certain CPUs in the hardware can be switched off \u2026 that\u2019s where AI contributes, down to the hardware. And if the platform supports it, we have ability to go a level up to scale horizontally or vertically the resources you provide to your nodes \u2026 You can measure your energy and then move your workloads to provide less or more resources, vertically to the nodes or horizontally to the cluster, so that you have an optimal way of consuming energy,\u201d said Soldani.\n\nFinding a \u2018means and method\u2019 to revenue\n\nSoldani also laid out a few key goals for 6G, but highlighted that one of the most important for Rakuten \u2014 and presumably, for all operators \u2014 is establishing a \u201cmeans and method\u201d to revenue.\n\nIn service of this goal, AI-RAN Alliance\u2019s AI-and-RAN working group is exploring how using the same infrastructure to run both RAN workload and also AI workload simultaneously will open up new revenue streams for telcos. \u201cThis is about making the most of what we have \u2026 to support AI applications while still managing our networks core functions,\u201d said Choi. \u201cThe outcome from this group is to show us how to increase resource utilization and open up new revenue streams by hosting various AI applications on the same platforms that runs our network functions.\u201d\n\nContinuing to build trust in AI\n\nAnderson is confident that in the future, AI will be \u201cpervasive in all aspects of the network,\u201d but added that right now, telco\u2019s lack of trust in the technology remains an obstacle. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that there is a heavy level of skepticism on the part of telcos around AI and explicitly, operations teams don\u2019t trust it yet,\u201d he said. What is AI automates off a false positive or off a false negative? What is this blows up my network? These are the questions telcos are still asking today.\n\nTherefore, operations teams only implementing what Anderson called \u201cpartial-closed loop AI\u201d use cases, where an operations team will get the output and confirm it implementing the change. AT&T\u2019s \u201cco-pilot\u201d approach to AI comes to mind. The telco uses AI as an additional network site quality agent and to provide its ops teams with recommendations around what, if any, network parameters should be changed.\n\n\u201cI do believe that in the 6G world, AI will be embraced with a trust that isn\u2019t there today. I think the biggest shift you\u2019re going to see is not a technology shift; it\u2019s a people and trust shift as it relates to the adoption of AI in a 6G world. And I truly believe that between now and 6G, this trust is going to evolve to the point that ops teams will start to give up that control,\u201d said Anderson"

        "article_content": "If you\u2019re bullish on AI and crypto, particularly Cardano, you\u2019re going to want to pay attention to PlayFix, a new AI-powered Web3 builder launching soon. With the crypto world shifting toward decentralized applications (dApps) and AI-driven solutions, PlayFix is uniquely positioned to capitalize on both trends, offering a powerful suite of tools for non-coders looking to build in the Web3 space.\n\nHere\u2019s why PlayFix could be the next big thing in AI and crypto, and why you shouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to get in early, including a free airdrop of their PFX tokens!\n\nWhat Is PlayFix?\n\nLaunching on September 17th, PlayFix is a project designed for AI-powered Web3 development. It simplifies the process of creating decentralized applications (dApps), websites, and even NFT marketplaces\u2014all without requiring users to have any coding experience. Imagine being able to launch your own Web3 project or NFT collection, all powered by AI, and done in just a few clicks. That\u2019s what PlayFix promises.\n\nThe platform allows users to create everything from basic landing pages to complex decentralized finance (DeFi) applications using AI-driven prompts. This puts the power of Web3 in the hands of anyone, regardless of their technical expertise.\n\nAirdrop Alert: Get PFX Tokens for Free\n\nOne of the biggest draws of PlayFix is its free token airdrop. All you need to do is join their Discord community to start earning points, which you can then use to claim your share of the airdropped PFX tokens. With 50% of the token supply going to the public sale, this airdrop is a prime opportunity to get in early, before the platform\u2019s full launch.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the mechanics, an airdrop means free distribution of crypto tokens to early users or community members, allowing participants to own a piece of the project before it takes off. PlayFix\u2019s airdrop gives you a chance to get a foothold in this innovative ecosystem without upfront investment.\n\nThe Power of AI in Web3: What PlayFix Offers\n\nWhat sets PlayFix apart is its focus on AI-driven Web3 development tools. From building websites and launching dApps to creating NFT marketplaces, PlayFix offers a comprehensive suite of tools that make it easy for both newcomers and experienced developers to create on Cardano's blockchain.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the PlayFix platform offers:\n\nAI-Powered Web3 Builder: Create websites and dApps using simple AI prompts. This is a huge leap forward compared to traditional Web2 website builders, as it enables the creation of more complex, decentralized applications. DeFi and NFT Functionality: Whether you're looking to create a DeFi application or an NFT marketplace, PlayFix has you covered. The platform offers tools for smart contract interaction, token management, and more, making it an all-in-one solution for Web3 projects. Customizable Site Bots and FlexiBots: AI-powered site bots on PlayFix don\u2019t just handle customer service\u2014they take it to the next level. These bots simulate human conversation using advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, which allow them to learn and evolve over time. FlexiBots, in particular, stand out because they can be trained to perform complex tasks, making them indispensable for Web3 projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy PlayFix's Tokenomics Are Bullish\n\nAnother reason to be excited about PlayFix is its robust tokenomics model. The PFX token isn\u2019t just for show\u2014it has real utility within the platform, driving user engagement and creating a sustainable economic model.\n\nKey highlights of PlayFix\u2019s tokenomics include:\n\n50% Public Sale : Half of the total token supply is reserved for the public, giving you a major opportunity to get in early.\n\n$10 Minimum Stake : To unlock premium features on the platform, users must stake at least $10 worth of PFX tokens, creating steady buying pressure as demand grows.\n\nRevenue-Generating Features: PlayFix isn\u2019t just another speculative token\u2014its business model includes selling custom domains, offering AI-driven site bots, and facilitating Web3 development through tiered subscriptions. This is a crucial differentiator, as it creates a sustainable revenue stream, unlike many 2020-era projects that had little practical use.\n\nFlexiBots: The Game Changer for AI in Web3\n\nPerhaps the most exciting feature PlayFix brings to the table is FlexiBots. These AI-powered bots can evolve over time and are trainable for specific purposes, like handling customer support, managing a DeFi app, or even emulating thought leaders in the space. Imagine having a FlexiBot trained on every Charles Hoskinson (the founder of Cardano) livestream, capable of answering questions in his style. The possibilities are endless, and the impact on the Cardano ecosystem could be significant.\n\nNot only can you use these bots to enhance your own Web3 project, but you can also sell your FlexiBots on PlayFix\u2019s marketplace, creating a whole new way to monetize AI-driven tools.\n\nThe Bullish Case for Cardano and PlayFix\n\nCardano has long been touted as one of the most promising blockchains for decentralized applications and smart contracts. However, many developers have struggled to bring projects to life due to the technical complexities involved. PlayFix bridges this gap, providing non-coders with easy-to-use tools to build on Cardano, which could significantly boost the blockchain's adoption in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIf you need a real-world example of why this is needed, look at the rise of meme coins on Cardano, like those launched through Snek.fun. Many of these projects struggled because they lacked basic website functionality, let alone custom dApps. With PlayFix, new projects could go live with fully functional Web3 capabilities in a fraction of the time.\n\nConclusion: Don\u2019t Miss Out on PlayFix\n\nPlayFix is poised to be a major player in both the AI and Cardano ecosystems. With its suite of AI-powered Web3 tools, a robust tokenomics model, and a platform designed for non-coders, it could be the key to unlocking the next wave of decentralized innovation on Cardano.\n\nThe free PFX token airdrop is an opportunity you don\u2019t want to miss, and the project\u2019s launch on September 17th could mark the beginning of a major trend in Web3 development. If you\u2019re bullish on AI and Cardano, PlayFix is a must-watch."

        "article_content": "TV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit in the Worcestershire attic of pop icon Toyah Willcox in Pershore on TV show Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted on Discovery\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai had a terrifying encounter with an 'evil spirit' in the attic of pop legend Toyah Willcox's Worcestershire home. The paranormal expert was left 'gasping for air' after being 'strangled' by a ghoul during filming for the new series of Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted. Ghai, along with his colleagues Ian Shaw and Jayne Harris, had set up a special 'REM' recording device at the historic Pershore residence of the 1980s singer for the popular TV show on Discovery+. Viewers will witness Ghai seemingly restrained while conducting an investigation in the attic. The team attempted to communicate with a ghost named 'George', believed to be a soldier from the English civil war in the 1600s. Willcox, who has experienced \"persistent paranormal activity\" since moving to the picturesque Worcestershire town two decades ago, signed up for the show. The punk pop icon, famous for hits like It's a Mystery, I Want To Be Free and Echo Beach, resides in a historic Georgian house with her guitarist husband Robert Fripp. During the ghost hunting visit, Ghai can be seen clutching his throat before hastily exiting the attic, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit\n\nGhai recounted: \"Something just grabbed my windpipe. F**king scared the s**t out of me. I couldn't get breath in, that's what scared me.\" \"I thought I was gonna die. I actually thought I was going to die.\" This is what Barri Ghai, one of the nation's leading paranormal investigators, confessed after a chilling encounter during a haunted house visit. His colleague Harris urgently intervened, pleading with the unseen presence, \"Whoever's doing that, can you step away please? You do not have permission to do that. Step away from Barri.\"\n\nA paranormal team with Toyah in Pershore\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. You can unsubscribe at any time. Read our Privacy Policy\n\nReflecting on the harrowing experience later in the show, Ghai shared his intense moment with host Willcox, saying, \"Straight away we got some kind of indication that there was a bit more of an aggressive male energy that was very dominant up there,\" and disclosed how he felt attacked by the spirit, \"And then, I was sat there, I was talking, and all of a sudden my windpipe was constricted. I couldn't breathe, I was actually really scared.\" The thrilling TV programme spotlights the expertise of three of Britains top ghost hunters: Ian Lawman, known for his skills as an exorcist and medium; Barri Ghai, who provides profound insights as a paranormal consultant; and Jayne Harris, a researcher and historian deeply immersed in paranormal lore. For those eager to be in the know about Worcestershire's latest talking points, signing up for our daily newsletter will ensure you're always in the loop.\n\nTrending\n\nVenturing into shadowy corners where spirits linger, this iconic trio uses their otherworldly talents to rid celebrities' homes of unwelcome spectres. Commentators were on edge when discussing the fifth episode shot in Pershore, with a spokesperson alluding to the gripping nature of Toyah's case on her website: \"To lend a helping hand, the team undergo one of their most terrifying investigations to date.\" What they unearth is staggering, connecting dots between an ancient medieval tragedy and the malicious ghost plaguing the property. Toyah, the seminal punk-pop starlet of the '80s, became enamoured with Pershore over twenty years ago, having been familiarised with it through holidays spent there with her family, a stark contrast to her urban Birmingham roots. Toyah Wilcox, the renowned singer, has lavished praise on Pershore, hailing it \"very friendly\" and \"one of the best places she's ever lived in the world\". Having spent her childhood weekends in the adjacent Wyre Piddle with her family, she became well-acquainted with the charm of the area.\n\nToyah Wilcox with her husband Robert Fripp"

        "article_content": "Here is Entertainment Weekly\u2019s ranking of the 25 best found footage movies of all time.\n\nWhile many found footage movies remain in the horror sandbox \u2014 and, admittedly, some less talented filmmakers use the genre to do nothing at all \u2014 the format\u2019s best installments take the camera\u2019s limitations and spin them into a brilliant device to immerse the audience in various worlds. In some cases, they\u2019re worlds we\u2019d never want to visit.\n\nWith the notorious video nasty Cannibal Holocaust (1980), the found footage style dipped its toes into horror and never looked back. Though some movies played with the subgenre\u2019s trappings during the following decades \u2014 most notably the BBC special Ghostwatch (1992) \u2014 found footage didn\u2019t properly take hold until the advent of consumer-grade camcorders. The Blair Witch Project (1999) gave rise to a series of imitators, but it was Paranormal Activity (2007) that birthed the genre\u2019s most fertile period.\n\nMany argue that the first found footage picture was Shirley Clarke\u2019s The Connection (1961), a faux-documentary about a group of drug addicts \u2014 mostly musicians \u2014 waiting around an apartment for their dealer, while the cameraman tries to intervene and even manipulate the proceedings. A few years later, Milton Moses Ginsberg directed Coming Apart (1969) \u2014 a precursor to Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) \u2014 that plays out in a seemingly unbroken shot and stars Rip Torn as a creepy psychiatrist who likes to film his amorous encounters with women.\n\nOne of the most affecting and moldable cinematic templates, found footage movies soared in popularity following The Blair Witch Project \u2019s debut 25 years ago \u2014 but the subgenre had already been percolating for nearly 40 years before that.\n\n25. Searching (2018) ELIZABETH KITCHENS/Sony Pictures This particularly sharp and savvy tech-thriller sees a father (John Cho) investigating the disappearance of his daughter (Michelle La), who led a busy and mysterious life on social media. Meanwhile, a dogged detective (Debra Messing, going against type with a hefty dramatic performance) assists in his efforts. Using a seamless combination of FaceTime calls, CCTV and news footage, and investigators\u2019 video evidence, Aneesh Chaganty weaves a riveting, anxious, and classically creepy found footage movie that puzzles until its final moments. Where to watch Searching: Starz\n\n24. Unfriended: Dark Web (2018) Blumhouse Productions An improvement over Unfriended (2014), this sequel finds five pals video chatting for their weekly game night. The twist: one of them logs in via the stolen laptop of a nefarious dark web user, who hacks their call and begins wreaking bloody havoc to regain his device. Tapping into terror and mean-spiritedness similar to Megan Is Missing, Dark Web holds you in its sweaty grip from start to finish with some clever editing and a nice spattering of jump scares. This isn\u2019t high art, but it\u2019s still a notably inventive computer-based thriller. Where to watch Unfriended: Dark Web: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n23. End of Watch (2012) Scott Garfield/Open Road David Ayer\u2019s white-knuckle police procedural follows two Los Angeles beat cops (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a) who get embroiled with a gang of drug dealers. Admittedly, the found footage concept is shaky here. It\u2019s ostensibly sourced from dash and body cams, but Gyllenhaal\u2019s character is also making a documentary about his life, and by the third act it\u2019s unclear where the footage is coming from\u2026 if not the production-grade camera of a cinematographer (in this case, Roman Vasyanov). Yet Ayer\u2019s film is an undeniably powerful one. It works effortlessly as both a gritty urban thriller and a stirring testament to friendship and brotherhood. Where to watch End of Watch: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n22. The Bay (2012) Everett Barry Levinson, known for character dramas like Rain Man (1988) and comedies like Wag the Dog (1997), helmed this startling and unfortunately credible bio-horror tale. It concerns a Maryland community beset by waterborne parasites that take control of victims\u2019 bodies and brains, causing them to do terrible things. Levinson\u2019s movie is one of the most convincingly documentary-like in the found footage subgenre. The simple premise and pacing conceal its supreme power and startling chill, throwing you directly into the fray for a nightmarish immersive experience. Where to watch The Bay: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21. The Last Broadcast (1998) Everett A documentarian (David Beard) enters the Pine Barrens to investigate the case of the Jersey Devil with drastic consequences in this gripping, lo-fi genre film that exists on a similar plain as The Blair Witch Project (not in cultural magnitude, but definitely in style). Their similar storylines are likely just a coincidence. But much like the infamous 1999 chiller (which was shot in 1997, around the same time as The Last Broadcast), this found footage movie benefits from empathetic lead performances by talented unknowns and plenty of regional charm. Where to watch The Last Broadcast: Tubi\n\n20. Willow Creek (2013) Dark Sky Films Comedian turned filmmaker Bobcat Goldthwait directed this amiable, genre-literate found footage movie, which stars Alexie Gilmore and Bryce Johnson as skeptical documentarians who explore the eponymous California town's obsession with Bigfoot. It\u2019s not a spoiler to say there\u2019s more truth to the legend than either anticipated. Willow Creek functions as both a jovial document of the town itself and, in its later stages, a properly suspenseful horror film. Goldthwait calls back to multiple classic forest-terror flicks, especially those from the genre\u2019s most fertile period in the \u201980s. The brilliant final punchline, without giving much away, nicely one-ups the similar conclusion of The Prey (1983). Where to watch Willow Creek: Peacock\n\n19. Megan Is Missing (2011) Trio Pictures Michael Goi\u2019s found footage shocker is remarkably upsetting and genuinely nauseating; it\u2019s an uncomfortable, grimy little thriller about two teens \u2014 Amy (Amber Perkins) and Megan (Rachel Quinn) \u2014 who meet an enigmatic young man called \u201cJosh\u201d online. After Megan disappears while going to meet him, Amy resolves to find out what happened to her friend. Both a savage warning to people of all ages not to mess around on the internet and a chilling horror pic in its own right, Megan Is Missing manages to be enthralling even as it flirts with being unwatchable, building breathtaking suspense before the uncompromising third act. Where to watch Megan Is Missing: Tubi\n\n18. VHS 2 (2013) Magnolia Pictures This second installment represents the venerable anthology franchise\u2019s height of humor, invention, and variety. Its frame story involves a crime-busting couple who, while searching for a missing coed, must view a variety of videotapes. The vignettes range from aliens crashing a slumber party to a man suffering a rogue ocular transplant, but the finest segments come courtesy of original Blair Witch Project director Eduardo S\u00e1nchez and The Raid (2011) filmmaker Gareth Evans. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s entry features industrious zombies hot on the tails of some cyclists, while Evans\u2019 installment (the best here) deals with a demented doomsday cult. Where to watch VHS 2: Hulu\n\n17. The Poughkeepsie Tapes (2007) Scream Factory This skin-crawling faux-documentary concerns a prolific New York serial killer who evades capture despite recording his brazen crimes. As investigators review the snuff tapes, the fiend\u2019s identity comes into focus; but do they have the right man? Directed by brothers Drew and Eric Dowdle, who capably remade Rec as Quarantine (2008), The Poughkeepsie Tapes makes up for its occasional lapses in realism with its utterly distrubing portrayal of pure evil. It\u2019s a tough watch, and rarely an enjoyable one, but it's nevertheless effective as both a taut found footage film and a haunting home invasion thriller (not to mention that it touts one of the best horror movie masks of all time). Where to watch The Poughkeepsie Tapes: Tubi\n\n16. Grave Encounters (2011) Tribeca Film/Courtesy Everett This modern horror classic sees ghost hunters head to an abandoned psychiatric hospital to capture evidence of a genuine haunting, but they find much more than they bargained for. That ropy old setup gives way to one of the more effective, and certainly action-packed, entries in the found footage subgenre. Directors Colin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz wisely employ a slow build with sharp writing and character development up top. When everything goes ballistic, the film adopts a pace similar to the rollercoaster Italian ghost films of the 1980s. In other words, it\u2019s an absolute blast. Where to watch Grave Encounters: Tubi\n\n15. Cannibal Holocaust (1980) Everett One of the original found footage movies, Ruggero Deodato\u2019s landmark exploitation movie follows a New York City documentary crew into the Amazonian jungle to film indigenous cannibal tribes, where things of course go terribly wrong. Suffice it to say, the United Nations won\u2019t be screening Deodato\u2019s movie anytime soon. Most infamous for its inexcusable animal snuff sequences, the film is equally concerned with watching yuppies suffer at the hands of \u201cunhinged natives.\u201d Yet while lacking in decency and, frankly, class, Cannibal Holocaust features extremely effective queasy quasi-realism. It\u2019s also an undeniably significant cinematic relic that set many ground rules for found footage. Where to watch Cannibal Holocaust: Peacock\n\n14. Host (2020) Shudder This recent genre entry finds six friends holding a Zoom s\u00e9ance with a mysterious medium (Seylan Baxter), accidentally summoning a demonic entity into their homes in the process. Rob Savage\u2019s DIY creep-fest was produced and released during the initial COVID-19 lockdown, and it\u2019s one of the few cyber-based projects that works. The constraint provided by its premise gives the film a vigor and life lacking in most horror films set online (and even many found footage thrillers). Its scares are well-executed with generous character development and likable performances from the entire cast. Where to watch Host: AMC+\n\n13. The Taking of Deborah Logan (2014) Millennium Entertainment This harrowing faux-doc feels like a combination of Grey Gardens, Paranormal Activity, and the Anthony Hopkins drama The Father. It concerns a documentarian (Michelle Ang) chronicling the eponymous Deborah Logan (Jill Larson) and her daughter (Anne Ramsay) as Deborah succumbs to Alzheimer\u2019s. Yet as strange events occur around their home, the Logans wonder if something else is to blame for Deborah\u2019s condition. The Taking of Deborah Logan is a high-water mark for found footage. The performances are far beyond what the subgenre is typically graced with, while the suppressive atmosphere lends the film a claustrophobic feel despite multiple scenes set outside the house of horrors. It\u2019s a tricky, intelligent balancing act that director Adam Robitel pulls off with aplomb. Where to watch The Taking of Deborah Logan: Tubi\n\n12. Cloverfield (2008) Paramount/courtesy Everett Matt Reeves\u2019 directorial career broke through with this taut alien invasion horror riff, which plays intelligently (rather than exploitatively) with a queasy post-9/11 anxiety that was still common at the time of Cloverfield\u2019s release. Just as a group of carefree New York City twentysomethings (including Mike Vogel and Lizzy Caplan) gather to celebrate one of their friend\u2019s impending move westward, a creature the size of the Empire State Building descends on the city. From there, they have to navigate an increasingly chaotic Manhattan and a growing military presence in their desperate fight to evade the beast and its smaller compatriots. Where to watch Cloverfield: Paramount+\n\n11. Chronicle (2012) Alan Markfield/20th Century Studios Josh Trank\u2019s riveting inversion of the superhero mythos birthed the careers of Dane DeHaan and Michael B. Jordan. DeHaan stars as an awkward teen who films his every move and, along with his friends, stumbles upon a mysterious object that imbues them with remarkable powers. But the abilities bring out the darker sides of some, imperiling the world as the kids know it. Chronicle is one of the best superhero movies of the modern era, subverting many of the genre\u2019s tropes and character types while indulging the right amount of camp and spectacle (and all under 90 minutes). Where to watch Chronicle: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n10. Ghostwatch (1992) Shudder This groundbreaking BBC gem stars actual network anchors of the time in a fake \"live\" broadcast concerning a haunted house investigation on Halloween night. When a presence known as \u201cPipes\u201d makes itself ominously known and attempts to infiltrate the production, the on-air hosts must fight to stay alive \u2014 or, more accurately, to stay un-possessed. Highly controversial at the time, Ghostwatch spurred thousands of complaints to the network, many of which were from viewers who had believed the program was real. Indeed, Ghostwatch is one of the most clever examples of the format, one that\u2019s extra effective if you have context for the personalities of early-\u201990s BBC anchors. Where to watch Ghostwatch: AMC+\n\n9. The Visit (2015) Universal Pictures M. Night Shyamalan got his career back on track with this tense, genuinely funny potboiler. Two kids (Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould) finally get to visit their grandparents (Deana Dunagan, Peter McRobbie) for the first time since their mother (Kathryn Hahn) cut off contact. Things seem normal at first but quickly devolve once nighttime rolls around. Here, Shyamalan delivers his best work in over a decade, getting out of his own way and letting the story do the talking. It\u2019s as straightforward a thriller as you can get, one propulsively paced and executed with an abundance of mordant humor. Where to watch The Visit: Max\n\n8. Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum (2018) Well Go USA /Courtesy Everett Collection This exceptional K-horror film sees prankish web series hosts venture into a haunted asylum, where they\u2019ve set up a succession of cheap scares to thrill their viewers. Little do they know, the paranormal residents there have a few genuine frights in store for them. Gonjiam gets terrific mileage from a well-trod premise. You\u2019ll likely laugh out loud at how many times the movie gets you with the same is-it-or-isn\u2019t-it-real trick, but it\u2019s so well structured that you\u2019ll hardly mind playing the fool. There\u2019s also a pleasing lack of artifice here, both in the acting and Jung Bum-shik\u2019s direction, that makes this one of the most watchable found footage installments in recent memory. Where to watch Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum: Tubi\n\n7. Trollhunter (2010) Magnet Releasing/Courtesy Everett Collection Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal directed this transcendent comedic thriller about a group of student filmmakers who set out into the Norwegian countryside to make a documentary about poachers. But they\u2019re tempted to change their angle when they meet an enigmatic man (Otto Jespersen) who claims to spend his days hunting trolls. \u00d8vredal has gone on to a fairly robust Hollywood career, directing solid genre films like The Autopsy of Jane Doe (2016) and Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019). Yet Trollhunter remains his most fleshed-out and daring work, a cunning, scrappy little experiment that features impactful performances and action sequences. Where to watch Trollhunter: Max\n\n6. Hell House LLC (2015) Fbi Films There\u2019s nothing new or fancy in Hell House LLC, which makes its feverish grip on the audience even more admirable. Good-time youths venture to an abandoned inn, where 15 people perished in a commercial haunted house gone terribly wrong, to investigate the unexplained tragedy. Hell House takes its time spinning the tale of misfortune that befalls the central investigators. It deftly combines a pseudo-crime documentary angle with a down-and-dirty fright-fest that milks each corner of the cavernous inn for everything it\u2019s worth. Perhaps most astonishingly, the movie manages to make creepy clowns \u2014 that shopworn trope \u2014 genuinely frightening again. Where to watch Hell House LLC: AMC+\n\n5. Paranormal Activity (2007) Arguably the movie that kicked off found footage\u2019s most fruitful period, Oren Peli\u2019s masterfully orchestrated spook-fest concerns a young couple \u2014 Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) \u2014 who begin documenting eerie occurrences in their suburban home. The hair-raising moments in this homegrown genre hallmark arise nominally through character development, a key to Paranormal Activity\u2019s enduring power. Its simple formula sets the viewer up for at least one (usually more) scare every 10 minutes or so, slowly revealing the particulars of the plot without sacrificing the story\u2019s anxious mystery. Where to watch Paranormal Activity: Max\n\n4. Lake Mungo (2008) Lionsgate This somber Australian chiller, done in an exceptionally authentic faux-doc style, follows a family trying to piece together unexplainable supernatural events in the aftermath of their daughter\u2019s tragic, seemingly accidental death. It would be a stretch to call Lake Mungo a full-on horror movie, though it has several sequences of ceaseless tension and one incredible, thematically rich fright near the end. It\u2019s perhaps one of the only found footage movies that is nominally a kitchen-sink family drama, infused with inflections of the paranormal and a few bone-chilling moments along the way. The actors, meanwhile, do a tremendous job behaving like normal people caught on camera while making tiny, hugely influential performance choices. Where to watch Lake Mungo: Tubi\n\n3. Rec (2007) Everett A late-night TV host Angela (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman plan to shoot a slice-of-life piece while following local firefighters to a city skyscraper. But when a mysterious virus imbues an elderly woman with excessive strength and a taste for blood, the police seal off the building, leaving the journalists and co. to face growing factions of the infected. This properly frightening genre exercise is one of the few found footage movies that properly utilizes the camera lens\u2019 limitations. Rec wrings an almost silly level of suspense and fear from what could be lurking on either side of the frame, a smart device that places the audience right in the center of the horror. Where to watch Rec: Tubi\n\n2. Creep (2014) Blumhouse Productions Mark Duplass gives his best performance to date in this psycho-thriller as a man who claims to be terminally ill and hires a filmmaker (Patrick Brice) to record him as a relic for his unborn son. It quickly becomes clear, however, that he can\u2019t be trusted as the cameraman unravels a dangerous web of secrets. Duplass and Brice (who also directed) wrote the screenplay together, marvelously blending suspense and comedy elements for a wholly original slow-burn horror film. Creep is able to maintain its mystery, and its dread, for much longer than most movies can muster, all while providing some modern jolts for viewers weaned on found footage. Where to watch Creep: Netflix"

The workshop will take place on Tuesdays from 6 to 8 p.m., running through Oct. 1.\n\n\"This is about everyone's experience of the unknown,\" said Martin, who has been captivated by the paranormal since childhood. \"Everyone seems to have a story. It could be a strange noise in the woods, a sighting of something mysterious in the sky, or an encounter in a haunted house. These are the kinds of experiences we want to talk about in the class.\"\n\nThe workshop will be divided into four distinct sessions, each focusing on different facets of the paranormal. \"We'll start with Bigfoot and other cryptids, because people are really drawn to those stories,\" said Martin. \"Then we'll dive into UFOs and aliens, ghostly encounters, and wrap up with a general discussion of fringe topics like the Mandela effect and how quantum physics might tie into the paranormal.\"\n\nAlthough the subject matter may seem fantastical to some, Martin emphasizes a healthy skepticism in his discussions.\n\n\"I believe in a lot of weird things, but I also think it's important to approach everything with a dose of skepticism,\" he noted. \"I don't just believe every crazy idea that comes along. I want to investigate it, explore the possibilities, and consider the evidence.\"\n\nMartin's journey into the world of the unexplained began with little paperback books from his childhood. \"I remember reading about the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, and the Mothman when I was a kid,\" he recalled. \"Back in the early '70s, no one really knew about Mothman, but I found it fascinating.\"\n\nHis connection to the subject deepened in the 1990s when he became involved with the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where his aptly titled band Mothman has performed for over two decades.\n\nWhile the workshop will cover a broad range of paranormal topics, Martin is excited to tie in local mysteries from southern Ohio.\n\n\"I do try to build in some of the local stories,\" he said. \"Lawrence County and Ross County have their share of strange occurrences, and students have shared their own stories about haunted houses and eerie experiences in the woods. It's a great way to connect the paranormal to our community.\"\n\nMartin encourages anyone with an open mind to attend the workshop. \"You don't have to be an expert to enjoy this class,\" he says. \"It's really for people who are curious, who want to hear about strange and unusual things. Whether you've had your own paranormal experience or are just intrigued by the unknown, this class is for you.\"\n\nRegistration for the workshop is available online at ohio.edu/southern-workshops, and the cost for all for sessions is $25 total."

        "article_content": "The most volcanic world in our solar system has sprouted a new volcano. And its lava flows are enormous.\n\nJupiter's molten moon Io has been surveyed by a number of passing spacecraft, allowing planetary scientists to see changes on the surface. Recently, NASA's Juno mission made the closest swings by Io in two decades. The 2024 views show a dynamic volcano where, just decades ago, there was a featureless region.\n\n\"Our recent JunoCam images show many changes on Io, including this large, complicated volcanic feature that appears to have formed from nothing since 1997,\" Michael Ravine, the advanced projects manager at Malin Space Science Systems, which operates the spacecraft's JunoCam instrument, said in a statement. The discovery was just presented at the 2024 Europlanet Science Congress.\n\nProdigious amounts of lava have clearly poured from this new volcano; you can see it running to the left of the vent in two potent streams some 100 kilometers (62 miles) long. The lava, overlain over a map of the city of Berlin in another graphic below, would dominate a large swathe of Germany. Where the lava flows end and have pooled, intense heat from the molten rock created those two gray circles when frozen surface material vaporized into space.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech / SwRI / MSSS / Europlanet / Google Maps\n\nThis volcanic world, an object a little bigger than Earth's moon, is blanketed in hundreds of volcanoes and ceaselessly erupting. The first-ever observations of Io, captured by the pioneering Voyager 1 craft, spotted at least eight different active volcanoes. The most recent flybys in 2023 and early 2024 spotted nine plumes from volcanoes.\n\nIt's a vicious world, inhospitable to life. And beneath its volcanic surface, it may harbor a sea of magma."

        "article_content": "The success rate of IT projects can be improved by empowering business unit leaders to become tech innovators, Gartner Vice President Analyst Daniel Sanchez-Reina told a crowd of CIOs and IT leaders on Sept. 10 at the Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo in Australia.\n\nAs he explained, CIOs in Australia have historically struggled to meet objectives: Only 48% of digital projects are currently meeting or exceeding their goals. However, a cohort of top-performing CIOs are achieving at a much higher success rate, with 71% of their projects reaching their targets.\n\n\u201cThis distance is huge,\u201d Sanchez-Reina said. \u201cAnd we are talking about enterprise-wide digital initiatives.\u201d\n\nSEE: Adopt AI at your own pace, Gartner tells Australian IT leaders\n\nHe told delegates in Australia that it is possible for any CIO to contribute to this \u201cdigital vanguard\u201d and boost digital initiative success rates by co-owning future digital initiatives with heads of businesses.\n\nCo-owning digital projects with business leaders\n\nGartner compared findings from the largest global study of 3,100 CIOs with survey results from chief experience officers, which Sanchez-Reina defined as business, corporate function, or agency leaders.\n\nThe results showed IT leaders overcame \u201cthe curse of random success\u201d by \u201cco-owning\u201d digital projects.\n\n\u201cCo-owning means equal fair share of responsibility, equal fair share of accountability, equal fair share of participation,\u201d Sanchez-Reina explained.\n\nIn these successful \u201cdigital vanguard\u201d organisations, these CXO or business leaders:\n\nCo-own digital delivery with CIOs from start to finish.\n\nAllocate 70% more business area staff to technology work for at least part of their time.\n\nSanchez-Reina said this was not a case of \u201cshadow IT.\u201d Instead, business leaders were being mentored in digital initiatives by CIOs and relied on central CIO involvement to achieve their own success.\n\n\u201cThere is no CXO success in digital without CIO success \u2014 and the other way around,\u201d he said.\n\n4 steps to reduce the risk of digital project failure\n\nCIOs should consider four effective strategies to increase IT project success rates, according to Sanchez-Reina:\n\n1. Provide easy-to-use platforms for business units\n\nThe best CIOs are investing in technologies such as cybersecurity, AI, cloud, and hyper-automation for business areas as well as for IT. These technologies enable potential or current tech producers to more easily access and use digital platforms while also leveraging distributed digital talent, such as younger workers, in business areas.\n\nSEE: The top 10 strategic technology trends for 2025\n\n\u201cDo you know Gen Z are able to create a landing page using any software you train them in in the blink of an eye?\u201d Sanchez-Reina asked. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just Gen Z. Think of people who master exploiting business intelligence to the utmost \u2014 they are perfect candidates to develop more complex analytical capabilities.\u201d\n\n2. Boost the architectural awareness of business leaders\n\nCIOs at the digital vanguard are active in teaching business areas beyond IT about what Sanchez-Reina called the \u201cpillars of digital delivery.\u201d This includes aspects of what would usually be considered an IT role, including managing technology vendors, understanding technology costs, and cybersecurity impacts.\n\nIn contrast with what CIOs might believe, he emphasized that it is not \u201ctoo techy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more you grow digital vanguard CXOs, the more they will want you to give them advice on architectural things like, for example, vendor management,\u201d Sanchez-Reina explained. \u201cThey want it 1.6 times more than the rest of CXOs.\u201d\n\n3. Foster innovation leaders across business areas\n\nSanchez-Reina urged CIOs to make it easier for business areas to spot, incubate, and scale innovation in 2025. He said the top technologies CIOs have deployed or are about to deploy \u2014 such as generative AI low-code/no-code platforms \u2014 provide a foundation for such innovation efforts in business areas.\n\nAccording to Gartner data, only 18% of CIOs say they are doing this at the global level. However, Sanchez-Reina noted that as more digital business leaders are developed, they will increasingly seek CIOs\u2019 help in identifying innovation opportunities, supporting AI use cases, and becoming innovation leaders themselves.\n\n4. Support business leaders in digital skills planning\n\nMore CIOs at the digital vanguard extend digital skills development planning beyond the boundaries of IT. Gartner\u2019s data shows that currently two-thirds of this leading cohort of CIOs are helping business areas to forecast digital skills needs, compared with just 16% of the rest of global CIOs.\n\nCIOs are helping business units with skills planning and development in technologies that are relevant for their areas, digital leadership, building communities of practice, or AI.\n\n\u201cThe more you grow digital vanguard CXOs, the more they will want you to help their staff to develop technical skills,\u201d Sanchez-Reina said.\n\nCIOs deliver more digital initiatives, enjoy their jobs more\n\nThere is some good news for CIOs who make the effort to work with business leaders in 2025.\n\nCIOs concerned about the strategic enterprise initiatives in their backlog could end up accelerating time to market and value, according to Sanchez-Reina, which is a key concern for their CEOs.\n\nCIOs in this leading cohort are also more optimistic about their role and enjoy it more. They are less likely to look for other jobs, he noted, and are more likely to recommend a CIO career as an option for friends or family."

Let\u2019s go!\n\nA little bird\n\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin\n\nLittle birds are continuing to give us updates on Fluid Truck, the startup founded to disrupt the commercial vehicle rental industry. You might recall last month Rebecca Bellan wrote about the dramatic behind-the-scenes fight over the company between ousted sibling co-founders James Eberhard and Jenifer Snyder and two minority investors on the board.\n\nIt seems there is a fresh complaint against the company for breach of contract, Bellan recently discovered after perusing new court filings.\n\nCalifornia company ServiceUp is alleging that Fluid Truck owes it close to $100,000, with interest accruing daily, after the company sent 150 invoices between January and July 2024 for arranging vehicle repairs. ServiceUp says Fluid\u2019s alleged breach of contract and refusal to pay has caused its own business to incur costs and expenses related to the services it performed under its agreement.\n\nGot a tip for us?

I was wrong.\n\nAther Energy, an Indian electric scooter manufacturer that competes with recently listed rival Ola Electric, plans to raise about $530 million in its initial public offering.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based startup is targeting a valuation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company said it will sell new shares worth $370 million in the IPO and up to 22 million shares from existing investors.\n\nIndia\u2019s electric vehicle market \u2014 largely made of two-wheelers \u2014 has been white-hot thanks to a combination of rising fuel prices and government incentives aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions. Still, the road isn\u2019t exactly smooth for Ather or others grappling for market share. Competition abounds!\n\nA couple of other notable deals \u2026\n\nCowboy, the Brussels-based company that designs and sells electric bikes, closed a small, strategic funding round of \u20ac5 million (around $5.5 million at current exchange rates). That includes \u20ac1 million in debt facilities. Cypress Capital led the round.\n\nDongchedi, the car information and trading app under TikTok parent company ByteDance, is raising as much as $600 million, Bloomberg reported. Joint investors include General Atlantic, HongShan, KKR & Co., and Gaorong Ventures.\n\nForterra, an autonomous vehicle developer formerly known as Robotic Research Autonomous Industries, raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by Moore Strategic Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital, and Hedosophia Venture Capital. New investor Standard Investments, along with existing backers Crescent Cove Advisors, Enlightenment Capital, and Four More Capital, also participated.\n\nSpecter, the Belgian manufacturer of e-bikes with powerful motors, raised \u20ac2 million ($2.2 million) in a round led by Fundracer Capital.\n\nTesla has discussed sharing revenue with another of Elon Musk\u2019s companies, AI startup xAI, in exchange for use of the startup\u2019s AI models, the WSJ reported. Musk has disputed the report and said Tesla doesn\u2019t need to license xAI models.\n\nThunder Power Holdings, an EV startup that went public on the Nasdaq exchange in June through a SPAC, is now trying to raise up to $100 million more through a share sale deal. That\u2019s not the eye-popping part. The fundraising effort is happening even as CEO Wellen Sham has been indicted by the Taiwanese government on 11 criminal charges.\n\nSpare, a Vancouver-based startup that developed a software-as-a-service product to help cities better serve disabled residents, raised $30 million (CA$42 million) in a Series B round led by Inovia Capital, with participation from Kensington Capital and Nicola Wealth.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nAutonomous vehicles\n\nNuro is pivoting. The startup, which has raised more than $2 billion, is moving away from its on-road autonomous delivery bots and will instead try to license its core autonomous vehicle tech to automakers and mobility providers like ride-hail and delivery companies. That means the Nuro R3 bot, which BYD was supposed to make, is dead. It also puts Nuro in direct competition with Mobileye and the buzzy startup Wayve.\n\nElectric vehicles, charging & batteries\n\nAmazon is experimenting with a delivery service that combines electric road and rail transport.\n\nAmber, the EV warranty startup founded last year, is starting to scale. The company is taking its aftermarket warranty product for Tesla vehicles to 47 states and rolling out a new remote diagnostic scan tool described as \u201ctelehealth for EVs.\u201d\n\nStellantis plans to invest more than $406 million in three Michigan facilities to support its \u201cmulti-energy strategy.\u201d Importantly, the Ram 1500 REV, the company\u2019s first electric light-duty truck and the range-extended all-new 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger will be built at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Michigan. The Ram 1500 EV is launching in late 2024.\n\nLucid Motors said its upcoming vehicle \u2014 dubbed Gravity \u2014 will have Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS) built right in, making an adapter unnecessary.\n\nA disabled Tesla Cybertruck became a fleeting tourist destination in Seattle.\n\nIn-car tech\n\nCariad, the VW software unit, is in trouble. Or I should state, in more trouble than usual. The Financial Times has a great report digging into the chaos at Cariad before and after a software-focused joint venture deal was struck between EV startup Rivian and Cariad parent company VW Group. One line item that made me gasp: Since launching Cariad four years ago, VW has invested almost 12 billion euros ($13.2 billion) into building in-house car software.\n\nSecurity\n\nAvis said thousands of car rental customers had personal data stolen in a cyberattack.\n\nTransport for London (TfL), the government body that runs the U.K. capital\u2019s transit system, is still dealing with a cyberattack. Although the transit system remains operational and unaffected by the cyber incident, some TfL online and digital customer services remain offline.\n\nThis week\u2019s wheels\n\nWhat is \u201cThis week\u2019s wheels\u201d? It\u2019s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we\u2019re testing, whether it\u2019s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle. Future vehicles include some e-bikes and the GMC Sierra EV."

        "article_content": "Sonos reportedly has partnered with online advertising company The Trade Desk on its as-yet unannounced (and almost certainly delayed) video streaming device, according to Janko Roettgers, who in his September 12 Lowpass newsletter cited \u201cmultiple sources with knowledge of the partnership.\u201d\n\nThe Trade Desk is a publicly traded company, currently valued at just over $50 billion, and describes itself as \u201cthe omnichannel advertising platform built for the open internet.\u201d In August, Roettgers reported that since 2019 the company has been building its own smart TV operating system to compete against Roku, Amazon, and Google. But that\u2019s something that The Trade Desk has denied, according to Digiday.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile there has been plenty of speculation that Sonos might be preparing to enter the streaming video arena \u2014 in part based on a 2023 Bloomberg report that claimed such a device was under development \u2014 little has been said about the software Sonos might use.\n\nSonos\u2019 current platform, which has faced enormous challenges since it released a poorly executed app update in May, is entirely oriented around music streaming. While Sonos does have soundbars \u2014 as do Amazon Fire TV and Roku \u2014 they\u2019re only meant for audio playback and don\u2019t have a traditional operating system in the same sense. Sonos has apps for iOS and Android (and that includes Fire OS), but it hasn\u2019t ever directly played in the space occupied by Roku, Google TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple\u2019s tvOS. The Sonos Ace headphones, released just after the software meltdown, were the company\u2019s first foray beyond the traditional speaker category. Sonos CEO Patrick Spence also said that two new products that were ready for release before the end of the year are shelved until the app and platform situations are rectified.\n\nRoettgers suggests that a partnership with a third-party like The Trade Desk would solve a number of problems simultaneously. If Sonos can license a pre-built platform, it would alleviate the need to develop one from scratch. Given its ongoing problems with the existing Sonos app and the tens of millions of dollars it\u2019s spending to fix it \u2014 plus recent layoffs \u201cfor long-term success\u201d \u2014 it likely has few resources to spare for other software initiatives.\n\nRoettgers notes that creating the necessary relationships with streaming giants like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO is no easy feat. The Trade Desk reportedly already has these relationships.\n\n\u201cThe company recently began selling ads for Netflix, and also counts major media companies like NBCUniversal, Fox and CBS among its partners,\u201d Roettgers wrote. \u201cThe Trade Desk has secured agreements with a number of major streaming services to participate on its platform, according to multiple sources.\u201d\n\nThe Trade Desk apparently is content to let Sonos have a lot of control over the look and feel of the software, which could be yet another reason why the two companies might partner on this project. Roettgers points out that streaming platforms owned by Roku, Google, and Amazon have strict licensing requirements that impact the interface, branding, and even remote control design of their licensee\u2019s devices."
