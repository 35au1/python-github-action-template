        "article_content": "DONALD Trump has been challenged to \"change history forever\" and come clean about UFO intel if he makes a stunning return to the White House this week.\n\nArizona-based expert Nick Pope says there is growing hope within the global UFO community that if Trump returns for a second term, he will push through an executive order to have several classified files released.\n\n5 Donald Trump, pictured on his golf course in Scotland in 2013, has been challenged to release any UFO secrets the government has Credit: Getty\n\n5 Recent whistleblower revelations suggested the White House created a special program to track UFO sightings called the Immaculate Constellation Credit: Getty\n\n5 UFO expert Nick Pope spoke about his hopes of finally seeing revelatory documents released that he believes could change history forever Credit: News Nation Now/On Balance with Leland Vittert\n\nHe also believes the recent whistleblower revelation that the US Government has created an \"active and highly secretive\" tracking program called the Immaculate Constellation could spark Trump's divulgation of critical information about the potential presence of other lifeforms.\n\nSECRET REVELATIONS\n\nQuizzed about his views on UFOs during his recent interview on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump said he was told \"a lot.\"\n\nPope, who used to work for a British Government department investigating the mysterious phenomenon that has enthralled believers for decades, is adamant the former president has been fully briefed and \"is being cautious about what to disclose.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a strong belief that the US government knows something concrete and might release it, particularly if Trump regains office,\" Pope excitedly told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Many see Trump as a disruptor and a populist, less beholden to the deep state or career bureaucrats. Unlike other politicians, he could potentially push for full disclosure.\"\n\nTrump has previously revealed, during an interview with his son, Donald Jr., that \"he knows a few things\" but had to be careful with the information.\n\nPope believes Trump is also determined to release the JFK files, which have similarly been shrouded in secrecy as the conspiracy theories over the infamous 1963 assassination continue to swirl.\n\n\"He\u2019s already promised total transparency on JFK if re-elected, so it\u2019s reasonable to think he might do the same with UFOs,\" the expert continued.\n\n\"SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS\"\n\nA whistleblower linked to the Immaculate Constellation case, described as \"a current or former US government official,\" has allegedly written a report with significant claims.\n\nIt alleges that the US executive branch has been addressing issues related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and non-human intelligence (NHI) without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization.\n\nWill Trump or Harris FINALLY reveal the truth about America\u2019s alien secrets? UFO expert says one candidate will tell all\n\nThis situation, the report claims, may have persisted for decades.\n\nThere are also detailed descriptions of several UFO encounters logged in a government database.\n\nOne incident involved an F-22 fighter jet being \"intercepted and boxed in\" by a group of three to six spherical objects, which ultimately forced the jet to leave its mission area.\n\nIn another reported encounter, the crew aboard a Navy aircraft carrier observed a sphere glowing orange-red with a surface that seemed to be \u201croiling like the sun.\u201d\n\nThis object descended rapidly from a high altitude, stopping to hover approximately 100-200 yards (90-180 meters) above the flight deck.\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger claimed he had communicated with the alleged whistleblower.\n\nHowever, identifying information, such as the exact role and gender, was being withheld to protect them from retaliation.\n\nFRESH HOPES\n\nIf Trump does indeed defeat Kamala Harris and return to the Washington DC hot seat, Pope is hoping access will be granted for \"clearer, longer videos of UFO sightings\" as well as underwater tracking data, which insiders believe is also present.\n\nFootage from military surveillance systems could also be released.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot we haven\u2019t seen from the military\u2019s surveillance systems,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"For example, the recent Chinese spy balloon was followed by other ambiguous shoot-downs, yet the government cited national security concerns as reasons for not releasing clear images.\n\n\"But soon after, they released clear photos of a Russian aircraft near a U.S. drone. This kind of inconsistency frustrates the UFO community, and we expect that a new administration might change this stance.\"\n\nAllan Lichtman's 2024 presidential election prediction Renowned historian Allan Lichtman has accurately predicted the outcomes of presidential elections since 1984 using his 13 Keys to the White House algorithm. In 2016, he was one of the few scholars who correctly predicted a Trump win. This year, has revealed who he thinks will be inaugurated as the 47th president in January next year based on his system of true and false statements. If six or more statements go against the White House party, they are projected to lose the presidential election. Midterm elections: The Democrats suffered losses in the 2022 House elections, meaning the key turns false. (Harris 0-1 Trump) There is no primary contest: This key turns in favor of Harris because the Democrats got \"smart\" and rallied behind the vice president after Joe Biden ended his campaign, according to Lichtman. (Harris 1-1 Trump) The sitting president is seeking another term: This turns false because Biden suspended his re-election campaign. (Harris 1-2 Trump) There is no third-party challenger: This statement is true because third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. needed to poll at 10% nationally, according to Lichtman. (Harris 2-2 Trump) The short-term economy is strong: This key goes in favor of the White House Party. (Harris 3-2 Trump) The long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms: This key also swings toward Harris. (Harris 4-2 Trump) The White House Party has made major national policy changes: This key is also true, according to Lichtman's theory. (Harris 5-2 Trump) There is sustained social unrest during the term: College campus demonstrations have erupted in reaction to the Gaza conflict, but no protests have broken out that threaten the fabric of society. This means the key goes in Harris' column. (Harris 6-2 Trump) The White House is untainted by scandal: Despite House Republican efforts to impeach Joe Biden, they have been unable to pin a scandal on him. (Harris 7-2 Trump) The incumbent is charismatic: Harris is not considered a Ronald Reagan or Franklin D. Roosevelt-like figure so the key is false. (Harris 7-3 Trump) The challenger is uncharismatic: This key goes in favor of the White House party - even though Trump is a showman. (Harris 8-3 Trump) Lichtman warned that the two foreign policy keys - whether there has been a major success or no failure - could flip either way. But, even if both statements flipped against Harris, Trump would not have enough keys in his column to win the election.\n\nInterest in possible extraterrestrial activity from political parties isn't new.\n\nMarco Rubio and Tim Burchett have pushed for transparency in the past, while Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Coretz and Kirsten Gillibrand have also voiced interest.\n\nUFO fanatic Robert Bigelow has donated millions to Republican campaigns over the years.\n\nHISTORY CHANGER\n\nPope, however, believes a maverick like Trump \"could make a real change\" and push ahead with some seriously stunning revelations.\n\n\"Some feel he\u2019s polarizing, but still hope he might follow through on disclosure promises,\" the expert admitted.\n\n\"People would remember where they were when it happened, much like they remember moments associated with JFK,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"And if there\u2019s a backstory, such as humanity\u2019s origins being linked to extraterrestrials, it could fundamentally alter worldviews, even presenting darker possibilities\u2014that Earth might be a science experiment, prison, or farm, theories that would undoubtedly provoke significant shifts in understanding.\n\n\"The President who discloses alien existence would change history forever.\"\n\n5 UFO expert Nick Pope told The U.S. Sun he believes Trump is a \"disruptor\" who will come clean about what the government knows about UFOs Credit: Getty"

It made a worldwide collection of Rs 16,000 crore. Later a giant production house invested 200,00 USD despite that actors were paid good enough. Here's why.\n\nA film is declared a blockbuster based on its box office collection. Specific earnings set up a range which later declares the film as a flop, no loss-no profit, superhit, and lastly blockbuster. Today we are talking about one such film which is considered the world\u2019s most profitable film and it\u2019s not Titanic, Avatar, or even Avengers Endgame. Can you guess which film are we talking about?\n\nWorld\u2019s most profitable film was made with $15,000\n\nA film released back in 2007 is the world\u2019s most profitable film. In terms of budget, this film was allocated Rs 12 lakh (15,000 USD). We are talking about the film Paranormal Activity. Director Oren Peli decided to make low-budget horror films by using mobile cameras and new faces in the industry. The director\u2019s approach to the film was very simple, he did not use any big cameras with lighting instead he opted for a handheld camera to shoot the sequence. However, when it came to actors Oren Peli hired actors certified by SAG on a minimum wage basis.\n\nYou will be shocked to know that Paranormal Activity had a lot of improvisations. The film didn\u2019t necessarily follow the script given by Oren Peli. Talking about CGI, the filmmaker used practical effects to bring life to horror sequences. Paranormal Activity was made with a mere budget of 15,000 USD. Later production house, Paramount Pictures invested a whopping 200,00 USD (approx Rs 16 crore) for post-production and marketing of the film.\n\nWatch the Paranormal Activity trailer:\n\nParanormal Activity lifetime collection\n\nThe film premiered in theatres in September 2009 and it was loved by the audience. The film made a business of 194.2 million USD (approx Rs 16,000 crore). The film was loved by the audience due to the fresh context, raw footage, storyline, and paranormal sequences. Paranormal Activity turned out to be a massive success globally. The film alone made a profit of 1300000%. The film was later turned into a franchise where two more sequels were released which added another 600 million USD to their profit.\n\nWhy Paranormal Activity actors were paid less\n\nFilm director, Oren Peli starred two new actors due to a shortage in budget. He starred Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, who were struggling to get any hold of contracts at that time. Later on, Oren hired the two actors for minimum pay, and they ended up earning 500 USD for their casting.\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Each investigator hails from a different part of Texas but shares a profound curiosity for the paranormal.\n\nAngela Kaatz, is the CEO of the group, she says she can feel and hear spirits.

Growing up in a haunted house, Angela and her daughter have shared multiple eerie encounters, including the sighting of a mysterious woman in a white robe.\n\nIssa Medina, from Manvel, Texas, grew up in a family that strongly believes in the supernatural. Her paranormal journey began early, with sightings of shadow figures that led her family to bless their home.

One of her most chilling experiences happened at La Carafe, a historic bar in Houston where she and her team members heard children\u2019s whispers and saw doors mysteriously close.\n\nRounding out the team is Lisa Gallo Roth, a skeptic from Galveston who now lives in Clearlake. Lisa remains cautious but intrigued by the paranormal. Her most notable experience came at the New Orleans Pharmacy Museum, where she encountered a setting she had seen only in recurring dreams.\n\nArmed with high-tech paranormal devices such as EMF meters, REM pods, spirit music boxes, and the light-sensitive Boo Bear, The Ghost Hunting Beauties delve into each investigation with both excitement and a hint of trepidation. They encounter both friendly and less-welcoming spirits, sharing their findings on their popular YouTube channel and partnering with professional paranormal experts to deepen their investigations.\n\nThis team continues to bring haunted Texas history to life with every investigation, reminding viewers that, in some places, the past is very much alive."

It\u2019s difficult to understand how these black holes were able to grow so big so rapidly. But with the discovery of a low-mass supermassive black hole feasting on material at an extreme rate, seen just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, astronomers now have valuable new insights into the mechanisms of rapidly growing black holes in the early Universe.\n\nLID-568 was discovered by a cross-institutional team of astronomers led by International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer Hyewon Suh. They used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe a sample of galaxies from the Chandra X-ray Observatory\u2019s COSMOS legacy survey. This population of galaxies is very bright in the X-ray part of the spectrum, but are invisible in the optical and near-infrared. JWST\u2019s unique infrared sensitivity allows it to detect these faint counterpart emissions.\n\nLID-568 stood out within the sample for its intense X-ray emission, but its exact position could not be determined from the X-ray observations alone, raising concerns about properly centering the target in JWST\u2019s field of view. So, rather than using traditional slit spectroscopy, JWST\u2019s instrumentation support scientists suggested that Suh\u2019s team use the integral field spectrograph on JWST\u2019s NIRSpec. This instrument can get a spectrum for each pixel in the instrument\u2019s field of view rather than being limited to a narrow slice.\n\n\u201cOwing to its faint nature, the detection of LID-568 would be impossible without JWST. Using the integral field spectrograph was innovative and necessary for getting our observation,\u201d says Emanuele Farina, International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer and co-author of the paper appearing in Nature Astronomy.\n\nJWST\u2019s NIRSpec allowed the team to get a full view of their target and its surrounding region, leading to the unexpected discovery of powerful outflows of gas around the central black hole. The speed and size of these outflows led the team to infer that a substantial fraction of the mass growth of LID-568 may have occurred in a single episode of rapid accretion. \u201cThis serendipitous result added a new dimension to our understanding of the system and opened up exciting avenues for investigation,\u201d says Suh.\n\nIn a stunning discovery, Suh and her team found that LID-568 appears to be feeding on matter at a rate 40 times its Eddington limit. This limit relates to the maximum luminosity that a black hole can achieve, as well as how fast it can absorb matter, such that its inward gravitational force and outward pressure generated from the heat of the compressed, infalling matter remain in balance. When LID-568\u2019s luminosity was calculated to be so much higher than theoretically possible, the team knew they had something remarkable in their data.\n\n\u201cThis black hole is having a feast,\u201d says International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer and co-author Julia Scharw\u00e4chter. \u201cThis extreme case shows that a fast-feeding mechanism above the Eddington limit is one of the possible explanations for why we see these very heavy black holes so early in the Universe.\u201d\n\nThese results provide new insights into the formation of supermassive black holes from smaller black hole \u2018seeds\u2019, which current theories suggest arise either from the death of the Universe\u2019s first stars (light seeds) or the direct collapse of gas clouds (heavy seeds). Until now, these theories lacked observational confirmation. \u201cThe discovery of a super-Eddington accreting black hole suggests that a significant portion of mass growth can occur during a single episode of rapid feeding, regardless of whether the black hole originated from a light or heavy seed,\u201d says Suh.\n\nThe discovery of LID-568 also shows that it\u2019s possible for a black hole to exceed its Eddington limit, and provides the first opportunity for astronomers to study how this happens. It\u2019s possible that the powerful outflows observed in LID-568 may be acting as a release valve for the excess energy generated by the extreme accretion, preventing the system from becoming too unstable. To further investigate the mechanisms at play, the team is planning follow-up observations with JWST.\n\nMore information\n\nThis research was presented in a paper entitled \u201cA super-Eddington-accreting black hole ~1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang observed with JWST\u201d to appear in Nature Astronomy.

        "article_content": "A handful of microbes have put global health on the ropes. They are the superbugs, considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one of the 10 main threats to public health and responsible for 1.27 million deaths a year. The WHO is specifically targeting 15 microorganisms considered \u201chighly dangerous\u201d due to their resistance to the arsenal of available antibiotics and their ability to spread or transmit resistance to other bacteria. Sworn enemies include, for example, resistant Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, among others. Regarding the latter, research published on Thursday in the journal Science has delved into their mechanisms for escaping antimicrobials and has discovered that, in order to be highly resistant, these microbes adopt a double defense.\n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) alone causes around 120,000 deaths a year worldwide. It is \u201ca serious global threat,\u201d explains Simon Foster, a researcher at the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom) and author of the study, which reveals a new defense mechanism for this bacteria. Methicillin was the antibiotic traditionally used against this microbe, but due to the appearance of MRSA and the toxicity of the drug itself, Foster explains, it was no longer being used. The problem is that methicillin belongs to a broader family of antibiotics, beta-lactams, and MRSA has become resistant to almost all of them. \u201cMRSA can sometimes be treated with other antibiotics, such as linezolid or tetracycline. However, for serious infections, such as bacteremia or endocarditis, daptomycin or vancomycin must be used. The problem is that resistance has developed against each of them,\u201d explains the expert.\n\nThe scientific community has long since discovered that MRSA had a peculiarity: it had acquired a gene that encodes a component called MecA, which helps form the bacteria\u2019s cell walls so that it can grow and divide. This genomic peculiarity makes it resistant, but researchers knew that this characteristic alone was not enough to be highly resistant. \u201cIt was also known that there are other small changes that occur in bacteria that allow a big jump in the level of resistance,\u201d Foster adds in an email response. Scientists thought that these small genetic changes, called \u201cenhancers\u201d in scientific jargon, allowed MecA to work better.\n\nHowever, the University of Sheffield researcher explains, his new discovery has turned the initial assumptions on its head and has revealed that these enhancers \u201care not related to the activity of MecA, but are part of another mechanism necessary for high-level resistance.\u201d Specifically, the authors discovered that MRSA adopts an alternative mode of cell division in the presence of antimicrobials to ensure its survival. \u201cBy using the newly discovered mechanism, bacteria divide in a different way that does not require a key activity that is normally needed for them to divide and multiply,\u201d says the researcher.\n\nThese two defense mechanisms are synergistic: \u201cBoth are necessary for high-level methicillin resistance. MecA needs to be resistant at a low level, about 10 times more than a sensitive strain, and potentiation needs to be resistant at a high level, about 1,000 times more than a sensitive strain. Potentiation alone does not make them resistant,\u201d says Foster.\n\nAccording to the authors, their discovery opens the door to finding new therapeutic strategies to fight antibiotic resistance. Foster argues that the discovery of this new division mechanism, hitherto unknown, is important on two levels: \u201cFirstly, it has been shown that these bacteria have the ability to divide in a way that was previously unknown, which sheds light on the mechanisms that sustain the life of this organism. Secondly, it shows that the development of resistance is more complex than we had previously imagined and uses the newly discovered pathway, which has important ramifications for the development of new treatments to control MRSA.\u201d The scientist assures that there are already compounds to which this resistant bacteria is vulnerable, and the activity in each of its two defense systems could be mapped to find other new treatments.\n\nA worrying pathogen\n\nBruno Gonz\u00e1lez-Zorn, director of the Antimicrobial Resistance Unit at the Complutense University of Madrid and advisor to the WHO in this field, stresses that MRSA is one of the pathogens \u201cthat causes the most mortality and the most concern at the hospital level\u201d and any advance in the knowledge of the biology of the resistance it generates, such as this research, is important: \u201cIt is an article on fundamental biology where it describes that MRSA acquires a gene that confers resistance. But one in every 10,000 of these manages to have a very high resistance and, until now, it was not known what made it highly resistant because that gene alone was insufficient. The new discovery will not have an immediate clinical implication, but it does open the door to designing molecules to inhibit that high level of resistance,\u201d reflects the microbiologist, who has not participated in this research.\n\nMar\u00eda del Mar Tom\u00e1s, a microbiologist at the A Coru\u00f1a University Hospital Complex and spokesperson for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), has a similar opinion: \u201cIt is extremely interesting. Many investigations have focused on the classic resistance mechanisms, those that act on antibiotics, but this study looks at the tolerance and stress mechanisms of the bacteria, which can also influence resistance.\u201d Tom\u00e1s points out that Foster\u2019s research, in which she did not participate, finds \u201cthe perfect link\u201d to explain the high resistance of MRSA to antibiotics: \u201cIt is a mechanism that combines the union of MecA with a mutation in enhancer genes related to cell division: the bacteria grows in a different, abnormal and disordered way, but it manages to stop the antibiotic from acting.\u201d\n\nThe research published in Science also raises new questions, Foster admits. For example, whether MRSA may have other hidden mechanisms to evade antibiotics: \u201cOur discovery of this new mechanism using an alternative division strategy demonstrates how little we know. We are currently working to elucidate the basis of the alternative division mode and how enhancers actually work to promote resistance. This allows us to discover a whole range of cellular capabilities that we can now explore. There is always more to discover and understand,\u201d the scientist says.\n\nAnother question is whether these same defense pathways are replicated in other resistant bacteria. For now, Foster says, enhancers are associated with resistance to other types of antibiotics and have been found in other bacteria. \u201cWe are working to determine whether there is a common thread between bacteria and whether this mechanism is more frequent than we had previously suggested,\u201d he says.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

Companies like HubSpot, founded in 2006, transformed the marketing landscape with its innovative inbound marketing software. Its success showcases the potential of Boston\u2019s unique ecosystem.\n\nAnother notable example is Drift, a conversational marketing platform that emerged from the city\u2019s tech scene.

Each company adds to a narrative rich with creativity and resilience while inspiring future founders to pursue their dreams amidst challenges.\n\nChallenges Faced by the Startup Community in Boston\n\nThe startup community in Boston, while thriving, faces notable challenges. One significant hurdle is the high cost of living. Founders and employees often grapple with steep housing prices, making it difficult to attract and retain talent.\n\nDiversity remains another pressing issue. The lack of inclusivity can stifle innovation and limit perspectives within startups. Many entrepreneurs feel that a richer mix of backgrounds could lead to more groundbreaking ideas.\n\nBoston also competes fiercely with Silicon Valley for resources and attention. This rivalry creates pressure on local startups to perform at an exceptionally high level just to stay relevant.\n\nNavigating these challenges requires resilience from the entrepreneurial ecosystem. As founders adapt, they may find innovative solutions that not only benefit their companies but also enhance the overall landscape of Boston\u2019s startup culture.\n\n\u2013 High Cost of Living\n\nBoston\u2019s high cost of living presents a significant hurdle for startups and their teams. Housing prices have soared, making it challenging for entrepreneurs to attract talent without offering competitive salaries.\n\nThe expense doesn\u2019t stop at rent or mortgages. Basic necessities like groceries, transportation, and utilities also come with hefty price tags. This financial strain can pressure budding companies that are still in their early stages.\n\nMany young professionals find themselves juggling multiple jobs just to make ends meet while pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams. The reality is that the vibrant startup culture can sometimes feel inaccessible due to these economic barriers.\n\nAs founders seek innovative solutions, they must navigate this landscape wisely. It\u2019s a balancing act between fostering growth and managing expenses in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Limited Diversity and Inclusivity\n\nDespite its vibrant ecosystem, Boston\u2019s startup culture faces challenges with diversity and inclusivity. The tech scene often mirrors the demographics of its surrounding areas, which can lead to a homogeneous environment.\n\nMany founders come from similar educational backgrounds and networks. This lack of varied perspectives can stifle creativity and innovation within startups.\n\nEfforts are being made to change this narrative, but progress is slow. Underrepresented groups still find it difficult to secure funding or mentorship opportunities in comparison to their counterparts.\n\nInitiatives aimed at fostering inclusivity exist, yet they need broader support from established businesses and investors. A shift towards embracing diverse talent could unlock new ideas and drive growth for all involved in the startup community.\n\n\u2013 Competition with Silicon Valley\n\nSilicon Valley often casts a long shadow over other startup ecosystems, and Boston is no exception. The tech giants of the West Coast have set high expectations for innovation and growth. This creates both inspiration and pressure for local startups.\n\nBoston\u2019s entrepreneurs frequently find themselves comparing their journeys to those in Silicon Valley. The allure of massive funding rounds and rapid scaling can be daunting. Yet, this competition drives Boston\u2019s startups to refine their ideas and focus on sustainable growth.\n\nWhile some may see it as a disadvantage, many embrace the challenge. It fosters creativity that differentiates Boston from its competitors. Startups here tend to emphasize quality over quantity, fostering deeper connections with customers.\n\nThis rivalry also encourages collaboration among local businesses looking to carve out their niche in the market. Instead of merely competing with Silicon Valley, Boston aims to complement it through unique innovations tailored for specific industries like healthcare and biotech.\n\nHow Boston\u2019s Startup Culture Impacts the City and its Economy\n\nBoston\u2019s startup culture significantly influences both the city and its economy. The influx of innovative companies fosters job creation, providing opportunities for residents across various skill levels.\n\nAs startups flourish, they attract talent from around the globe. This influx enriches the local workforce and stimulates diverse industries. A vibrant ecosystem emerges where established firms collaborate with newcomers, nurturing creativity and knowledge sharing.\n\nMoreover, successful startups often reinvest in their communities. They support local schools, nonprofits, and infrastructure projects through philanthropic efforts.\n\nThe economic ripple effect is undeniable; increased business activity enhances tax revenues that fund crucial public services and community development initiatives.\n\nThis dynamic also draws significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on Boston\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, further fueling growth in technology sectors like biotech and software development.\n\nThe Future of Boston\u2019s Startup Scene\n\nBoston\u2019s startup scene is poised for exciting growth. The blend of innovation, education, and investment creates fertile ground for new ideas.

Although it\u2019s not the update people have been waiting for, it\u2019s still important.\n\nAccording to SamMobile, a new software update is being rolled out for the carrier-locked versions of the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra. The firmware version for this update is S92xUSQS4AXJA, and it includes the November 2024 security patch. This update addresses multiple security vulnerabilities, but does not introduce any new features. Instead, it resolves dozens of security issues identified in the previous software version.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLast week, Samsung released the same update for the Galaxy Tab S7 FE.\n\nAlthough the new security update is important, users have been patiently waiting for the next release, One UI 7. This update, based on Android 15, will offer a refreshed design and enhanced features for Galaxy devices. It includes several redesigned icons and a new camera user interface.\n\nOne UI 7 includes modifications such as a pill for system apps on the home screen, reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island. However, unlike Apple, which places its similar feature at the top center of the screen, Samsung\u2019s Dynamic Island will be located on the left side of the notification area.\n\nOnce expected to arrive earlier this year, One UI 7 might not launch until early next year. According to reliable tipster Ice Universe, Samsung is expected to release the first One UI 7 beta to testers in the coming weeks. Although many anticipated this launch in July, it has been delayed by several months.\n\nTo check for the new security update on your Galaxy S24 series device, go to Settings and then navigate to Software Update."

        "article_content": "Since we performance tested the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor in the GT 7 Pro smartphone, Realme has insisted it has a fix coming for what it described as a \u201csoftware compatibility\u201d problem, which was causing the phone to overheat before it could complete a 20-minute gaming benchmark test.\n\nToday, a software update containing the fix was delivered to our review model, with the promise it would solve the issue. Sure enough, after running the Solar Bay Stress Test \u2014 a 20-minute program that emulates gameplay with ray-traced graphics \u2014 in the 3DMark benchmark app, the Realme GT 7 Pro did indeed successfully complete it, giving us the performance figures we were missing during our initial comparison with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nStill running hot\n\nHowever, this is not where the story ends. If Realme\u2019s intention was to fix it so the GT 7 Pro could complete a 3DMark stress test, then its mission is complete. I\u2019ve run all the available 20-minute stress tests in the app, and it has not failed so far. But what\u2019s also clear is the phone still gets very hot during the process, and although it\u2019s not giving up at the last moment \u2014 it previously failed after around 17 to 19 of the 20 total loops in the test \u2014 I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s right on the edge of doing so. This is also in an environment where the ambient temperature is quite low, and in hotter climates, it will likely fare worse. It gets hot during all the tests, but it\u2019s the Solar Bay Stress Test that taxes it the most.\n\nEven by loop 11, I consider the GT 7 Pro too hot to comfortably hold, especially along the chassis edges, and this is with the performance-enhancing GT Mode active. I certainly would not consider putting it against my cheeks to assess the temperature. The heat generated is reflected in the benchmarking app, which shows a temperature increase from 27 degrees Celsius to a toasty 45 degrees Celsius over the course of the Solar Bay Stress Test. By comparison, the Galaxy S24 Ultra reaches 42 degrees Celsius during the same test, with the phone nowhere near as hot and still comfortable to hold.\n\nThere\u2019s further evidence the test is putting considerable strain on the phone, with the full Solar Bay Stress Test taking 15% from the Realme GT 7 Pro\u2019s battery and 12% from the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I\u2019ll reiterate that these extreme benchmarking tests do not reflect general use and instead show how a phone and processor perform during extended gameplay sessions, primarily when playing the latest graphically intensive games like Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail. We run these tests on most phones we review, though, and it\u2019s very rare for a phone to fail to complete the test or get as hot as the Realme GT 7 Pro.\n\nWhat does this mean for the chip?\n\nWhat does all this mean? It\u2019s still difficult to say how much of the fault lies with Realme, the phone and its software, or the Snapdragon 8 Elite for the heat generation. But as Realme\u2019s software update hasn\u2019t cured or noticeably lessened the heat buildup, just made it possible for the benchmark test to finish, it is becoming more likely the incredibly powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite may get hotter than older chips in certain circumstances.\n\nWe contacted Qualcomm for comment and received the following statement from a Qualcomm spokesperson:\n\n\u201cThe Snapdragon 8 Elite isn\u2019t the cause of the overheating issue experienced by the Realme GT7 Pro early device samples, seeded to select press. Realme has identified the cause as a software compatibility issue with 3D Mark and is actively working on a resolution. Snapdragon Mobile Platforms continue to deliver exceptional user experiences, and we\u2019re excited for consumers to enjoy the upcoming commercial devices powered by our technology.\u201d\n\nThe Realme GT 7 Pro is the only smartphone we\u2019ve tried with the Snapdragon 8 Elite inside, but others are expected soon, including the Asus ROG Phone 9 and the OnePlus 13. When these, and others, hit the scene, we\u2019ll have a better idea of what\u2019s going on with the processor expected to power most of 2025\u2019s top Android phones, or whether Realme\u2019s recent, otherwise very positive return has stumbled."
