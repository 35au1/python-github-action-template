        "article_content": "Q: We are seeking records on UFOs, and were told to try the Freedom of Information Act. First question, can you explain the Freedom of Information Act? Then, how do we go about requesting records?\n\nJ.V., Glendale\n\nA: The Freedom of Information Act (abbreviated as FOIA) provides you with the right to request access to records of the executive branch of the United States government. The records are to be provided, unless they are subject to certain exemptions whose purpose is to protect disclosure deemed harmful to: (a) national security, (b) privacy of individuals, (c) proprietary business information (such as trade secrets), (d) the actual functioning of our government, and/or (e) other interests that are deemed of significant importance. The exemptions are real, but FOIA requests often are productive.\n\nThe act dates from 1967 and took many years to become law. The objective is to make our government more transparent. As to UFOs (which the government now refers to as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d), federal agencies have been required this year to organize and tag documents. Congress has expressed clear interest in determining what agencies know about UFOs. Thus, the agencies are to disclose their information by the end of this fiscal year. The records are also to be housed at the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nHere, then, is an outline of a FOIA request you can consider: Using letterhead, set forth the date you are sending it; then list the name and address of the executive agency where the request is being sent; then \u201cRE: FOIA REQUEST\u201d; followed by \u201cDear Sir or Madam: This is an authorized request to you under the Freedom of Information Act. Please provide the following records to the undersigned on a timely basis. \u2026\u201d Here, clearly set forth the records sought, describing them, if possible, by year(s), name of the party or parties involved, and/or the circumstances or events in focus. Then close the FOIA request with a sign off.\n\nNote that some agencies have instructions on where a FOIA request is to be sent (you can look for that online, or call to inquire). While it is not required that the FOIA request be transmitted by certified mail/return receipt requested, doing so is one way to seek to show that you not only sent it, but that it was received. The agency is required to respond within 20 working days (excluding weekends and legal holidays).\n\nQ: There was a local incident that at first was well reported. An older person was run over by a hit-and-run driver. We think they have since found the identity of the driver, who may be a local official, but there is radio silence. Our neighbor suggests we try a Public Records Act request. Can you give us some guidance on that?\n\nM.B., (location withheld)\n\nRelated Articles News | Am I liable for a slip and fall at a bowling alley?

Ask the lawyer A: The Public Records Act is found at California Government Code Sections 6250 through 6277. The act gives you, as a member of the public, the right to request information from California governmental agencies, which includes both state and local/municipal governments. In some instances, you may be able to learn online or by phone where to send the request, depending on which agency the request is going to (such as, the police department, highway patrol, zoning commission, district attorney\u2019s office or mayor\u2019s office, among others). As with a FOIA request, be specific about what you are seeking, and to whom and where the records are to be sent. The agency has 10 calendar days to respond to you, but may indicate it needs more time to locate, review and produce the records (which can mean a 14-day extension for \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d).\n\nAs with a FOIA request, some records may be deemed confidential or otherwise off-limits.\n\nA Public Records Act request, however, should not be costly or time consuming. It is the law, and compliance is expected to the extent authorized and permissible. I cannot say the request will unveil what you are looking for, and records you get may have redactions (which the agency can seek to justify), but, as they say, \u201cnothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d\n\nRon Sokol has been a practicing attorney for over 40 years, and has also served many times as a judge pro tem, mediator, and arbitrator. It is important to keep in mind that this column presents a summary of the law, and is not to be treated or considered legal advice, let alone a substitute for actual consultation with a qualified professional."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous week for OpenAI, full of executive departures and major fundraising developments, but the startup is back at it, trying to convince developers to build tools with its AI models at its 2024 DevDay. The company announced several new tools Tuesday, including a public beta of its \u201cRealtime API\u201d, for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. It\u2019s not quite ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, but it\u2019s close.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said the recent departures of chief technology officer Mira Murati and chief research officer Bob McGrew would not affect the company\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with saying Bob and Mira have been awesome leaders. I\u2019ve learned a lot from them, and they are a huge part of getting us to where we are today,\u201d said Weil. \u201cAnd also, we\u2019re not going to slow down.\u201d\n\nAs OpenAI undergoes yet another C-suite overhaul \u2013 a reminder of the turmoil following last year\u2019s DevDay \u2013 the company is trying to convince developers that it still offers the best platform to build AI apps on. Leaders say the startup has more than 3 million developers building with its AI models, but OpenAI is operating in an increasingly competitive space.\n\nOpenAI noted it had cut costs for developers to access its API by 99% in the last two years, though it was likely forced to by competitors such as Meta and Google continuously undercutting their prices.\n\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s new features, dubbed the Realtime API, will give developers the chance to build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can\u2019t use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. (The voice ambiguously based on Scarlett Johansson\u2019s is not available anywhere.)\n\nDuring the briefing, OpenAI\u2019s head of developer experience, Romain Huet, shared a demo of a trip planning app built with the Realtime API. The application allowed users to verbally speak with an AI assistant about an upcoming trip to London, and get low-latency responses. The Realtime API also has access to a number of tools, so the app was able to annotate a map with restaurant locations as it answered.\n\nAt another point, Huet showed how the Realtime API could speak on the phone with a human to inquire about ordering food for an event. Unlike Google\u2019s infamous Duo, OpenAI\u2019s API can\u2019t call restaurants or shops directly; however, it can integrate with calling APIs like Twilio to do so. Notably, OpenAI is not adding disclosures so that its AI models automatically identify themselves on calls like this, despite the fact that these AI-generated voices sounds quite realistic. For now, it seems to be the developers\u2019 responsibility to add this disclosure, something that could be required by a new California law.\n\nAs part of its DevDay announcements, OpenAI also introduced vision fine-tuning in its API, which will let developers use images, as well as text, to fine-tune their applications of GPT-4o. This should, in theory, help developers improve the performance of GPT-4o for tasks involving visual understanding. OpenAI\u2019s head of product API, Olivier Godement, tells TechCrunch that developers will not be able to upload copyrighted imagery (such as a picture of Donald Duck), images that depict violence, or other imagery that violates OpenAI\u2019s safety policies.\n\nOpenAI is racing to match what its competitors in the AI model licensing space already offer. Its prompt caching feature is similar to the feature Anthropic launched several months agoallowing developers to cache frequently used context between API calls, reducing costs and improve latency. OpenAI says developers can save 50% using this feature, whereas Anthropic promises a 90% discount for it.\n\nLastly, OpenAI is offering a model distillation feature to let developers use larger AI models, such as o1-preview and GPT-4o, to fine-tune smaller models such as GPT-4o mini. Running smaller models generally provides cost savings compared to running larger ones, but this feature should let developers improve the performance of those small AI models. As part of model distillation, OpenAI is launching a beta evaluation tool so developers can measure their fine-tune\u2019s performance within OpenAI\u2019s API.\n\nDevDay may make bigger waves for what it didn\u2019t announce. For instance, there wasn\u2019t any news about the GPT Store announced during last year\u2019s DevDay. Last we\u2019ve heard, OpenAI has been piloting a revenue share program with some of the most popular creators of GPTs, but the company hasn\u2019t shared much since then.\n\nAlso, OpenAI says it\u2019s not releasing any new AI models during DevDay this year. Developers waiting for OpenAI o1 (not the preview or mini version) or the startup\u2019s video generation model, Sora, will have to wait a little longer."

That news isn\u2019t just landing on the hardware front, though, and Google\u2019s also got a whole mess of announcements to make about features landing across the Chromebook lineup \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t you guess it, but there\u2019s a heaping load of AI involved.\n\nFor starters, Google tells us, you can now chat with Gemini right from the shelf of any Chromebook model, Plus or not. You\u2019ll also find a new Welcome Recap screen greeting you when you first open up your laptop, reminding you of what you were working on earlier and giving you some tips for what to start with now. And for stuff you\u2019re frequently working with, and don\u2019t want to lose track of, you can easily pin files to your Chromebook\u2019s shelf.\n\nChromebook Plus models are getting a few upgrades beyond what the rest of the lineup will see, including AI-powered Live Translate for basically anything you\u2019re watching on your Chromebook screen. If you\u2019re looking to capture a conversation, the new Recorder app will offer automatic transcriptions, complete with speaker labels and summaries. And speaking of audio, Google\u2019s implementing some AI-based microphone simulation models to offer the highest possible fidelity on all your video calls. There are even some tweaks to boost camera performance, and neither of these upgrades will be restricted to Meet, and should offer enhanced performance across the board.\n\nLanh Nguyen / Android Authority\n\nThis new Chromebook Plus stuff should start arriving as updates hitting your Chromebook across the month of October \u2014 don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t see it land immediately, nor all at once. There\u2019s also the summary \u201cHelp me read\u201d feature for PDFs and websites that will start deploying in the weeks to come, and is already set to get a big update next year, letting you specify passages that require more detailed explanation.\n\nFinally, if any of this new functionality gets you feeling particularly excited about the power of AI (and we\u2019re betting Google hopes it might), the company is extending its offer for three free months of Google One AI Premium to all new Chromebook purchases.\n\nGot a tip?

        "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 ChatGPT maker OpenAI will allow any app developer to add snappy and humanlike voice interaction to their products, a move that could greatly increase the number of people interacting with a slick and sometimes provocative new generation of artificial intelligence technology. OpenAI\u2019s \u201cadvanced voice mode,\u201d which offers six AI voices that sound casual and expressive, with the ability to detect and react to different human vocal tones, has been available to ChatGPT subscribers since July. The technology will now be offered to the thousands of companies that pay to use OpenAI technology in their own products \u2014 and any new developer who signs up.\n\nOpening more of its AI inventions to outsiders could help grow OpenAI\u2019s revenue from usage fees it charges each time an app taps its technology. Increasing that income is crucial to the company, which is seeking billions of dollars in new funding and considering restructuring to remove its business from the control of its existing nonprofit board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced it was opening access to its voice technology at an event in San Francisco for software developers. At a news briefing ahead of the event, OpenAI executives showed how an app built on its voice technology could make a phone call to a business and place an order for chocolate strawberries.\n\nThe business was not real and the person who took down the order and asked questions that the AI voice nimbly responded to was an OpenAI executive role-playing, but app developers will be able to deploy that capability immediately, the executives said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it possible to interact with AI in all of the ways you interact with a human being,\u201d OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said at the press briefing.\n\nFully achieving that goal would be challenging with existing AI technology, which often makes mistakes. But if app developers rush to build on OpenAI\u2019s voice algorithms, many more people could soon be using or exposed to automated systems that capably mimic people in some scenarios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRealistic voice synthesis technology has already been used in some call centers, but if OpenAI succeeds in making it more sophisticated and widespread, then consumers could encounter fresh frustrations or scams as well as new conveniences.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission last week fined a political consultant $6 million for using AI to fake the voice of President Joe Biden in New Hampshire robocalls earlier this year.\n\nIn 2018, Google debuted its AI voice bot, Google Duplex, that could call restaurants or salons to make reservations. But the humans employed by local businesses receiving the calls didn\u2019t always like it.\n\nInitially, Duplex did not disclose that it was a piece of software, until the backlash prompted Google to reprogram it to always introduce itself as an AI system. The feature hasn\u2019t caught on broadly, although Google Pixel phones can screen calls using similar technology and the company\u2019s cloud unit offers voice technology for call centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice bots have drastically improved over the past several years, with OpenAI\u2019s new voice mode for ChatGPT winning plaudits for its ability to carry out snappy conversations, understand complex topics and questions, sing, and respond to different tones of voice when it was first unveiled in May.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s system has been tuned to sound eager and polite, similar to the tone of ChatGPT\u2019s textual answers. The company offers six voices to choose from but retired its initial default, called \u201cSky,\u201d after Scarlett Johansson alleged the company copied her voice without permission. Documents shared with The Washington Post indicate a different actor was hired for recordings used to make the voice.\n\nOpenAI says 3 million developers in dozens of countries are now experimenting with its technology and using it to build new apps and features. Opening up its latest voice features could help grow that crucial user base and the revenue it provides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome tech investors and entrepreneurs say that just as the internet incubated giants such as Google and smartphones enabled businesses such as Uber and DoorDash, artificial intelligence will also spawn a wave of start-ups that become integral to peoples\u2019 lives.\n\nOther AI experts caution that new capabilities such as convincingly expressive voices can cause havoc in the wrong hands. An AI narration service marketed for audiobooks and video games was adapted to make the fake Biden robocalls placed in New Hampshire in January.\n\nOpenAI says that its rules ban developers from using its services to spam, mislead or harm people, and that it has built systems that monitor how people use its technology to shut down any who don\u2019t comply.\n\nDevelopers tapping the new voice offering must \u201cmake it clear to their users that they are interacting with AI, unless it\u2019s obvious from the context,\u201d the company said in a blog post about the new tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI\u2019s systems have been abused in the past, despite similar rules being in place for ChatGPT and its other services, including a ban on political campaigning."

This helps keep your data private since everything is processed on your device.\n\nYou\u2019ve likely heard of Gemini Nano already since it\u2019s supported by modern devices like the Google Pixel 9 and the Samsung Galaxy S24 trio. It runs AI features in apps like Pixel Recorder, Google Messages, and more. Now, it seems third-party apps will also soon benefit from Gemini Nano\u2019s smarts.\n\nStarting today, all Android app developers can experiment with Gemini Nano using a tool called the AI Edge SDK. The Google AI Edge SDK for Android was previously under a closed early access preview program but is now available for developers working on Google Pixel 9 devices. Support for more devices will be added soon.\n\nEssentially, app developers can now experiment with Gemini Nano in their apps. This should open the floodgates for AI integration into many more apps than currently available. At present, Google is only letting developers experiment with text-to-text prompts. The company says support for more modalities (images, etc.) will be added in the future. Even so, more developers can now play around with Gemini Nano to add use cases like rephrasing, smart replies, proofreading, and summarization.\n\nDevelopers can customize how they use Gemini Nano with the AI Edge SDK. It will help manage how the AI processes information and allow developers to tailor Gemini Nano\u2019s responses based on their app\u2019s needs.\n\nIn summation, this announcement means Google is making its advanced AI technology more accessible for app developers to create useful app features that would directly benefit users.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

After debuting in 1999, the story of softhearted Nana has prompted live-action movies, Hello Kitty collabs, and rabid TikTok fandom, but its success hasn't guaranteed Yazawa's other work the same star treatment.\n\nLast Quarter \u2013 Yazawa's supernatural shoujo manga from 1998 \u2013 has been lost to the English-speaking world until this fall when VIZ Media released the first in a two-book series of the manga's first English translation. Even though it's taken 26 years, I'm grateful that Last Quarter can finally brush off the cemetery dirt and get back onto dusty bookshelves. Its intoxicating suspense is a perfect example of what draws me to paranormal romance.\n\nIn the manga, Mizuki \u2013 with the Rapunzel hair and platform heels characteristic of a Yazawa heroine \u2013 meets Adam by chance. He's a moody musician, another Yazawa trademark, and impossible to resist, so Mizuki stops going to high school. \"The rest of my life\u2026belongs to you,\" she decides.\n\nArt from Last Quarter.\n\nBut life gets in the way. Though Mizuki is too in love to see it, something's wrong with Adam. His hands are freezing, and yet he leaves the windows wide open, for all of March's cold wind to curl through. He lives in an opulent apartment, but neighbors say it's been empty for decades, and when Mizuki ends up there alone, she discovers she can't leave. No one can hear her or see her, either, apart from a blue-eyed cat and the gracious fifth grader Hotaru, who Mizuki meets in a dream.\n\nSince the Jane Eyre days, two things have made a paranormal romance story really worthwhile: the man, and the mystery. I think Last Quarter is an emblematic paranormal romance because it excels at both.\n\nLike Mr. Rochester, like Edward, like Patrick Swayze in Ghost, Adam is beautiful and frightening in Last Quarter, as plausible as a monster as he is a husband. He doesn't appear often in book one, but his bright eyes make a lasting impression.\n\nArt from Last Quarter.\n\nAs French philosopher Roland Barthes writes in A Lover's Discourse, \"isn't desire always the same, whether the object is present or absent?\" Even after she's forgotten her own name, losing herself in days as repetitive as a nightmare, Mizuki still pines for Adam. She tasks Hotaru and her friends with bringing Adam back to her, declaring that, \"I don't care if Hell comes afterward. No matter how wonderful Heaven might be, if Adam isn't there, it would be meaningless to me.\"\n\nMizuki's body-aching desire for Adam and what he represents \u2013 adulthood, novelty, potential \u2013 dissolves whatever boundaries we, as readers, have separating our love from fear. That's always my favorite part of the paranormal romance experience, embracing every possibility of fear. In the unknown, I find red connective tissue and the unmistakable, metallic glint of excitement.\n\nI take the same away from Julietta Suzuki's 2022 manga series, Otaku Vampire's Love Bite, which Viz Media is also beginning to translate. In book one, released today, the perky Romanian vampire Hina has a crush on the gloomy human Amanatsu. He shares a sexy haircut and entire face with her favorite anime character, delectably blending reality and fiction.\n\nArt from Otaku Vampire's Love Bite.\n\nIt's a tantalizing mystery, the second ingredient in what I think is a winning paranormal romance story. And in Last Quarter, whose grayscale panels are often moonlit and melancholy, strangeness drives the plot more than a male protagonist with luscious hair. Little Hotaru is determined to help Mizuki rediscover her identity, and the truth of the dream-place where they first met. Was it purgatory? An omen?\n\nThrough Hotaru and Mizuki's intertwining and opaque fates, Last Quarter establishes a creeping anxiety as absorbing as its romantic elements. That's also what I find fascinating about Junji Ito's popular 1998 horror manga series Uzumaki . Unlike Last Quarter, Uzumaki has disproportionately more people spiraling in slimy agony than in thriving relationships. Its ending \u2013 and spoilers ahead \u2013 though, creates a satisfying combination of both; narrator Kirie and her boyfriend Shuichi collapse in a pile of dry and twisted corpses, holding each other close while their arms grow long and coil together.\n\nAs much as I enjoy mainstream horror manga's spilled blood and bloated bodies, I'm glad shoujo horror like Last Quarter is now starting to be translated. Aside from Uzumaki, it's rare that horror manga has a notable romance element, and when it does, it's often presented in the form of a misogynistic yandere crime scene. But Last Quarter protects the girls in its pages, subjecting them to the uncanny only in the context of tenderness. That's what I want from paranormal romance. It reminds me that nothing is pure, and nothing is doomed.\n\nStill in a manga mood? Check out our picks for the 10 best manga from 2023."

These depressions, measuring between 91 meters (300 feet) and 183 meters (600 feet) across, also caught the attention of a shipwreck hunter at the time, although scientists have only recently been able to examine them more closely.\n\nDuring an August expedition, the team discovered around 40 of these features, which are believed to be sinkholes. These formations were found approximately 22.5 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of Sheboygan, aligned in a line extending toward Port Washington.\n\n\"There were dozens of them in our search grid,\" said Brendon Baillod, the shipwreck hunter who first noticed them in 2022, in an interview with Live Science. \"Most ranged between 500 and 1,000 feet [152 to 309 meters] in diameter and were irregular in shape.\"\n\nThe sinkholes likely formed through typical geological processes.\n\n\"Sinkholes are most common in what geologists refer to as 'karst terrain',\" the US Geological Survey notes. \"In these regions, certain types of rock beneath the surface can naturally dissolve due to groundwater circulation. Soluble rocks include salt beds, gypsum, limestone, and other carbonate formations.\"\n\nLake Michigan's limestone bedrock helps explain the creation of these sinkholes. While their formation is straightforward, these structures are far from ordinary. Similar sinkholes in Lake Huron host unique microbial communities, thriving in oxygen-poor, sulfur-rich groundwater, resembling life on Earth about 2.5 billion years ago.\n\n\"Much like early Earth, microorganisms dominate the Middle Island Sinkhole in Lake Huron. Scientists recognize three major domains of life: Bacteria, known for their diversity and adaptability; Archaea, noted for their ability to survive in extreme conditions and produce methane; and Eukarya, which includes plants, animals, fungi, and protists,\" states a study on Lake Huron sinkholes.\n\nOn the lake floor, bacteria form a purple mat.\n\n\"DNA analysis revealed that the majority of the purple mat consists of Phormidium autumnale, a photosynthetic cyanobacterium. These filamentous organisms use light energy to convert dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic carbon.\"\n\nThese microorganisms are found in diverse environments, from Yellowstone National Park to Antarctica's ice-covered lakes.\n\n\"We also discovered methane-producing Archaea in the sediment and several Eukaryotic species within the mat. While many DNA sequences resemble known organisms, some represent novel and potentially undiscovered microbial life forms.\"\n\nFurther research at Lake Michigan is necessary to determine if it harbours similar life forms, though GLERL scientists told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel they believe the sinkholes are similar to those in Lake Huron and may provide insights into early Earth conditions."

They also examined the woolly rhino's teeth, measured the length of one of its horns and noted the size of a large hump on its back, which appeared to be filled with fat.\n\nIllustration of a woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). (Image credit: De Agostini via Getty Images)\n\nThe horn was 9.4 inches (24 centimeters) long and presented three to four dark patches that typically correspond to the number of years lived by a rhinoceros, according to the study. The height at the shoulder of the carcass was close to 4.3 feet (130 cm). Together, this indicates the woolly rhino was 4 to 4.5 years old when it died and hadn't reached sexual maturity.\n\nIts fur was darker than that of a smaller woolly rhino calf discovered in 2014 in the same district. That calf, named \"Sasha,\" was frozen for at least 10,000 years and covered in thin, almost-blond hair . In contrast, adult woolly rhinos that were previously pulled from the ice have coarse, dark brown fur.\n\n\"The fur of the Abyisky rhinoceros has a uniform light brown color due to the combination of white, beige, and brown hair,\" the researchers wrote in the study. \"The coat is darker on the ears and feet and lighter on the back, belly, and hind legs.\"\n\nRemarkably, the Abyisky rhinoceros also had a 5-inch-high (13 cm) hump filled with fatty mass on its back, the likes of which scientists had never seen on a woolly rhino carcass. Fatty humps are relatively common in Arctic animals, Love Dal\u00e9n , a professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University in Sweden who was not involved in the study, told CNN . They evolved to beat the cold and store energy for when times get tough, he said.\n\nThe newly discovered 4-year-old appears to represent an intermediate stage of woolly rhino development. Specimens with preserved tissues like this one are invaluable for further research, and particularly for genetic tests that cannot be done on bones, Dal\u00e9n said."

        "article_content": "<p>Chandrayaan-3 landed in one of Moon\u2019s oldest craters, Isro scientists claim discovery</p><p><br></p>\n\nBENGALURU: Scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and others from ISRO have shown that India\u2019s Chandrayaan-3 landed within a buried impact crater, which is around 160 km in size, around 4.4 km deep, and likely to be older than the South Pole Atkin (SPA) basin.\u201cThis buried crater is one of the oldest craters on the Moon, and the Chandrayaan-3 lander (Vikram) and rover (Pragyan) landed and roved within this buried crater, which is hosting the SPA basin ejecta material and some of the most deeply excavated materials on the Moon,\u201d ISRO said Tuesday.Ejecta means material that is forced or thrown out, especially as a result of volcanic eruption, meteoritic impact, or stellar explosion.Their findings are based on analysis of images obtained by navigation cameras (navcams) on Chandrayaan-3 rover (Pragyan) and Chandrayaan-2 orbiter\u2019s Optical High Resolution Camera (OHRC). The work, authored by S Vijayan, KB Kimi, Anil Chavan, R Aditi, U Thahira, V Rama Subramanian, Rishitosh K Sinha, Santosh Vadawale, M Shanmugam, NPS Mithun, Arpit R Patel, S Amit Basu, KV Iyer, K Suresh, Ajay Prashar, G Rima and Anil Bhardwaj, has been published as a study in the peer-reviewed journal Icarus.\u201cThe Chandrayaan-3 mission with the lander (Vikram) and Pragyan landed in the high latitude highland region near the south pole of Moon. The landing site is located around 350 km from the South Pole-Aitken basin rim, an ancient and the largest impact basin in the Solar System,\u201d ISRO said Tuesday.It added that this landing site has undergone the complex emplacement sequence of SPA basin ejecta followed by the nearby and distant impact basins and complex crater ejecta materials.\u201cWe found that the SPA basin is the major contributor, which deposited nearly around 1400 m of ejecta materials, and 11 other basins deposited around 580 m of ejecta. The other complex craters contributed up to around 90 m of ejecta. Meanwhile, secondary craters of a few kilometres in diameter located adjacent to the Vikram lander contributed to around 0.5 m ejecta, which are crucial target materials for the Pragyan\u2019s in-situ analysis,\u201d ISRO said.Images from Pragyan\u2019s navcams and the OHRC gave the first clue about the linear, distal ejecta rays or groove-like structures possibly formed due to the distant impacts deposited at the Chandrayaan-3 landing site, the scientists said.\u201cThe regional exploration around the Chandrayaan-3 landing site revealed a near semi-circular like structure, highly degraded in nature. This structure encompassed the Statio Shiv Shakti (yellow star). Further detailed geomorphological and topographical analysis revealed that the structure is a heavily degraded crater structure or a buried impact crater with a diameter of around 160 km,\u201d ISRO said."

        "article_content": "A new update on Konami's Silent Hill: Townfall has been provided nearly two years after the game's announcement. Back in October 2022, Konami revealed that it was working on a new entry in the Silent Hill franchise dubbed Townfall. Details on the project were sparse at the time of its reveal, but it was known to be coming about thanks to a collaboration with Annapurna Interactive and No Code. Now, in the wake of a major collapse at Annapurna, new info on the status of Silent Hill: Townfall has been made public.\n\nIn a statement on the official Annapurna Interactive X account, it was made clear that recent happenings at the company won't impact work on Silent Hill: Townfall. Despite the future of Annapurna being uncertain at the moment, Konami and No Code remain partners on Townfall and the project will continue onward as normal. Additional info outside of this wasn't provided, but it at least confirms that Townfall is still alive in the midst of what's been going on within Annapurna.\n\n\"We deeply apologize for any concerns about Silent Hill: Townfall,\" Annapurna wrote. \"Silent Hill: Townfall will continue to be co-developed by Konami, Annapurna Interactive, and No Code.\"\n\nFor now, Silent Hill: Townfall remains without even a broad launch window as Konami continues to work on the game in secrecy. Townfall is one of two mysterious Silent Hill projects in the works right now, with the other being Silent Hill f. Developed by NeoBards, Silent Hill f is set to be a continuation of the mainline Silent Hill series, although it will be set earlier in the timeline. Rather than center around the titular town, Silent Hill f will also take place in a village in Japan. Like Townfall, Silent Hill f still doesn't have many details whatsoever and has no arrival window.\n\nIn the immediate future, Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2 is set to finally launch one week from today on October 8th. The reimagining of the survival-horror classic will be available across PS5 and PC, with its appearance on PlayStation being a timed-exclusive for one year."

        "article_content": "Microsoft is starting to release its Windows 11 2024 update today, also known as version 24H2. This update includes a number of small but useful additions to Windows 11 that improve the Start menu, File Explorer, Settings, and much more.\n\nThe Start menu has a big change for those using Microsoft\u2019s Phone Link software. The Windows 11 2024 update adds a side panel to the Start menu that provides information on your phone\u2019s battery status and notifications as well as quick access to messages, calls, and photos. The floating panel is a neat addition for Phone Link users.\n\nIf you own an HDR monitor, this latest Windows 11 update will enable HDR background support, and you can also now easily toggle monitor color profiles directly within the Settings page.\n\nFile Explorer now has labels on copy, paste, and more. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\nFile Explorer is also getting some useful changes in the Windows 11 2024 update. The home section has been redesigned slightly to combine recent, favorites, and shared files into a tabbed view. The context menus within File Explorer and across Windows 11 have also been updated, so common actions like copy, paste, and rename now have labels and are larger and clearer to use. You can now create 7z and TAR files, too.\n\nIn the system tray, Microsoft has switched up the time and date UI so it\u2019s more simplified and the year is no longer listed. Quick Settings has also been overhauled to include all of the quick actions by default, and you can now drag and drop them freely. Microsoft has also reworked the power options in Windows 11 with a new Energy Saver mode that\u2019s designed to save battery life on laptops. You can also change what happens when you press the power button or lift a laptop lid and set power profiles easily within Settings.\n\nYou can now easily reverse the mouse scroll wheel direction. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\nOther improvements to the Settings interface include the ability to finally reverse the mouse scroll direction without having to use the Windows registry. Microsoft has also added the ability to toggle enhanced pointer precision for a mouse in the Settings interface, instead of having to delve into the legacy Control Panel.\n\nSudo is part of this Windows 11 2024 update, allowing developers to use the popular command from Unix-based operating systems. It\u2019s useful for developers who want to test scripts, and Microsoft is using sudo inside of Windows to let developers run elevated tools directly from an unelevated console session.\n\nOther changes in this Windows 11 update include a unified version of the Microsoft Teams app that works for both professional and personal accounts. Microsoft has also replaced the Mail and Calendar apps with a new Outlook client, and the Copilot app has turned into a web app that no longer directly interacts with Windows 11 settings.\n\nThe new unified Microsoft Teams app. Image: Microsoft\n\nThe Windows 11 2024 update also includes support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth LE audio and improves performance for the latest AMD desktop CPUs.\n\nMicrosoft is slowly rolling out 24H2 to existing devices. \u201cWe are taking a phased approach with the 2024 Update rollout, based on when data shows your device is ready and you will have a great experience,\u201d explains John Cable, vice president of program management for Windows servicing and delivery. \u201cThe first phase will start over the coming weeks. We will begin with eligible devices running Windows 11, version 22H2 and 23H22 for those who have previously opted in to be amongst the first to experience new enhancements.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft is using the OS swap method for 24H2, where it replaces the entire OS with an updated version, instead of what it has done in the past with the 23H2 update, which was a service update to the existing OS. This means Microsoft will only offer you 24H2 once your device is fully compatible and ready to upgrade. There could be application or device driver incompatibilities that Microsoft detects and places a safeguard against upgrading your device."

Joining them on stage were SaaS leaders Dhivya Venkatesan, Head of Marketing at Sign easy, and Abhigna Kashyap, Senior Director and Global Head of Brand Content, and Social Media at LTI Mindtree.\n\nThe conference theme was \u201cSecuring Your Spot on Buyer Shortlists.\u201d The Insights Summit brought together 68 industry experts and thought leaders to provide actionable insights and best practices for SaaS businesses. Participants learned about the latest software buyer trends, emerging technologies, and effective marketing strategies to drive growth.\n\nThe event featured exclusive research that surveyed 3,500 software buyers and company decision-makers.

India is the most confident of the countries surveyed, planning to increase its spending by 89%. Top priorities for software purchase are Cybersecurity (37%), IT management (31%), and AI (31%).\n\n* Customer reviews: Customer reviews are buyers\u2019 most influential information source for narrowing their initial purchase options and creating a shortlist of products (41%). Final purchase decisions are made predominantly after product trials (62%) and impressions made by the vendor\u2019s customer support (57%).\n\n* Buyer regret: Over half of companies have experienced regret over a technology purchase in the last year. The more a buyer relies solely on information from a vendor to buy software, the more often they experience regret.

        "article_content": "Motorola may be catching up to companies like Samsung and Google regarding the number of years of Android updates it provides for its smartphones. A new Motorola phone could come with five years of updates, and it represents the second Motorola phone to do so in as many months.\n\nThe recently announced Motorola Moto G75 will come with five Android OS upgrades and six years of security patches. By our count, this would mean that users will be able to update their phone to at least Android 19, considering that the Moto G75 ships with Android 14. Last month, it was announced that the Motorola Edge 50 Neo would include five years of OS upgrades and security patches.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile five years of updates isn\u2019t as many as the seven years that companies like Samsung and Google promise, it still represents a significant increase from what Motorola had previously offered.\n\nMotorola confirms this update guarantee on its product page for the Moto G75, writing: \u201cKeep up with the latest version of Android by getting five OS upgrades \u2014 and six years of security updates \u2014 guaranteed through 2029.\u201d\n\nThe Motorola Moto G75 is a midrange smartphone with impressive features at its price point. It includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, a 6.78-inch Full HD+ LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, and support for expandable storage via a microSD card of up to 1TB.\n\nThe new phone also boasts a 50-megapixel main primary camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and Quad Pixel technology and a 5,000mAh battery that supports 30-watt TurboPower wired and 15W wireless charging.\n\nThe new phone is available in Charcoal Gray, Aqua Blue, and Succulent Green. The Charcoal Gray model features a matte-finished back cover, while the Aqua Blue and Succulent Green models have vegan leather rear panels.\n\nIt looks like a very competent budget phone, though the real interest lies in its update policy. This is an area Motorola has long struggled with, and while it remains to be seen if the company actually makes good on this promise, it\u2019s a very encouraging step in the right direction.\n\nMotorola has not yet announced the pricing and availability details for the Moto G75."
