        "article_content": "Over the last two years, Congressional hearings on UFOs have introduced new terms to the popular vernacular. From hearings on Navy pilots who spotted a \u201cTic-Tac\u201d UFO in 2004, we got the term \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d (UAP). Then reports of strange objects hovering above the ocean gave us \u201cUnidentified Submerged Objects\u201d (USOs).\n\nNow, believers and skeptics alike can add another new bit of vocabulary to the debate around these bizarre happenings, which may tie them all together: \u201cImmaculate Constellation.\u201d\n\nDuring last week\u2019s UAP hearings on Capitol Hill, multiple witnesses described the elaborately named program as an alleged information-gathering and evidence-retrieval program conducted by the Pentagon without Congressional oversight. The Immaculate Constellation program, they say, has been withholding a treasure trove of high-resolution images and other data about UAP sightings from the public for decades.\n\nThe November 13 hearings followed up on the June 2023 Congressional event in which retired Navy Comm. David Fravor and fellow pilot Lt. Comm. Alex Dietrich described how their F/A-18 Hornets spotted and chased a white \u201cTic-Tac\u201d-shaped UAP for several minutes. According to analysis of radar tracks and grainy infrared video shot by the F/A-18s, the object displayed speeds of more than 45,000 miles per hour and pulled more than 2,000 Gs.\n\nJump ahead to 2024, and a new crop of believers have come forward about the function of Immaculate Constellation\u2014gathering reports of major UAP sightings and possible encounters; investigating possible crash or landing sites; and gathering physical UAP evidence, biological material, or technology.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information\u2014still photos, video photos, other sensor information\u2014and they have for a very long time,\u201d said journalist Michael Shellenberger, one of the witnesses at the November 13 hearing. Meanwhile, the public has only ever seen fuzzy photos of some of those incidents.\n\nShellenberger delivered an 11-page report to Congress during the hearing, detailing claims about Immaculate Constellation; he says a current or former official and UAP whistleblower authored the report.\n\nThe November testimony lineup also included one-time Air Force Intelligence officer David Grusch\u2014who claimed during a prior hearing last summer that crashed UAPs had not only been recovered and studied for reverse-engineering, but that \u201cnon-human biologics\u201d had also been discovered inside\u2014and Lue Elizondo, who formerly headed the Pentagon\u2019s secretive UFO unit.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: UAP are real,\u201d Elizondo said in his opening testimony. \u201cAdvanced technologies not made by our government\u2014or any other government\u2014are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. Furthermore, the U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries.\u201d Elizondo says it all adds up to a \u201cmultidecade, secretive arms race.\u201d\n\nHowever, skeptics point to the fact that none of the assembled witnesses presented anything by way of physical evidence or direct testimony from the witnesses or whistleblowers referenced. Department of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough stated the Pentagon denies the existence of such a program, while representatives of the U.S. Government agency AARO (All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office) continue to claim there is no evidence that UAPs are alien in nature.\n\nAvi Loeb, Ph.D.\u2014a physicist and professor at Harvard University who heads the Galileo Project, which seeks out alien intelligence or artifacts\u2014acknowledges the possibility of Immaculate Constellation, but highlighted the lack of any real proof. \u201cAll we have seen is written text,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cNo credible scientific evidence was made public.\u201d\n\nLoeb says his firm belief is that all major nations have programs to \u201cimage or retrieve relics from crash sites.\u201d However, he insists the purpose of such programs is to learn about technologies developed by adversarial nations and manage reverse-engineering efforts to reproduce such technologies.\n\n\u201cThere might also be biologics in such crash sites if the equipment carried pilots,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fundamental question is whether some of the data collected by these programs indicates an extraterrestrial technological origin. If such data exists, I would love to see it and help the Department of Defense or the Intelligence agencies figure out what it means.\u201d\n\nLoeb generally questions the usefulness of the ongoing series of congressional hearings, stressing that it is unlikely any meaningful admissions will come from the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe Galileo Project Observatory at Harvard University released its first commissioning data on half a million objects that it monitored in the sky over five months,\u201d Loeb says. \u201cWe also retrieved materials from the crash site of the first interstellar meteor in the Pacific Ocean.\u201d\n\nLoeb promises his team will openly share with the public any data they collect and any discoveries they make.\n\n\u201cThis standard scientific practice is far more informative than political maneuvers aimed to disclose classified information from stubborn government agencies,\u201d he says. \u201cA robust answer to Enrico Fermi\u2019s old question of \u2018where is everybody?\u2019 will originate from scientists\u2014not from politicians or journalists.\u201d"

This is excellent news for anyone looking to pick up a cheap option among the best smart rings, especially right now, as it's on sale for Black Friday.\n\nStarting with the obvious style change, the layout remains similar, but the various charts and graphs have been tweaked visually. For example, the wellness balance chart on the app\u2019s main page has morphed from its diamond-like design to a much more readable flower-like design.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe corresponding petal is filled in as you improve your Activity, Sleep, Relax Status, and Vitals Status scores. It\u2019s very similar to the previous graph, except that it\u2019s significantly more understandable at a quick glance.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nRingConn Gen 2\n\nBefore...\n\nImage 2 of 2\n\nRingConn Gen 2 app screenshots showing Hamish hector's fitness stats\n\n... and after\n\nThose improvements to glanceability extend to other aspects of the home page and stats pages but let\u2019s talk about new features. AI has come to the RingConn app in a big way with the introduction of Health Plans.\n\nThe first of these plans to launch is a Body and Mind Balance plan \u2013 a Sleep improvement plan is apparently on the way, according to the app \u2013 and after answering a quick survey about your activity patterns, the software will provide specific daily targets for you to achieve so you can steadily morph from your current routine to your new healthier normal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also an AI chatbot you can converse with, but as the app notes, it can only respond to fixed questions. Because of this limitation, it\u2019s not the most useful as it repackages the insights the app already gives you. Still, as it develops, I could see the AI becoming a useful fitness companion.\n\nA reason to use the app\n\nRingConn Gen 2 on a colorful mousemat\n\nSince testing the RingConn Gen 2 for our review, I\u2019ve kept using the ring pretty much all the time \u2013 save for the week or two I had lost it (it fell behind my bedside table) \u2013 but I\u2019ve realized I increasingly relied on the app a lot less because the stats I cared most about were easily viewable in the Android app widget. I could easily check my sleep, activity score, and ring battery with just a brief look at my home screen.\n\nThe in-depth insights were useful, but I often just wanted a quick recap of my stats and a brief guide to improving. The app's facelift and health plan tool is perfect and gives me a reason to open it up more frequently, as I can now get that extra detail and daily targets in a condensed, quick-to-read fashion.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the Ai doesn\u2019t feel entirely helpful, but overall, this RingConn app overhaul looks to be a massive boost instead of a downgrade, and I\u2019m excited to see what improvements we get next."

It was mostly a recap of the features I've tried already, but two tools were surprisingly useful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demo was quick, less than 15 minutes, and I was helped by two store employees who said they usually show shoppers features based on which apps they frequently use. For me, that meant a recap of the \"clean up\" tool in the Photos app, but I got new details on Math Notes and a \"hide\" feature on Safari.\n\nApple launched its AI software in beta with the iOS 18.1 update in October \u2014 the first of a rollout happening over the next several months. Although flashier features, like the Image Playground and Genmojis, aren't included yet, many new AI-powered tools exist on iPhone 15 Pro models or later.\n\nWhen I played with Apple Intelligence on my own, I was impressed, but I couldn't fully explore it since my iPhone 14 Pro Max isn't compatible with the software. If you've recently upgraded to an iPhone 15 Pro or later, an AI walkthrough might be beneficial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's what you might've missed if you haven't gotten a tutorial.\n\nI thought Math Notes would come out later\n\nMath Notes is a feature that solves complex math equations. Jordan Hart/BI\n\nI was impressed by Math Notes when Apple first demonstrated it at WWDC, but it was unclear which phase of Apple Intelligence it would be included in.\n\nThe AI-powered math helper was rolled out with iOS 18 in September, before the official Apple Intelligence launch. Unlike other AI tools, Math Notes is available on any iPhone compatible with iOS 18.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Calculator app, you can type complex math equations, and your phone will use AI to solve them. On iPads, you can use a pencil to write out the problems. I can't help but wonder where this was when I was in high school.\n\nI could see myself using \"hide\" on Safari a lot\n\nThe hide tool would be useful to eliminate distracting ads or elements of a webpage. Jordan Hart/BI\n\nAlthough I've read about and reported on Apple Intelligence's uses in the Safari app, I didn't have the chance to see how they could be applied to my daily life.\n\nOne store employee demonstrated how the \"hide\" tool removes distracting elements from a webpage. He used the shopping site Temu as an example. When he clicked the hide button and selected which parts he didn't want to see \u2014 mostly ads \u2014 the page transformed to become an efficient showing of items to shop from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tool would definitely come in handy for an online shopper like myself who wants to get straight to the goods.\n\nThere's also the Tips app\n\nIf you can't make it to an Apple store for a rundown, there's always the Tips app with a section on Apple Intelligence. It provides some guidance on how to use the AI available on iOS 18.1 so far.\n\nI went through it while first exploring Apple Intelligence, but the hands-on demo in a store gave me some more details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple has said that there's more to come in December with the release of iOS 18.2, and there's more Apple Intelligence on the horizon in 2025."

        "article_content": "AI agents are at the forefront of technological innovation, redefining how tasks are performed autonomously. These sophisticated systems, functioning as AI microservices or compact applications, are characterized by their ability to operate independently. The core strength of AI agents lies in their capacity to make decisions and execute tasks without direct human oversight, marking a significant leap in artificial intelligence applications. Whether it\u2019s planning your next vacation or suggesting the perfect outfit based on the weather, AI agents are quietly transforming the way we live and work.\n\nBut what exactly makes an AI agent tick? At the heart of these systems is a concept known as agentic behavior, which refers to the varying degrees of autonomy that AI agents can exhibit. Some are highly independent, tackling complex tasks with minimal input, while others might still rely on a bit of human guidance. This spectrum of autonomy is not just a technical detail\u2014it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of AI, where machines learn and adapt, becoming more efficient over time. The Google team provide more insight deeper into the world of AI agents, explaining how these digital assistants are not only transforming industries but also opening up new possibilities for innovation and collaboration.\n\nAI Agents in Everyday Life\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : AI agents operate autonomously, making decisions and executing tasks without human intervention, similar to AI microservices.\n\nThe autonomy of AI agents, known as agentic behavior, varies based on system capabilities and task complexity.\n\nAI agents are applied in diverse industries, managing tasks like email prioritization, travel planning, and fashion recommendations.\n\nDeveloping AI agents can involve simple algorithms or custom models, with various frameworks available to suit different functionalities.\n\nAI agents can collaborate to enhance outcomes, with each agent performing specific functions to improve efficiency and productivity.\n\nDecoding Agentic Behavior in AI\n\nThe concept of agentic behavior is central to understanding AI agents. This behavior refers to the varying degrees of autonomy exhibited by these systems. Some AI agents demonstrate high levels of independence, capable of completing complex tasks with minimal external input. Others may require a degree of human guidance, especially for more nuanced or critical decisions. The spectrum of autonomy is directly related to the agent\u2019s underlying capabilities and the intricacy of its designated tasks.\n\nKey aspects of agentic behavior include:\n\nDecision-making capabilities\n\nTask execution without constant supervision\n\nAdaptability to changing environments\n\nLearning from interactions and outcomes\n\nThe level of autonomy in AI agents is not static; it can evolve as the system learns and improves over time, potentially increasing its independence and efficiency.\n\nDiverse Applications Across Industries\n\nThe versatility of AI agents has led to their adoption across a wide range of sectors, demonstrating their potential to transform various aspects of business and daily life.

The fashion sector is using these agents to provide style recommendations, considering factors such as weather conditions, personal style, and existing wardrobe items.\n\nWhat are AI agents?\n\nTake a look at other insightful guides from our broad collection that might capture your interest in Autonomy.\n\nThe Development Landscape of AI Agents\n\nContrary to common belief, developing AI agents doesn\u2019t always necessitate the use of large language models (LLMs). The choice of technology depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. For simpler applications, basic algorithms or custom-trained models might suffice, offering a more efficient and targeted solution.\n\nDevelopers have access to a variety of frameworks and tools for creating AI agents. These resources enable the design of agents that can interact, collaborate, and achieve specific goals. The selection of development tools is crucial and should align with the desired functionality and complexity of the agent.\n\nFactors to consider in AI agent development:\n\nScalability requirements\n\nIntegration with existing systems\n\nData processing capabilities\n\nReal-time response needs\n\nSynergy in AI: Agent Collaboration\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of AI agents is their ability to collaborate, creating a synergistic effect that enhances overall performance. In a collaborative setup, multiple agents can work in tandem, each specializing in specific functions to produce superior outcomes.\n\nFor instance, in content creation, one agent might focus on generating initial drafts, while another specializes in refining and polishing the content. This division of labor not only improves the quality of the final product but also significantly boosts efficiency and productivity.\n\nThe collaborative potential of AI agents extends beyond content creation. In complex problem-solving scenarios, multiple agents can tackle different aspects of a problem simultaneously, sharing insights and building upon each other\u2019s progress to reach solutions more quickly and effectively than a single agent or human could.\n\nEmbarking on Your AI Agent Journey\n\nFor those interested in developing AI agents, the journey begins with understanding basic business logic and identifying areas where automation can bring significant benefits. Numerous tutorials and educational resources are available to guide beginners through the process of conceptualizing and creating their first AI agent.\n\nPlatforms like Vertex AI Agent Builder and Firebase offer robust tools and infrastructure for building and deploying AI agents. These platforms provide scalable solutions that can help bring your ideas to life, whether you\u2019re looking to create a simple task automation agent or a more complex, multi-functional system.\n\nAI agents represent a significant leap forward in task automation and execution across various sectors. By harnessing their autonomy, diverse capabilities, and collaborative potential, you can drive innovation and enhance efficiency in your projects and operations. As the field continues to evolve, the possibilities for AI agents in transforming industries and solving complex problems are boundless.\n\nMedia Credit: Google Cloud Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

        "article_content": "Deliverance minister Jason Bray deals with hauntings, ghosts, demonic possession and poltergeists(Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\nJason Bray may seem like your normal Anglican priest.\n\nAt Cardiff\u2019s Llandaff Cathedral where he is now the Dean, he starts each morning with a brisk walk down a set of stone steps which lead from his home to his workplace.\n\nIt\u2019s a picture of peaceful contentment, but the priest\u2019s work also has an unpredictable side.\n\nJason is a deliverance minister, which is essentially the role director William Friedkin portrayed in the 1973 horror film \u2018The Exorcist.\u2019 Terrified audience members were said to have fainted or fled during screenings of the film, which tells the story of a girl possessed by an ancient demon.\n\nThe Exorcist spawned a whole genre of movies about demonic possession (Picture: THA/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nJason has been specialising in deliverance ministry for the last 27 years (Picture: Jason Bray)\n\nWhile he says the film paints an unrealistic picture of exorcisms, Jason admits he has had several experiences which made his \u2018skin crawl.\u2019 There was the family plagued by a \u2018ghostly monk\u2019, a woman terrified rats were \u2018eating her insides\u2019 and a man who had spotted his dead boyfriend stark-naked in his shower.\n\n\u2018You never know what you\u2019re going to be presented with,\u2019 Jason, 55, tells Metro, as he sits in a meeting room in Llandaff Cathedral, where ancient gravestones and tall trees border the nearby window.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no walking in going \u201chello, I\u2019m the exorcist\u201d in a scary low voice, though. People are usually quite frightened to begin with. I try to be as pleasantly disarming as I can be, so they don\u2019t feel the need to be nervous.\u2019\n\nJason sips a cup of strong black coffee as he discusses his work. Today he\u2019s in a trim black suit and red waistcoat; the type of outfit he\u2019d attend a call-out in. A copy of The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behaviour Disorders sits on his desk as a constant reminder that mental health, not mysterious spirits, could be the cause of a case.\n\nWhat is the deliverance ministry? In Christianity, deliverance ministry refers to groups that perform practices to cleanse people of demons and evil spirits. These groups attribute certain people\u2019s physical, psychological, spiritual, and emotional problems to the activities of these evil spirits in their lives. Every diocese has at least one deliverance minister. Exorcisms are extremely rare and a rite only administered with authorisation from a bishop. Therefore, the term \u2018deliverance minister\u2019 over \u2018exorcist\u2019 is used.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had some really creepy experiences,\u2019 the dad-of-two says. \u2018There have only been a couple occasions where I\u2019ve turned to a colleague and said \u201cRUN.\u201d\u2018\n\nThere are three types of call-outs which a deliverance minister deals with, he explains.\n\nFirst, poltergeist activity, which can cause lights to flicker or shoes to vanish. This is a negative spirit energy caused by \u2018someone who is struggling to communicate their distress\u2019. A teenager bottling up stress about a parent\u2019s divorce could cause the behaviour; as could an older person suffering with the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn one poltergeist case, a woman rang up Jason and blurted out: \u2018It\u2019s these rats, they\u2019re eating my mother alive. She woke up and felt like her insides were being eaten away by something, but when she turned the lights on there wasn\u2019t anything there at all.\u2019\n\nJason will bless a house in a bid to rid it of unwanted spirits (Picture: Stock image/Getty Images)\n\nJason will often uses a holy water sprinkler to bless a house (Picture: Jason Bray)\n\nJason raced to the home and proceeded to walk from room to room and speak the Lord\u2019s Prayer while he held a wooden cross. The woman\u2019s rat-based problem thankfully vanished and it later emerged she was awaiting results from a bowel cancer screening. Jason thinks this pent-up anxiety caused the experience.\n\nThe second type of call-out deliverance ministers respond to is \u2018place memories\u2019. This is where a building \u2018relives\u2019 something dramatic which took place years before. An example of place memory can be found at Treasurer\u2019s House in York, where heating engineer Harry Martindale saw \u2018Roman soldiers\u2019 march through a basement wall in 1953. Excavation work later found that the building was located on top of a former major road which led to the Roman city of Eboracum.\n\nJason points to one notable \u2018place memory\u2019 experience he had, with a family who felt the need to take a large step at the bottom of their staircase. It turned out a previous resident had fallen down the basement stairs and had broken his neck at the bottom.\n\nThe third type of call-out is \u2018true hauntings\u2019, which see a dead person try to communicate with loved ones. If you catch a whiff of your late grandmother\u2019s perfume; or see a shadow of a dead relative \u2013 this could be a true haunting, Jason explains. He will often carry out a \u2018requiem mass\u2019, also known as a Mass for the Dead, to encourage these spirit to move on.\n\nJason met King Charles and Camilla when they visited Wales in 2022 (Picture: Jason Bray)\n\nThe priest has met other famous faces such as Ryan Reynolds and Pudsey Bear (Pictures: Jason Bray)\n\nThis was the case when Jason was called to the home of his friend Pete; who had been left terrified after the ghost of his dead Australian boyfriend Craig appeared in his shower. After gentle questioning from Jason, Londoner Pete explained how he struggled to let his ex-partner go. This could have led to the spirit struggling to \u2018move on\u2019.\n\nBut isn\u2019t there a fourth category \u2013 what about exorcisms? Does Jason ever pin a possessed person to a bed and shout the Lord\u2019s Prayer while thunder and lightning crashes outside? No, is the swift answer.\n\n\u2018The movie [the Exorcist] has ruined the word \u201cexorcist\u201d,\u2019 Jason says. \u2018A major exorcism would mean someone is possessed and the deliverance minister is casting the demon out. But we do that on vanishingly rare occasions. It\u2019s a last resort.\u2019\n\nJason adds that he has never conducted an exorcism in his 12 years as a deliverance minister and dislikes the term \u2018exorcist\u2019 due to the negative connotations it brings up.\n\nFilms like the Pope\u2019s Exorcist (2023) impact people\u2019s perceptions of demons (Picture: Screen Gems/Everett/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHe continues: \u2018What people see in the films influences their opinions quite strongly. People we come across talk about \u201corbs\u201d a lot, I think Most Haunted has inspired a large part of that. I\u2019m convinced these \u201corbs\u201d are dust specs which get picked up on night vision cameras.\u2019\n\nWhen Jason does attend a call-out his \u2018ghostbusting\u2019 bag includes candles, prayer books, holy water, hand gel and a crucifix. Some deliverance ministers bring a radiator key he adds, in case trapped air is the cause of strange sounds.\n\nLike a doctor, Jason listens to symptoms and provides treatment in the form of house blessings and prayers. Then, like a therapist, he asks questions to help the homeowner find a deeper reason behind negative energy in their home. Finally, like a detective, he works out if his services are even required \u2013 if it\u2019s a mental health matter he will signpost accordingly.\n\n\u2018If you were possessed you wouldn\u2019t know it,\u2019 Jason, originally from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, insists.\n\n\u2018You definitely wouldn\u2019t go looking for help. Hearing demonic voices, something I have been called out to, isn\u2019t a symptom of being possessed \u2013 it\u2019s a sign of schizophrenia. I usually ask people if they are on medication or have a diagnosis. Sometimes, I tell them they need to see a doctor as soon as they can \u2013 not me.\u2019\n\nToday, deliverance ministers go out in pairs for safety. But that wasn\u2019t always the case, and Jason recalls one incident during the Covid pandemic when he felt at risk.\n\nJason says he dislikes the term \u2018exorcist\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe prefers the title \u2018deliverance minister\u2019 (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\n\u2018I was called to a guy who was really into his conspiracy theories and essentially had gone stir crazy,\u2019 he explains. \u2018Like many people at that time, he hadn\u2019t seen anybody for months and was cut off from the world. He had worked himself up into a complete state worrying his house was bugged. When I walked in, I could almost feel nervous energy pour out of him as he paced his tiny living room. I blessed the house and he said he was better afterwards, but I admit I did not feel safe there at all.\u2019\n\nJason\u2019s personal journey into deliverance was spurred by a strange encounter in 1997. After studying theology at Durham and a PhD in the Old Testament at Cambridge, he got ordained and moved with wife Laura into a three-bedroom house in South Wales. They welcomed a son, Tom, the same year and soon realised something was very wrong.\n\n\u2018I was away for a couple days on a training course,\u2019 Jason recalls. \u2018I came back to Laura \u2013 who is a very level-headed person \u2013 hugely concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut Tom\u2019s bedroom is like a freezer. Something is not right.\u201d We bled the radiator as you do, but it was still so cold.\n\n\u2018A few nights later I got up to go to the toilet. As I made to leave the bathroom and touch the handle, there was a sudden feeling that someone was standing on the other side of the door. I somehow knew, despite not seeing him, that he was my height, had grey eyes and wore a round wooden mask. I eventually opened the bathroom door and there was no-one there, so I ran into bed and dived under the covers. Laura saw my face and said \u201cyou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d\u2019\n\nJason is currently based at Llandaff Cathedral in Wales (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\nWith Laura\u2019s encouragement, Jason approached the local vicar \u2013 his boss \u2013 at a cheese and wine event and nervously explained what he had experienced.\n\nA visit was arranged to bless the Bray home. After the vicar splashed holy water in each room and gathered Jason and Laura to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer, everything changed. Almost instantly, the sun streamed in and Tom\u2019s room became warmer. Inspired, Jason embarked on a training course to become a deliverance minister.\n\nIn his very first house visit, Jason came across a \u2018very bored\u2019 family who seemed ambivalent as he walked around their house and blessed it. He later learned that they\u2019d told the council the flat was haunted in an attempt to get moved to a better home.\n\n\u2018You know it\u2019s real when they\u2019re frightened,\u2019 Jason adds knowingly.\n\nEager to put the work of a deliverance minister out into the world in his own words, in 2021 Jason published his book Deliverance, which brings together his various encounters with the supernatural. Since then, the film rights have been purchased, and Jason suggests with a smile that Welsh actor Michael Sheen would be a shoo-in to fill his boots.\n\nJason encourages anyone with haunted happenings to contact their local church (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\n\u2018Deliverance\u2019 recalls his memorable experiences with the supernatural (Picture: Kirsten Robertson)\n\nJason\u2019s work as a deliverance minister has also led him to act as a consultant on ITV\u2019s Midwinter of the Spirit, which tells the story of a country vicar played by Anna Maxwell Martin who is called to a strange murder with supernatural undertones. He\u2019s also explained his job to actors Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds in an episode of their TV show Welcome to Wrexham.\n\nFor now though, the priest has no plans to hang up his crucifix anytime soon.\n\n\u2018I suspect there will always be a role for the deliverance ministry,\u2019 Jason says. \u2018Interestingly, there are now more atheists than people who believe in God, but a surprising number of atheists who believe in ghosts. There\u2019s a bit of a lack of logic in the whole thing there.\u2019\n\nTo buy Deliverance, click here. An Audible version is also available.\n\nDo you have a story you\u2019d like to share?

A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they\u2019re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Paul Mescal, Zendaya \u2014 the celebrity look-alike contests sweeping the US and the UK seem to be more than just a weekend fad. Despite sporadic attendance and skeptical media coverage, the events keep happening, sometimes with repeat contests for various celebrities in different cities. Disappointed by the lack of Jack Schlossberg look-alikes in New York? Not to worry, the ultimate Schlossberg doppelg\u00e4nger might get their chance to shine in Washington, DC, this weekend.\n\nWhy now, you might ask? What weird burble in the zeitgeist has somehow manifested in lines of identical Chalamets? Is it that we can\u2019t get enough of Hollywood \u201cit\u201d boys? Is it that, as a society, we\u2019re tiring of lives lived primarily online? Is it that we\u2019re all thirsty for more fun, low-stake events that are free and open to the public?\n\nI turned to a Zayn Malik look-alike contest attendee for answers. \u201cI was probably just going to stay home, but I was like, no, some divine spirit is calling me to this look-alike contest,\u201d Natalie Miller, a social producer from Bushwick, told me. Miller and a friend attended the contest last Sunday in Maria Hernandez Park.\n\nThe winner, 29-year-old Shiv Patel, seemed prepared for glory; he told Brooklyn Mag the win \u201cadds to my lore.\u201d Naturally, Miller got a photo.\n\nIt\u2019s almost a real celebrity moment.\n\nHowever tongue-in-cheek the events and the participants might be, the glee they\u2019re producing is real. \u201cEveryone was just having such a good time, and it was 30 minutes, but it was just the best part of everyone\u2019s day,\u201d Miller said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a minute since the public took to the streets for fun reasons. While flash mobs of the early 2010s quickly got deemed cringe, viral dance memes of the mid-\u201810s often resulted in injuries, and the past few years of Pok\u00e9mon Go may have inadvertently aided our dystopian nightmare, these look-alike contests seem, so far, to be wholly banal. (Well, notwithstanding that one guy who got arrested.)\n\n\u201c[T]he timothee chalamet lookalike competition just shows that the people yearn for weird town events like we live in gilmore girls,\u201d as one viral post put it.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s plenty of precedent for precisely this type of quirky celebration. This moment harks back to an era well before the internet, when people were arguably considerably more bored and desperate for entertainment \u2014 or, as Jeremy O. Harris put it, \u201cGreat Depression era coded.\u201d\n\nIn other words, we might be seeking refuge from our current reality in wholesome, mindless community spectator events. Historian and folklorist Matthew Algeo noted to Vox that such crazes historically spring up amid times of intense technological and social change \u2014 changes that necessarily create public anxiety and a longing for community and simple entertainment.\n\n\u201cWe think of the Great Depression as an economic event, but it was also a psychological event,\u201d Algeo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a psychological event right now. There\u2019s a hunger for diversion.\u201d\n\nAlgeo is the author of Pedestrianism, about the massively popular walking contests of the 1870s and \u201980s, in which crowds would fill huge stadiums, including Madison Square Garden, to watch other people walk around in circles for hours.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for new and interesting forms of entertainment,\u201d Algeo said, \u201csomething that everybody can relate to.\u201d As for what the spectators get out of it, Algeo admitted that, as interesting entertainment goes, walking competitions and look-alike contests are \u201ca little like watching paint dry.\u201d He suggested one reason people turn out for the events is that they \u201cget a perverse joy in watching other people putting themselves out there in public.\u201d While ironic glee could certainly be one factor, Miller suggests a purer motivation.\n\n\u201cIt honestly felt like a One Direction meet and greet,\u201d Miller, a longtime Directioner, told me. \u201cI was so nervous going up to [Patel]. It\u2019s just so fun to experience that joy again.\u201d\n\nOne might assume that the primary appeal of these look-alike contests would be to the fandoms of those specific celebrities, but that isn\u2019t the case; Miller said she was pleasantly surprised at the way most people in attendance at the Zayn contest seemed to be locals rather than fans. \u201cIt felt like a local community gathering and it was just so joyous,\u201d Miller said of the crowd. Algeo told me the local community appeal is understandable.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of how famous walker Edward Payson Weston would go to these small towns and do these challenges where he would walk 100 miles in 24 hours in somebody\u2019s barn,\u201d Algeo said. \u201cEverybody had to come out and see it because it was live entertainment, and that really brought communities together. This is kind of the same thing. It gives people a reason to get out of their houses and share an experience with other people, in real time and in real life.\u201d He also compared the current craze to flagpole-sitting of the \u201920s and \u201930s, when the public would go gawk at other humans sitting, where else, atop flagpoles.\n\n\u201cIt sounds silly, but I think the fact that it\u2019s silly might make it all the more appealing to people,\u201d Algeo said. \u201cEspecially in this day and age, with everything so intense and polarized and fractured. It\u2019s hard to summon a lot of negative emotions about a celebrity look-alike contest.\u201d Thinking back to the Depression, it probably doesn\u2019t hurt that in the current age of inflation, these events are free.\n\nThere\u2019s also perhaps a little bit of stunt myth-making afoot. The flagpole-sitting craze began because a theater hired a Hollywood stuntman named Shipwreck Kelly to sit atop a flagpole to promote a new film. From there, the trend went viral. Likewise, the look-alike contests might have been born out of self-promotion as much as wholesome community fun. The organizer of the first look-alike contest, the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet competition famously attended by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet himself, is Anthony Po, a New York-based YouTuber with nearly 2 million followers tuning in to his stunt videos, which range from sneaking into cults to manufacturing paranormal sightings. He swiftly moved on from the look-alike contest uproar to planning his next big event: a boxing match between his alter-ego, Cheeseball Man, and a mysterious newcomer named Cornhead Killer.\n\nStill, it would seem that, so far, Cornhead Killer has nothing on Sunday in the park with Zayns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s objectively so funny to see a bunch of people standing in a straight line that all look really similar,\u201d Miller assured me.\n\nMiller\u2019s giddy joy in congregating with her fellow Directioners and fellow Bushwick community members would seem to support Algeo\u2019s hypothesis that, in the end, \u201cpeople just like to watch other people do things.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what they\u2019re doing, there\u2019s probably any human activity you could get a crowd for.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you \u2014 threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.

More info\n\nStepping out of my car, I was immediately greeted by the loud roar of the M5. I was surrounded by trees and fields, but make no mistake, this was not the countryside.\n\nI'd travelled to Sandwell Valley Country Park, a hidden slice of greenery situated in the heart of the Black Country. For a 1.5 mile stretch, the M5 passes through this green corridor, leaving behind the masses of towering buildings, factories and housing estates that make up the West Midlands conurbation.\n\nNear this small section of motorway, hidden from view by the line of trees, are the remains of a Christian monastery built 900 years ago. But you won't be able to see Sandwell Priory from your car window; it's located a five-minute walk into Priory Woods in West Bromwich.\n\nREAD MORE: New 455-mile train service will link Wales, England and Scotland direct - and it stops in Birmingham\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp , click the link to join\n\nIf you do manage to find it, all that remains of the monastery, which was founded in 1190AD by a man named William Fitz Guy, are several feet of stonework. The bricks appear in rectangular shapes on the ground, the foundations of where the ancient buildings once stood.\n\nBut while only a relic of the Sandwell Priory monastery remains today, there's been rumours that the monks who once resided there still haunt the land. Drivers claim to have witnessed such figures as far as the M5 - even being forced to swerve around them on the carriageway.\n\nWith such strange reports occurring in the area, I decided to set out and explore further. From where I'd parked up at Sandwell Valley, the ruins were only a 10-minute walk away via a small, green footbridge over the M5.\n\nThe only unusual thing I'd spotted so far was a woman walking three-legged across the car park. There were also a number of peculiar 'MJ' graffiti tags. But alas, the area seemed quiet and untroubled. Turning left from my car, I embarked on a narrow footpath into a set of woods, with the footbridge just up ahead.\n\nOn the other side, a shower of golden leaves were floating to the ground from the towering trees. It was a picturesque autumn scene. Save for a man who came speeding past on an electric bike, there was no one about.\n\nThen a little robin came to say hello, flitting through the trees as I walked along the path next to a pristine-looking golf course. Further down the path, a man was perched on a mobility scooter with a long camera lens fixed up on the tree canopies above.\n\nFinally, just beyond him emerged the old ruins. There wasn't much to them. A number of information boards stood overlooking the medieval site, informing passers-by of its history. But there was a touching little memorial placed in the corner of the brickwork in memory of someone's mother.\n\nIt was hard to fathom how old the priory ruins actually were, standing amongst the stones. This dates back to the medieval period, not long after the Norman conquest of England.\n\nHaving taken in all that I could, I started heading back to my car. As I passed the man with the camera again, I asked: \"Have you ever seen anything spooky around here?\"\n\n\"No,\" he laughed. \"I don't believe in anything like that. But I hope I don't see anything out here,\" he added in a more stern tone. Just like Cannock Chase, this was another wooded area seeped in mystery. And I could see why it attracted wonder and intrigue.\n\nPast research by the paranormal group West Midlands Ghost Club had gathered together accounts of sightings believed to have been connected to the priory ruins. One motorist reported seeing a 'monk-like' figure walking along an unnamed road in the area before the entity simply 'vanished'.\n\n\"The person concerned was not alone but they happened to have been in the car with three other family members, with everyone sharing in the encounter,\" a spokesperson for the ghost club said. On other occasions, motorists had even reported their experiences to the police, such was their level of concern.\n\nThe paranormal group's spokesperson added: \"It seems, and usually entails people - using the section of motorway nearest to the priory ruins - either seeing monk-like figures in the cutting or sometimes having to swerve to avoid such phantoms. It is frequently claimed that the people concerned are not locals - and do not know of any spooky reputation to the area - and that a number of these experiences are reported to the police.\""

        "article_content": "It's always a great time to invest in quality businesses that can prime your portfolio for long-term growth. It's important to be selective with the companies that you add to your portfolio and ensure that you only put cash into investments that align with your overall investment priorities, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.\n\nYou should also only put cash to work that you can leave in your portfolio for a few years, not funds that you might soon need for bills or other financial obligations. On that note, if you're looking for top-notch growth stocks to buy right now and have $1,000 available to invest, here are two names to consider.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\n1. Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has been the darling of pharmaceutical stocks in the last 12 to 18 months, with shares rocketing upward as the popularity of its GLP-1 drugs has propelled revenue and earnings. Bear in mind, this is one of the oldest healthcare companies in the world, with a lineup of top-selling drugs across a range of disease categories that target everything from various cancers and cardiovascular ailments to endocrine disorders and neurological conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024 alone, shares roared upward to the tune of about 62%. After the company reported its earnings for the third quarter of 2024, shares took a double-digit nosedive as investors responded negatively to a few key points, including a slight pullback in full-year guidance. The company also reported financial figures that were slightly below what Wall Street had expected.\n\nIn terms of its full-year guidance, where Eli Lilly was targeting revenue for the 12-month period in the $45.4 billion to $46.6 billion range, the company is now projecting that it will deliver in the ballpark of $45.4 billion to $46 billion. Its Q3 revenue was around $800 million below what analysts had aimed for.\n\nThat being said, a closer look is warranted, and the long-term outlook for this business is anything but dismal. Revenue in Q3 2024 rose 20% year over year to $11.4 billion. The company sold rights for its olanzapine portfolio in Q3, featuring products used to treat ailments such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. If you exclude revenue from this portfolio, Eli Lilly's top line actually jumped 42% on a year-over-year basis, which is a bit more than the 36% growth it reported in the second quarter. The company also reported net income of approximately $970 million in Q3.\n\nTirzepatide, which is the main active ingredient in its top-selling drugs Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), is being studied by Eli Lilly across multiple other disease areas. For example, positive phase 3 trial data from a 176-week study of tirzepatide demonstrated a 94% reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults with pre-diabetes who are obese or overweight.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnother first-of-its-kind study initiated by Eli Lilly has been studying tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity. In this phase 3 trial, tirzepatide reduced heart failure symptoms and physical limitations while lowering the risk of worsening heart failure events by 38%. Risk of hospitalization for heart failure was also reduced by 56% in trial patients taking tirzepatide. In short, the future revenue and profit opportunities from tirzepatide may be in the very early innings.\n\nIn Q3, sales of Mounjaro rose more than 121% year over year to $3.1 billion, while Zepbound (which was just approved last November) raked in $1.3 billion in sales. This was despite negative effects for both drugs cited by Eli Lilly that were caused by inventory decreases in the wholesaler channel. Blockbuster cancer drug Verzenio generated $1.37 billion in sales in the quarter, up 32% from one year ago, while sales of autoimmune disease drug Taltz jumped 18% to $879.6 million.\n\nWhile investors appear to be particularly reactionary in the current environment, that can present an opportunity for those with a sufficient buy-and-hold horizon to take a slice of the action. While Eli Lilly doesn't trade at a cheap valuation by any means, its annual dividend of $5.20 and steady increase to its payout can augment total investor returns. Investors who want to become part-owner in a top healthcare business with a steady global footprint may be remiss to overlook this quality stock.\n\n2. Monday.com\n\nMonday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY) is a low-code and no-code platform that helps organizations build the work management tools and software applications they need to ensure business operations run smoothly. The company derives its revenue from monthly or annual subscription agreements that it enters into with customers who use its cloud-based platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMonday.com's software enables everything from project management and collaboration to helping keep tools and files in a single location for easy access. Clients with little to no coding experience can leverage its platform to develop customized workflow apps featuring boards, charts, and other important automation solutions.\n\nCompanies like Canva, Lionsgate, and Coca-Cola are just a handful of the big names on Monday.com's client roster. Investors have been particularly optimistic about Monday.com's performance recently, with shares skyrocketing to the tune of about 50% over the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAs always, share price is never a reason to buy (or sell) a stock. You need to look at the underlying business, its drivers and detractors of growth, its financial performance, its industry, and its long-term growth runway to gain a clear picture of whether it's a wise fit for your portfolio. In the case of Monday.com, the company has only been in business since 2012, so it's still in the relatively early stages of its potential growth story.\n\nManagement estimates that the company operates in a large and growing total addressable market, which could hit a valuation of $150 billion by the year 2026. The diverse range of solutions that Monday.com's platform offers allows it to target various segments of its overall market opportunity, including the $30 billion customer relationship management (CRM) software market.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Monday.com is doing quite well. Its third-quarter revenue rose 33% from the year-ago period to $251 million, and the company officially surpassed the $1 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) mark. Its overall net dollar retention rate (NRR) increased to 111%, while NRR for customers with more than $100,000 in ARR was 115%.\n\nThe number of paid customers with more than $100,000 in ARR jumped 44% from one year ago. Meanwhile, the company's second-largest customer, which is an unnamed international technology company, more than doubled its seat count to 60,000 from 25,000. Although Monday.com is not profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), cash flow is another core profitability metric to consider.\n\nFrom a free cash flow perspective, the company raked in $82.4 million of free cash flow, while net cash provided by operating activities was $86.6 million in Q3. While investors may need a certain level of risk tolerance to invest in software stocks, this resilient business looks like a compelling addition to a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "article_content": "They still don\u2019t get it.\n\nWhile President-elect Trump is working overtime assembling his White House cabinet, Democrats in some circles are still concocting ways to elevate Kamala Harris.\n\nThey need to follow the advice of ice queen Elsa from the movie \u201cFrozen.\u201d\n\nLet it go.\n\nOne nutty idea has President Biden resigning from office and allowing Harris to take over and become the 47th president before Trump steps up in January and lays claim to the number.\n\n\u201cHe could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris the president of the United States,\u201d Jamal Simmons, Harris\u2019 former communications director, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nIf the goal is to disrupt some of Trump\u2019s merchandising, it\u2019s a great idea.\n\nAll the red MAGA hats and t-shirts that say \u201c47\u201d would have to be changed to \u201c48.\u201d\n\nBut if the goal is to move the needle forward for a party that lost the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, it has that closing-the-barn-door-after-the-horses-get-out feel to it.\n\nThe time for Biden to have resigned was over the summer, when the momentum of history and incumbency could have done Harris some good.\n\nAll it would be now is a quirky consolation prize, which is the last thing America and Black women need.\n\nNearly as short-sighted is a long-shot plan to put Harris on the U.S. Supreme Court before Biden\u2019s term expires.\n\nThe problem with this plan is that there is no vacancy.\n\nTo create one, proponents suggest convincing Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 70, to step down because she has some health problems.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, died in the final months of Trump\u2019s presidency, allowing him to nominate Amy Coney Barrett and moving the Supreme Court to a 6-3 conservative majority that in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling.\n\nIn just four years, Trump was able to put three justices on the court.\n\nBiden has nominated only one person to the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the nation\u2019s female first Black Supreme Court justice.\n\nSotomayor, the senior member of the court\u2019s liberal minority, has given no indication that she would go along with the plan, one that would do nothing to change the court\u2019s balance of power.\n\nBiden, who showed his own reluctance to step aside, doesn\u2019t appear likely to ask Sotomayor to give up her lifetime appointment.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to those types of decisions, those are personal decisions, regardless of if it\u2019s Justice Sotomayor or any other justice on the bench,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in March, when the idea of targeting Sotomayor\u2019s seat was first floated.\n\nThis is backwards thinking.\n\nIf the Democrats, Biden included, were so determined to keep Trump from having another opportunity to put someone on the court, they should have come up with a better strategy \u2014 and message \u2014 to keep him out of the White House again.\n\nBut the damage has been done, and no amount of resignation roulette is going to fix it.\n\nThese aren\u2019t real ideas. They\u2019re internet memes. They\u2019re intricate plots for streaming political dramas on Hulu or Netflix. They are page-turning fiction novels.\n\nThey\u2019re candy.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is appointing his cabinet. Next on his list of nominees is probably the My Pillow guy.\n\nWhat the Democrats have needed to do, from the moment the electoral votes were counted, was start looking and planning ahead.\n\nNo more wound licking. No more finger pointing.\n\nNo more kooky ideas.\n\nKamala Harris fought a great fight. But she lost. It\u2019s over.\n\nIt\u2019s time to let it go.\n\nLeonard Greene is a columnist with the New York Daily News."
