            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch ads or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Lawyer Pierre Dewitte, a privacy advocate whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

            "article_content": "Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh govt may soon launch the AI-based Janani Mitra healthcare app for pregnant women across the state. The app, currently being piloted in Kundair mandal of Anantapur district, focuses on key service delivery parameters for pregnant women, including their nutrition and overall well-being.The AAIM (Alliance for Artificial Intelligence and Medtech) consortium, comprising the Asian Healthcare Foundation-AIG Hospitals, AMTZ Vizag, Indian School of Business, and IIIT Hyderabad, entered into a memorandum of understanding with state govt on Friday during the DeepTech/GovTech Conclave held in Visakhapatnam. Dr D Nageshwar Reddy, chairman of the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology and AIG Hospitals, serves as the chairman of AAIM, while Dr Prateek Sarma, president of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and chairman of the AI Institute in the USA, is the advisor of the AAIM.Explaining the initiative to TOI, Dr Rakesh Kalpala, director of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Innovation at AIG Hospitals, said that AP govt is already offering robust maternal and postpartum healthcare.\"However, there are some gaps in the connection between the mother and the associated services. The app acts as a smart companion for the mother, including giving SOS alerts, a food scanner, and more. The scanner allows the mother to scan her food and track how many calories she is consuming,\" said Dr Rakesh.\"This AI-based app provides health and medication monitoring, diagnostics, and connects mothers to Ashas (accredited social health activists) and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwives), as well as dietary care and other govt benefits. As rural areas often lack sufficient network coverage, the app has been designed as a simple progressive web app that can be accessed with just a click of a button,\" added Dr Rakesh.The app also leverages advanced AI technology to detect early signs of anaemia. By taking pictures of their eyes, tongue, and nails, mothers can undergo an early detection process for anaemia. If anaemia is detected, an alert will be sent to the respective Ashas and ANMs.Another challenge addressed by the app is tracking whether the services have been provided to the mothers. When an Asha visits a mother or when a mother goes to an ultrasound facility, this information can be captured and tracked through the app, ensuring that all services are delivered appropriately."

In this exclusive Q&A, insights from founders and Marketing leaders reveal groundbreaking ways AI is being used creatively in the industry. With nineteen expert opinions, the discussion kicks off with using AI for cultural bridge-building and concludes with tailoring GPTs for platform-specific content. Discover how these innovative approaches can elevate your brand\u2019s online presence.\n\nUse AI for Cultural Bridge-Building\n\nElevate Engagement with Hyper-Targeted Content\n\nCreate Hyper-Personalized Content for Audiences\n\nCraft Real-Time Trend Hijacking Campaigns\n\nLeverage AI for Dynamic Personalized Ads\n\nTurn Reviews into Testimonial Videos\n\nEnhance Human-Centered Design with AI\n\nStreamline Content Creation with AI\n\nRevolutionize Marketing with AI Copilot\n\nBrainstorm and Tailor Messaging with AI\n\nSpeed Up LinkedIn Post Creation\n\nAutomate Blog-Based Social Media Posts\n\nUtilize AI for Campaign Planning\n\nMonitor Conversations with AI Sentiment Analysis\n\nRestructure Content Strategy with AI Insights\n\nCurate Content for Multichannel Engagement\n\nCreate Stunning Visuals with Canva\u2019s AI\n\nIdentify Micro-Influencers with AI Analysis\n\nTailor GPTs for Platform-Specific Content\n\nUse AI for Cultural Bridge-Building\n\nRather than chasing viral trends or relying on AI-generated content, we\u2019ve revolutionized our social media strategy by using AI as a cultural bridge-builder. Our proprietary sentiment analysis system doesn\u2019t just track mentions\u2014it identifies cultural nuances and regional preferences across our markets. This insight helps our human team craft authentically localized content that resonates deeply in each region.\n\nFor instance, we discovered that our East Coast audience engages most with sustainability-focused content early in the week, while our West Coast followers respond better to innovation stories shared during evening commute hours. AI helps us optimize these timing patterns while our creative team develops market-specific narratives that feel native to each region.\n\nThe results speak volumes: 47% increase in cross-regional engagement and a 3x boost in qualified lead generation. Most importantly, we\u2019ve built genuine connections with diverse audience segments who now see us as a brand that truly understands their unique perspectives and values.\n\nThe key is using AI as an insights engine to empower human creativity, not replace it. Let AI handle the heavy lifting of pattern recognition while your team focuses on crafting authentic, regionally relevant stories that forge real emotional connections. This approach transforms social media from a broadcast channel into a powerful tool for building genuine relationships.\n\nSolomon Thimothy\n\nPresident, OneIMS\n\nElevate Engagement with Hyper-Targeted Content\n\nWe used AI to elevate a client\u2019s social media strategy by creating hyper-targeted, engaging content at scale. One specific campaign leveraged AI-driven sentiment analysis to craft personalized replies to hundreds of customer comments. The AI analyzed tone, intent, and keywords in comments, allowing us to respond with tailored messages that resonated on an emotional level, boosting engagement by 40% within a month.\n\nIn another instance, we trained an AI model to generate short-form videos from existing long-form content. For a fitness brand, this meant repurposing webinar footage into bite-sized clips optimized for Instagram Reels and TikTok. The AI identified key moments, added subtitles, and suggested captions based on trending keywords. This approach not only saved hours of manual editing but also increased video reach by 300%, proving how AI can amplify content creation while maintaining relevance and authenticity.\n\nBrandon Leibowitz\n\nOwner, SEO Optimizers\n\nCreate Hyper-Personalized Content for Audiences\n\nWe\u2019ve used AI to make social media marketing more effective and engaging by creating hyper-personalized content for different audiences.\n\nThis involved launching a campaign to promote our data analytics platform to marketers from various industries, such as retail, tech, and finance. We used AI to analyze large sets of audience data, including interests, demographics, and past engagement patterns. Based on this, we identified what each audience segment cared about most. For instance, retail marketers wanted insights on customer behavior trends, while finance teams were focused on ROI tracking.\n\nNext, we fed this data into an AI-powered content generator to create customized social media posts tailored to each segment. For retail marketers, the posts highlighted features like predictive analytics for customer behavior. For finance professionals, we focused on how our platform tracks and boosts ROI. AI also helped suggest optimal hashtags, posting times, and even visual styles to increase engagement.\n\nHowever, we didn\u2019t stop there. We used AI-driven sentiment analysis, to track real-time responses to the campaign. This allowed us to quickly tweak the messaging or visuals for underperforming posts, ensuring every part of the campaign stayed relevant and engaging.\n\nThe result? A significant increase in engagement rates and higher-quality leads from social media. By using AI, we transformed our digital marketing efforts into a smarter, data-driven process that spoke directly to the needs of different audiences. It showed how AI can take personalization to the next level in a creative and impactful way.\n\nIra Prevalova\n\nGrowth Marketing Director, Adverity\n\nCraft Real-Time Trend Hijacking Campaigns\n\nAs a Social Media Marketer, I used AI to craft a \u201creal-time trend hijacking\u201d campaign for a food brand. The AI tool tracked trending keywords and memes, then came up with witty, brand-relevant content within minutes. For instance, during a viral meme trend, the AI created a post featuring our signature burger with the trending meme format, which we quickly shared. The post went viral, gaining 150K+ engagements in 24 hours and driving a 40% increase in web traffic to the brand\u2019s delivery page.\n\nShalu Sharma\n\nSocial Media Manager, BigOhTech\n\nLeverage AI for Dynamic Personalized Ads\n\nWe leveraged AI to create dynamic, personalized content for social media ads. Using AI tools like ChatGPT and Canva\u2019s AI design features, we crafted tailored captions and visuals based on user demographics, browsing behavior, and past purchase history. For example, we ran a campaign showcasing product recommendations, where AI analyzed customer preferences to generate hyper-personalized ad copy and visuals. This creative use of AI allowed us to automate A/B testing for ad variations, optimizing performance in real time. The campaign increased click-through rates by 25% and boosted engagement by fostering a more personalized connection with our audience.\n\nMuhammad Nurul Afsar\n\nSEO Manager, Numinix\n\nTurn Reviews into Testimonial Videos\n\nRecruitment marketing is where we really get to have fun with AI for social media. We took our best Glassdoor reviews and turned them into testimonial videos using AI avatars. It took 5 minutes each, and we were able to highlight great employee comments that would otherwise never have been seen. We also promote specific jobs with AI avatars. Finally, we made some fun songs to promote specific jobs.\n\nBrooke Browne\n\nMarketing Director, Smartbridge\n\nEnhance Human-Centered Design with AI\n\nAs the visual designer leading marketing at a WOC-led digital design agency, we\u2019ve taken a thoughtful approach to AI integration, using it to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014our human-centered design process. Recently, we experimented with AI to help streamline our content versioning across platforms while maintaining our commitment to authentic, inclusive representation.\n\nWe use AI tools to help us quickly adapt our design messaging for different platform contexts\u2014taking a LinkedIn post and suggesting variations that would resonate better with our Instagram audience, for instance. However, we always ensure these AI suggestions go through our team\u2019s cultural and inclusivity lens before implementation. This hybrid approach has allowed us to maintain our authentic voice while increasing our content efficiency by about 32%.\n\nThe key lesson? AI works best as an enhancement to human creativity, not a replacement. We\u2019ve found the sweet spot lies in using AI for the heavy lifting of content adaptation, while keeping the core storytelling and inclusive design decisions firmly in human hands.\n\nAlexandra Brown\n\nVisual Designer, Oak Theory\n\nStreamline Content Creation with AI\n\nOur absolute favorite strategy is done in 4 steps:\n\nFirst, after we return from travel, we sit down and have a conversation about the trip and record it using Claude AI. With Claude, you can record up to 10 minutes, which can end up being around 1,000 words.\n\nThen we ask Claude to format the conversation into a blog post. We normally rework this draft further, moving sections around and generating components that will add maximum value to the reader, but we always ask the tool to retain our original wording as much as possible. This is very important.\n\nNext, we prompt the tool to give us recommendations on the existing content, and suggestions for additional content. As with all prompts, we make the tool aware of the audience we are writing for, and our goal, which is always to provide the best UX.\n\nAfter acting on the best recommendations, we then prompt the tool to create 5 posts for the various social media platforms we are on (e.g., Instagram and Tik Tok), getting inspiration for our style, voice, and language from the original transcript.\n\nWe begin the process with real experience followed by a real conversation. This is key because where you source content is critical for originality and uniqueness.\n\nThen, we use AI for efficiency, organization, and ideation. Our conversation becomes a blog, which is enhanced by an AI editing process. Our enhanced article becomes 5 distinct ideas for multiple social media posts.\n\nIdeation, efficiency, organization, and even creation (properly sourced) are all great uses of AI and this process has nearly eliminated the fatigue from writing, overthinking, and having to do some of these things manually, which allows us to put our energy into accumulating more experiences and ensuring our content is true to those experiences and delivers the most value to our readers.\n\nBrian Gorman\n\nOwner, BrianShio\n\nRevolutionize Marketing with AI Copilot\n\nOur organization has creatively implemented AI to revolutionize our social media marketing. Using our AI solution, OfficeIQ, we developed an AI copilot trained on our brand\u2019s specific tone, style, and marketing data. This copilot generates tailored social copies, articles, campaign ideas, and email drafts, all aligned with our brand voice, saving significant time and effort.\n\nAdditionally, our AI tool helps with sentiment analysis to evaluate the emotional impact of each post and track engagement metrics. By understanding the sentiment our content generates, we refine our strategy to create content that resonates more effectively with our audience.\n\nLata Tewari\n\nChief Marketing Officer, Webuters Technologies Pvt Ltd\n\nBrainstorm and Tailor Messaging with AI\n\nMy company has embraced AI in a big way to take our social media marketing efforts to the next level. One of the most impactful ways we\u2019ve used it is through tools like ChatGPT to help brainstorm post ideas, write captions, and even tailor messaging for different audiences. This has been a lifesaver during those inevitable creative blocks or when we needed a lot of content ideas quickly to keep our campaigns fresh and engaging. Using ChatGPT allowed us to stay consistent with our posting schedule and focus on strategy rather than spending endless hours coming up with concepts from scratch.\n\nOn top of that, we\u2019ve utilized tools like CarouselMaker.co to streamline the creation of carousel posts, which can typically be time-intensive to design. These tools sped up production significantly, making it easier to create visually engaging content without overloading our team or our budget.\n\nWhile we did sometimes sacrifice a little quality by relying on AI, the trade-off was worth it. It allowed us to produce content at scale, stay cost-effective, and meet the high demands of a fast-paced social media environment. For us, it\u2019s been all about striking the right balance between quality and efficiency, and AI has been a critical piece in making that happen.\n\nKyle Morris\n\nCEO / Founder, LawTurbo\n\nSpeed Up LinkedIn Post Creation\n\nAI has been an extremely valuable tool for our marketing team. While content writing itself is still best done by human hands, having an AI creative \u201cassistant\u201d has opened the door to new ideas and expedited workflows. Our strongest social media channel is LinkedIn. Using the OpenAI API platform, our marketing team created a LinkedIn Social Media assistant armed with the knowledge and training of our LinkedIn strategy. We use the assistant chatbot to grab key points from our high performing blog articles to repurpose them into LinkedIn posts. This was something we used to do manually, but the workflow is now significantly faster. Just plug in the article, make some quick edits to give it that human touch and ensure accuracy, and then your post is ready to go on your content calendar.\n\nJack Perkins\n\nFounder and CEO, CFO Hub\n\nAutomate Blog-Based Social Media Posts\n\nWe used AI in social media marketing by leveraging it to analyze our blog sitemap and generate new social media posts. The AI tool read through our existing blog content, identified key themes, and crafted posts along with relevant hashtags, making it easy and quick for us to promote our existing blogs.\n\nThis approach simplified our social media strategy by automating the process of content creation while ensuring each post stayed aligned with our brand and messaging. It saved us hours of manual effort and helped maintain a steady stream of engaging posts.\n\nMark London\n\nPresident/CEO, Verity IT\n\nUtilize AI for Campaign Planning\n\nWe don\u2019t use AI to generate content for our social media campaigns. However, we find it very helpful at the planning stages of our campaigns. For instance, we used AI for data analysis related to user behavior to figure out what kinds of content users find the most attractive on LinkedIn. Ultimately, these insights show what content people are more likely to engage with.\n\nWe saw that although LinkedIn is a more professional platform, unlike Instagram, for instance, users still tended to click on content that had elaborate visual elements. That\u2019s why I started making posts that would include aesthetically pleasing infographics, pictures, or even short videos. Because of this, engagement rates significantly increased.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes I really need to make a post to stay consistent, but I just can\u2019t come up with anything valuable. That\u2019s when I turn to AI and kind of brainstorm with it. It gives me ideas, and I spin them and give them a personal touch. Because social media is really all about authentic human connection, so using solely AI-generated content is a bad idea.\n\nRuslan Halilov\n\nCMO at Bluedothq, BluedotHQ\n\nMonitor Conversations with AI Sentiment Analysis\n\nWe used ChatGPT for social media listening, an integral aspect of social media marketing. For its natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, we incorporated ChatGPT to monitor social media conversations about our services through AI-driven sentiment analysis. It helped us understand consumer behaviors and perceptions to craft our marketing strategies accordingly.\n\nTrend detection is another feature that allows us to identify emerging trends and topics within our industry. By analyzing these trends, we can create timely, engaging content that aligns with our audience\u2019s demands.\n\nBusinesses who want to use ChatGPT for social media marketing should regularly update and refine training data to achieve accuracy in social media listening. Always assist with automated responses to improve personalization and experiment with different prompts to maximize their potential.\n\nSoubhik Chakrabarti\n\nCEO, Canada Hustle\n\nRestructure Content Strategy with AI Insights\n\nWe have been early testers and adopters of AI in social media marketing and have found prompts effective for organizational restructuring of content based on performance analytics. Proper prompts can give greater visibility to your competitors\u2019 social media content strategy, and you can revise your content strategy accordingly.\n\nMany mistakes we see as a digital agency are when individuals and executives try to use AI-generated content directly, replacing their own point of view. AI-generated content ranks differently, and human readers, who are familiar with large language model-generated content, can spot it. When content is thought out and represents new viewpoints or continues a narrative of executive points of view, an audience is engaged.\n\nThink of the visibility of competitors in a larger landscape, and about what their brand is \u201csaying\u201d digitally; this is what AI can capture in moments. It would take hours to compile this information, and the labor would also need to be trained. Use AI to compile data and provide a rough analysis through prompts, then base more complex strategy and content around the findings.\n\nMatthew Capala\n\nCEO, Alphametic\n\nCurate Content for Multichannel Engagement\n\nWe leverage AI for content curation. Maintaining an active presence on multiple social media platforms can be overwhelming. However, at the same time, you need to ensure a multichannel presence to engage your target audience, as you never know which platform they may prefer to explore the required information. AI-powered solutions come in handy here. They help us curate meaningful content from relevant information sources and acknowledge high engagement. Thanks to AI, we are able to share valuable information and insights consistently, generating more traction through social media platforms that align with the preferences of our target audience.\n\nThomas Griffin\n\nCo-Founder & President, OptinMonster\n\nCreate Stunning Visuals with Canva\u2019s AI\n\nWe\u2019ve been diving headfirst into Canva\u2019s AI tools, and let me tell you, it\u2019s been a game-changer for our social media visuals. It\u2019s incredible how AI can take a simple idea and transform it into stunning graphics. We recently used Canva\u2019s AI image generator to create a series of visuals for a social media campaign promoting a client\u2019s new product. We simply fed the AI a few keywords and descriptions, and it generated a variety of images that were not only relevant but also incredibly eye-catching.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive is how Canva\u2019s AI allows us to customize these images to perfectly align with our brand and messaging. We can tweak the colors, adjust the composition, and add text overlays\u2014all within Canva\u2019s user-friendly interface. It\u2019s like having a personal artist on demand, but without the hefty price tag. This AI-powered approach has allowed us to create visually compelling social media content that truly stands out from the crowd. It\u2019s not just about pretty pictures; it\u2019s about using AI to amplify our creativity and connect with our audience on a deeper level.\n\nMichael Lazar\n\nCEO, Content Author\n\nIdentify Micro-Influencers with AI Analysis\n\nWe used AI to analyze thousands of influencer profiles to identify micro-influencers with the highest relevance and engagement for our clients\u2019 campaigns. This went beyond simple follower counts, factoring in sentiment, audience overlap, and niche appeal. The curated partnerships led to authentic collaborations that resonated deeply with audiences, driving both brand awareness and trust. AI helped us shift from broad reach to meaningful, targeted impact.\n\nJason Hennessey\n\nCEO, Hennessey Digital\n\nTailor GPTs for Platform-Specific Content\n\nIn my Web3 marketing agency, we\u2019ve used custom GPTs creatively for social media marketing by tailoring each model to reflect our clients\u2019 unique voices across different platforms. Each GPT is trained on the client\u2019s brand messaging, tone, and past content, enabling it to generate optimized posts for specific channels like LinkedIn, Twitter, or Instagram.\n\nFor example, for a Web3 client targeting thought leadership on LinkedIn and casual community engagement on Twitter, the custom GPT crafted professional, data-driven posts for LinkedIn while creating shorter, conversational tweets for Twitter. This allowed the client to maintain consistency in their messaging while adapting to the distinct audience expectations of each platform. The result was increased engagement and a streamlined content creation process, freeing up resources for strategy and analytics.\n\nvictoria olsina\n\nWeb3 SEO Agency Founder, VictoriaOlsina.com"

            "article_content": "Lake Enigma is located in Antartica's Victoria Land\n\nBizarre microbes found in a lake in Antarctica have provided key insights into how life on other planets may have developed. A study published by the Italian National Research Council published in Communications Earth & Environment, a peer-reviewed journal, suggests, in contrast to what was previous believed, Lake Enigma, located in Antarctica\u2019s Victoria Land, does in fact contain liquid water. The study was led by scientists from the Institute of Polar Sciences of the Italian National Research Council (CNR-ISP). The team includes prominent researchers like Dr Maurizio Azzaro and Dr Angelina Lo Giudice, who specialise in microbial ecology and polar environments. Scientists used advanced ground-penetrating radar and drilled through the ice during an Italian Antarctic expedition in 2019-2020 to confirm the existence of liquid water.\n\nEuropa: Professor discusses 'potential life' on Jupiter's moon\n\nThe lake's isolation from external elements, including extreme cold and lack of sunlight, has created a unique, closed microbial environment. The study also uncovered \"ultrasmall\" bacteria from the superphylum Patescibacteria, which are known for their minimal cellular activity but play critical roles in the lake's ecosystem. Their discovery of microscopic lifeforms has exciting implications for both Earth sciences and astrobiology. This isolated environment, locked under ice for around 20,000 years, contains liquid water and hosts extremophiles - microorganisms capable of surviving extreme cold, low nutrients and high pressure.\n\nTrending\n\nThe launch of the Europa Clipper mission in October\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their discovery underscores the resilience of life and broadens the understanding of where it might exist. It highlights water as a key solvent for life, not only on Earth but potentially on other icy worlds like Europa and Enceladus. The chemical and energy processes in Lake Enigma provide a parallel for studying similar extraterrestrial environments where liquid water is present beneath icy crusts. The Galilean moon of Europa for example is thought to have a sizeable lake beneath its frozen surface.\n\nEuropa is believed to have a subsurface ocean"

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.\n\nFeatured Video For You 10 mind-blowing discoveries from the James Webb Telescope"

Speed is important, but to be the best, antivirus software must also vigorously safeguard your computer from cybersecurity threats.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nI reviewed Eset Premium to find out if it offers robust malware protection, an easy-to-use interface, and responsive customer service. I also checked out the subscription options to find out if there\u2019s enough value for the money.\n\nSpecs\n\nEset Premium Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 1+ (Essential, Premium), 5+(Ultimate) Support Chat, Email, Phone Free version? No\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nEset offers flexible pricing with options to add more devices and extend the subscription term to enjoy a lower price.\n\nThe $50-per-year Essential plan is the least expensive, providing real-time malware protection, a network firewall, and PC cleanup tools. A $60 Premium subscription includes a password manager, ransomware protection, and file encryption. Both tiers cover one device, and more can be added for $5 each.\n\nThe top tier is the $130 Ultimate plan, starting with protection for five devices plus $5 for each additional computer or phone. It includes an unlimited VPN, image metadata removal, and dark web monitoring.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bargain, we have a guide to the best deals on antivirus software. High-quality security doesn\u2019t have to be expensive.\n\nYou can try Eset Essential or Premium free for 30 days, but Ultimate requires a paid subscription. Eset offers some basic malware scanner and removal tools, but there are better free antivirus apps.\n\nDesign\n\nI began Eset setup on the website welcome page, which showed my active subscription. I selected the Protect device to start the download to my Windows PC.\n\nThe installer offered some customization options. I enabled Eset LiveGrid and customer experience, which uses anonymous data from my computer to help strengthen protection and improve usability for all Eset customers. I left the unwanted application detection off, since I prefer to manage that myself.\n\nA quick tour briefly highlighted a few features, while an initial scan run to identify any malware on my computer. Despite my choice to skip unwanted app detection, a popup window suggested that I might want to \u201cclean\u201d an app I\u2019d intentionally downloaded. I chose to ignore the warning.\n\nEset\u2019s Premium app gives an overview of my security status. A green checkmark indicates real-time protection is active. The left sidebar has tabs for malware scans, software updates, tools, settings, account details, and support.\n\nPremium comes with a password manager, ransomware protection, data encryption, network inspection, and browser protection. The app has a confusing number of options. I left the default settings for most.\n\nBy the time setup was complete, the computer scan finished and alerted me to several more apps that I recognized and wanted to keep.\n\nFeatures\n\nAccording to independent security lab AV-Comparatives, Eset Premium performed well in 2024 but failed to offer good security in previous years. Out of a possible three stars, Eset earned a single star in real-time malware protection tests conducted from July to October 2023.\n\nI usually refer to AV-Test when checking the track record of antivirus software. While the 2024 results show excellent malware prevention, there are big gaps in evaluations from December 2021 to February 2024.\n\nFor the best protection, an antivirus solution like Norton 360 boasts a near-perfect protection record that spans several years.\n\nI spot-checked browser protection by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. Eset Premium successfully identified and blocked all 13 threats, in each case opening a new tab to alert me to the danger. For perspective, it\u2019s worth noting the free antivirus Microsoft Defender blocks Wicar threats also.\n\nI also tested the password manager, which asked me to create a master password, different from my Eset login, to unlock the vault. It\u2019s quite basic, automatically filling logins on websites where I have an account. The best password managers are much more advanced with login sharing, folders to organize accounts, and secure storage for files and photos.\n\nSupport\n\nEset Premium\u2019s help tab offers 24/7 technical support via an AI. In my tests, it was very responsive and could help with simple questions. However, the chatbot was easily stumped, reporting it doesn\u2019t have the requested information and supplying tangential links that didn\u2019t help.\n\nIf you expect quick responses from a real support agent, I found Bitdefender\u2019s customer service to be among the best. It\u2019s also a low-cost antivirus with a great track record.\n\nThe AI was able to provide the live chat hours, 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT. I tried again during normal hours, and the chatbot said no agents were available. However, it provided a link to a contact page that had a button for live chat.\n\nIf you use Eset, don\u2019t trust the AI to connect you to a human. Go to Eset\u2019s contact page. A live agent came on quickly and was able to answer my questions. Overall, support is good, despite the AI glitch.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEset\u2019s privacy policy says your data is only used to provide the services you pay for. It\u2019s only shared with third-party companies that assist with customer support, billing, and other services related to your subscription.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s internal security seems robust, BleepingComputer reported Eset\u2019s exclusive partner Comsecure was breached. Hackers were able to target Eset customers in a brief (10 minutes) but malicious phishing campaign.\n\nIs Eset right for you?\n\nEset is fast and offers good protection in 2024, but it has a checkered track record. While leading antivirus software blocks threats year after year with few lapses, independent security labs found Eset allowed some malware in several tests between 2021 to 2023.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for protection without impacting performance, there are some better options that make the cut for the best antivirus software for gaming PCs."
