            "article_content": "The rising panic over mystery drones swarming the skies of Mid-Atlantic states reminds us that, in the centuries-long hunt to identify UFOs, humans are usually the weakest link. America has real national-security challenges in the new era of unmanned aerial vehicles in warfare. But an invasion of mystery drones over New Jersey isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAs it turns out, just as eyewitnesses often bungle the details of, say, a car accident on the corner, we are notoriously unreliable when it comes to identifying and reporting UFOs. A huge percentage of \u201csightings\u201d turn out, upon investigation, to be the planet Venus or other surprisingly bright astronomical phenomena; people on the ground regularly misjudge distances in the sky so that even objects miles away are perceived to be close by.\n\nThe UFO mistaken-identity problem is a big part of the reason that the military and scientists now refer to such sightings more precisely as UAP, or unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 a label meant to capture that many sightings might not be \u201cobjects\u201d at all but are more likely to be known, or as yet unknown, astronomical and atmospheric phenomena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven skilled aviators make mistakes. On Oct. 1, 1948, Lt. George Gorman, a World War II veteran and pilot in the North Dakota Air National Guard, gave chase in his P-51 fighter after spotting the bright light of a UFO race past him in the skies over Fargo. At speeds of over 400 mph, he engaged it in a dogfight for nearly 30 minutes, the ball-shaped UFO bobbing and weaving around him as it executed turns that he felt were aerodynamically impossible. He finally broke off the engagement, never identifying the bogey. \u201cJust when we were about to collide, I guess I got scared,\u201d he told investigators, adding later: \u201cIt is hard to believe your own eyes when something with no wings walks off and leaves you standing still.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later determined that Gorman had been chasing a weather balloon launched about 10 minutes before he spotted it. The balloon had simply been floating along in the night sky, and he\u2019d been diving and racing all around it.\n\nJ. Allen Hynek, the astronomer and godfather of \u201cufology,\u201d who spent a quarter-century working with the Air Force on its UFO studies and coined the phrase \u201cclose encounters of the third kind,\u201d told an interviewer late in his career, \u201cPilots have been known to swerve their planes violently when they suddenly encounter a very bright meteor they think is on a collision course, but which later proves to have been 50 to 100 miles away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people who are serious about studying UAP are trying to get humans out of the reporting loop: At a congressional hearing last summer, Ryan Graves \u2014 a former Navy aviator who had his own experiences encountering UAP and now leads an advocacy organization called Americans for Safe Aerospace \u2014 proposed a more reliable alternative to the grainy, black-and-white (but supposedly revealing) photos that dot the internet: sensors. Similarly, Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb, one of the leading voices in UAP studies, argues that we need to far better understand what a \u201cregular\u201d sky looks like before trying to determine what\u2019s \u201canomalous.\u201d As Loeb told me last year: \u201cTrust in data. People are a waste of time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the self-centered confidence that underlies so many UFO reports, that people\u2019s first instinct upon spotting a bright, moving light in the night sky is not to assume the obvious \u2014 say, a star, meteor, satellite or faraway jetliner \u2014 but instead to imagine that, after an alien craft journeyed thousands of light-years across interstellar space to visit Earth, the aliens would pick that moment on a random Tuesday night to reveal themselves to someone on a dark, rural road or in a suburban backyard. Occam\u2019s razor, the useful medieval theory that argues the simplest explanation is usually the best, would tell you that the sound of hoofbeats more likely means horses than zebras.\n\nPartly, that instinct stems from something fundamental. The question \u201cAre we alone?\u201d is one of the three most basic questions that have fascinated humans since the first caveman campfires, a question that ranks alongside \u201cWhat happens after death?\u201d and \u201cIs there a God?\u201d as the most profound and potentially life-altering mysteries we wrestle with. Who wouldn\u2019t want to knock out an answer to one of the Big Three while taking out the garbage late at night?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, our cultural fascination with UFOs stems from the fact that it is a rare area where we can all gaze upon the deepest frontier of knowledge. As an ordinary person, I can\u2019t add much to the already-advanced scientific and mathematical questions of our time: I\u2019m not liable to crack string theory wide open during a weekend barbecue, nor is my tinkering in the garage likely to deliver to humanity the secret to nuclear fusion."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

For example, the company recently gave Gemini the ability to summarize Drive folders to provide a quick overview. We\u2019ve also recently discovered that the company is working on an AI-powered \u201cCall To-do List\u201d function. In its latest initiative, it looks like we could start seeing AI search suggestions in the Google app on iOS.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhile exploring the Google app on iOS, we noticed something interesting. Sitting neatly in the search box was a new pencil icon. Tapping on this icon opens up a new page with a text box and a few suggestions, as seen in the screenshots below.\n\nWhen you begin typing in this text box, you\u2019ll see the Gemini icon below along with text that reads \u201cGenerate AI suggestions.\u201d Once enough words are in the field, it automatically starts generating suggestions based on your query. You can then select these suggestions to narrow down your search, working like filters.\n\nYou can see an example in the video above where we asked for help buying a gift. The suggestions that were generated provided options for \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201cgift occasion,\u201d and \u201crelationship to recipient.\u201d So you could select \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201cunder $50,\u201d and \u201cbirthday\u201d to get search results for an affordable birthday gift for your friend.\n\nIt appears this feature is still in beta testing, however, as it doesn\u2019t work properly quite yet. In the video below, you can see the feature struggling to work.\n\nThis feature could possibly save users some time, as they would not have to type out these commonly used keywords to get the results they are looking for.

Notably, this feature is not available in either the global version of the app or its beta version, hinting that the company is still developing it.\n\nGoogle App for iOS Could Get a New AI Feature\n\nAccording to an Android Authority report, Google is testing a new AI suggestions feature for its iOS app. The publication found the feature during a teardown of the Google app. A new pencil icon was reportedly added next to the camera and microphone icon in the text field of the app.\n\nAI suggestions feature in Google app for iOS\n\nPhoto Credit: Android Authority\n\nThis pencil icon is said to open the AI suggestions interface for users. In a video recording, the publication showcased how the feature could work. On tapping the pencil icon, a larger full-screen interface with a larger text box opens. When a user begins typing their search query in it, the Gemini icon appears below with the text \u201cGenerate AI suggestions\u201d.\n\nAs per the publication's video, once enough words have been typed to let the AI understand the context, it begins showing related words in three rows (thematically separated) that users can select to filter their search results.\n\nFor instance, if a user types \u201cbuying a birthday gift\u201d, Gemini might generate suggestions where the first row will be words for different budgets, the second row could be words for occasions, and the third could be about the relationship with the person. So, users can select \u201cless than Rs. 5,000\u201d, \u201canniversary\u201d, and \u201cwife\u201d and see search results from websites that offer information on these specific keywords.\n\nAs mentioned above, the feature is reportedly under testing and the publication was not able to get it to work, likely due to the server side of the feature not being active. There is no word on when the feature might be released on iOS, and if an Android version is also in the works."

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, Verizon Communications Inc VZ announced a new solution developed with Nvidia Corp NVDA that enables a wide range of AI applications to run over Verizon\u2019s reliable 5G private network with private Mobile Edge Compute (MEC).\n\nThe new AI-powered private 5G platform stack is an infrastructure developed by Verizon and Nvidia that is designed to plug and play, helping third-party developers innovate while accommodating future evolutions in AI computing and various AI and connectivity applications.\n\nIt can provide these services remotely via portable private network solutions or on a customer\u2019s premises with a permanent private network.\n\nAlso Read: Walmart Teams Up With China\u2019s Meituan to Boost E-Commerce\n\nThe stack can handle compute-intensive apps, including Generative AI large language models and Vision Language Models, Video streaming, broadcast management, Computer Vision (CV), Augmented/Virtual/Extended Reality (AR/VR/XR), Autonomous Mobile Robot/ Automated Guided Vehicle (AMR/AGV), and IoT.\n\nVerizon engineers will begin demonstrations of this solution in early 2025.\n\nSrini Kalapala, Senior Vice President of Technology and Product Development at Verizon, acknowledged leveraging its private networks and Verizon\u2019s global industry leadership in private MEC, combined with Nvidia\u2019s AI computing capabilities to enable real-time AI applications that require security, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth.\n\nRonnie Vasishta, Senior Vice president of Telecom at Nvidia, noted Verizon\u2019s integration of Nvidia\u2019s full-stack AI platform into its new solution for running AI workloads on private 5G networks as a big step forward in helping enterprises of all sizes reach their business objectives faster with AI.\n\nIn October, Keybanc analyst Brandon Nispel downgraded Verizon stock from Overweight to Sector Weight following weaker-than-expected quarterly print.\n\nNispel flagged Verizon\u2019s potential acquisition of Frontier Communications Parent, Inc FYBR as restricting its ability to repurchase shares soon, which could otherwise generate over 6% yield. He also highlighted slowing improvements in postpaid phone net additions and higher device subsidies, indicating higher costs.\n\nPrice action: VZ stock is down 0.02% at $40.87 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nImage via Shutterstock"

            "article_content": "If you haven\u2019t heard about the thousands of mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey in recent weeks, you might be living under a rock. Or are you living under \u2026 a drone? Or several of them? Some Maricopa residents believe so.\n\nIt\u2019s a bird! It\u2019s a drone! It\u2019s a cop? Seriously, what are these things?\n\nThe FBI, Department of Homeland Security, state police and other agencies have launched investigations into the recent torrent of inexplicable drone sightings.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said Monday that there has yet to be any public safety or national security risk identified in any of the drone sightings. He said that officials believe they were lawfully flown drones, planes or stars.\n\nBut that seemingly did little to abate UFO anxiety here on the opposite side of the country, where three reported sightings in Maricopa and Hidden Valley have been posted to the social networking site Nextdoor in as many days.\n\nRancho El Dorado resident Marcus Griffin posted Sunday about his own drone sighting.\n\n\u201cI will add to the HYPE: Has anyone ever paid attention to the DRONE activity around Maricopa at night?\u201d Griffin questioned. \u201cI live in the back of [Rancho El Dorado] adjacent to the farmer fields and I see large drones operating on a regular.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Nextdoor user Nevaeh P., who lives on the east side, posted a photo and video of \u201corbs\u201d she saw while on her way to Phoenix.\n\n\u201cI have seen lots of weird stuff in the sky but over the past few years it seems there\u2019s been more and more paranormal activity to the point where it\u2019s not ignorable anymore,\u201d Nevaeh said. \u201cA few hours [after] I recorded this, I went on TikTok, and my feed was overflowing with videos similar to mine. Of course, our phones listen to us, so maybe it was just feeding into my delusions but it\u2019s weird how everyone else in the world is seeing or experiencing the same things!\u201d\n\nThe most recent post came yesterday from a Hidden Valley user who said she had for weeks been hearing about a Standfield drone group flying for several hours at night with detailed sightings.\n\nThe user attached a screenshot sourced from the r/AskLEO (law enforcement officer) subreddit that she said might \u2018explain\u2019 the sightings.\n\n\u201cPinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Eloy Police Department have added drones to patrol and run surveillance for certain investigations,\u201d said the Reddit user u/Nervous_Comb_8047.\n\nInMaricopa contacted the Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office to see if this was accurate.\n\nPCSO spokeswoman Lauren Reimer said the sheriff\u2019s office uses drones for these specific purposes (neither surveillance nor patrol is one of them):\n\nScene documentation to record evidence from a crime scene or traffic accident from above.\n\nDuring active SWAT incidents to monitor suspect activity around and inside a home or building where a suspect is barricaded, as well as to clear the building before, during and/or after a high-risk arrest.\n\nAerial searches to follow or search for a wanted suspect when the perimeter is known, and air support (helicopter) may be far away or unavailable.\n\nSearch and rescue operations when searching for missing or injured hikers, etc.\n\n\u201cPCSO does not use drones for daily patrol operations,\u201d Reimer confirmed.\n\nSo, the next time you see a post about another drone or \u201corb\u201d sighting, or you see one yourself, keep in mind it might just be PCSO trying to keep people safe. Or, hey, it could be aliens."

Visitors to this 19th-century Gothic mansion in Neath Port Talbot have long shared eerie tales of spectral figures, unexplained laughter, and objects that seem to move of their own accord.\n\nFrom the vengeful ghost of a murdered gamekeeper to the echoes of Victorian children\u2019s laughter, Margam Castle has earned its reputation as one of the most haunted places in Britain.\n\nREAD MORE: Fire service issues update after massive blaze at industrial site in Pontardawe\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: Boots shoppers snap up half price designer perfume that's 'sophistication in a bottle'\n\nBut the castle\u2019s haunting is just one layer of its story. As Dave explains, \u201cWe\u2019re on a historic site here at Margam, one that has been permanently occupied for at least 4,000 years.\u201d\n\nFrom the Bronze Age through to Roman times, and later the founding of the Cistercian Abbey in the 12th century, this site has seen centuries of human life\u2014and, perhaps, lingering spirits.\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park, a gorgeous 1,000-acre South Wales estate in the Neath Port Talbot region, also known as the 'Dramatic heart of Wales'.\n\nThe castle, built between 1830 and 1840 by architect Thomas Hopper for Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot, is a striking example of Tudor-Gothic architecture. \u201cIf you look up at the ceiling,\u201d Dave points out on tours, \u201cyou\u2019ll see the initials CRMT\u2014Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot\u2014very proud of his ancestry and heritage.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Talbot family owned the estate until 1942 when the castle fell into disrepair following a devastating fire in 1977.\n\nThe council owns the property today, and ongoing restoration work ensures its grandeur is preserved.\n\nDespite the fire\u2019s destruction, many original features remain, from the intricate stone carvings to the elegant stained glass windows, which, as Dave explains, \u201cdate back to when the house was built, almost 200 years ago.\u201d\n\nWhile the castle impresses with its architecture and history, its eerie ghost stories draw in thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.\n\nThe ghost of Robert Scott\n\nMargam Castle is part of Margam Country Park -Credit:Robert Melen\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott, a gamekeeper who was murdered on the estate\u2014some say by a poacher, others by an escaped convict. His presence is said to rage through the castle and the estate to this day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nScott is frequently spotted making a determined ascent up the Gothic staircase that leads to the Castle. His presence is a recurring theme among psychic investigators, who all agree that his spirit seethes with fury, unable to rest after his untimely and unjust death.\n\nAfter nightfall, the castle\u2019s security guards report the unsettling sounds of hurried footsteps and low, chattering voices echoing through the empty halls\u2014though no trace of another soul is ever found.\n\nPsychic investigators have described his presence as one of anger, with inexplicable slamming doors and objects being hurled across rooms attributed to his spirit. Visitors who\u2019ve dared to investigate report an overwhelming sense of dread, as though Scott\u2019s rage still lingers.\n\nChildren\u2019s giggles and mischievous spirits\n\nAnother frequently reported occurrence is the sound of children\u2019s laughter echoing through the castle\u2019s long, empty corridors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVisitors claim to have seen ghostly figures of children in Victorian clothing flitting in and out of rooms, as though playing an eternal game of hide-and-seek. Others describe objects mysteriously moving or disappearing, believed to be the playful antics of these mischievous spirits.\n\nA shadowy blacksmith\n\nThe ghost of a blacksmith is another familiar figure at Margam, often spotted by the groundskeepers and gardeners who maintain the estate.\n\nAt night, security guards on patrol have reported unsettling sounds: hurried footsteps, murmuring voices, and shadows darting across the walls\u2014despite the castle being empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reputedly one of the most haunted places in the United Kingdom,\u201d Dave confirms. While he hasn\u2019t experienced anything personally, the sheer volume of stories visitors and staff share suggests otherwise.\n\nParanormal Activity at Margam Castle\n\nThe most infamous spirit of Margam Castle is Robert Scott -Credit:Getty Images\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe. Reports of cold spots, mysterious orbs of light, and sudden temperature drops are commonplace during overnight ghost vigils. Objects have been known to move independently, while unexplained noises chill even the bravest ghost hunters.\n\nThe spirit of Robert Scott remains the most active, with psychic investigators describing his presence as hostile and overwhelming. Rocks have been thrown during s\u00e9ances, and the sensation of being watched is unnervingly frequent in certain castle areas. For those who dare, Margam offers an experience unlike any other.\n\nGhost Zunters International at Margam Castle\n\nMargam's haunted history made waves across the Atlantic when Ghost Hunters International filmed an episode here for the SyFy Channel.\n\nThe investigation, broadcast to over a million viewers, shone a global spotlight on the site\u2019s paranormal activity, cementing its status as one of Britain\u2019s spookiest destinations.\n\nParanormal investigators used low lux cameras, full spectrum photography and super sensitive recording devices to capture \u201celectronic voice phenomena\u201d which is said to be spirit world voices.\n\nThe enthusiastic American team claimed to have captured on camera the floating figure of a monk wearing a white habit.\n\nAnd they also claimed to have \u201cspoken\u201d with a medieval monk called Brother Tom, seen a \u201cghost\u201d in shadow form of Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot \u2013 the man who commissioned the building of the castle \u2013 and heard the footsteps of Lady Emily Charlotte in the bedroom in which she died almost 100 years ago.\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:Lydia Royce\n\nAttend a ghost hunt\n\nFor those eager to experience the castle\u2019s ghostly atmosphere, Haunting Happenings offers overnight ghost hunts at Margam Castle\u2014a daunting but thrilling prospect.\n\nThese spooky events provide a unique opportunity to search for the spirits that roam the castle\u2019s many haunted rooms. Guests can expect strange light anomalies, loud footsteps echoing on the grand staircase, and sudden, extreme drops in temperature. Few are brave enough to spend time alone in the most active areas of the castle.\n\nThis popular overnight experience includes access to ghost hunting equipment such as EMF Meters and K2 Meters and interactive experiments like glass divination, table tipping, and Ouija boards.\n\nThe event features small group s\u00e9ances, ghost hunting vigils, and even free time to explore the castle\u2019s shadows alone. Teas and coffees are provided to keep spirits\u2014of the living variety\u2014high during the night.\n\nWhy visit Margam Castle?\n\nMargam Castle\u2019s ghostly reputation has attracted paranormal investigators from across the globe -Credit:South Wales Evening Post\n\nWhile the ghost stories are reason enough for many visitors, Margam Castle is also a gorgeous architectural gem surrounded by natural beauty. Dave Phillips says, \u201cThere\u2019s a story to be told here, from the stationing of American soldiers during World War II to visits from historical figures like Admiral Lord Nelson and General Dwight Eisenhower.\u201d\n\nMargam Country Park offers more than ghostly tales. From scenic walks and historic ruins to mountain biking trails and paddleboarding, there are plenty of activities for the whole family.\n\nFor those brave enough, ghost tours and overnight vigils provide the perfect opportunity to experience Margam\u2019s supernatural side firsthand.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re drawn by its history, beauty, or the chilling possibility of encountering one of its many spirits, Margam Castle is well worth a stop. But as the shadows lengthen and the night falls, keep your ears open\u2026 you might hear laughter where no one stands or footsteps where no one walks.\n\nNeed to know"

For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see this FAQ.\n\nAs caregivers mark their calendars to celebrate their children's birthdays, weddings, graduations or special events, my mind, body and spirit will always remember Nov. 2, 2024, as the day I had to take my 27-year-old son off life-support.\n\nAs I was holding him through his last breaths on Earth, I remember trying to quiet the grieving cries of loved ones at his bedside. I wanted to silence the human world, soothe the aching pain of my broken heart and stay attentive to the spiritual sounds of my son laughing.\n\nI wanted to lean into the hope that he was going to a place where he would be free of the suffering.\n\nAs I process the grief and loss, I reflect on the realization that my son's story and cries for comfort in healing will not die with him. I feel the years of injustices unravel as I am trying to embrace the peaceful purpose of having to bury my son.\n\nHowever, the fire he continues to light within me is burning with a purpose, and I cannot allow his voice to go ignored. I invite you to see my son through my eyes and hear it with your heart. I invite you to walk with me, as I share the essence of who he was.\n\nHis spirit name is Blue Thunderbird Man, and his legal name was Kyrel Lavallee. He was my sacred fire-keeper and only son.\n\nAngela Lavallee with her son, Kyrel. He was 'a sacred fire-keeper, helper, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin, grandson and friend,' she writes. (Submitted by Angela Lavallee)\n\nHe had a passion for writing lyrics and was fascinated by ancient Egyptian mythology, aliens, Marvel movies, documentaries, multidimensions and the mysterious paranormal powers of the world.\n\nHe had an adventurous life that took him across Turtle Island, where he filled space sharing stories about humour, survival, hope, healing and love, and making memorable connections. Kyrel had a generous energy, and he would often give his clothes, money and food to those in need.\n\nHe loved helping others, but also required the necessities and empathy he was so freely giving to others.\n\nAt war with addiction\n\nKyrel had an illness that many people stigmatize as preventable \u2014 substance use addiction. At a young age, he started using alcohol and drugs to cope with his trauma. It became his confidence-builder to interact socially with people.\n\nWe spent years navigating health and community resources that offered tools for him to live a life of sobriety, and tending to the wounds of ongoing traumas.\n\nHis sisters and I had the honour of being trusted with the staggering and tough stories where he was at war with addiction. As his mother and primary caregiver, I understand the core of his intergenerational traumas, pains, grief and losses.\n\nRight to the last hours of his life, we advocated for him and his ongoing need for support and social guidance.\n\nWe know our Canadian health system is intended to provide quality care and should offer a sense of dignity, respect and well-being to all people.\n\nBut part of my son's story involves his cries for comfort and non-judgmental healing services, only to be dismissed by some of the people working in our health system.\n\nAngela Lavallee says Kyrel 'had a generous energy, and he would often give his clothes, money and food to those in need.' (Submitted by Angela Lavallee)\n\nHours before my son was admitted into an intensive care unit at an Edmonton hospital, he was discharged from a detox centre elsewhere in the city.\n\nHe was trying to access resources to heal from the spirit of addiction. One of my son's last text messages to me reads, \"I signed up for two different treatment places but a call ASAP isn't guaranteed.\u2026 They'll be discharging me when my withdrawal symptoms are gone.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2024, instead of accommodating his pleas to remain in the detox centre either until a treatment bed opened up, or we'd safeguarded a plan to get him back home to Manitoba, he was dismissed and sent on his way.\n\nSadly, being sent on his way pulled him back into the pathway of addiction. It was a route he struggled not to take, but as we know, it's often more accessible than healing and wellness resources.\n\nLess than eight hours after being discharged from detox, my only son was found outside a homeless shelter, unresponsive.\n\nLeft with 'what ifs'\n\nKyrel is one of many who are dying in a pandemic of accidental overdoses.\n\nWe are left with the residue of unanswered questions and unloading the \"what ifs.\" What if they allowed him to stay until he secured a bed in treatment? What if they'd comforted him until we'd made our safe plan to get him back home?\n\nWhat if they'd accommodated him until he continued his sober pathway at \"ma's treatment\"? When he was home, I sometimes had the capacity to be his safe place between detox and treatment.\n\nI honour every moment my son fought to stay sober and would make space where he could heal and be away from energies that dragged him into the cycle of addiction.\n\nWhat if people did not have to be on their deathbed to be treated with such dignity, respect and comforting care?\n\nWhat if every person who wants to be on a pathway of healing and sobriety had the resources between detox and treatment? What if they had focused more on hearing my son's voice, instead of measuring his needs based on withdrawal symptoms?\n\nI spent the last three nights and four days of my son's life crying, talking, singing and pleading with him to keep fighting.\n\nIn the darkest of moments, it was therapeutic to feel and see how the doctor and nurses at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton tended to my child and made space for our family to be with him. They did not use any words that made his illness less than, and treated him with dignity, respect and care. The nurses spoke to him with such tenderness and love. Each night, the nurses made a bed for me next to my dying son.\n\nThe doctor was transparent in the whole process and did not refer to my son as an \"addict,\" a \"user\" or a \"homeless person.\" Nor did he use the word \"overdose.\" We had access to seeing his charts, brain scans \u2014 every process so diligently explained \u2014 and could smudge with our traditional medicines in his ICU room.\n\nWhat if people did not have to be on their deathbed to be treated with such dignity, respect and comforting care?\n\nKyrel is more than just a number in the statistics of people who died by overdose. He was more than his struggle with addiction. My son is a sacred fire-keeper, helper, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin, grandson and friend.\n\nWe need to fill in those gaps where we are losing people like my son. We need more healing resources to support folks who keep trying to save their lives and find the courage to seek help.\n\nMy son had a purpose in life, and his legacy will not die with him."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert believes that aliens could invade Earth at any moment and warned that they \"will make themselves known\".\n\nCarl Nally, of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), issued the chilling warning after unexplained flying objects were spotted near military facilities. The mystery sightings came in the US, UK and Germany. Mr Nally said sightings are on the rise and believes there could be a portal for aliens to enter and exit Earth.\n\nAccording to Mr Nally, the secret entrance is nestled in the middle of Ireland between Athlone and Slane. His claims come after US authorities said they were unable to establish the origin of the objects. \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus,\" a White House official said last week.\n\nImage: X/@charliekirk11) X/@charliekirk11)\n\nMr Nally claimed that if the flashing lights that were spotted were simply drones, it would have been confirmed by now. He told the Irish Mirror: \"It\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it. You would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nMr Nally said the appearance of flying objects near military bases is part of an unprecedented global surge in UFO sightings over the past two months \u2013 including in Ireland, where several suspected UFOs have been spotted around Slane and Athlone. He suggested there were certain locations on the planet where UFOs enter from space and leave again, and claimed one such location may exist in the Irish midlands \u2013 explaining the uptick in sightings in recent weeks.\n\nImage: littlespacemochi/ Reddit) littlespacemochi/ Reddit) Image: littlespacemochi / Reddit) littlespacemochi / Reddit)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d said Mr Nally. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nThe UFO expert said the recent sightings suggested extra-terrestrials were assessing military strength, and noted that UFOs had also been spotted in the vicinity of nuclear facilities. \"It seems to be some kind of observation that\u2019s going on at this point in time, and it seems to have increased, without a shadow of a doubt, and you would wonder,\" he claimed.\n\nMr Nally was relaxed about the prospect of an alien invasion, however, and suggested there were greater threats to mankind to worry about. \"If you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI [artificial intelligence] on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nMr Nally has co-authored three books on aliens and UFOs with Dermot Butler, the most recent of which was Circle of Deceit. They are currently working on their fourth book."

Discovered by cave explorers in 1970, the collection of mismatched bones seemed to be just another Bronze Age gravesite \u2014 a few victims scattered among sediment and animal skeletons.\n\nNow, a recent study published in the Cambridge University journal Antiquity suggests a stunningly grim saga played out at Charterhouse Warren, at far greater scale than previously thought: The bones belong to at least 37 men, women and children who were slaughtered and possibly eaten in a ceremonial feast after their massacre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us all aback.

The upgrade is one of a number of new features being rolled out to OpenAI's developer customers starting today.\n\nOpenAI announced during a livestream today that the new o1 model would bring back many of the \"core features you've been missing\" from the API during o1-preview. This includes the ability to use developer messages to help guide your particular chatbot (i.e. \"You are a helpful assistant for tax professionals.\") and access to a \"reasoning effort\" parameter that tells the API how long to think about specific queries, saving time and money on simple problems so they can be used on the tougher ones. API users can also use visual information like scans of documents as input.\n\nOpenAI also highlighted improvements to the new API's use of internal function calling, where the OpenAI model decides to call functions pre-written by outside developers to generate answers to certain queries, when appropriate. The new API is also more accurate in its use of structured outputs, which use a JSON schema to present information in a specific format outlined by the developer, OpenAI said.\n\nThe o1 model uses 60 percent fewer thinking tokens than o1-preview, OpenAI said, generating faster and cheaper results. But those results are also roughly 25 to 35 percentage points more accurate on benchmarks like LiveBench and the AIME, according to OpenAI.\n\nWhile o1 access will start rolling out to tier 5 development customers today, API access to the $200/month o1 Pro model is only promised to be \"coming soon.\""

            "article_content": "Experts provide insight into the rise of FinOps, how APIs will force a rise in DevSecOps, and how low-code, no-code is here to stay.\n\nThe Rise of FinOps\n\nTzvika Zaiffer, Director, Solutions, Spot by NetApp:\n\nThe DevOps landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, particularly in response to the growing demands of enterprise AI initiatives and competitive market pressures. A key development has been the rise of FinOps\u2014the integration of financial accountability into DevOps practices. DevOps teams now regularly collaborate with finance experts, making decisions that balance technical requirements with cost considerations. This evolution reflects a broader shift toward cost-conscious infrastructure management. Organizations increasingly expect DevOps teams to implement sophisticated cost visibility tools, automated provisioning systems, and real-time monitoring capabilities. These practices help control expenses while maintaining the high-performance infrastructure needed for AI workloads and other complex applications.\n\nLooking ahead, this convergence of DevOps and financial stewardship will become even more critical. Successful DevOps strategies will need to demonstrate not just technical excellence, but also clear financial viability through mature cost controls and efficient resource utilization.\n\nAPI Boom Will Yield Transition to DevSecOps Teams\n\nMoshe Lipsker, VP of Global Product Development, Imperva, a Thales company:\n\nAs we head into 2025, we\u2019ll be four years into application programming interfaces (APIs) taking over the world. As it stands, the Economic Impact of API and Bot Attacks study from the Imperva Threat Research Team found that the average enterprise managed 613 API endpoints last year. APIs enable seamless integration and user experience but, consequently, attract hacker interest as these endpoints provide direct access to sensitive data. On average, API-related security issues cost organizations $25-87 billion annually. This massive loss begs the question: are IT security teams and DevOps teams ready to work together to balance the speed of business development with security?\n\nAs more organizations continue to adopt APIs in 2025, these increasing risks will force their hand in strengthening security posture at the point of development so that they can provide widespread protection of their software. Though it\u2019s not easy, we will continue to see the transition to DevSecOps teams to ensure that security is effectively built into product development from the start. With these transitions, organizations will adopt automated solutions such as runtime application self-protection to increase security without adding overhead to development processes.\n\nLow-code/no-code: Hype or Real Value?\n\nShomron Jacob, Head of Applied Machine Learning & Platform, Iterate.ai:\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen firsthand for years now, low-code strategies are very efficient and effective at bringing AI, the IoT, data connectivity and more into production applications\u2014and doing so without facing the exorbitant cost and technical hurdles of otherwise hardcoding (and exhaustively learning) those technologies. By distilling the complexity of those technologies into modules ready to be connected to build out complete applications, businesses are achieving innovative functionality and delivering breakthrough capabilities with less direct expertise, time, and expense. That simplicity also translates into speed, from initially testing applications, to iteratively optimizing and perfecting them (both capabilities and user experiences). Those advantages will continue to drive greater low-code adoption in the coming year as organizations seek to debut applications with competitive features at an even more accelerated pace."

(Part One)\n\nPredictions for AI in the coming year.\n\nThe generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom will continue unabated over the next several years. As 2025 approaches, I predict the following key trends in generative AI.\n\nPrediction #1: Expanding Generative AI Usage\n\nAdoption of generative AI will accelerate across business and consumer markets in 2025 and beyond. Already, generative AI features are becoming a key differentiator in enterprise applications in the form of conversational user interfaces, embedded digital assistants, natural-language chatbots, task-oriented copilots, and other large language model (LLM)-powered productivity augmentations.\n\nTDWI research shows that productization of generative AI is starting to gain traction in enterprises. A recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness showed that 30% of organizations have already deployed the technology or have expressed a significant interest in adopting it in the coming year. By the same token, 46% are discussing how generative AI could be useful in their businesses.\n\nPrediction #2: More Transformative Experiences\n\nGenerative AI will transform the experience of more devices, applications, and services in 2025. Already, voice chatbots powered by generative AI are becoming a popular choice for the self-service experience of every app, including no-code business analytics tools.\n\nTDWI research shows that generative AI is rapidly changing how enterprises get work done. A recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that 37% of organizations have already built or are planning to deploy generative AI chatbots for customer support applications, 28% for marketing content generation, 26% for onboarding new employees, and for many other use cases. Over the next several years, we predict that generative AI will democratize many professions as knowledge workers adopt tools that enable them to single-handedly produce sophisticated deliverables that once required highly skilled teams and expensive, time-consuming production processes.\n\nTDWI research also shows that the generative AI application experience will grow more multimodal. In 2025 and beyond, multimodal LLMs will proliferate as developers create more generative AI apps that work with text, image, video, audio, and other data modalities. In the recent TDWI survey on achieving success with modern analytics, 46% of enterprises report either using generative AI text prompting now to generate images and other modalities or plan to do so over the next few years.\n\nPrediction #3: More Sophisticated Platforms and Tools\n\nGenerative AI will be a principal driver in the evolution of enterprise data foundations in 2025.\n\nDemand for multimodal applications of generative AI will drive evolution of enterprise data lakes, data pipelines, data governance, and much more. Likewise, adoption of generative AI will bring such platforms and tools as vector databases, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation into the enterprise mainstream.\n\nIn the coming year, prompt engineering will continue its rapid maturation into a substantial body of proven practices for eliciting the correct output from LLMs and other foundation models.\n\nWithin generative AI development tool sets, embedding libraries will become an essential component for developers to build increasingly sophisticated similarity searches that span a diverse range of data modalities. The recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness shows that 28% of organizations already use or are deploying vector databases to store vector embeddings for use with AI models, while 32% plan to adopt those databases in the next few years.\n\nIn addition, generative AI developers in 2025 will have access to a growing range of tools for no-code development of \u201cagentic\u201d applications that provide autonomous LLM-driven copilot, chatbot, and other functionality and that can be orchestrated over more complex process environments. Agentic workflows, leveraging a new phenomenon known as a \u201clarge action model,\u201d will be a growing focus of intelligent process automation.\n\nPrediction #4: More Diverse Models and Data\n\nDevelopers will have access in 2025 to a growing range of sophisticated models and data for building, training, and optimizing generative AI applications\u2014including both commercial and open-source models.\n\nThe recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that around 25% of enterprises are experimenting with private or public generative AI models, while 17% are building generative AI apps that use company data with pretrained models. The survey also showed that 41% of enterprises are exploring how to use generative AI to build apps that use private data.\n\nOnline cloud marketplaces will become a favorite source of third-party training data for more enterprise AI developers. I also predict that enterprises will increasingly rely on synthetic data generation as an alternative for training generative AI in use cases where authentic source data is either too costly, restricted, or unavailable for their needs.\n\nRead more predictions about AI governance and ROI in Part Two of this article."

            "article_content": "NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iStock, a leading e-commerce platform providing premium content to SMBs, SMEs, creatives, and students everywhere, has released its 2025 Marketing Trends Report, packed with practical strategies to help businesses thrive in today\u2019s trust-driven marketplace.\n\nThe report comes at a critical time when consumer trust in social media\u2014a key tool for small businesses\u2014is declining. According to iStock\u2019s VisualGPS research platform, 81% of consumers don\u2019t trust social media content, citing concerns over misinformation. However, trust in businesses remains high, with 64% of people favoring businesses over celebrities or influencers, or even politicians, and 58% preferring brands whose values align with their own. For small businesses, this is a powerful opportunity to leverage their local ties and authentic engagement to build stronger connections and outpace larger competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rebecca Swift, Senior Vice President of Creative for iStock, emphasizes the need for a bold shift: \u201cAs we enter 2025, trust will define success, and visual content will be a critical tool in forging genuine connections with audiences. For small businesses, the advantage lies not in chasing polished perfection but in creating visuals that feel human, honest, and deeply relevant. By telling real stories and reflecting diverse experiences, small businesses can establish deep, lasting trust with their audiences\u2013proving that it\u2019s not about looking perfect but about feeling real and relatable.\u201d\n\nHere are iStock\u2019s key marketing trends to help SMBs build trust in 2025:\n\nReal Talk: Less Influencer, More Real-User Content\n\nThe genuine feel that made influencer content connect with people is disappearing. VisualGPS revealed, 67% of people believe traditional ads are more authentic than sponsored influencer posts. Even if you don\u2019t use influencers, this shift matters. People are tired of content that looks too perfect and want visuals that feel genuine and honest. A few years ago, User-Generated Content (UGC), like selfies and vertical videos, was seen as the most real and authentic. But in 2025, people expect more. This is where Real-User Content (RUC) comes in, a new concept from iStock experts which encourages businesses to move from \"generated\" content to images and videos that show \u201creal.\u201d\n\nThis change is affecting how people interact with visual content, especially on social media. Despite people\u2019s lack of trust, they still find these platforms valuable, 82% of users still go to places like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts for video content to learn something new or get inspiration. In other words, people want the benefits of social media, without the negative effects. This shift has also made video-driven social search more popular, where platforms focused on video are no longer just for scrolling \u2014they\u2019ve become places to search and discover. In 2025, to succeed, you need to speak directly to your audience, this approach will always be more effective than a flood of generic posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHonesty: The New Face of Authenticity\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to marketing trends, you\u2019ve probably seen the word \u201cauthenticity\u201d everywhere. But what does it truly mean? For consumers, it means being real, truthful, and original, according to VisualGPS research. And in 2025, it will still be key to building trust\u201498% of people say authentic images and videos are important for earning trust. However, authenticity is changing. In 2025, it\u2019s will be about radical honesty. People don\u2019t want perfect images\u2014they want to see what makes your business human, imperfections and all.\n\nSharing raw moments, real customer stories, and the messy, behind-the-scenes parts of running a business can create strong emotional connections. Being honest is important\u2014whether it's showing how your processes work to teach your audience or admitting when things don\u2019t go as planned. Even humor, when used carefully, can turn simple interactions into memorable moments. In a world full of overly polished content, honesty will help your brand stand out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Frontier: Trust-Centric AI for Forward-Thinking Businesses\n\nText-to-image Generative AI is a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. However, in 2025, its successful use will depend on being transparent. While consumers are open to AI-generated ads, 86% believe it should be clearly labeled, and 74% are okay with AI-generated content IF used ethically. This means using AI to empower, not to mislead. Also, as ethical AI becomes the standard, using tools that offer commercially safe AI images with legal protection\u2014just like any other royalty-free image\u2014not only gives you peace of mind but also positions your business as a leader in responsible AI use, aligning with the values your audience expect.\n\nOn top of that, beyond creating images from scratch think of AI as a virtual studio that helps your team create flexible, cost-effective content. AI tools like iStock\u2019s AI generator, allow businesses to not only generate custom images from creative prompts but also modify visuals, remove or change elements, and expand canvases to fit specific formats\u2014all without needing expensive software or design skills. This tool even lets businesses upload reference images and product photos to build a personalized library of assets, making it quicker and easier to align visuals with your business needs, pace, and budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs 2025 approaches, the key to success for SMBs is embracing trust-first strategies. By focusing on Real-User Content, being radically honest, and using AI transparently, small businesses can not only stay ahead of the curve but also lead the way in making trust the foundation of modern marketing.\n\nTo inspire and elevate your visual marketing strategy ahead of 2025 with related imagery and videos, visit https://www.istockphoto.com/.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nIlse Noguez\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement are available at:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9508cf80-f5a7-403f-819b-68c62617e25c\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f9cc203d-5c67-45a0-8e84-a6e001ad7acb\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/80078fc0-f37b-4b57-b58b-55c54c396f5a\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ef7c3bb1-ca44-4d03-83f5-0d5f80c8af52\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f860a42a-50ab-413a-b17e-75d09e83934c"

            "article_content": "Check Out the Key Software Development Trends That May Emerge in 2025\n\nThe world of software development is evolving at a pace we\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nEach year brings new breakthroughs, fresh approaches, and bold ideas that redefine how we build and interact with technology. By 2025, some trends will reshape the way developers and businesses operate, while others will open up new opportunities we might not even fully grasp yet.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what the future of software development might look like in 2025 and why these trends are worth paying attention to.\n\nGenerative AI: A New Coding Ally\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves all across industries, and in software development, it\u2019s become an essential tool. AI is no longer just an assistant; it\u2019s becoming an indispensable co-developer.\n\nIn 2025, AI-powered tools will:\n\nWrite code faster than ever, taking over repetitive tasks so developers can focus on solving real problems.\n\nDebug software more efficiently, spotting and fixing issues before they even cause disruptions.\n\nEmpower people who aren\u2019t traditional developers to build their own applications using natural language prompts.\n\nThink of AI as a partner that boosts creativity and efficiency for any software development company, and it can make software development not just faster but smarter.\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms: Breaking Down Barriers\n\nImagine a world where you don\u2019t need to know how to code to create software. That is the promise of low-code and no-code platforms, and by 2025, these tools will become even more powerful.\n\nFor businesses, this is a game-changer. They\u2019ll be able to:\n\nBuild complex applications with drag-and-drop simplicity.\n\nSave time and money by reducing reliance on traditional development teams.\n\nCustomize solutions without the usual trade-offs of flexibility versus speed.\n\nAs these platforms evolve, they\u2019ll bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams, making innovation accessible to everyone.\n\nCloud-Native Development Becomes the Norm\n\nThe cloud isn\u2019t just a buzzword anymore - it\u2019s the backbone of modern software. By 2025, cloud-native development will dominate how applications are built.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\n\nServerless technology will take off, letting developers focus on building apps without worrying about managing servers.\n\nEdge computing will complement the cloud, processing data closer to users for lightning-fast performance.\n\nTools like Kubernetes will simplify scaling and managing applications, even for smaller teams.\n\nCloud-native isn\u2019t just about convenience; it\u2019s about delivering better software faster and at scale.\n\nSustainability Will Drive Software Decisions\n\nThe world is becoming more eco-conscious, and software developers are joining the movement. By 2025, sustainability won\u2019t just be an option - it\u2019ll be a priority.\n\nDevelopers and companies will focus on:\n\nWriting energy-efficient code that reduces the environmental impact of software.\n\nPartnering with cloud providers committed to renewable energy.\n\nBuilding tools that help businesses track and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nIn short, green software will be the next big thing, and those who embrace it will be in charge of a more sustainable future.\n\nSecurity as a Core Feature, Not an Afterthought\n\nWith data breaches and cyberattacks on the rise, security is becoming non-negotiable. By 2025, building secure software will be baked into every stage of development.\n\nHere\u2019s how this will look:\n\nDevelopers will adopt a \u201csecure by design\u201d approach, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed early.\n\nThe AI technology will play a bigger role in identifying threats and stopping them in real time.\n\nDevSecOps, which integrates security into development workflows, will become a standard practice.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t just to build software that works but to create systems that users can trust.\n\nQuantum Computing: Peeking into the Future\n\nQuantum computing feels like science fiction, but it\u2019s getting closer to reality. By 2025, we\u2019ll start to see its impact on software development, albeit in niche areas.\n\nFor example:\n\nQuantum algorithms will revolutionize industries like cryptography, logistics, and complex simulations.\n\nDevelopers will experiment with hybrid systems that combine classical and quantum computing.\n\nNew programming tools tailored for quantum systems will begin to gain traction.\n\nWhile still in its early stages, quantum computing offers a glimpse of what\u2019s possible when we push the boundaries of technology.\n\nHyper-Personalized Software Experiences\n\nWe all love it when apps and tools feel like they were made just for us. By 2025, hyper-personalization will be a must-have feature for software.\n\nExpect:\n\nApps that adapt in real time based on your behavior and preferences.\n\nSmarter AI systems that deliver relevant recommendations without feeling intrusive.\n\nA stronger emphasis on privacy, ensuring personalization doesn\u2019t come at the expense of user trust.\n\nThis shift isn\u2019t just about making software better; it\u2019s about making it truly human-centered.\n\nMulti-experience Development: Meeting Users Everywhere\n\nGone are the days when users stuck to one device. Today, people expect seamless experiences across smartphones, smartwatches, AR/VR headsets, and beyond.\n\nBy 2025, multi-experience development will focus on:\n\nDesigning software that works flawlessly on any device.\n\nIntegrating natural inputs like voice commands, gestures, and even biometric data.\n\nEnsure users can switch between devices without losing their place.\n\nThis trend is all about meeting users where they are - and delivering a great experience every time.\n\nEthics Will Take Center Stage\n\nAs technology becomes more powerful, developers are being asked tough questions: Is this ethical? Is it fair? Does it do more good than harm?\n\nBy 2025, we\u2019ll see a stronger push toward ethical software development, including:\n\nEfforts to eliminate bias in AI systems.\n\nTransparent policies on how user data is collected and used.\n\nGuidelines that prioritize inclusivity and fairness.\n\nEthics won\u2019t just be a box to check - it\u2019ll be a guiding principle for how software is built and deployed.\n\nAgile Practices Will Evolve\n\nAgile has been the go-to methodology for years, but it\u2019s constantly evolving. By 2025, it\u2019ll adapt to new challenges and opportunities, with trends like:\n\nBlending Agile with other methodologies like DevOps and Lean.\n\nUsing AI to streamline project management and decision-making.\n\nShifting the focus from delivering features to achieving measurable business outcomes.\n\nAgile\u2019s flexibility will keep it relevant, ensuring teams can adapt to whatever comes next.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe future of software development is exciting, challenging, and full of potential all at the same time. From leveraging the power of AI to building sustainable, secure, and ethical systems, the trends of 2025 promise to shape a smarter and more connected world. For businesses and developers alike, the key is to stay curious, embrace changes, and never stop innovating. The opportunities are endless. Are you ready to be part of the journey?"

            "article_content": "Is AI going to steal your job \u2013 or will you be able to use it to your advantage? And is the recent decrease in job listings a good or a bad thing for freelancers? It\u2019s an interesting time for freelancers and contractors and that\u2019s set to continue into 2025.\n\nWondering what could be coming up for your business next year? Keep reading to see six predictions about the state of freelance work.\n\n1. An urgent need to embrace AI?\n\nAI has been a hot topic for several years now, but recent developments suggest that 2025 is a year for change. AI has come a long way \u2013 and with easy access to tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, as well as Apple\u2019s new inbuilt Apple Intelligence, there are less barriers to introducing it into your professional life too.\n\nAs a busy freelancer, you can use generative AI to lighten your workload for things like drafting proposals, transcribing notes, and summarising emails. You can also use it to help with areas outside of your expertise, such as marketing or copywriting.\n\nA recent study from Fiverr also found that AI was the top missing skill in UK businesses \u2013 with 18 per cent of business leaders surveyed saying they hire freelancers who have AI skills full time employees don\u2019t.\n\nLooking to upskill in this area? Read our guide to AI for small businesses for some ideas.\n\n2. An end to late payments?\n\nThe new Labour government\u2019s Fair Payment Code launched in December 2024, so will start affecting the self-employed in 2025. This voluntary code of practice gives larger businesses who work with freelancers and contractors an award based on their payment record.\n\nBusinesses can be categorised one of three ways: Gold \u2013 for businesses that pay 95 per cent of their suppliers within 30 days\n\n\u2013 for businesses that pay 95 per cent of their suppliers within 30 days Silver \u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of their small business suppliers within 30 days and all other suppliers within 60 days\n\n\u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of their small business suppliers within 30 days and all other suppliers within 60 days Bronze \u2013 businesses that pay 95 per cent of suppliers within 60 days\n\nAdditionally, the Small Business Commissioner will be given greater enforcement powers to ensure small businesses and freelancers are getting paid on time. And with our own research showing that small businesses were owed an estimated \u00a332 billion in late payments in 2023, this is sure to be a positive change in the freelance world.\n\n3. More clarity for contractors under umbrella companies?\n\nThe 2024 Autumn Budget revealed plans to crack down on exploitative umbrella companies who fail to comply with IR35 regulations. This means that the responsibility for paying the correct income tax and National Insurance contributions will fall on the employer and not the contractor.\n\nWhile this new legislation won\u2019t come into effect until April 2026, HMRC recently published an online tool designed to help contractors better understand payment from umbrella companies. This new tool was published in December 2024, meaning freelancers will be able to use it for their 2025 contracts.\n\n4. Higher day rates for freelancers?\n\nThe new year could be the time to increase your day rate, according to a recent study from the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed. The study revealed that the average day rate of UK freelancers increased from Q2 to Q3 2024, from \u00a3457 to \u00a3576.\n\nThe same study revealed that the freelancers surveyed expected their day rates to further increase 12.2 per cent in the next year.\n\nIf you think it\u2019s time to increase your earnings, our guide to setting a freelance rate can help.\n\n5. Increased costs for freelancers outside IR35?\n\nFiverr\u2019s recent data also reveals that 83 per cent of businesses believe Labour\u2019s Budget will impact their business. This is largely in part to the increase of Employer National Insurance contributions \u2013 which are set to rise to 15 per cent from April 2025.\n\nThis increase, combined with a lower earnings threshold and an increase in corporation tax, could affect both umbrella contractors and limited company contractors. Umbrella contractors could see a reduction in their take home pay, while limited company contractors may find it harder to negotiate contracts.\n\n6. Less job vacancies?\n\nJob vacancy website Reed recently reported the number of job vacancies posted on its website had fallen 13 per cent between October and November \u2013 and is now 26 per cent lower than a year ago.\n\nThis is supported by recent data from the Office of National Statistics, which also revealed that the number of job vacancies fell by 31,000 between September and November.\n\nWhile this accounts for the job market as a whole and isn\u2019t limited to just freelance and contract work, it suggests changes for the self-employed.\n\nEither businesses will be unable to hire full time staff and will instead look to contractors, meaning more employment opportunities, or the decrease in overall opportunities will include freelancers too.\n\nDo you have any other predictions that may affect freelancers and contractors in 2025? Let us know what you\u2019ve heard in the comments below.\n\nHelpful guides for freelancers"

Bones with slicing cuts, as if someone had butchered the skin around them.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the remains found in a shaft at the Charterhouse Warren Farm in southwest England have been a blip in British archaeological history. Discovered by cave explorers in 1970, the collection of mismatched bones seemed to be just another Bronze Age gravesite \u2014 a few victims scattered among sediment and animal skeletons.\n\nNow, a recent study published in the Cambridge University journal Antiquity suggests a stunningly grim saga played out at Charterhouse Warren, at far greater scale than previously thought: The bones belong to at least 37 men, women and children who were slaughtered and possibly eaten in a ceremonial feast after their massacre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken us all aback. It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

            "article_content": "In the late 1800s, scientists realized that migratory birds made species-specific nocturnal flight calls\u2014\u201cacoustic fingerprints.\u201d When microphones became commercially available in the 1950s, scientists began recording birds at night. Farnsworth led some of this acoustic ecology research in the 1990s. But even then it was challenging to spot the short calls, some of which are at the edge of the frequency range humans can hear. Scientists ended up with thousands of tapes they had to scour in real time while looking at spectrograms that visualize audio. Though digital technology made recording easier, the \u201cperpetual problem,\u201d Farnsworth says, \u201cwas that it became increasingly easy to collect an enormous amount of audio data, but increasingly difficult to analyze even some of it.\u201d\n\nThen Farnsworth met Juan Pablo Bello, director of NYU\u2019s Music and Audio Research Lab. Fresh off a project using machine learning to identify sources of urban noise pollution in New York City, Bello agreed to take on the problem of nocturnal flight calls. He put together a team including the French machine-listening expert Vincent Lostanlen, and in 2015, the BirdVox project was born to automate the process. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Eventually, when this nut is cracked, this is going to be a super-rich source of information,\u2019\u201d Farnsworth says. But in the beginning, Lostanlen recalls, \u201cthere was not even a hint that this was doable.\u201d It seemed unimaginable that machine learning could approach the listening abilities of experts like Farnsworth.\n\n\u201cAndrew is our hero,\u201d says Bello. \u201cThe whole thing that we want to imitate with computers is Andrew.\u201d\n\nThey started by training BirdVoxDetect, a neural network, to ignore faults like low buzzes caused by rainwater damage to microphones. Then they trained the system to detect flight calls, which differ between (and even within) species and can easily be confused with the chirp of a car alarm or a spring peeper. The challenge, Lostanlen says, was similar to the one a smart speaker faces when listening for its unique \u201cwake word,\u201d except in this case the distance from the target noise to the microphone is far greater (which means much more background noise to compensate for). And, of course, the scientists couldn\u2019t choose a unique sound like \u201cAlexa\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d for their trigger. \u201cFor birds, we don\u2019t really make that choice. Charles Darwin made that choice for us,\u201d he jokes. Luckily, they had a lot of training data to work with\u2014Farnsworth\u2019s team had hand-annotated thousands of hours of recordings collected by the microphones in Ithaca.\n\nWith BirdVoxDetect trained to detect flight calls, another difficult task lay ahead: teaching it to classify the detected calls by species, which few expert birders can do by ear. To deal with uncertainty, and because there is not training data for every species, they decided on a hierarchical system. For example, for a given call, BirdVoxDetect might be able to identify the bird\u2019s order and family, even if it\u2019s not sure about the species\u2014just as a birder might at least identify a call as that of a warbler, whether yellow-rumped or chestnut-sided. In training, the neural network was penalized less when it mixed up birds that were closer on the taxonomical tree."

            "article_content": "Target and touch totals are important but not as important as the market share. \u201cTargets\u201d is mostly a receiver stat (although there are some notable early exceptions). Touches are the currency of the running back.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is really simple. For pass-catchers, market share is targets divided by team pass attempts. For running backs, it is touches divided by team plays from scrimmage (not team touches, to be clear).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnap counts, depth of target and type of touch (running back receptions are far more valuable than carries) are also important but will generally not be discussed here. This is pure market share. Consider this a primary tool for assessing waivers and trades.\n\nHere\u2019s the list. Be sure to select the current week, though all the weeks of the season will be archived, so you can get a multi-week sample on a player if you so desire. Also, note I put great thought into providing these stats weekly. The objective here is to respond quickly to present trends. Yearly stats smoothen everything out to a somewhat meaningless middle. As our Gene McCaffrey so wisely says, \u201cTo be very right, you have to be willing to be very wrong.\u201d\n\nScoop City Newsletter Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Sign Up\n\nRunning Back Touches\n\nThis is the final market share report of the year, but I will update the sheet next week, gratis. Happy holidays!\n\nThere\u2019s not much for waivers this week, but there are tough calls to make in your Week 16 lineups.\n\nJerome Ford is rostered in less than half of Yahoo leagues (44 percent), so he could be on waivers in your league. But should we start him against the Bengals if we have him on our teams, or we can pick him up? I\u2019d have him about RB20, given that Jameis Winston is benched. Dorian Thompson-Robinson has basically no floor except whatever we think the Bengals\u2019 defense provides (which could be somewhat high). Maybe Ford is 15th. My point is he\u2019s not an automatic start.\n\nKendre Miller has a brutal matchup against Green Bay, and we\u2019re not sure Alvin Kamara is even out. If Kamara plays, that\u2019s probably the worst-case scenario for managers of both players. Miller and Kamara will have to contribute mostly as receivers, and they won\u2019t do much in the passing game without Derek Carr as their QB.\n\nTyjae Spears is similarly rostered (45 percent), so he\u2019s another RB you can possibly get for nothing. Again, he\u2019s a low-end RB2 for me, though that goes up a little if Mason Rudolph plays (more expected passes/completions/first downs). Rudolph is likely starting (see below).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see people thinking Tyler Allgeier is in play. He typically gets 10 touches \u2026 maybe a TD. But the Falcons offense is completely broken due to Kirk Cousins being toast. I\u2019d rather play Emanuel Wilson, given the likelihood of a lot of rushes from the Packers\u2019 backup RB at home against the Saints on Monday night.\n\nChase Brown (No. 3) is an automatic starter, of course, and the Cleveland defense is not nearly as good as its reputation. More automatic starts: No. 6 Rico Dowdle and No. 18 Bucky Irving, who is enjoying a historically efficient rookie rushing season. I guess No. 19 Rachaad White, who keeps scoring TDs, has to be played, too.\n\nBreece Hall (No. 24) is fringy, given his knee injury. The same applies to the Chiefs RBs (No. 25 Kareem Hunt and No. 26 Isiah Pacheco). Giants Tyrone Tracy Jr. and Devin Singletary (No. 29 and No. 28, respectively) are in the same bucket of plausibility in Flex10 formats if you have elite receivers.\n\nReceiver Targets\n\nAs for receivers on waivers, generally, I\u2019d rank them Romeo Doubs, Jalen Coker, Rashod Bateman.\n\nThe matchup with the Steelers is the major problem for Bateman. The Ravens are likely to score one to two TDs.\n\nI like Doubs (No. 55) more than the market because the top three Green Bay WRs each have two-TD ceilings and no floor. They\u2019re exactly the same. So Doubs has a 20 to 33 percent chance of winning a playoff game for you, no different than Jayden Reed, even though Reed will be started in almost all deeper formats.\n\nCoker gets the Cardinals, a sort of a neutral matchup, in the Mayor of Munchkin City Bowl (winner gets to keep the ruby slippers).\n\nJerry Jeudy (No. 2) is someone you have to sweat about playing now that DTR is replacing Jameis Winston \u2014 which is likely horrible for Jeudy \u2026 even against Cincy.\n\nTerry McLaurin (No. 11) has 10 TDs, so he\u2019s an automatic start, right? Well, the Eagles are one of those rare pass defenses with a shutdown corner who shadows the No. 1 WR, forcing teams to make very unconventional decisions \u2014 or at least think about them. McLaurin had zero targets in 20 snaps against Quinyon Mitchell in their meeting in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people who have been benching Keenan Allen (No. 4) should start him this week. Given that Allen plays the Lions (there is no \u201cD\u201d in Detroit), I\u2019d definitely pick him over McLaurin.\n\nTrey McBride, at No. 12, was the top TE in market share. The narrative next year will be that too many of his points were derived from non-TD plays, and he\u2019s not getting that many catches again. Well, my narrative is there is no such thing as a non-TD TE, so he\u2019ll probably get 10 TDs next year. I will draft him like he had at least 30 more fantasy points in 2024.\n\nBrian Thomas Jr. was 14th, perfect for those with him on their teams.\n\nOur No. 1 waiver wire TE, Brenton Strange, was the fourth-highest-targeted TE. The Jaguars play the Raiders in \u201cLost Wages.\u201d Strange finished behind Chig Okonkwo, but I need the Titans to play Mason Rudolph and not Will Levis to pick up Okonkwo. We know this is at least planned.\n\nThe Tennessee #Titans are planning to make a switch at quarterback this week, source told ESPN. Mason Rudolph is the logical candidate to step in for starter Will Levis, who likely heads to the bench barring surprise. \u2014 Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) December 17, 2024\n\nIf he\u2019s starting again in Week 16, Stone Smartt (the last T stands for \u201cTargets,\u201d says my Yahoo colleague and podcast partner Scott Pianowski) is in the top 12 TE conversation \u2013 early game against the Broncos, who shut down WRs and don\u2019t care about tight ends.\n\n(Top photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)"

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nRumor mill: Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, which spearheaded a recent push to promote Arm-based Windows, have exclusively powered laptops so far. However, new reports suggest that the company's next-generation lineup will fulfill its promise to expand into desktops following its canceled mini PC.\n\nEstablished leaker Roland Quandt believes the previously leaked follow-up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite series of CPUs is intended for desktops. Numerous laptops featuring the chips launched earlier this year running an Arm-based version of Windows, and the company aims to expand into other form factors.\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Elite (or possibly X Elite 2), codenamed Project Glymur, initially appeared in international import-export databases in late September, according to WinFuture. Hardware details are scarce, but Qualcomm previously used special housing to test the NAND and RAM chips for a new flagship processor with the model number SC8480XP.\n\nI think Qualcomm is coming for the desktop with Snapdragon \"X Elite 2\". They're testing \"Project Glymur\" SC8480XP with an AIO liquid cooler feat 120mm fan(s?), just like what you'd use in a (gaming) desktop \u2013 Roland Quandt (@rquandt.bsky.social) December 9, 2024 at 8:26 PM\n\nQuandt reports that the company has begun testing the CPU with AIO liquid coolers resembling those typically used for gaming desktops, suggesting Qualcomm is aiming for higher-end sectors. Snapdragon X Elite laptops have demonstrated modest gaming performance thus far, but seeing what they can accomplish with higher power budgets could be intriguing.\n\nThe company announced plans to bring Snapdragon to all PC form factors at a July Computex presentation but has since remained silent on the subject. Qualcomm unveiled a Snapdragon X Elite mini PC for use as a dev kit earlier in the year but abruptly ceased selling and supporting the device in October.\n\nGeekom might become the first company to release a Snapdragon X desktop. The mini PC manufacturer hasn't formally announced the device, but a leaked promo image reveals that it will be called the QS series and house the top-end X Elite CPU in an aluminum chassis.\n\nAlthough various laptop manufacturers released new models featuring Qualcomm's chips, they haven't amassed a significant presence in the overall PC market yet. Lower prices, which the company promises will come next year, could help attract customers.\n\nGenAI is a primary selling point of Snapdragon X Elite and other \"AI PC\" processors, but users have shown little interest in the technology. Instead, Qualcomm's main advantage might be longer battery life, with some laptops featuring the company's chips lasting a whole day on a single charge.\n\nThe likelihood of desktops running Windows on Arm is expected to increase with the emergence of Arm CPUs from other manufacturers. Nvidia has teased plans for one in 2025, and Arm previously stated that more clients are preparing chips."

Since the 1800s, only 6 samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand. From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jeremiah and Laura Burke produced their documentary about Pastor David Platt, they never imagined it would reach a global audience. Released in fall 2023, the film has garnered more than 100,000 views on Conversations that Matter alone, with additional viewership across other platforms.\n\nAn earlier BNG article about the documentary \u2014 The Real David Platt: The Hijacking of McLean Bible Church \u2014 has drawn tens of thousands of readers.\n\nIt is unusual for a group of laypeople to lead such a public revolt against their own church and pastor as what has happened at McLean, a five-campus nondenominational megachurch in suburban Washington, D.C. It is more unusual for laity to take their own church to court. And it is unheard of to create a two-part documentary series outlining grievances against the pastor.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what has happened at McLean Bible Church, where the arrival of David Platt as pastor in 2017 set off a chain of events not unprecedented in American churches but absolutely unprecedented in the public nature of the dispute. The disaffected members have their own website to tell their story.\n\nOne reason for the public attention is that Platt came to the pastorate from the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention International Mission Board.\n\nSome longtime McLean members did not want anything to do with the SBC because they are proudly nondenominational.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Platt and other church leaders have denied any wrongdoing and have protrayed themselves as victims of a campaign by disgruntled church members.\n\nJeremiah and Laura Burke\n\nAmong those leading the charge against Platt are Jeremiah and Laura Burke. He is a self-described \u201ctypical layman\u201d who comes from a business background in wealth management.\n\n\u201cI was a member of McLean since 2005 \u2026 just a rank-and-file member. A Christian husband and father of four children, just a regular everyday guy, nothing unique,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who David Platt was until he started speaking at McLean and became the pastor of the church.\u201d\n\nHis awareness of church politics at McLean heightened only after Platt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cIt had come to my attention that he had written a couple of books because he spoke in the summer of 2015,\u201d Burke recalled. \u201cHe had come to the church and was a guest pastor for a weekend event, and that was my first exposure to David Platt. Then it wasn\u2019t again until 2016 or 2017, when the church started transitioning out of their prior senior pastor, that David\u2019s name started coming up as being the new pastor to replace long-time pastor Lon Solomon.\u201d\n\nWhile initially open to Platt\u2019s leadership despite his admiration for Solomon, Burke\u2019s perspective began to shift by 2020.\n\n\u201cThere was a series of issues that had come to light over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen David first came on, I guess there was a gloominess over the church in a sense, in that it didn\u2019t seem like everyone was aware of what was happening but you kind of just trust your leadership. It seemed like there were some things that were just not right in the whole transition process.\u201d\n\nBurke reflected on the sudden leadership change: \u201cFor the 10 years I was at McLean, you had a solid pastor. Lon Solomon was a stalwart leader and then all of a sudden, he was gone, David came in and Lon never came back. We had been in Israel on a trip with him, he does these tours to Israel. I remember him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die in the pulpit. I\u2019m not leaving this church.'\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by Baptist News Global, Solomon provided this statement: \u201cIf you have seen Part 2 of the video series, you will see that I was removed by the elders from all operational involvement at MBC early in 2017 as a part of my separation agreement. Also, as part of my separation agreement, I am not at liberty to comment on events at MBC or David Platt.\u201d\n\nThe summer of 2020\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked a turning point, as Platt addressed racial and social issues from the pulpit, following controversy from his 2019 prayer over former President Donald Trump. McLean historically had attracted political figures, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, but Burke perceived a shift in atmosphere: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to see famous political people there. David made a story out of it. I guess a lot of people interpreted it as an apology, and that kind of riled some people up.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further complicated matters.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when COVID came up, the shutting down the church was another huge exodus of people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was problematic because everybody started going to other churches. At McLean you had to register to attend, you had to let them know you were coming.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point for Burke came when he discovered the nondenominational church\u2019s connection to the SBC, which he believed violated church bylaws prohibiting denominational affiliation. His investigation revealed McLean\u2019s involvement with the SBC of Virginia and the North American Mission Board through church planting initiatives.\n\n\u201cI just started to research whether we were part of the SBC or not,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn December 2020, at the first congregational meeting they had in person, I remember a lady asking if we were part of the denomination and David said from the pulpit no. However, that\u2019s not what I discovered.\u201d\n\nSBC church planting partnerships\n\nNot only was Platt educated and ordained by Southern Baptists and served in Southern Baptist leadership, the Bible church got involved in church planting partnerships with the SBC North American Mission Board.\n\nChurch leaders contend this partnership with the SBC \u201cwas not a secret.\u201d The SBC connection predated Platt\u2019s tenure, coordinated primarily through Clint Clifton, who Burke identifies as \u201cseemingly the genesis of this SBC relationship.\u201d\n\nThe discovery left Burke feeling betrayed: \u201cI had no idea I was a Southern Baptist. I had no idea for years that I was a Southern Baptist.\u201d\n\nThe conflict escalated to the point where Burke and his family were charged with trespassing at their own church. Determined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nDetermined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nConflict remains, as does attention\n\n\u201cI feel like I have two jobs now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally grassroots, but the amount of people who have seen it is kind of mind boggling. It\u2019s all over the world at this point; people in Romania and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have seen it. There\u2019s a gentleman who reached out from Russia asking if he could have permission to translate it into Russian and distribute it through Russia. It\u2019s been overwhelming.\u201d\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nSeven years after Platt\u2019s arrival as pastor, the dispute is not resolved and Burke and other unhappy members and former members continue to press their case. Their next target is seeking to document where tens of thousands of dollars from NAMB went because they do not believe all the named church plants even exist.\n\nChurch leaders, meanwhile, released their own investigation that stated: \u201cAfter review of numerous financial transactions associated with this partnership, we are encouraged that no improper financial transactions were discovered either during annual external audits by an independent accounting firm or during the discovery process in the lawsuit. We can say, however, that the financial transactions for the church planting partnership were sometimes confusing.\u201d\n\nThat report also said: \u201cIt is unquestionably clear that MBC did not give up any independence or cede any authority over our local church to the SBC or any other denomination. We at MBC remain committed to maintaining our autonomy and independence as a local body of believers according to our understanding of what the Bible teaches about the authority of the local church, and we are grateful that we are moving closer and closer to a day when these kinds of legal updates will no longer be necessary.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nUnderstanding the David Platt story | Analysis by Maina Mwaura\n\nDavid Platt hopes for a biblical gospel instead of an American gospel\n\nFor now, David Platt has won the battle against internal critics at McLean Bible Church\n\nDavid Platt steps up schedule to step down at IMB"

It was completely unexpected, totally atypical for the period and for almost all of British prehistory,\u201d said Rick Schulting, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University who led the study."

            "article_content": "Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because is the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming, way back in spring this year. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.\n\nThe terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences- has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.\n\nFor starters, that introductory analogy is from the wrong millennium. Times Of Progress is set during the Industrial Revolution - the dawn of steam engines, trade unions and high-density urban housing. The first thing that grabs you about it is the presentation and aesthetic. We are in procedurally generated Isometric Land, with roads and railways binding together diamond-shaped town layouts. The buildings, terrain types and overall colour scheme are pleasantly clean - pale earth, red brick, green hill - but it isn't barren. There are some engrossing animated flourishes such as smoke plumes, and the way houses slowly fatten up into more complex dwellings.\n\nNonetheless, you might be tempted to call Times Of Progress \"minimalist\". It definitely seems more condensed than a lot of city-builders, but there are systems aplenty, including a few that spring more directly from the choice of period.\n\nTake scientific innovations and new technologies, such as typewriters, water frames or electrolysis. You don't simply assign scientists to research them yourself. Rather, they unlock according to a timeline as part of the wider Industrial Revolution, which encompasses your city and all the other, AI-governed cities on the map. You then spend points earned by meeting certain goals (like achieving a certain food output) to import new technologies and get access to them faster. In general, trade appears to be a big deal in Times Of Progress. There isn't a military element, and seemingly no distinct \"culture\" layer either, so your interactions with other metropoli will be mostly mercantile.\n\nThere's also the question of labour politics. Workers in Times Of Progress may go on strike if a certain percentage in a certain place of work haven't been paid (in the form of food) for several weeks. You can meet their demands or implement a police crackdown. Workers may also unionise, once you pass the associated laws, making them more expensive but more efficient. Those with university educations may be more likely to strike.\n\nI like the balance Times Of Progress seems to be striking between the joy of building a model trainset and a carefully considered degree of historical fiddliness. I suspect/hope that Sin will be along in the new year to write something more elaborate about the game. Please look kindly upon my fumbling early efforts, Sin! For the moment, you can read more about Times Of Progress on Steam. The developer Pressing Thumbs Games is a solo operator, based in Berlin, who uses the Rust programming language and the Bevy Engine. The studio's name apparently comes from the German equivalent for crossing your fingers to ensure good luck. Awww."

            "article_content": "Close your eyes and picture a football scout.\n\nHe \u2014 and it will always be a he \u2014 will be over 50, probably dressed in an overcoat and flat cap, and sat in a darkened corner of a far-flung stadium, scribbling observations in a battered notebook.\n\nBut this image of talent-spotters as football\u2019s wizened old-timers is outdated. In a sport in a constant state of flux, few sectors are undergoing such a sudden and disruptive transformation as scouting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development of data-driven modelling, an increasingly globalised marketplace and, most recently, the advent of artificial intelligence are delivering a revolution in how clubs identify and assess possible signings.\n\nAnd, as always with revolutions, the process is proving turbulent. Three Premier League clubs \u2014 Liverpool, Tottenham and Brighton & Hove Albion \u2014 have overhauled their recruitment departments this year while Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the co-owner of Manchester United, recently criticised the club\u2019s data capabilities, suggesting their own root-and-branch review may not be far away.\n\nAmid this turmoil, and ahead of the January transfer window, The Athletic has canvassed the views of 40 scouts from across the Premier League and EFL to test the temperature of the industry. Eight of them have spoken at length for this article, all doing so anonymously to protect working relationships.\n\nThe findings illustrate shifting, less predictable times. Just 10 per cent of the scouts that filled out our survey said the advent of data use had not impacted their role. The clear majority (72 per cent) consider its introduction as positive.\n\nBut a common concern is that theirs is likely to become a shrinking industry. Almost half of respondents were unsure if they would still be working as a scout in five years.\n\nIn a topic that will be analysed in greater detail later this week, two-thirds of scouts also believe the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) will be the next advancement to impact their role.\n\nIn an industry that employs thousands, a sample size of 40 scouts should not be considered scientific. But the findings of The Athletic\u2018s survey and the weight of anecdotal evidence are enough to confirm that the changes in football scouting are only just beginning \u2014 and are likely to have far-reaching consequences.\n\nEvery club can decide just how much they wish to allow data to shape their recruitment strategy, but behind these debates are what one top-flight scout calls \u201cculture clashes\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor the older scouts, their ability to stay in the game is going to come from how they use the data side,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ones who don\u2019t listen are the ones being phased out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt means that the stereotypical scout mentioned above is an increasingly rare presence at English football stadiums \u2014 a trend that is likely to please as many people as it will dismay.\n\nA player\u2019s statistical output might not be the decisive factor in settling a transfer decision, with final calls still shaped by those picking apart performances, but the numbers increasingly structure the search.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a great deal of complacency in the scouting industry,\u201d says one figure from an established Premier League club. \u201cIt\u2019s come from a lack of respect for what data can provide and also a lack of understanding of what data can offer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also been a lack of best practice within the industry. At the moment, scouting opportunities are shrinking because the belief in what the scouts can produce has slipped away quite considerably in the last few years as the data has taken on greater significance.\u201d\n\nIt is that quest for the middle ground, though, that has caused friction and separation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shifting time,\u201d says one chief scout at an EFL club, who has previously worked in the Premier League. \u201cI know a lot of scouts who in the last six to 12 months have been cast aside. To me, that\u2019s a loss to the game. They have been part of a cull.\u201d\n\nBecause they\u2019re old-school?\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re different,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou can call it old-school but I would say different to what a lot of clubs want now. They bring a lot of skills. It\u2019s intuition, it\u2019s an eye, it\u2019s gut feeling, experience and knowledge. That type of data is getting put to one side and the numbers are now flavour of the month. There\u2019s room for both but to me, one can\u2019t exist without the other.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Data and video scouting - how important is it and how does it work?\n\nOne former scout, who worked for clubs in the Premier League and Championship, brings up a scene from Moneyball, the film that details Billy Beane\u2019s transformation of the Oakland A\u2019s baseball team through data analysis. In it, Beane, played by Brad Pitt, sits in front of his scouting team and presents their new strategy. Very little else matters so long as \u201che gets on base.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur meetings were like that, with the old boys putting their thoughts in and not really being interested in the rest,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cYou go to games now and predominantly the scouts would all be young lads. The analysis types, the ones on their laptops, young kids who are more data-driven. Some can be excellent, though. You\u2019d still have the old boys (attending games) but there\u2019s definitely less of them.\u201d\n\nBilly Beane\u2019s \u2018Moneyball\u2019 system transformed the way football used scouting (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nIt is a non-scientific snapshot of the industry but a 60 per cent majority of respondents to The Athletic\u2019s survey were aged between 26 and 45. Only a fifth formerly played professional football.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made sure in our department that, because I\u2019ve never played the game, I wanted someone who had,\u201d says one chief scout at an EFL club. \u201cThey can relate to different experiences.\n\n\u201cYou need to get a balance. I like to know someone who has played the game and has different experiences from mine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at clubs previously when the scouts came in it was like Dad\u2019s Army but they don\u2019t half find some good players. The data has been coming for a long time but we\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s almost taken over for some clubs.\u201d\n\nFootball is a game of trends and the successes of data-driven clubs in the transfer market such as Brighton and Brentford, have made them the ones to follow. Thousands of players from all corners of the globe can be monitored and whittled down using statistical analysis, allowing clubs to draw up shortlists based on the data.\n\nScouts are still employed and valued (Brentford have 15 on their books) but their skill set has needed to evolve. Filling out a scouting report and placing it on a manager\u2019s desk is no longer the process.\n\n\u201cThere was a need to change,\u201d says one experienced head of recruitment at an EFL club. \u201cIf we get transfers wrong now, then ultimately it\u2019s millions of pounds. There\u2019s got to be a blend of video, data, eyes and feel and character references to the nth degree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re all trying to do ultimately is to find the undervalued talent. Let\u2019s say a club wants to sign a player, you can\u2019t watch all of his games ahead of signing him. But what data allows is for you to judge a player over 50 or 100 games. As long as the data is set in the right way, around positional and team needs, it helps you find the players that can help you. You can\u2019t have 100 scouts out every week because the cost is so high.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of scouts spoken to for this article see the help that data has delivered. They are positive about its influence, rather than seeing it as a threat.\n\n\u201cData used in the right way has certainly helped,\u201d says an EFL club\u2019s chief scout. \u201cBrentford and Brighton, two of the clubs you\u2019d associate most with being data-driven, have always had scouts at games still. They\u2019re not passing judgement on laptops. Data can be misused if you\u2019re not applying a context to it. There\u2019s got to be a \u2018Why?\u2019 element to it.\u201d\n\nTony Bloom, the Brighton owner, recently overhauled the club\u2019s scouting department (Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images)\n\nTechnological advances, too, have made the scouting world smaller. More players are typically watched via online platforms, such as Wyscout \u2014 where games can be dissected in forensic detail \u2014 than in the flesh across most weeks.\n\n\u201cWhen I started 20 years ago, we\u2019d write off to a guy in Germany and request a list of DVDs he\u2019d download from a satellite dish and send over in a week or two,\u201d says one Premier League scout. \u201cWyscout brought a big change but the data side has been a massive new thing in the last decade or so.\n\n\u201cYou can now pretty much watch 80-90 per cent of what you\u2019d need to watch at the click of a button the next day. It\u2019s been a huge gamechanger. I probably do close to 80 per cent of my scouting now through videos.\u201d\n\nThat reality has forced working practices to alter. Scouts used to often be the first point of contact for targets, speaking with agents and counterparts to understand a player\u2019s attainability. That influence can still be there but it has diminished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe great unknown is where scouting will be in 10 years. Brighton\u2019s overhaul in November saw several scouts made redundant, with a move away from their model of position-specific scouting. Premier League leaders Liverpool, however, have advertised for scouting roles in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be smaller departments,\u201d predicts one Premier League scout. \u201cIn a bid to be everywhere, I think a lot of clubs have overhired. You\u2019re going to have to be multiskilled and, eventually, those older scouts will be phased out. A Premier League club is going to look increasingly like an EFL club. They\u2019ll need to be more efficient.\u201d\n\nAn experienced EFL chief scout has the same misgivings. \u201cThere\u2019s part of me that\u2019s uneasy with just using data and video, and signing players solely on that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to dig deeper, try to understand the personality and what they\u2019re all about. That\u2019s traditionally been the work of scouts.\n\n\u201cMaybe before you\u2019d have one analyst and 10 scouts, now it\u2019s going to be 10 analysts and one scout.\n\n\u201cClubs like Brighton and Brentford have elevated themselves through scouting. Look at a club like Manchester United with 70-odd scouts. Do you think that\u2019s really the future? I can\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER The reality of being a scout: 'You do it for love - not money'\n\nFor all the flux, scouting remains a job that plenty covet and enjoy. You are the talent spotters and, as such, inevitably spend a life watching football. It is common to spend four or five days of the week attending football matches, filing reports and building up opinions.\n\nForty per cent of survey respondents said they will typically work six-day weeks and a fifth told us they will work, on average, more than 60 hours a week.\n\nAll that means almost a third of scouts taking part said they will attend more than 120 games a season and six out of 10 will watch that same figure again on recorded games or streams. It is worth noting that a significant number of scouts to fill out the survey held part-time roles or that number would inevitably have been higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best bit of the job?\n\n\u201cThe people you meet, the community of scouts you get to know, is the best part,\u201d says one Premier League scout. \u201cYou\u2019re competing against one another but you make good friends. Football is a small place but there\u2019s nothing better than when you\u2019ve played your part in bringing a player in. That feeling is really good.\u201d\n\nAnother operating at the highest level concurs. \u201cI absolutely love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess it\u2019s the involvement in the game, the participation at such a high level in world football. Even if you\u2019re a small contribution, it\u2019s very rewarding.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming majority of scouts surveyed by The Athletic said they felt valued by their club. That contrasts markedly with the mood of support staff, including strength and conditioning coaches, physios and masseurs, previously surveyed by The Athletic last year.\n\nScouting, on the surface, feels like a more content world.\n\nOver a third said their annual earnings were more than \u00a350,000; that figure is dwarfed by many who work in football but is still well above the UK national median salary of \u00a337,430, according to the most recent figures published by the Office of National Statistics.\n\nIt is still a curious quirk \u2014 and perhaps an indication of football\u2019s draw \u2014 that many scouts working for clubs below the Premier League do so without pay. Some will cover mileage and expenses but it is common for plenty of scouts to effectively work as volunteers, with admission to games and a branded jacket the only tangible return.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got your foot half in the door but, because you\u2019ve got so few full-time roles, then it\u2019s very difficult for that to lead somewhere,\u201d says one scout at a League One club, who estimates reports can take roughly 15 minutes to write up on every player they have been asked to track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a volunteer so I don\u2019t get anything. No mileage or expenses. That\u2019s common at League One and League Two level. You\u2019ll get a few (clubs) paying expenses but a lot aren\u2019t on a wage. Maybe the club sells it as an internship where you\u2019re going to games and getting experience but really it\u2019s the chance to go and watch a game on a Saturday, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nAnd that is just it; something between a simple pleasure and a privilege. Understanding family and friends is also a must. One chief scout, employed by an EFL club, says he has just spent four out of five midweek days attending a game ahead of a 300-mile round trip for another on the Saturday.\n\n\u201cYou have to be comfortable with spending many hours away from home,\u201d says another scout at a Premier League club. \u201cYou\u2019re driving home at 10pm on a night and it can be a lonely life. It\u2019s almost Stockholm syndrome. Most scouts get to May and say they\u2019ve got one more season left in them but they get to July and they can\u2019t wait for the season to start. That\u2019s definitely a thing but it\u2019s something I love.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: iStock; design: Dan Goldfarb)"
