        "article_content": "0 SHARES Share Tweet\n\nUFO 50 Review: Making History\n\nBetween 1982 and 1989, UFO Soft put out a wide variety of classic games for their LX game console. Their titles ranged from shooters and RPGs to sports games and pretty much every genre under the sun. These games, and this console, have been largely forgotten over the years, but this under-heralded team was way ahead of their time and put out a catalog of games that should be considered classics. Now, 50 of those games are back in this fantastic collection called UFO 50. It celebrates what made these games great and really shows off the wide variety of games that were available on the LX.\n\nNone of that is actually true. UFO Soft never existed, and the LX game console wasn\u2019t a thing. What if they were, though? That\u2019s the question asked by some of the best games in the indie gaming space, including Derek Yu and Eirik Suhrke, who are responsible for hits like Spelunky and Downwell. Eight years ago, they got together with a group of indie developers and decided to make a fictional collection of games from a fictional company. The plan was to release it two years later, but making 50 games takes a while, and this title got pushed back again and again. Now, though, UFO 50 is finally here after eight years of development, and thankfully, it was well worth the wait.\n\nYou Can Have Whatever You Like\n\nWhen we think of a development group making 50 games for a collection, I think most of us would tend to assume those would be minigames or at least micro-games. Short and simple titles that wouldn\u2019t take long to make. That\u2019s not the case here, though, at least not largely. The games in UFO 50 are all designed as if they were made for a console released throughout the 80s. As anyone who played games in that period knows, a game that debuted in 1982 is generally very different from a game released in 1989. That means some of the early games in UFO 50 are quite simple, in the same way early black box Nintendo games were. Basic action games, puzzle games that take place on a single screen but with a fun twist, and early side-scrollers, which have a cool hook but don\u2019t look like much. By the end of the collection, though, you have incredibly cool vehicle-based shooters with unique movements, an idle game that encourages regularly returning to it, and a multi-genre action mashup that combines elements of Streets of Rage and Metal Gear with a bunch of owls who look like they belong in a late 80s cartoon.\n\nThe framing and backdrop of UFO 50 is definitely cool, but none of it would be more than a brief curiosity if the games weren\u2019t good. Thankfully though, those eight years of development paid off. In a group of 50 games, not every title can be a true must-play. Still, the hit rate for this many games is really impressive. There are a few games here that don\u2019t do much for me, like Planet Zoldath, which is a bit too slow for my taste, or Onion Delivery, which has controls that definitely feel out of the 80s but which I wouldn\u2019t have liked even then. But even these feel plucked from an era they never existed in and helped set the tone of the collection. The games here are presented in release order by default, though you can sort them many ways easily, and all games are unlocked from the start. If you play in release order as I did at first, you\u2019ll find that some of the early games are a little harder to get into. Barbuta is the first game, and it\u2019s dense, with unintuitive controls and a confusing layout that feels very 1982 but which modern players may bounce off of. Even these early games, though, often have a shocking amount of depth under the hood if you stick with them.\n\nDiving In\n\nLike action games? Mortol is a fascinating title where you have three options to sacrifice your character at any time to clear a path forward for your next life. The goal is to get through each level with as many lives remaining as possible. Kick Club is like a mix of Snow Bros and Bubble Bobble with superb style, which has kept me coming back again and again. The three Campanella titles are all great and show a wonderful evolution of a series. Velgress is basically reverse Downwell, and I mean that as a huge compliment. Rakshasa has a fantastic twist on death which allows you to keep coming back but makes it harder and harder each time you die. Seaside Drive is one of the best driving games I\u2019ve played in a while, with an absolutely killer soundtrack which is true for a lot of these games. Overbold is essentially Smash TV, but with a risk/reward system built in, which got me in trouble far more often than I\u2019d like to admit, but it always kept me coming back for one more run.\n\nIf you want something that\u2019s a bit more puzzle-like, Magic Garden has stolen more of my life in the last week than any other game here. A fascinating mix of Snake and Pac-Man, it\u2019s incredibly charming and addicting. Paint Chase mixes Splatoon with cars and works far better than it has any right to. Attactics forces you to manage your resources to build an army that can protect your castle while taking that of your opponent. Like a lot of these games, it has local multiplayer available, and it\u2019s great for it. Party House is a deck builder that I cannot stop playing, which forces you to manage resources and play a sort of risk versus reward game as you build the ultimate party.\n\nIf you like RPGs, there are plenty of options. Lords of Diskonia is a first-person dungeon crawler that mixes real-time combat with your exploration of the lost depths. Grimstone is a Wild West RPG with timing-based combat and a system of selecting your party, which surprised me from the jump. It\u2019s great, though you will need to be prepared to grind like most RPGs of that time. Vainger is Metroid with the ability to flip your world upside down at any time. Or you have Porgy, an incredibly charming, if difficult, underwater Metroidvania where you\u2019re constantly upgrading your adorable ship to go just a bit further.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThere are some games here that are harder to group together, too. Rail Heist is an action stealth game where you must sneak onto a train and rob it while getting away with the money. It combines action with puzzle elements in a way I\u2019m not sure any actual 80s games touched, but it\u2019s very cool. Cyber Owls combines four different genres, and while no one of them feels out of time, putting them together pushes it though it is presented as the last game here chronologically. Night Manor is a rather short but impressive point-and-click game right out of the era. There are even a couple of early platform fighters here, with Hyper Contender being a lot of fun.\n\nUFO 50 offers plenty of other games here that I really liked, but I haven\u2019t even mentioned, like Rock On! Island, Mini & Max, Warptank, Waldorf\u2019s Journey, and Bug Hunter. There\u2019s too much here to go into every game with much depth, but many of these games are very good with multiple challenges to complete in each. Each game has not only a base goal of completing them but a higher cherry goal to show you really mastered the game.\n\nBeyond just providing 50 interesting games, UFO 50 also features a code console players can access to put in codes you\u2019ll find hidden throughout the game. These codes can be anything from cheats within certain games to hidden areas, which will unlock more info about UFO Soft. They\u2019re not the main reason to buy UFO 50, but they are a neat little extra for those who fall in love with this collection.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe developers of UFO 50 took on a monumental task in creating 50 unique games for their fictional collection but they accomplished it in wildly successful fashion. Not only are the large majority of these games excellent, but when taken as a fictional canon, they make each other even better. Seeing how they bounce off each other, interact, and tell a story just in the way they evolve is a wonderful experience that\u2019s unlike any other game I\u2019ve played. That said, the main reason to play UFO 50 is because it\u2019s absolutely packed with great games, many of which could have been released on their own and been successful. If you have any affinity for the era of gaming UFO 50 is depicting, you should absolutely check it out.\n\nFinal Verdict: 5/5\n\nAvailable on: PC (reviewed); Publisher: Mossmouth; Developer: Mossmouth; Players: 2; Released: September 18th, 2024; ESRB: N/A; MSRP: $24.99\n\nFull disclosure: This review is based on a retail copy of UFO 50."

Above, another USAF F-22 Raptor during an air show over Toronto, Canada on August 31, 2024\n\nThis official, a director of e-communications for Canadian DND named Taylor Paxton, advised military colleagues that this confusion would be inevitable 'given the current public environment and statements related to the object being benign.'\n\nPaxton suggested that any move by the Royal Canadian Air Force to publish the photo on social media would likely only raise more inquiries from the general public and the press 'regardless of the text that will accompany the post.'\n\nThe emails, obtained along with the eerie new UFO photo by CTVNews.ca reporter Daniel Otis via an open records law request, also included efforts by members of Canada's armed forces to better understand the craft that had been shot down.\n\nOne email from Canadian Brigadier-General Eric Laforest described the UFO as a 'cylindrical object.'\n\n'Top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20-foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended,' Brig. Gen. Laforest wrote. 'Best description that we have.'\n\nThe suspected spy balloon was one of four airborne objects gunned out of the sky by the US over eight days of February 2023. One unusual feature of the newly released UFO photo is that it had already been designated 'unclassified' within just days of these 19-month-old incidents\n\nA possible reason, as one public affairs official with Canada's Department of National Defence (DND) warned colleagues, was the Canadian military's own internal fears that releasing this UFO image 'may create more questions/confusion'\n\nDark portions visible along the top center of the UFO in this newly released image may depict either that upper metallic region or the remains of the alleged 'package.'\n\nBut this release only adds more mystery to the wave of espionage-tinted UFO activity that surrounded the confirmed downing of an authentic Chinese-government spy balloon earlier that month off the coast of North Carolina's Myrtle Beach.\n\nIain Boyd, a professor of aerospace engineering and director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado, described the Canadian government's reticence to release the image as an issue of national security \u2014 despite the image's 'unclassified' designation.\n\n'It comes down to these episodes illustrating a potential vulnerability in the U.S./Canada defensive system,' Boyd opined.\n\n'Certainly the failure to provide more information has fed conspiracy theories,' as he told CTVNews.ca, 'but the military will likely accept that outcome over disclosing information that may help an adversary identify defensive weaknesses.'\n\nAccording to the report for CTV News, the network's journalists plan to petition the Canadian military for a higher resolution version of this UFO image."

        "article_content": "An alleged USAF intelligence insider has gone public with what he says is a 70-year history of the pentagon's negotiations with non-human intelligence \u2013 and says that a huge escalation is imminent\n\nOne of the most dramatic events in the history of mankind is set to take place in the coming months, according to claims from a UFO whistleblower. Charles McNeal alleges that he was recruited into a top-secret US Air Force intelligence unit tasked with maintaining a 70-year truce between the American government and an alien civilisation.\n\nThis truce agreement, McNeal claims (without any proof of his credentials) on his YouTube channel, is set to come to an end at the end of September 2024. He claims that a planned series of events, including the partial \u2013 or possibly total \u2013 destruction of the state of Israel, a brief global conflict and a staged alien invasion using reverse-engineered UFO technology will soon follow.\n\nOne of the first parts of this overarching plan, according to McNeal, will be the announcement of an alliance between the US and Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government.\n\nImage: Getty Images/Stocktrek Images) Getty Images/Stocktrek Images)\n\nMcNeal alleges that a slow drip feed of information, through both news outlets and fictional accounts of extraterrestrial contact through films and TV, has been part of a campaign to prepare the global population for the shock of encountering an alien species. \u201cThis is known as the Public Acclimation Program,\u201d he bizarrely says. \u201cFor decades you have been force-fed fictionalised version of the truth via TV, movies and books.\u201d\n\nHe outlines the entire shocking scheme on his \u201cAcclimate Now\u201d website, including an orchestrated third world war, the main purpose of which will be to intimidate the public while culling vast numbers of the civilian population. This war, he claims, will be interrupted by an \u201calien invasion\u201d that has been in the planning for decades.\n\nMany of the \u201calien craft\u201d on view during this phase, he claims, will in reality be a secret USAF development that he calls the TR3-B Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV).\n\nImage: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut soon, McNeal says, we willed be introduced to a variety of real aliens, including cybernetically enhanced humanoids from a planet in the Rigel star system: \u201cType A-C have a grey or greyish pigmentation that can come off a bit chalky sometimes,\" he says. \"They have four fingers with little suction cups on the ends of each finger and some have webbing in between their fingers and toes. Type D have a brownish pigmentation and five fingers and five toes.\n\n\u201cThis species started off fully biological until they ventured out into the cosmos and came into contact with what they now answer to, something called \"The Keeper\". They now worship technology and started to incorporate mechanics into their biological makeup thousands of years ago.\u201d\n\nHe further alleges that, following initial contact with these beings in the late 1940s, the US government has since had dealings with a number of different alien species over the years, and that news of all of these extraterrestrial civilisations will be made public in the coming few years.\n\nImage: US Navy/Youtube) US Navy/Youtube)\n\nBut even the public revelation of these alien visitors, he says, will not contain the whole truth:\u201dUnfortunately,\u201d McNeal says, \u201ceven the disclosure process is not planned to be 100% honest or transparent. It is only being used as tool for a very dangerous plan to bring the world together.\u201d\n\nMcNeal alleges that one of the core aims of this bizarre conspiracy is to establish a so-called \u201cNew World Order\u201d global government, under US control, to then establish a planet-wide alliance with these extraterrestrial visitors.\n\nBarring a few short videos of the alleged USAF \u201cAlien Reproduction Vehicle,\u201d McNeal has produced no hard evidence to support his claims. But, if his suggestion that the global realignment is set to begin at the end of September, we won\u2019t have long to wait to discover whether there is any truth to his allegations."

        "article_content": "Deepak Chopra, the world-renowned author and health and wellness expert, has teamed with AI firm ElevenLabs to add his pipes to the company\u2019s roster of notable voices available for audio streaming of books, articles and other written materials.\n\nChopra\u2019s voice pact with ElevenLabs stemmed from the \u201cDigital Deepak\u201d chatbot app that he launched with the company in June. The bot is trained in Chopak\u2019s more than 90 books and numerous public appearances in order to allow people to ask him specific questions and get responses delivered back in Chopra\u2019s synthetic voice.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nLondon-based ElevenLabs has been getting attention in the entertainment industry for its work to partner with the estates of celebrities such as Judy Garland, Laurence Olivier, James Dean and Burt Reynolds to allow users to stream books, articles and other texts as read in the voices of iconic stars. ElevenLabs\u2019 deal with Chopra comes the same day that the industry-leading, Microsoft-backed OpenAI platform rolled out a host of new voices and features to its Advanced Voice Mode service.\n\nChopra\u2019s latest pact with ElevenLabs adds his distinctive voice to the roster that users can choose from when streaming audio spoken-word content. ElevenLabs has made a major effort to underscore that it has worked with estates to reach license agreements offering appropriate compensation. The company also emphasizes that its vault of celebrity voices is only available for audio streaming of written material. ElevenLabs users are not able to use those voices to create new works.\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce my partnership with ElevenLabs. Listening can help cultivate emotional\n\nnurturing and engagement. This is no different in the age of AI, it is only more important,\u201d Chopra said.\n\n\u201cI have always written to connect with people, and now I can connect on a deeper level with a global audience as I make my teachings available for everyone in my own voice.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 outreach to the industry is an counteract the pervasive fear in Hollywood, particularly in the creative community, that AI tools will eventually pinch employment for actors, writers, directors, producers and below the line talent.\n\n\u201cAt ElevenLabs, we\u2019re committed to preserving and celebrating cultural legacies while pushing the boundaries of technology,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships for ElevenLabs. \u201cBy bringing voices like Deepak Chopra to our platform, we\u2019re not just enhancing our app \u2013 we\u2019re creating new ways for people to connect with the most influential figures and their work.\u201d\n\nMayim Bialik, actor and neuroscientist who is friendly with Chopra and closely following the growth of AI in content, added her thumbs-up for the ElevenLabs model. Actors in particular are focused in establishing the principle of compensation and consent when AI tools are employed to create new works from older material. AI concerns were at the heart of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s long strike last year and they are the key sticking point in the union\u2019s current strike against top video game publishers.\n\n\u201cDeepak has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to the mind-body connection and the significance of understanding ourselves, so it\u2019s no surprise to see him finding creative ways to leverage the latest and best in AI technology with ElevenLabs in a safe and responsible way,\u201d Bialik said. \u201cBeing able to access his content in his calm and soothing voice is a big win for his fans around\n\nthe world.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 latest deal also comes on the heels of AI legislation being signed in to law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom. With SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher at his side, Newsom on Sept. 17 signed two bills, championed by the union, that mandates that AI and tech firms receive the consent of performers if their likeness is to be used in AI-generated new material.\n\nElevenLabs sees the California legislation as a step in the right direction to establishing guardrails around a powerful new high-tech tool that has enormous potential to revolutionize productivity and the way we live and learn, but it also comes with enormous repercussions for copyright violations and misinformation concerns. Blank told Variety he sees such legislation at the state and federal level as essential to nurturing AI business opportunities in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe welcome \u2014 and we believe the whole industry should welcome \u2014 government efforts to hold accountable bad actors who create digital replicas of someone without their consent,\u201d Blank told Variety. \u201cRecognizing that there should be accountability for abuse of technology is an important part of making technology safer while still allowing progress to thrive.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

        "article_content": "Nothing OS 3.0 update was announced by the British smartphone maker on Tuesday, alongside the launch of the Nothing Ear Open - its first-ever open-style true wireless (TWS) earbuds. First teased earlier this year, the update will bring features powered by artificial intelligence (AI) such as natural language search and smart image categorisation. It is also said to introduce more customisation and personalisation options, new apps and widgets, and system-wide performance enhancements.\n\nIn a video posted on Nothing's YouTube channel, the company revealed several of the features included in its upcoming update. While not official, it is speculated to be based on Android 15 - the latest Android operating system (OS) which was globally released earlier this month.\n\nOne of the most notable changes of the upcoming Nothing OS 3.0 update is the revamped font. Nothing says it will feature an updated Sans Serif font alongside the existing N-Dot font across the OS as well as apps, bringing a more modern cleaner look. It also features a new dot animation engine which animates and makes it more dynamic during activities like unlocking or charging the handset. It can also display items such as the icons in the weather app in dot-matrix style.\n\nThe update also brings a completely new lock screen which allows editing more directly. It bundles new clock faces, typefaces, and design layouts. Quick settings in Nothing OS have also been revamped and are now based on the same grid system as the home screen. Users will also be able to pin apps at the top of the app drawer. Nothing has also introduced a new Countdown widget. As the name suggests, it will allow users to begin the countdown to a specific date, in addition to displaying things like a year's progress. They will also be able to link widgets with friends and family and share content across devices.\n\nAI features will also be included in Nothing OS 3.0, the Carl Pei-led company confirmed. It will bring a new smart app organisation system which automatically arranges them in different categories, based on the usage. Nothing's upcoming update is also confirmed to feature a new Gallery app that uses AI to automatically highlight the key object and segment it out from other parts of the image. The company will also introduce other AI features such as automatic AI image categorisation and more natural language search in the coming months. AI upscaling and super-resolution features have also been confirmed to be in development.\n\nNothing says its 3.0 update will be available in open beta starting October. Its public rollout will begin in December. The list of supported devices is said to be revealed soon."

I think we\u2019ve got one,\u201d said Hailong Chen, an associate professor at the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cOur cathode can be a game-changer. It would greatly improve the EV market \u2013 and the whole lithium-ion battery market.\u201d\n\nBatteries are responsible for around 50 per cent of the cost of an electric vehicle, with current technologies making them slightly more expensive than fossil fuel-powered vehicles at today\u2019s prices.\n\nWorldwide EV adoption has been largely driven by government subsidies, however many schemes have already come to an end, making the vehicles less economically viable.\n\nThe new cathode material could make electric cars cheaper than their polluting counterparts, while also offering a solution for larger-scale energy storage needs.\n\n\u201cThis could not only make EVs much cheaper than internal combustion cars, but it provides a new and promising form of large-scale energy storage, enhancing the resilience of the electrical grid,\u201d Professor Chen said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our cathode would greatly improve the sustainability and supply chain stability of the EV market.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was published in the journal Nature Sustainability this week in a study titled \u2018Low-cost iron trichloride cathode for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries\u2019.\n\nOther recent battery breakthroughs have seen scientists improve the range and charging times of electric cars, both of which are frequently cited as barriers to adoption.\n\nEarlier this month, researchers from the University of Boulder Colorado used an X-ray machine to figure out how to significantly increase the range of electric cars using lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\u201cHaving a better battery is very important in shifting our energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels to more renewable energy sources,\u201d said Michael Toney, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. \u201cAll consumers want cars with a large driving range.\u201d"

The inspiration for the group stemmed from witnessing firsthand how no-code platforms were breaking down barriers that had historically kept women \u2014 and many others \u2014 from entering tech.\n\nTrending Peacock Spider Dances Its Way Into Our Arachnophobic Hearts\n\nThe tech industry is often dominated by people with formal coding skills, which can be intimidating to those without a programming background, but no-code solutions have changed that dynamic. These platforms allow users to build and automate processes without writing a single line of code, meaning someone with an idea can bring it to life, whether creating a mobile app, automating workflows, or developing a new website without extensive technical expertise.\n\nWomen of NoCode was created to connect women with the resources, knowledge, and community to use these tools confidently. By leveraging no-code solutions, women can bring their innovative ideas to life and challenge the notion that tech innovation is reserved for coders.\n\nSupporting Women in Tech Through Resources and Networking\n\nOne of the key pillars of the Women of NoCode group is the support it provides to women in tech through a variety of resources and networking opportunities. From curated content to expert-led discussions, the group offers a wealth of information on how to navigate the no-code landscape. Women who are just starting their tech journey and seasoned professionals alike can all find something of value in the group.\n\nNetworking plays a vital role in advancing one\u2019s career, and Women of NoCode fosters this through a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation. The group offers a platform where women can collaborate on projects, seek advice, and exchange best practices. Whether through virtual meetups, webinars, or simply engaging with posts on the LinkedIn group, members have countless opportunities to grow their network and gain insights from others in the field.\n\nWhat makes Women of NoCode unique is that it is not just a space to talk about tools and platforms but a space to celebrate women\u2019s achievements in tech. Every success story shared within the group serves as a reminder of what women are capable of when given the right tools and opportunities. These stories help inspire others, fostering a ripple effect of empowerment across the community.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the no-code movement is how it democratizes access to tech. In the past, building a software application or automating business processes required either hiring a developer or learning to code \u2014 both of which are traditionally costly and time-consuming. No-code platforms have changed that, making it possible for anyone, regardless of their background, to become a creator in the tech space.\n\nFor women, this is particularly empowering. Studies show that women are still underrepresented in many technical fields, often due to a lack of access to the necessary training or mentorship. No-code platforms offer a way to bridge this gap by enabling women to acquire tech skills without writing code or requiring programming skills.\n\nThrough Women of NoCode, women are discovering how to leverage no-code tools to solve real-world problems, launch new businesses, and innovate within their existing roles. The accessibility of these tools means that more women can enter the tech industry, contribute to digital transformation, and bring important and unique perspectives to the table.\n\nNo-code solutions also help to level the playing field for entrepreneurs. With the rise of tech startups and the increasing demand for digital transformation, no-code platforms are giving women the ability to build, test, and launch products quickly, opening more doors for women entrepreneurs who may have previously faced challenges securing technical talent or funding. By removing these barriers, no-code empowers more women to become tech leaders and innovators.\n\nJoin The Movement\n\nThe Women of NoCode LinkedIn group is a movement that encourages women to take control of their tech journeys, embrace innovation, and break down barriers that may have held them back. In this group, members are given access to free training, learning how to use no-code tools effectively while building the confidence to lead in an industry that is constantly evolving.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman in tech, a woman in business, and a woman with a great idea for the next great company \u2014 or even just someone curious about the possibilities of no-code \u2014 joining Women of NoCode will connect you with a thriving community of innovators, problem solvers, and leaders. The future of tech is inclusive, and no-code is helping to make that a reality. Being a part of this group will help you stay at the forefront of tech innovation and contribute to a growing ecosystem of empowered women ready to change the world."

        "article_content": "\u25cf AI-powered platform offers contextual and actionable recommendations based on identified operational inefficiencies\n\n\u25cf Introduces no-code ML platform for users to perform highly customized and complex analyses\n\n\u25cf The new 6.0 version of Analytics Plus boasts a central metrics repository, serving as a single destination for all IT metrics\n\nDubai, UAE: ManageEngine, a division of Zoho Corporation and a leading provider of enterprise IT management solutions, today announced a significant upgrade to its flagship IT analytics solution, Analytics Plus. Version 6.0 introduces Spotlight, a contextual recommendations engine powered by AI, designed to identify key inefficiencies in IT operations and suggest corrective strategies.\n\n\n\nThe 2023 State of Analytics Engineering report found that time to business insight is the biggest challenge for nearly 50% of surveyed directors. Spotlight dramatically reduces the time IT managers and CIOs spend analyzing various IT metrics and coming up with remedies to fix structural fault lines in operations. By incorporating decision-intelligence capabilities, Analytics Plus now facilitates contextual decision-making, addressing a crucial gap in traditional analytics software.\n\n\n\nFor instance, Analytics Plus can analyze correlations between the age of IT assets, their frequency of failure, and the mean time to repair. Based on these parameters, it suggests the optimal time frame for asset replacement. This approach ensures that organizations neither dispose of assets prematurely, losing usable value, nor retain them for too long, negatively impacting employee productivity. With the introduction of Spotlight, ManageEngine reinforces its commitment to enhancing IT operations through intelligent, data-driven solutions.\n\n\n\n\"While traditional analytics tools excel at providing a platform for analyzing any type of data, they often lack the necessary context of the data they are analyzing. Deriving meaningful and context-specific insights is becoming increasingly challenging due to a significant disconnect: the people performing the analysis are skilled at mining data but often lack the IT context, making it difficult to translate findings into actionable business decisions,\" said Samantha Hall, Service Delivery Manager, Leathams Ltd., a UK-based food supplying company.\n\n\n\nAnalytics Plus' built-in AI engine is programmed to study common IT processes and identify solutions to achieve desired results more quickly. Spotlight acts like an assistant, constantly monitoring for bottlenecks or operational inefficiencies and offering tips for corrective action. By bringing in IT context and leveraging AI capabilities, Analytics Plus ensures that organizations can address issues more effectively and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\"Organizations no longer want to spend hours mining data for actionable insights. They require ready-made strategies that they can implement immediately to see rapid results,\" said Rakesh Jayaprakash, product manager and chief analytics evangelist at ManageEngine. He added, \"There are sufficient tools in the market that promise automation and remediation for day-to-day network and application failures, but there's a lack of focus on strategic decision-making. This is the gap Spotlight aims to bridge.\"\n\n\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\n\nQuick decision-making is only half the journey; IT managers and CIOs also need a way to backtest their decisions to ensure a new strategy or model will achieve the desired results. In addition to decision intelligence capabilities, ManageEngine is introducing the Root Cause Analysis feature, which automatically identifies the top factors contributing to a particular trend. This feature allows IT managers and CIOs to verify whether their changes or decisions are having a positive impact.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if tools are implemented for auto-remediation of L1 network issues, Root Cause Analysis can look at the increased uptime and highlight the reduction in L1 network issues as the major contributor to better network uptime.\n\n\n\nNo-Code Auto-ML for Deep Analysis\n\nThe new version of Analytics Plus empowers IT teams to create custom machine learning (ML) models without writing a single line of code.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, developing and deploying ML models was restricted to experts. However, Analytics Plus\u2019 no-code ML platform democratizes this process, allowing IT managers to develop ML models directly on the data they are familiar with.\n\n\n\nWith this capability, IT managers can build ML models for prediction and classification, such as a predictive model to derive the probability of ticket escalations based on various factors or related events. This approach ensures the development of highly specific and accurate models because they are built on the organization's unique data and validated by the very people who use it daily.\n\n\n\nUnified IT Metrics Library\n\nAnalytics Plus serves as a command center and decision hub for IT by contextually analyzing all IT data, enabling organizations to cross-correlate metrics and identify interdependencies. Analytics Plus version 6.0 introduces the Unified IT Metrics Library, listing all KPIs from an IT environment in a single view, effectively acting as a comprehensive directory of metrics. This makes searchability and reusability easier, breaking down silos created by various IT tools and serving as a single source of truth for any metric that IT teams need to track.\n\n\n\n\"Traditional IT data analysis is often confined within individual tools. For instance, resolution time of incidents is limited to ITSM while mean time to repair a device is restricted to IT operations management. This inhibits cross-correlation and prevents organizations from obtaining a complete picture of their IT infrastructure. By analyzing all these metrics together in a centralized platform, organizations can unlock significant value,\" said Jayaprakash.\n\n\n\nThe Unified IT Metrics Library democratizes data by making a catalog of KPIs readily available for technicians to conduct their analyses, which can also be consumed by other IT applications for contextual integration. This comprehensive approach enhances governance and ensures that all relevant metrics are easily accessible and managed effectively, driving quick decision-making.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these key features, Analytics Plus version 6.0 includes a range of productive enhancements such as multivariate forecasting, workflow charts, support for distributed processing (on-premises) and more than 10 new integrations with popular IT tools, detailed here.\n\n\n\nAbout Analytics Plus\n\n\n\nAnalytics Plus is an IT analytics and decision intelligence software designed to provide organizations with a unified view of their IT operations, correlate interdependencies, and derive meaningful insights. It breaks down data silos by consolidating both on-premises and cloud infrastructure KPIs. Analytics Plus measures the efficiency of network operations, tracks the responsiveness and availability of business applications, evaluates technician performance, assesses the progress of processes, and flags security anomalies. This comprehensive analysis is achieved by connecting to every single IT software that forms the backbone of an IT infrastructure. These consolidated insights enable organizations to make data-driven decisions that enhance operational efficiency and drive business success.\n\nAbout ManageEngine\n\nManageEngine is a division of Zoho Corporation that offers comprehensive on-premises and cloud-native IT and security operations management solutions for global organizations and managed service providers. Established and emerging enterprises including nine of every 10 Fortune 100 organizations rely on ManageEngine's real-time IT management tools to ensure the optimal performance of their IT infrastructure, including networks, servers, applications, endpoints and more.

        "article_content": "Late last week, cybersecurity company Kaspersky started deleting its anti-malware software from computers located in the United States. As a replacement, the company automatically downloaded antivirus software from UltraAV instead.\n\nIf you use Kaspersky antivirus software, you may know the Russian company was added to the U.S. government\u2019s Entity List and subjected to a ban on sales and updates within the United States earlier this year. As a result, the company told BleepingComputer in July that it had decided to shut down its U.S. operations and lay off its American employees.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThese developments aren\u2019t a secret, but it can\u2019t be said that everyone knew about them, either. As a result, Kaspersky\u2019s sudden and badly explained decision to automatically delete its software came as a surprise to many.\n\nEmails went out at the start of September informing customers that the company had teamed up with UltraAV to provide continued protection for customers even after Kaspersky withdrew from the United States. The emails did not, however, make it clear that this continued protection would be automatically installed on their computers.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t see the email for whatever reason, the transfer came as even more of a shock. Users on Reddit and other forums have been expressing their confusion about the situation along with their distrust of the new UltraAV software. One poster even worried their desktop had been compromised when they woke up to find their Kaspersky antivirus software gone and UltraAV in its place.\n\nThis distrust isn\u2019t surprising since little is known about the company other than its connection to multiple VPN brands such as UltraVPN, Hotspot Shield, and Betternet. According to customer reports online, many people are uninstalling UltraAV because of this \u2014 and because it appeared on their devices in such an unsettling way.\n\nKaspersky has since posted an official statement explaining that it took this action to make sure customers \u201cwould not experience a gap in protection upon Kaspersky\u2019s exit from the market.\u201d The post also went on to say the company had chosen UltraAV because it offered similar features and products to Kaspersky. For instance, people who used Kaspersky\u2019s VPN service also found UltraVPN installed on their devices.\n\nFor a lot of people, the explanation is too little too late and likely won\u2019t stop them from replacing UltraAV with a more well-known antivirus software application."

On the hardware side, the YouTuber installed a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller (specifically, the Seed Studio ESP32-C3), thereby avoiding the need to use the link port to connect to an external connectivity device. They had to tweak the device\u2019s voltage slightly and install a 1K resistor to properly power the microcontroller.\n\nI Made The Ultimate Cheating Device\n\nThe software, on the other hand, is available on Github under the TI-32 repository and acts as \u201ca mod for the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition and TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition calculators to give them internet access and add other features, like test mode breakout and camera support,\u201d according to its description. The modder ran into signal integrity issues during the development process, but was able to mitigate them by building a custom PCB to enable the Wi-Fi microcontroller to impersonate another TI-84 and allow the user to more easily send and share data with their actual TI-84.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIn the video above, ChromaLock shows off some of the device\u2019s capabilities, including a chat function, a monochrome image viewer, and a ChatGPT input window. Essentially, the modification enables users to input complex equations, then have ChatGPT solve them and display the answers on the calculator\u2019s screen.\n\nThe data link appears to be glacially slow and typing long strings of text using a graphing calculator keypad feels like a lot of work, but the device\u2019s capabilities are impressive nonetheless. And ChromaLock is not finished. They plan to add more features in the future, including improvements to the large language model\u2019s functionality, web browsing and email functionality, video playback, and Discord access."
