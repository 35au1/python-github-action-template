            "article_content": "The exceptional drone or UFO sightings over New Jersey have had a high volume and there are officials who confirm various sightings.\n\nLaw Enforcement and Local Officials:\n\nVarious law enforcement agencies, including the Morris County Sheriff\u2019s Office, have reported sightings. Sheriff James Gannon noted that there was no immediate danger to the public but confirmed the presence of drones which have \u201cunnerved\u201d residents. However, there\u2019s no clear video evidence directly from these officials that distinctly shows drones or UFOs not mistaken for planes.\n\nGovernment Officials:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and other state officials have acknowledged the sightings, calling for more transparency and investigation but have not presented clear, video evidence that confirms exceptional drones or UFOs. The state has been actively monitoring the situation, but the focus has been more on the potential risks and the need for legislative action rather than providing definitive evidence.\n\nFBI and DHS:\n\nBoth agencies have been involved in investigating the sightings. They\u2019ve stated that many reported sightings are likely manned aircraft or misidentified objects. There\u2019s no mention of clear, video evidence from these agencies specifically distinguishing exceptional drones or UFOs from regular aircraft. Their focus has been on ensuring there\u2019s no threat to national security or public safety.\n\nPublic and Social Media:\n\nPosts on X have mentioned numerous sightings, including claims of UFO/UAP events in New Jersey with video footage; however, these are not from official sources and should be treated as anecdotal. The validity of these videos as clear evidence of exceptional drones or UFOs is often questioned due to potential misidentification or hoax.\n\nDamage or Effects Caused by These Objects:\n\nNo Significant Damage or Effects:\n\nThere have been no reports of these drones or UFOs causing physical damage or significant effects. The primary impact has been public concern, speculation, and calls for better drone regulation. Authorities have emphasized there\u2019s no known malicious intent or threat from these sightings.\n\nImpact on Public Safety and National Security:\n\nDiscussions around these sightings have led to debates about national security, with some lawmakers suggesting the need for the ability to shoot down unidentified objects, though this has been met with caution due to legal and safety concern.\n\n\"People made fun of me when I posted this originally\"- OP Ryan Ward.

While the popular app already serves its intended purpose, Meta is exploring new ways to modernize it. According to a recent WhatsApp beta build for Android, Meta AI character creation could soon be coming to the mobile app.\n\nPer a WABetaInfo report, Meta is preparing to bring AI character creation to WhatsApp. Version 2.25.1.26 beta for Android reveals how the feature could work if the company proceeds with its plans. Similar to the existing Meta AI Studio tool on Instagram\u2019s website, WhatsApp will seemingly let users build custom AI chatbots by describing their personality, expertise, unique qualities, etc.\n\nTo inspire users creating Meta AI characters, WhatsApp may display trait suggestions when building a chatbot. Based on the included screenshot, there also appears to be a refresh button that will generate new recommendations if users are unhappy with the presented ones.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the AI characters themselves aren\u2019t new; eligible WhatsApp users can already access first- and third-party chatbots in the app. The upcoming addition will only popularize creating them by making the building tools easily accessible.\n\nOtherwise, WABetaInfo highlights that WhatsApp for Android may soon drop the Communities tab in favor of a new one dedicated to AI chats. Those who rely on the Communities feature will still be able to access it through the main Chats tab. It remains unclear when and if Meta will roll out these changes, as they\u2019re still in development.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

            "article_content": "Content provided by British Council\n\nRead the following text, and answer questions 1-9 below\n\n[1] Do you believe in ghosts or paranormal activity? Professor Chris French is keen to know why. His research focus is \u201canomalistic psychology\u201d: bizarre experiences that many people have and why they believe in events that do not have a scientific base.\n\n[2] French, a professor emeritus at Goldsmiths College at the University of London in the United Kingdom, explores examples of \u201csupernatural activity\u201d in his research, and in his book The Science of Weird S**t: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal. He investigates ghost sightings, fortune-tellers, clairvoyants and psychics. Alien abductions are also in his scope. If it is a strange thing, French is interested.\n\n[3] Ghost sightings take up most of his time. There are many reasons people think they have seen one. One is a well-proven phenomenon called sleep paralysis, little known outside scientific circles. It can convince even cynics that they are in the presence of a \u2013 usually malicious \u2013 ghost.\n\n[4] \u201cSleep paralysis is a temporary period of paralysis between sleep and wakefulness,\u201d French said. \u201cIt can come with a range of additional symptoms that can make it absolutely terrifying. These include a strong sense of an evil presence and hallucinations like hearing voices or footsteps and seeing demons. Other symptoms include experiencing difficulty in breathing, feeling pressure on the chest and intense fear.\u201d\n\n[5] People go through several different stages during a regular night\u2019s sleep. One is REM, or rapid eye movement, sleep \u2013 the stage associated with vivid dreams. \u201cThe muscles of the body are actually paralysed during this phase, presumably to stop us from acting out the actions of the dream,\u201d French said.\n\n[6] Sometimes, REM sleep dream imagery gets mixed up with feelings of being awake, and we mistakenly believe we are having a supernatural experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a glitch in the normal sleep cycle. It\u2019s as though the brain wakes up, but the body doesn\u2019t \u2013 and all of that imagery spills over into waking consciousness,\u201d said French. Many artistic representations of ghosts and demons from the past probably stem from sleep paralysis, he added.\n\n[7] How about Ouija boards? This apparent way to communicate with the dead involves asking questions and having a form of marker seemingly move across a board of letters and numbers to spell out answers on its own. \u201cWhen people experience the planchette or an upturned wine glass moving around during a Ouija board session, the illusion that some external force is causing the movement is powerful,\u201d French explained. \u201cIn fact, those taking part are making unconscious muscular movements, known as the ideomotor effect.\u201d\n\n[8] Sometimes, ghost stories are cons to make a dollar. But while scammers do exist, our desire to believe is the bigger culprit. \u201cThe single most powerful cognitive bias that we all suffer from is confirmation bias,\u201d said French. \u201cWe pay more attention to evidence that is consistent with what we already believe or would like to be true. And we either ignore evidence [that does not match what we believe] or make up reasons it can be dismissed.\u201d If you believe in ghosts, it is more likely you will think you see one, he said.\n\nSource: South China Moring Post, December 29\n\nQuestions\n\n1. Which of the following best describes \u201canomalistic psychology\u201d, according to paragraph 1?\n\nA. The study of abnormal human behaviour.\n\nB.

            "article_content": "Quick, what do you think of when you hear the word \u201cThunderbird?\u201d\n\nThe (very snazzy) car? The plane? Or perhaps even the email software?\n\nBut how many of you would conjure up images of a gigantic creature that flaps its wings and unleashes tempests? And how many more of you are privy to rumors of sightings of such a creature coming out of Pennsylvania?\n\nA Kiowa shield cover decorated with a turtle, a Thunderbird, stars and the milky way. Sightings of the Thunderbird have been reported in Pennsylvania as recently as 2021. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)Universal Images Group via Getty\n\nAccording to \u201cEncyclopedia of Beasts and Monsters in Myth, Legend and Folklore (2016),\u201d Thunderbirds are gigantic spirits from Native American lore that take the form of birds. They\u2019re particularly known for controlling the weather.\n\n\u201cBy [the Thunderbird\u2019s] work, the earth was watered and vegetation grew,\u201d reads Encyclopedia Britannica. \u201cLightning was believed to flash from its beak, and the beating of its wings was thought to represent the rolling of thunder.\u201d\n\nTales vary depending on which tribe tells the story, adds \u201cNative American Myths: Stories & Folklore from the Apache to the Zuni (2018)\u201d: Some believe it\u2019s a god. Others describe it as being more human in shape. The Lakota Sioux even had more than one type of Thunderbird.\n\nNow, it could be argued the Thunderbird myth is among those that can be easily explained: North America is full of incredibly large birds that \u2014 back in the day \u2014 could have been mistaken for some godlike creature. California condors \u2014 North America\u2019s largest wild bird \u2014 has a wingspan of 109 inches, or a little over 9 feet, far exceeding the height of your average Joe.\n\nThat would make it unlikely for anyone to believe they saw a Thunderbird in this day and age, right?\n\nWell.\n\nPeople do, in fact, still claim to see Thunderbirds, vast zoological knowledge out there and all. According to a 2018 Juneau Empire report, a woman proclaimed on Facebook how she spotted a \u201cHUGE\u201d bird \u201calmost the size of a small airplane\u201d in Mendenhall Valley, Alaska. Reddit threads detailing accounts from all over the country \u2014 mainly in the West \u2014 eagerly discuss the potential existence of the being.\n\nAnd, of course, there have been plenty of purported sightings in the Keystone State.\n\nKwakiutl dancers in masks and costumes representing (left to right) Wasp, Thunderbird, and Grizzly-bear, arrive in canoes during the winter ceremony. The myth of the Thunderbird differs from tribe to tribe. (Photo by Buyenlarge/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Wilds website, sightings of the Thunderbird have popped up in places such as Pine Creek Valley and the I-80 Frontier over the last 100 years or so: A man in Cameron County claimed to have seen a flock of them in 1892. An early pioneer of Potter County swore he saw the same.\n\nThere\u2019s even a legend known as the \u201cLost Thunderbird Photo,\u201d which is said to be evidence of the creature, although it was supposedly lost in a house fire. Researcher Ivan Sanderson \u2014 who states he was the one to have left the photo with the owner of the house that burnt down \u2014 has dedicated a whole website to this lost photo, as well as other paranormal encounters from Bigfoot to the Jersey Devil.\n\n\u201cThis was like a mammoth hawk, or a mammoth eagle or a mammoth raptor of some kind,\u201d describes one witness to an alleged sighting in 1970. \u201cIt was not a condor. It had no resemblance to any prehistoric animal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was an aberration. There are creatures that, for whatever reason, they grow bigger than the average bear.\u201d\n\nThunderbirds have continued to be spotted in Pennsylvania in recent years: Head over to cryptid and alien tracking sites like the one run by Pennsylvania-based researcher Stan Gordon and you\u2019ll find accounts of run-ins with Thunderbirds that have occurred way passed the 1970s.\n\nA Thunderbird as drawn by a Dakota near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, around 1883. (Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons)Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u201cIn early April of 2021, [a] woman was just pulling into a parking lot for a scheduled appointment at a location in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\u201d one such account reads. \u201cShe was a few minutes early, so she was talking with a friend on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, something flew over her vehicle that shadowed the entire car. Even though she was in her car she ducked her head, thinking it was a small plane about to crash. She commented to her friend about what had just happened. Seconds later, she saw the biggest bird she had ever seen flying in front of her car.\u201d\n\nNow, the biggest question is, if these birds are so big, why aren\u2019t more people seeing them?\n\nWell, if you adopt the same line of thinking that some other paranormal researchers apply to other cryptids such as Bigfoot\u2014 as highlighted in \u201cThe Sasquatch People and Their Interdimensional Connection (2011)\u201d \u2014 the Thunderbird can be viewed as a creature that moves among dimensions. In other words, one minute it\u2019s in our dimension where we can spot it, and then, boom, it zips into the unseeable unknown.\n\nSo, are all these sightings just really, really big birds, or creatures from beyond our realm of understanding? You decide.\n\nAnd next time you\u2019re caught in a storm, be sure to take a closer look at the sky."

            "article_content": "The 2000s brought groundbreaking innovations to horror cinema that continue influencing filmmakers today. From found-footage techniques that changed how we experience fear to intimate character studies that elevated the genre\u2019s storytelling potential, this era delivered unforgettable scares that resonated with audiences worldwide. Furthermore, independent productions proved horror could tackle complex themes while maintaining commercial appeal, while major studios took chances on unique creative voices that would reshape the genre landscape.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nThrough careful character development, innovative directing techniques, and genuine emotional stakes, the best horror films of the 2000s demonstrate how genre pictures can tackle complex themes while still delivering the scares audiences crave. Here\u2019s our picks for the best horror movies of the 2000s.\n\nDrag Me to Hell (2009)\n\nPlay video\n\nSam Raimi\u2019s return to horror follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer cursed to be dragged to hell in three days after denying a mortgage extension to an elderly woman. The film perfectly balances genuine scares with gleefully twisted comedy, powered by Raimi\u2019s masterful direction that transforms this tale of karmic revenge into a rollercoaster ride. Through dynamic camera movements, memorable practical effects, and a deep understanding of how to build tension, Drag Me to Hell creates a uniquely engaging horror experience that demonstrates why Raimi remains one of the genre\u2019s most influential voices.\n\nCloverfield (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nDirector Matt Reeves and producer J.J. Abrams revolutionized the monster movie genre with this found-footage masterpiece that follows a group of friends documenting their desperate attempt to survive a massive creature attack on New York City. By grounding its spectacular destruction through intimate, documentary-style filmmaking, Cloverfield creates an immersive experience that makes its fantastic elements feel terrifyingly real. The film\u2019s focus on ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances and masterful special effects that never break the found-footage illusion create a haunting portrait of survival against impossible odds that still\n\nThe Ring (2002)\n\nPlay video\n\nGore Verbinski\u2019s atmospheric horror masterpiece follows journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates a mysterious videotape that kills viewers seven days after watching it. The film\u2019s strength lies in its ability to create overwhelming dread through subtle visual cues and psychological manipulation rather than relying on jump scares. Through its exploration of urban legends and technology-based fears, alongside Watts\u2019 compelling performance as a mother fighting to save her son, The Ring crafts a profoundly unsettling story that transforms mundane objects like televisions and telephones into sources of terror. Plus, The Ring is one of the best horror remakes, capable of standing on its own legs while showing respect for the original Japanese flick.\n\nMartyrs (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nPascal Laugier\u2019s uncompromising film follows Lucie (Myl\u00e8ne Jampano\u00ef), who escapes from brutal captivity as a child only to be haunted by visions of her tormentors years later. When she finally tracks down those responsible, her closest friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui) becomes entangled in a secret society\u2019s disturbing quest for spiritual enlightenment through suffering. Through its unflinching portrayal of trauma and sophisticated exploration of martyrdom, Martyrs transcends typical revenge narratives to deliver a philosophically rich horror experience that challenges viewers to keep their eyes open while maintaining powerful emotional resonance.\n\nThe Others (2001)\n\nPlay video\n\nAlejandro Amen\u00e1bar\u2019s gothic experience stars Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart, a devoutly religious mother struggling to protect her photosensitive children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) in a fog-shrouded Victorian mansion. When three mysterious servants arrive, led by the enigmatic Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a series of inexplicable events forces Grace to question everything she believes about life, death, and reality itself. Through its masterful use of atmosphere and psychological manipulation, The Others transforms familiar haunted house tropes into a profound exploration of grief, faith, and maternal devotion. The film\u2019s true genius lies in how it uses its period setting and gothic elements to craft the ultimate ghost story.\n\nShaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nPlay video\n\nEdgar Wright\u2019s brilliant horror-comedy follows Shaun (Simon Pegg), a directionless electronics salesman stuck in a dead-end job and a failing relationship with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). When London falls to a zombie outbreak, Shaun must finally step up, joining forces with his slacker best friend Ed (Nick Frost) to rescue his mother (Penelope Wilton) and win back Liz. Wright\u2019s signature rapid-fire visual style and razor-sharp script, co-written with Pegg, elevate this beyond simple parody. Instead, the zombie apocalypse becomes a perfect backdrop for exploring very human themes about growing up, accepting responsibility, and maintaining relationships.\n\nLet the Right One In (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nTomas Alfredson\u2019s Swedish masterpiece introduces us to Oskar (K\u00e5re Hedebrant), a bullied 12-year-old boy who forms a profound connection with Eli (Lina Leandersson), a mysterious girl who only appears at night in their snow-covered Stockholm suburb. As their relationship deepens, Oskar\u2019s discovery of Eli\u2019s vampire nature transforms this intimate character study into something far more complex. Against a stark winter landscape, Alfredson crafts a tender coming-of-age story that reimagines vampire mythology through the lens of childhood loneliness.\n\nParanormal Activity (2007)\n\nPlay video\n\nDirected by Oren Peli, this found-footage phenomenon centers on Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat), a young couple whose attempt to document strange occurrences in their suburban San Diego home spirals into a nightmare. As Micah\u2019s obsession with capturing evidence intensifies, the supernatural presence grows more aggressive, revealing a sinister decades-old connection to Katie. Armed with nothing but security cameras and practical effects, Peli manipulates negative space and sound design to create overwhelming dread. Yet beneath the supernatural scares lies an equally disturbing portrait of a relationship crumbling under the weight of fear, making its explosive climax all the more devastating.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nPlay video\n\nDanny Boyle reimagines zombie cinema by opening with Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakening from a coma to discover London abandoned. Alongside fellow survivors Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley), he uncovers the horrifying reality: a \u201crage\u201d virus has transformed most of the population into rabid killing machines. Shot on early digital video cameras that lend a raw documentary feel, Boyle\u2019s apocalyptic vision stands apart in its exploration of human nature. The real horror emerges not from the infected masses but from the survivors themselves, as the distinction between civilization and savagery blurs in the fight for survival. The movie also redefined the zombie mythology by turning the undead into agile killing machines instead of their classic slow interpretation.\n\nThe Descent (2005)\n\nPlay video\n\nNeil Marshall\u2019s horror movie is one of the best 2000s horror movies, and there are no questions about it. The Descent follows Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who joins five friends for a spelunking expedition one year after losing her husband and daughter. Under the leadership of the ambitious Juno (Natalie Mendoza), what begins as adventure becomes a desperate fight for survival when the group finds itself trapped in an unmapped cave system. Marshall builds unbearable tension long before revealing the ancient predators lurking in the darkness, as the cave\u2019s suffocating environment brings long-buried resentments and betrayals to the surface. This sophisticated approach to horror transforms a monster movie into a multifaceted study of trauma and survival, with an all-female cast facing both physical and psychological terrors that will haunt viewers long after the credits roll."

            "article_content": "Even for an industry that depends on relentless innovation to thrive, life sciences have seen remarkable advancements in recent decades. From the Human Genome Project paving the way for precision medicine, to monoclonal antibodies, mRNA, CRISPR gene editing, and other major breakthroughs \u2013 our industry continuously proves its ability to serve humanity by consistently one-upping itself.\n\nAnd yet, data science is now poised to usher in a level and acceleration of progress that even life sciences have never before seen.\n\nWhy AI Is now hitting its full stride\n\nAlthough data science and AI have been applied in life sciences for decades, their application has often fallen short of expectations, yielding incremental, rather than transformative, gains. But today\u2019s advances in algorithm sophistication, large-scale data integration, and cloud computing have helped them overcome the fragmented data, slower processing, and other limitations that have been stunting their full power. Regulatory agencies, meanwhile, are providing clearer guidance on the use of models, giving organisations the guardrails needed to innovate faster, with confidence.\n\nTogether, these developments, combined with the global urgency to address humanity\u2019s most pressing health challenges, create a perfect storm for data science and AI to take life sciences to new heights.\n\nWhat makes AI so transformative\n\nWith its ability to process massive and complex datasets, identify hidden patterns, and continuously evolve as it learns from new data, AI brings a depth of understanding and speed of decision-making and discovery that takes it to a level far beyond human capabilities. With predictive modelling, AI doesn\u2019t just analyse existing data it anticipates future outcomes. This allows researchers to solve problems at scale with unprecedented precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the time and cost of bringing new therapies to market.\n\nAI is at a critical juncture, and 2025 promises to be a transformative year. Here\u2019s how I believe models will reshape life sciences in the year ahead:\n\nAI graduates from trials to tangible real-world solutions\n\nThe integration of data science in drug discovery is evolving beyond mere trial phases to practical uses \u2013 especially in the creation and testing of molecular compounds in silico. With algorithms getting better at simulating biological interaction, we can significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery. Not only will this improve initial testing efficiency, it will open doors to novel therapies that revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry and, more importantly, profoundly impact world health.\n\nData science will take diagnostic accuracy to new heights\n\nMachine learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency over the past year in detecting irregularities in medical images, often exceeding the level of accuracy seasoned professionals can provide. In the year 2025, AI-powered imaging tools will greatly enhance diagnostic precision in radiology and pathology, enabling healthcare providers to deliver more precise determinations. Machine learning-assisted medical imaging of tumours, for instance, will dramatically improve their pairing with the right targeted treatments. Such advancements will play a crucial role in allowing patients to live longer and higher quality lives.\n\nLLMs will transform documentation\n\nFrom scientific manuscripts to clinical trial records and regulatory filings, large language models (LLM) will revolutionise documentation. LLMs are already proving effective in managing specialised medical language, compliance checks, and simplifying complex terms, with providers like IBM and Microsoft integrating them into healthcare documentation. Organisations are also increasingly turning to automation for authorship of Clinical Study Reports using data from clinical systems and statistical computing environments to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. This change will speed up the process of finding new cures and lead to better results for patients, while also boosting the pace and accuracy of advancements.\n\nData science will accelerate clinical trial recruiting\n\nOver the next 12 months, AI will streamline the recruitment process for trials by utilising electronic health records and real-time patient data. This will enable more precise and faster identification of suitable candidates for more successful trials. We are already seeing signs of this transformation with AI-powered platforms significantly reducing recruitment timelines by more accurately matching patients to trial criteria. Such improvements will enhance trial effectiveness and accelerate the pace of medical innovation.\n\nAI compliance platforms will see wide adoption\n\n2025 will see the rise of AI-powered compliance platforms that provide for the real-time monitoring of regulatory adherence across clinical trials, drug manufacturing, and elsewhere. As regulatory requirements grow increasingly complex, such AI solutions will be extremely helpful in managing compliance data in real-time, allowing organisations to maintain operational integrity.\n\n2025 will mark a turning point for data science and AI in life sciences, redefining what\u2019s achievable across the industry. From revolutionising drug discovery and diagnostics to streamlining documentation and compliance, models are accelerating the pace of innovation and enabling breakthroughs that were once unimaginable.\n\nWhile the opportunities are immense, challenges remain. Ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks will require careful attention to ensure AI\u2019s potential is realised responsibly. But data science will undoubtedly prove itself as a transformative force reshaping the way we develop therapies, conduct trials, and deliver care. As the industry continues to embrace these capabilities, 2025 is destined to be the year where life sciences once again pushes the boundaries of innovation \u2013 enhancing lives and advancing healthcare on a global scale."

            "article_content": "OpenAI wants you to think of AI like a car. Europe invented the car, but heavy regulations prevented its widespread adoption there. In laissez-faire America, the car dominated the culture. OpenAI wants the U.S. to do that again. On Monday the company behind ChatGPT published AI in America: OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint, a whitepaper that calls on Washington to let AI determine the country\u2019s future.\n\nAI in America is a slight 15-page document with an AI-generated photo on its cover that shows an architect\u2019s desk overlooking a futuristic cityscape. The picture and 15 pages seem fine at first glance. But like so much of the stuff attached to AI, both the image and the outline for economic prosperity seem vague and grotesque the more you inspect them. The picture\u2019s coffee cup has no handle. The words written on the pages of the picture look like unreadable smudges. The economic blueprint contains calls to action that ask the government to turn over public secrets to large private companies.\n\nThe more you look, the more things fall apart. OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint is a call for a lightly regulated AI future where government-collected data, both state secrets and public information, is fed into its vast and hungry machines.\n\nThe first thing OpenAI wants you to know is that AI is very important and very scary. \u201cAI is too powerful to be led and shaped by autocrats, but that is the growing risk we face, while the economic opportunity AI presents is too compelling to forfeit,\u201d reads an opening note from OpenAI vice president of global affairs Chris Lehane. \u201cShared prosperity is as near and measurable as the new jobs and growth\u2060(opens in a new window) that will come from building more AI infrastructure like data centers, chip manufacturing facilities, and power plants.\u201d\n\nAnd how should America accomplish such ambitious goals? By sharing as many of its secrets as possible with AI companies. \u201cAs appropriate, share national security-related information and resources that it alone maintains\u2014such as briefings on security threats to the industry and high-level results of testing US and non-US AI models\u2014with US AI companies pursuing advanced research,\u201d the economic blueprints says.\n\nIt goes further. OpenAI always wants the feds to share their \u201cunique expertise with AI companies, including information about how to secure their IP against industrial security threats and mitigate potential cyber, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear CBRN and other risks that are heightened by increasingly powerful models.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s all that wonderful data just sitting around waiting to be scanned. \u201cA lot of government data is in the public domain. Making it more accessible or machine-readable could help US AI developers of all sizes, especially those working in fields where vital data is disproportionately government-held,\u201d the blueprint says. \u201cIn exchange, developers using this data could work with government to unlock new insights that help it develop better public policies.\u201d\n\nThe economic blueprint also notes that \u201cinfrastructure is destiny\u201d and that the U.S. is in a unique position to create jobs and get ahead of China. All it has to do is focus on building infrastructure for AI systems, if not people. \u201cIn the AI era, chips, data, energy and talent are the resources that will underpin continued US leadership, and as with the mass production of the automobile, marshalling these resources will create widespread economic opportunity and reinforce our global competitiveness,\u201d it says.\n\nWhat does that mean? \u201cSeizing the moment and building the infrastructure needed to produce enough energy and chips to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant,\u201d it says. \u201cIn turn, this will create tens of thousands of skilled-trade jobs, boost local economies through spending and indirect job creation, and modernize our energy grid in the near term\u2014 ultimately supporting the kind of breakthroughs and innovations that drive lasting economic growth.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019ll work, provided AI ends up being as important to the long-term future of the world as OpenAI and all the other AI companies would have you believe.\n\nOpenAI published its economic blueprint for America the morning the Biden White House announced sweeping new regulations of the industry. Biden\u2019s new regulations will create a tiered list of countries that AI companies do business with. On tier one is the U.S. and 18 of its allies. Those countries are free of restrictions. China and Russia are on tier three and no AI companies can do business with them. The rest of the world is in tier 2. They can have a little AI, as a treat. But the White House will set caps.\n\n\u201cIn its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America\u2019s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,\u201d NVIDIA said in a blog post about the new regulations. \u201cThis sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America\u2019s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.\u201d\n\nThese seem to be the kinds of burdensome regulations that OpenAI railed against in its economic blueprint. But it\u2019s also mostly focused on countries other than the U.S. Altman and OpenAI have long attempted to thread the needle of calling AI a revolutionary technology that needed to be unleashed while also claiming it\u2019s dangerous and in need of serious regulation.\n\nBut the regulation-friendly Democrats are no longer in power. Everything could change in a week. Elon Musk is no fan of Altman and OpenAI and, for now, he\u2019s close to the incoming president. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how OpenAI\u2019s calls for loose government regulation and widespread access to federal data are met by the new President and his Musk-backed administration."

These job postings include an EE Sensing Engineer, Robotics Mechanical Design Engineer, and TPM Manager.\n\nClicking links to the roles yields a description of a Robotics team that is \"focused on unlocking general-purpose robotics and pushing towards AGI-level intelligence in dynamic, real-world setting.\" The description also describes the team's aim to bring robotic systems from prototype to full-scale production.\n\nMany users are expressing unease about OpenAI delving into the robotics space. However, when one user commented, \"The thought of OpenAI with hardware\ud83d\ude2c\", Kalinowski attempted to diffuse concerns, citing the benefits instead.\n\n\"Yeah, I cannot wait!\" replied Kalinowski. \"Imagine being able to send a robot to do a job that's really dangerous for a human.\"\n\nUntil now, OpenAI has developed its AI models to streamline workflows, with the next logical step being integration into physical devices to enhance user assistance. However, following examples like Elon Musk's Tesla, which announced the Optimus humanoid robot in 2021 but has yet to release it, a market-ready robot may still be years away.\n\nRobotics can also mean things outside of humanoid robots, including less flashy robots -- such as robot vacuums -- that help accomplish everyday functions. Moreover, when asked in the comments if the focus would be humanoid robots, Kalinowski said that is yet to be determined, with the initial team defining and building the roadmap."

            "article_content": "Microsoft has announced that neural rendering capabilities are coming to DirectX soon. Cooperative vector support, as it\u2019s called, will lead to \u201ccross-platform enablement of neural rendering techniques,\u201d according to Microsoft, and it will usher in \u201ca new paradigm in 3D graphics programming.\u201d\n\nIt sounds buzzy, but that\u2019s not without reason. This past week, Nvidia announced its new range of RTX 50-series graphics cards, and along with them, it revealed a slate of neural rendering features. Neural shaders, as Nvidia calls them, allow developers to execute small neural networks from shader code, running them on the dedicated AI hardware available on Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm GPUs. Microsoft is saying that it will enable these features on all GPUs, not just those sold by Nvidia, through the DirectX API.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMicrosoft is doing so through cooperative vector support, which it says \u201cdirectly improves the performance of neural rendering techniques.\u201d It enables matrix multiplication to be run directly from shader code \u2014 the programs that your GPU executes \u2014 allowing neural networks to function regardless of your GPU brand. At this point, all major GPU brands have dedicated AI hardware available, and cooperative vectors will allow developers to tap into that hardware through shader code.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nCross-vendor support for neural shaders is a big deal. In generations past, Nvidia maintained a closed system of middleware dubbed GameWorks that would only work on Nvidia graphics cards. The suite included features like PhysX in games like Batman: Arkham City and Mirror\u2019s Edge, as well as HairWorks in games like The Witcher 3 and Final Fantasy XV.\n\nWith broad neural rendering support through DirectX, it will hopefully encourage developers to include neural shaders without fear of locking out certain players. Nvidia has already demonstrated the capabilities of neural rendering with features such as the Neural Radiance Cache, which uses a neural network to infer light bounces in a path-traced scene, enhancing both the visual quality and performance of games that feature path tracing.\n\nAlthough the DirectX announcement is recent, we won\u2019t see neural rendering features in games for quite some time. Nvidia and Microsoft are just now laying the foundation for these new rendering techniques, so it could be several years before we see a game running small neural networks through shader code. The potential applications are vast, though, and these techniques could bring about a new wave of rendering capabilities now that they\u2019ll be supported on GPUs from all vendors."

Discovery editorial team, will explain in simple terms how radiation can safely be used to solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing global challenges. These include:\n\nMicroplastics in the ocean (filmed in Monaco/Global)\n\nThe growing cancer burden (filmed in India)\n\nFood insecurity (filmed in Austria/Global)\n\nWater scarcity in the face of climate change (filmed in Austria/Costa Rica)\n\nIndustrial contamination (filmed in Czech Republic)\n\nEach of these films is around one minute long and will play as part of Discovery\u2019s \u2018Good To Know\u2019, a new educational videos series about the benefits of nuclear science and technology, both on television and online.\n\nFuture films to be included in the series will continue to investigate how nuclear science can help development, particularly in the light of climate change, such as by measuring how coastal regions sequester carbon, or how the oceans are becoming more acidic, or how pest insects can be controlled without chemicals. The films will also highlight more details on key IAEA programmes to battle plastic pollution, drought and hunger.\n\nThe films are made in conjunction with the IAEA's twelve nuclear sciences and applications laboratories, a unique feature in the United Nations. The laboratories develop and share nuclear techniques with countries around the world. Watch a three-minute film about the labs here.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \u201cPeople may know us as the nuclear watchdog, helping enhance safety, security and safeguards in places like Fukushima, Iran, Ukraine. But not enough people know of the amazing potential nuclear science has to make tangible differences in people\u2019s lives \u2013 helping farmers grow better crops, cancer patients get better treatment, governments understand and protect key natural areas. As the terrible effects of climate change become more obvious to people around the world, it is important for the public to also know there is hope. Science, as always, offers solutions to many of our main challenges.\u201d\n\nNajat Mokhtar, Head of IAEA Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, agreed: \u201cI am delighted to see ours labs' the vital research being shared on the respected Discovery Channel. Science is a vital force for good in the world, and nuclear science offers so many incredible innovations to help countries meet their development goals.\u201d\n\nJamie Cooke, Executive Vice President and Managing Director Central Europe, Middle East and Turkey said: \u201cWe are thrilled that our viewers will now get the opportunity to learn more about how nuclear science is being used in innovative ways to improve our lives and advance the environmental sustainability agenda. We consider it our duty to leverage the voice, storytelling strength and expertise we have, to cast light and tell the right stories that will positively impact our communities and viewers. It\u2019s part of our Social Good Strategy, and we want to use our media for good.\u201d\n\nAbout the International Atomic Energy Agency\n\nWidely known as the world\u2019s \u201cAtoms for Peace and Development\u201d organization within the United Nations family, the IAEA is the international centre for cooperation in the nuclear field. The Agency works with its Member States and multiple partners worldwide to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies.

If you are overwhelmed or stuck, go to a lower gear.\u201d That\u2019s the secret. It\u2019s always personal to the developer in question and requires a level of self-awareness, but that\u2019s the key. As Shubham says, \u201cAI-assisted coding is all about grokking when you need to gain more granular control and when you need to let go of control to move faster,\u201d recognizing that \u201chigher-level gears leave more room for errors and trust issues.\u201d\n\nMore senior engineers seem to understand this, entrusting AI tools cautiously (i.e., using them to get more done while in \u201clower gears\u201d like auto-complete). The problem is that junior engineers and non-engineers trust AI tools way more than they should. To some extent, we can blame years of marketing by low-code and no-code platforms that promise to turn everyone into a developer without any (or much) software knowledge. This has always been a false hope.\n\nHere\u2019s the solution: If you want to use AI coding assistants, don\u2019t use them as an excuse not to learn to code. The robots aren\u2019t going to do it for you. The engineers who will get the most out of AI assistants are those who know software best. They\u2019ll know when to give control to the coding assistant and how to constrain that assistance (perhaps to narrow the scope of the problem they allow it to work on). Less-experienced engineers run the risk of moving fast but then getting stuck or not recognizing the bugs that the AI has created."

Now it often provides higher quality, stronger security, better privacy, unparalleled extensibility, and access to innovation compared to proprietary rivals. It is no coincidence that 96% of all software today relies on open source, and large enterprises are increasingly inclined to invest in OSS-based solutions to capitalize on these advantages.\n\nFor venture investors like myself, this shift in market preferences represents a significant opportunity to fund the next generation of OSS-based category leaders in enterprise software. And a few notable trends will likely shape how this market area will likely evolve in 2025 and beyond.\n\nRise of open source AI\n\nThe rapid development of foundational large language models, related AI infrastructure, and their applications has ignited debates around the crucial AI challenges. Many of these issues \u2014 such as transparency, adaptability, and security \u2014 can be addressed through openness. After the initial wave led by closed-source pioneers like OpenAI and Anthropic, a new cohort of open source AI models, including Meta\u2019s Llama and Mistral AI, is now raising the tide and boosting the global AI ecosystem."

            "article_content": "Investing.com -- OpenAI's leading executives have announced plans to host events in Washington DC and two key swing states, aiming to strengthen support for investments in artificial intelligence (AI). This move comes as the company adapts to significant shifts in the US political landscape since the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nLater this month, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, along with other top personnel, will convene a meeting with policymakers in Washington. The purpose of this gathering is to discuss a new \"economic blueprint\" for AI, according to the company. The policy proposals, which were made public on Monday, urge the public and private sectors to collaborate in areas such as energy and infrastructure. This is part of a strategy to maintain the US's lead over China in AI, a pitch that is likely to resonate with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, also intends to host events in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama in the upcoming months. The company will announce new AI projects in each of these states, as stated by OpenAI's Vice President of Global Affairs, Chris Lehane, in an interview with Bloomberg News. These announcements are being framed as part of a fresh \"Innovating for America\" initiative that aims to stimulate economic activity around AI across the country.\n\nOver the last year, OpenAI and Altman have been urging the Biden administration to facilitate the construction of more data centers and the development of energy resources required for AI. Currently, OpenAI and other AI firms are adapting to the uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's AI strategy.\n\nThe President-elect, Donald Trump, is anticipated to revoke crucial elements of the Biden administration's AI agenda, including a 2023 executive order on artificial intelligence. Elon Musk, a supporter of Trump, has recently gained more influence in Washington. This has raised concerns that Musk might advocate for policies that benefit his own companies, including startup xAI, which is a competitor to OpenAI.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Seven years later, our attitude toward such driver assists is a little more sober. Drivers are often more confident about such systems than they ought to be, and that's when they even care about such features in the first place.\n\nThat said, Super Cruise remains one of the better implementations of what the industry has inelegantly labeled \"level 2+\" driver assists: in plain English, a system that lets the driver go hands-free for long stretches, as long as they're paying attention to the road. Which, in Super Cruise's case, is achieved via an infrared camera that faces the driver and follows their gaze, even if they're wearing sunglasses.\n\nBetter yet, it's also tightly geofenced, as it's only meant to be used on restricted access, divided-lane highways.\n\nEven with this rather rigid \"operational device domain,\" Super Cruise still has to be able to cope with a wide range of driving conditions\u2014from the depths of a northern winter to the heat of a southwestern summer\u2014as well as different vehicle configurations.\n\n\"Since day one, we designed the Super Cruise steering control with multiple objectives\u2014mainly to be precise, comfortable, and confidence-inspiring,\" said Reza Zarringhalam, a staff software developer at General Motors. \"We... wanted to make sure that the drivers feel comfortable when the system is doing the driving task for them,\" he said.\n\nThat means the lane centering can't have the driver thinking they're too close to, say, a semi the next lane over. The automated lane changes\u2014now initiated either by the driver using a turn signal or if the car itself determines there's less traffic\u2014need to be smooth. And importantly, it should be easy for the human in the driver's seat to take back control of the steering without having to fight or battle a machine."

Facing the prospect of an unpredictable new U.S. president \u2014 who has vowed to end the war swiftly, without clarifying the terms \u2014 Ukraine hopes to use Russian territory as a bargaining chip.\n\nRussia, relying on North Korean reinforcements, hopes to knock that territory out of Ukraine\u2019s grasp."

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) slid as most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech megacaps lost ground in the market turmoil.\n\nBut the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.7%.\n\nStocks were navigating another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading near 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure.\n\nAs of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025.\n\nThat has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target.\n\nAdding to the gloom, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82.\n\nElsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged nearly 20% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines.\n\nLIVE\n\n14 updates"

            "article_content": "Most computer standards change quickly, with manufacturers adopting new ports, cables, and form factors as soon as they release. Random-access memory (RAM), meanwhile, hasn\u2019t changed all that much in the last decade. So what is the difference between the different types of modern RAM?\n\nSince its introduction in 2014, DDR4 has been the de facto standard for desktop computers, and DDR5 has taken over only in the last few processor generations. Along with a slightly updated form factor, DDR5 raises the total possible capacity and top speed of your memory, adds in some new functionality for overclockers, and reduces its overall power usage.\n\nCapacity and Form Factor\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. 8GB Double-Data-Rate (DDR) 4 memory modules are arranged for a photograph in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, July 9, 2019. Resurgent tensions between Japan and South Korea threaten to wallop chipmakers from Samsung Electronics Co. to SK Hynix Inc., upsetting a carefully choreographed global supply chain by smothering the production of memory chips and other components vital to widely used devices. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images Photograph: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll likely notice when shopping for DDR5 memory, at least for consumer options, are higher base capacities. While 16 GB DDR4 kits are commonplace, most DDR5 kits start at 32 GB, typically in a 2 x 16 GB setup. We already recommended 32 GB for new systems, so this is a welcome change to the baseline that should result in fewer unhappy users.\n\nDDR4 and DDR5 are not compatible with each other, despite how similar they look. Memory manufacturers will still stock both varieties for a bit, and they have similar product names, so always double-check you\u2019ve got the right type for your motherboard. All AMD AM5 motherboards use DDR5, while Intel\u2019s 12th generation supports both.\n\nThe two are physically almost identical, and the only visual indicator on most sticks of RAM will be the notch in the pins at the bottom. On DDR5 this notch will be directly in the center, while it\u2019s slightly offset on DDR4. The shifted notch should prevent you from installing the wrong type of memory when building a new computer, but only if you line it up first and see that it doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nFaster Speeds\n\nWhile the sticks may look the same, there are way more horses under the hood. The standard for DDR4 chips technically maxed out at 3,200 MHz, which is the new starting point for DDR5. We\u2019ve only seen a few examples of the top end, but DDR5 supports speeds all the way up to teetering on 8,000 MHz. Don\u2019t expect to put memory like that in your gaming rig any time soon though; most consumer DDR5 RAM tops out around 6,400 MHz."

            "article_content": "The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard is partnering with Manifold to bring a unique life science research and development platform to investigators around the world.\n\nHealthcare data have become increasingly available in larger quantities and are stored across a multitude of cloud service providers. The Broad Institute will begin to use Manifold\u2019s AI platform to address this problem through Manifold\u2019s cloud agnostic architecture. Together, Manifold and Broad will adapt the existing platform to advance genomic research inside and outside of the institute.\n\nThe Broad Institute is a pioneering research lab that began when Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers came together in 2004 with the goal of advancing genomic research through collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe recognized that there were certain types of research projects that were going to be really important to catalyze advances in biomedical research across the entire ecosystem, and yet it would be difficult to accomplish them in a typical academic lab,\u201d Todd Golub, director of the Broad Institute, said in an interview.\n\nManifold was founded by Vinay Seth Mohta, now CEO, in 2016 as a consulting company for using AI in healthcare research. In 2021, Manifold began building its R&D platform to bring no-code software to research institutions.\n\n\u201cWe started in cancer research with a focus there, because we saw that cancer consistently pushed science and technology the hardest, and also, as a result, pushed data the hardest, and where we were seeing a lot of pain,\u201d Mohta said.\n\nManifold has deployed its research and development platform with the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cWith the Broad Institute, we're really excited about some of the novel genomics-related capabilities that will bring, based on learning about their use cases, which, by the way, are going to be the use cases everybody's going to have in about three years,\u201d Mohta said. \u201cBecause that's what the Broad does. They're leading the world in science.\u201d\n\nThe lessons from the Broad over its two-decade history will be incorporated into the Manifold platform. One of the key turning points from the Broad's existing software is that researchers will be able to use it without having to know how to code. The organization specifically has plans to do so with its bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nMohta said they plan to add new capabilities every quarter to allow more researchers to come onto the platform, along with collaborations the Broad Institute itself has with other institutions, like companies or other research institutions.\n\n\u201cWith a more modern technical architecture, it really opens up the ability to enable AI more natively, which will again, fuel the future of discovery when we think about what we can do with the data,\u201d Heather Jankins, co-lead of the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute, said.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting feature of the new platform, Golub said, is its \u201cbring your own cloud\u201d capability.\n\nAccording to Manifold, \"bring your own cloud\" means that users of the platform can seamlessly use their existing cloud service provider to power the Manifold research platform.\n\n\u201cScience happens on all clouds, and so we want to make sure that we're enabling science to the maximum,\u201d Jankins said. \u201cFrom that perspective, having a platform that has natively made some cloud agnostic choices is very exciting for us to make sure that we can really leverage using the data, where the data lives.\u201d\n\nResearch institutions use all manner of different cloud providers such as Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. Without the \"bring your own cloud\" capability, researchers may have to consider migrating their data to another cloud to be compatible with a certain research platform or opt out of using it.\n\n\u201cYou have this convergence of two things happening right now, which is an explosion of the amount of data that's possible to generate, and the power of AI making it possible for everybody to ask complex questions of large data sets, regardless of where they're generated,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThat's a very different world than the way research used to work, which is that you do experiments in your own lab and you analyze those results.\u201d\n\nGolub continued: \u201cThis is still very early days of data generation, data aggregation, data and complex data analysis. And so we need to think about the future of this activity and what's going to be needed for the next phase, given that continued explosion of data and need, and that was a motivation for the Broad-Manifold collaboration.\u201d\n\nAlso important to the Broad Institute was Manifold\u2019s ability to create a trusted research environment where access to patient\u2019s genomic data is only allowed by authorized users for a finite period of time.\n\nOne of Manifold\u2019s current customers is the ACS, which has several ongoing cancer studies with 1.5 million participants. With Manifold, the ACS is allowing outside research institutions to use its data while ensuring the data is safely accessed.\n\n\u201cThe point of this exercise is to accelerate the pace at which the world can make important discoveries that will help patients, and without a really scalable, durable, powerful data platform, that's not going to go as quickly as possible, and so we're excited to make that possible,\u201d Golub said."

            "article_content": "The producers of The Curious Case of Natalia Grace have six other bizarre and disturbing stories lined up for Investigation Discovery, and the docuseries The Curious Case Of\u2026 will delve into each one, starting on Monday (January 13) night at 10/9c.\n\nThese are \u201csome of the most shocking true crime cases and unbelievable scandals,\u201d according to the network, which adds that The Curious Case Of\u2026 will \u201cgo inside these real-life cases exposing bizarre secrets, shattered lives, and twisted motives.\u201d\n\nGuiding us through the sordid sagas is Beth Karas, the former New York City assistant district attorney who served as a legal analyst in the Natalia Grace series. \u201cLed by Karas, with her extensive legal expertise and insight, each gripping story will uncover deceit, greed, and manipulation and offer key access to shocking, firsthand accounts \u2014 proving the truth is much more chilling than fiction,\u201d ID says.\n\nHere\u2019s what we already know about the cases covered by all six episodes\u2026\n\n\u201cBam Margera\u201d (January 13)\n\nThe series premiere details the sobriety journey of Jackass star Bam Margera amid a conflict between BJ Courville, a lawyer and YouTuber interested in Margera\u2019s case, and Lima Jevremovic, a tech entrepreneur who became Margera\u2019s legal guardian.\n\nA New Jersey Law Journal article from 2022 provides more context, reporting that Courville had been sued for allegedly using YouTube to disparage Jevremovic\u2019s guardianship of Margera. The suit claims Courville accused Jevremovic of using the guardianship to co-opt Margera\u2019s assets. Online legal records, however, indicate the suit has been dismissed.\n\n\u201cThe Girl Who Died Twice\u201d (January 20)\n\nThis episode revisits the case of Mary Day, previously chronicled on CBS News\u2019 48 Hours. Day, who allegedly grew up with an abusive stepfather, disappeared from her home in Seaside, California, in 1981, at age 13. In 2002, police in Phoenix, Arizona, found a woman they said was Mary Day during a routine traffic stop.\n\nThe DNA was a match, but her biological sisters had doubts that this \u201cPhoenix Mary\u201d was actually their sibling. Plus, a police team using cadaver dogs found a young girl\u2019s shoe buried in the family\u2019s former backyard, and retired homicide detective Mark Clark couldn\u2019t shake his hunch that Phoenix Mary, who died in 2017, was an impostor, per 48 Hours.\n\n\u201cThe Orphan Impostor\u201d (February 3)\n\nA man named Nicholas Rossi faked his own death in 2020 and traveled to Scotland to escape rape charges in Utah\u2019s Salt Lake County and Utah County. But he was busted at the Glasgow hospital where he was receiving treatment for COVID-19 after employees recognized his tattoos from Interpol images, according to BBC Scotland News. Rossi then claimed that he was actually an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight, that he had never been to the United States, and that he\u2019d been framed by someone who gave him the tattoos while he was unconscious in the hospital.\n\nRossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was extradited to the United States in January 2024, and he\u2019s scheduled to face trials for the Salt Lake County and Utah County cases this year, according to KTVX.\n\n\u201cThe Funeral Home of Horrors\u201d (February 10)\n\nThe next episode details the case of Jon and Carie Hallford, the co-owners of Return to Nature Funeral Home in Penrose, Colorado. The Hallfords pleaded guilty to corpse abuse charges in November 2024 after prosecutors alleged they stored bodies in a building without electricity and gave customers dry concrete instead of cremated remains, as CBS Colorado reports.\n\nAfter the Fremont County Sheriff\u2019s Office fielded reports from neighbors who had noticed a foul smell, investigators found 190 improperly stored bodies in the building. Court documents alleged that the Hallfords used customers\u2019 payments and government loans to pay for luxury items, cosmetic procedures, and vacations.\n\n\u201cThe Doomsday Cat Cult\u201d (February 17)\n\nEx-followers of the purported prophet Sheryl Ruthven claim that her organization \u2014 which operated a nonprofit cat shelter operation called Eva\u2019s Eden in Washington and then Tennessee \u2014 was an abusive cult and that Ruthven professed to be a reincarnated Mary Magdalene who would create a new Eden after an upcoming apocalypse, as Nashville Scene reported in 2016. (Eva\u2019s Eden denied the claims at the time.)\n\nCaring for cats, sometimes by the dozen, was a requirement in Ruthven\u2019s organization, since Ruthven told followers that cats carried the 144,000 souls mentioned in the bible\u2019s Book of Revelation and that those souls would rescue Ruthven\u2019s faithful in the post-apocalypse world.\n\n\u201cJodi Hildebrandt\u201d (February 24)\n\n\u201cTherapist Jodi Hildebrandt\u2019s crusade against masturbation drives a wedge between couples in crisis,\u201d Investigation Discovery says in a synopsis of the Curious Case Of\u2026 season finale. \u201cShe forms a dark alliance with Mormon mommy vlogger Ruby Franke, but a horrifying 911 call exposes the depths of their bizarre beliefs.\u201d\n\nWhen Franke was charged with four felony counts of child abuse and was sentenced to one to 15 years of prison time for each count, Hildebrand received the same charges and sentence, according to USA Today. Hildebrand, Franke\u2019s business partner, is the former clinical mental health counselor behind a counseling business called ConneXions Classroom, which has spurred cult allegations for its extreme parenting methods, the newspaper adds.\n\nThe Curious Case Of\u2026, Series Premiere, Monday, January 13, at 10/9c, Investigation Discovery"

Although he denied throwing anything, suspicion was raised.\n\nA shocking confrontation leads to discovery\n\nMinutes later, two bikemen arrived, having noticed the man and blood dripping from his bag. They questioned him, but he insisted on getting off near the church.\n\nTogether with the two brothers, they confronted Ajayi and demanded he retrieve the bag from the river. After further questioning, Ajayi ran, but was eventually caught by the group.\n\nA video taken by onlookers shows the intense moment in a nearby bush, with the bikemen attempting to restrain him.\n\nUmaru explained,\n\n\u201cThe bikemen began hitting him with a stick, but we stopped them to ensure the matter was followed up properly. He was weak and could hardly talk.\u201d\n\nWhen police were eventually called, a plainclothes officer questioned the suspect.\n\nAjayi admitted to having been in a relationship with the woman for about a year, and explained that an argument about her phone had escalated, leading to the fatal stabbing.\n\nA chilling confession\n\nThe situation grew more horrifying when the church members opened the bag and discovered a human head inside.\n\nAjayi later explained that a woman had asked him to bring her the head, but he did not know the woman's identity or the victim\u2019s relatives.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I have seen anything like this in person,\u201d Umaru said, visibly shaken.\n\nAjayi, a suspected gospel singer, according to some social media users, was arrested and taken by the police, but further details of his background have not been verified.\n\nThe church community is reeling from the horrific event, and local authorities have taken charge of the investigation.\n\nHowever, attempts to reach the Nasarawa State police for comment were unsuccessful at the time of publication.\n\nPAY ATTENTION: \u0421heck out news that is picked exactly for YOU \u27a1\ufe0f find the \u201cRecommended for you\u201d block on the home page and enjoy!\n\nSource: Legit.ng"

Initially claiming to help the scavengers trapped aboard the Romulus, he eventually becomes an impediment to their escape.\n\nFor the recreation, which was made with the consent of Holm\u2019s estate, a combination of CGI and puppetry was used to achieve the likeness of the actor, who passed away in 2020.\n\nSpeaking to Empire recently, Alvarez agreed with criticisms of the scene, saying: \u201cI wasn\u2019t 100 per cent happy with some of the shots, where you could feel a bit more the CG intervention. So, for people that react negatively, I don\u2019t blame them\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlvarez continued: \u201cWe fixed it. We made it better for the release right now. I convinced the studio we need to spend the money and make sure we give the companies that were involved in making it the proper time to finish it and do it right. It\u2019s so much better\u201d. This was done, explains, by lessening the influence of CGI on the character \u201cWhat we did (for the streaming version) was revert a lot more to the puppet\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better.\u201d\n\nFascinating\u2026 streaming versions of Alien: Romulus have apparently made some tweaks to certain shots of Rook VFX (via Reddit) pic.twitter.com/XMEY6iT7QG \u2014 Alien Theory (@Alien_Theory) January 10, 2025\n\nAlien: Romulus was a box office hit and critically well-received.
