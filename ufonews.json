Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d. Lenticular clouds were visible on Thursday and Friday mornings in North-east England.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "INSTITUTE, W.Va. \u2013\u2013 Local volunteers will donate their time over the next dozen weeks to gather food for local food banks in Kanawha and Putnam Counties. The 44th annual United Food Operation food drive kicked off Friday. It\u2019s a 12 week effort to collect as much non-perishable food as possible to be passed along to the region\u2019s needy.\n\n\u201cWe do our pre-planning and get everything together and as we\u2019re talking to the pantries, they\u2019re running out of food. The need is so great we\u2019ve got to keep this going,\u201d said Elaine Harris, UFO Chairperson.\n\nEach Friday through April, the organization will accept donations of food at their warehouse in Institute to be distributed to a dozen food banks across two counties.\n\n\u201cOur warehouse is right off the Institute exit, there will be a big sign. We can take food and store it there and then distribute to the food banks,\u201d she explained.\n\nThis year the American Postal Workers Union Local 133 has joined the effort. The union members are employed at the U.S. Postal Service Processing Center at Southridge. The facility had originally been slated for closure, but thanks to efforts by the community and West Virginia\u2019s Congressional delegation it was saved and will stay in place. Harris said the organization wanted to get involved in the food drive out of gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their way of giving back to the community because the community was so very involved and supportive of them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur members are very excited to take part in this,\u201d Tim Holstein, Vice President of APWU Local 133, said in a news release. \u201cWe have a table set up in front of the union office at the plant and at the Main Post Office and are asking everyone to bring canned/nonperishable food to donate. One can of food could make a difference in someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe effort accepts any non-perishable goods. They\u2019ll take them at the warehouse each Friday or they can also make arrangements to pick up large donations. Harris said it\u2019s a never ending labor of love.\n\n\u201cThe need is so great. This is working people falling through the cracks. This is how we started this program almost 45 years ago,\u201d she said."

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "Microsoft made a trio of announcements this week that are going to be very important for how the company approaches its big AI bet in 2025. It started off by creating a new AI engineering group to focus its developers on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers. Microsoft then announced pay-as-you-go agents for its relaunched Copilot Chat for businesses, and it finished the week by bundling Office AI features into Microsoft 365 for consumers and raising the subscription price.\n\nAll three of these announcements are linked to Microsoft\u2019s insatiable hunger to win at AI. The company still prioritizes security through employee performance reviews, but it increasingly feels like promoting AI is an equally high priority.\n\nThe new engineering group is a good example of Microsoft\u2019s priorities. Led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, the new CoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools division will combine Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div and AI platform teams together. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the reorganization as \u201centering the next innings of this AI platform shift\u201d and said it will \u201creshape all application categories.\u201d Nadella has regularly said that the pace of AI is changing software development, and now Microsoft is building an AI-first app stack to try and take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nCombining Microsoft\u2019s AI platform work and its developer division will put AI at the heart of the very tools, platforms, and services that Microsoft builds for customers and its own teams. Nadella even described this platform shift as the ability for Microsoft\u2019s AI agents, which are essentially virtual employees that automate tasks, to eventually be able to build custom applications. It\u2019s a transformation for Microsoft that looks like it will flip the company from software-as-a-service to service-as-software \u2014 where once-manual human tasks are automated by software and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has spent the past 15 years selling cloud computing to businesses, tempting them to move off traditional software that\u2019s licensed and installed to on-premise servers toward servers hosted by the software giant. Nadella led Microsoft\u2019s transformation to cloud infrastructure and services before becoming CEO, and it\u2019s been hugely successful for the company. Now, Nadella appears to be betting on being able to automate many people-based services and package this up in a software solution Microsoft can sell to businesses.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to some employees in Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div organization this week, and it\u2019s clear there is some unease about the company\u2019s commitment to AI at all costs. Microsoft\u2019s new AI engineering group emerged just days after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg predicted 2025 is going to be a year where \u201cMeta, and the other companies that are working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code.\u201d In an interview with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg said he believes that, over time, a lot of the code in Meta\u2019s apps \u201cwill be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a scary prospect for the thousands of engineers at Meta and Microsoft who have spent their entire careers learning how to build software. One engineer in Microsoft\u2019s new CoreAI team tells me there\u2019s now a feeling that if you\u2019re not all in on AI, there won\u2019t be a place for you in this new team.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s transition here will undoubtedly see engineering jobs change, and it\u2019s all part of a revenue opportunity for AI that the company is constantly chasing. Investors are increasingly looking for returns on Microsoft\u2019s big bets on AI, and recent reports have suggested that it\u2019s struggling to sell businesses on the idea of paying extra for AI-powered versions of Office apps. That\u2019s probably why this week we also saw Microsoft relaunch Copilot as Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, complete with free ChatGPT-like capabilities and pay-as-you-go agents. It\u2019s a rebranding of what was once Bing Enterprise Chat, then Copilot, and now Copilot Chat.\n\nI spoke to Jared Spataro, Microsoft\u2019s chief marketing officer of AI at work, earlier this week, and he made it clear this relaunch is also Microsoft\u2019s latest attempt to get people hooked on using AI at work. \u201cWhat we find is that when you start to use it, you become accustomed to and appreciative of the value that it can provide at work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThe free chat side of Copilot has already been popular for businesses that rely on Microsoft\u2019s software and services, and by adding in agent capabilities, there\u2019s an upsell opportunity to get businesses to pay extra to automate tasks with AI.\n\nMicrosoft can also use this Copilot Chat as a way to tempt businesses into upgrading to the full Microsoft 365 Copilot at $30 per user per month. \u201cWhile Copilot Chat is a powerful new on-ramp for everyone in your organization to build the AI habit, Microsoft 365 Copilot remains our best-in-class personal AI assistant for work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThis is where Copilot really transforms from a simple chatbot into a more assistive technology that can analyze Excel data for you, write paragraphs in Word, or generate an entire PowerPoint presentation. A lot of CTOs tell me that businesses have found the most value from Copilot inside Microsoft Teams, where the AI assistant will transcribe meetings and pull out key talking points to make it easy to catch up on calls you might have missed.\n\nMost businesses aren\u2019t paying the extra for Copilot inside Office apps, though. While adding an AI-powered version of the Python programming language to Excel is powerful and summaries of Outlook emails are super useful, Microsoft needs a lot more compelling Copilot features if it wants businesses to pay that $30 per user per month fee.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar situation over on the consumer side, which is why Microsoft started bundling its AI-powered Office features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions this week. Instead of asking consumers for $20 extra per month for Copilot Pro, Microsoft is raising its subscription prices by $3 per month to bundle Copilot into Office apps.\n\nAs part of this price bump, Microsoft is providing a set of AI credits that can be used on Copilot in apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. You\u2019ll get a monthly allotment of these credits, which can also be used for things like image generation in the Designer app or in apps on Windows like Paint, Photos, and Notepad. If you want unlimited usage of Copilot in Office apps or all of these AI features, you\u2019ll still need to pay for Copilot Pro.\n\nMicrosoft had been testing this Microsoft 365 subscription change in Australia, New Zealand, and some markets in Asia, and it feels like the worldwide launch this week is an even bigger test before the company does something similar for its commercial subscriptions.\n\nGoogle may well force Microsoft\u2019s hand here, after revealing this week that its Gemini Business plan, which you previously had to pay $20 per user per month for, is now free. Google is now bringing all of its AI features to its Workspace app at no extra cost, which piles on the pressure for Microsoft to make some similar moves for commercial customers of Microsoft 365.\n\nAs the competition heats up in 2025, expect to see Microsoft come up with even more inventive pay-as-you-go agents or AI credit methods to get consumers and businesses addicted to AI.\n\nThe pad:\n\nMicrosoft won\u2019t support Office apps on Windows 10 after October 14th. If you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time. Microsoft has started warning that it will no longer support Office apps, known as Microsoft 365 apps, on Windows 10 after October 14th \u2014 the day support ends for the old OS. While the apps will continue to function, there could be issues over time. It\u2019s all part of an effort from Microsoft to get businesses and consumers to upgrade to Windows 11.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time.

Microsoft stops using Bing to trick people into thinking they\u2019re on Google. Microsoft has started quietly killing off its spoofed Google UI that it was using to trick Bing users into thinking they were using Google. The page that appeared after you searched for \u201cGoogle\u201d on Bing no longer has a special search bar or an image that resembles a Google Doodle. It\u2019s just a regular Bing search result now, although some countries still have the fake Google UI.\n\nMicrosoft has started quietly killing off its spoofed Google UI that it was using to trick Bing users into thinking they were using Google.

Panay left Microsoft in 2023, after working alongside Groene to create the original Surface tablet more than 10 years ago. Amazon also hired Xbox cofounder J Allard recently, who is also working on Panay\u2019s devices team.

Microsoft files a gaming AI patent for \u201ccrafting and altering game narratives.\u201d I\u2019m still waiting for Microsoft to unveil its AI plans for Xbox, but it looks like the company is already exploring ways that AI can be used in game design. Windows Central has spotted a patent from 2024 that allows designers and players to customize a game through generative AI prompts. Nvidia has been showing off similar work for NPCs in games, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we start to see a lot more of this.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for Microsoft to unveil its AI plans for Xbox, but it looks like the company is already exploring ways that AI can be used in game design.

There aren\u2019t many Microsoft employees who can say they\u2019ve been at the company 40 years, but Larry Osterman is one of them. To celebrate Osterman\u2019s long tenure \u2014 that has included work on Windows, Exchange, and Azure \u2014 Microsoft gifted him a giant 40th-anniversary crystal. It took almost six months to be delivered, and it looks like it was worth the wait.

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "We\u2019ve been waiting for a big ChatGPT upgrade for months now, but OpenAI has yet to announce one. Sure, the company had a monster month of announcements in December. OpenAI took the o1 reasoning model out of beta, making it available to more ChatGPT users. The text-to-video Sora tool is now available to users in certain markets. The o3 reasoning model has also been announced and is currently undergoing testing.\n\nThese are just a few of the AI announcements OpenAI made in December, but there\u2019s no word on when the GPT-4o upgrade will drop. Unofficially, reports say that ChatGPT GPT-5, or whatever it ends up being called, is running behind schedule, as OpenAI has had issues training the next-gen AI model. OpenAI isn\u2019t the only AI company experiencing such problems.\n\nSam Altman has been hyping OpenAI\u2019s accomplishments recently, teasing potential ChatGPT features to come in 2025 while also talking about the larger goals. AGI (artificial general intelligence) is the next big thing, an AI that can tackle any task just like a human would. After AGI, we get to artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is AI that exceeds the capabilities of the human mind.\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\u201d Altman said in a blog post recently, adding that OpenAI is already starting to look at superintelligence development.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHow close are we to that big AI breakthrough? Some people think the recent excitement that some OpenAI engineers are displaying online suggests that the company is indeed close to some sort of big advancement in AI.\n\nSome AI fans noticed the recent teasers from OpenAI employees, as well as an essay from an AI researcher who goes by the name of \u201cGwern\u201d online.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 AI Researcher Gwern just dropped the latest essay on OpenAI o3, o4, o5\n\n\n\nHere are a few important points from the essay:\n\n\n\n\u2013 openAI may have chosen to keep its \"o1-pro\" model private, using its computational resources to train a more advanced model like \"o3\", similar to the\u2026 https://t.co/p10BXXjuQH pic.twitter.com/Zcu7a1uY7C \u2014 Haider. (@slow_developer) January 16, 2025\n\nGwern theorized that OpenAI may hold the key to developing AGI and superintelligence. A powerful reasoning model like the o1 or o1 pro can produce the data needed to train more advanced reasoning models.\n\nThe essay author in the tweet above also said they\u2019re surprised OpenAI isn\u2019t keeping o1-pro private so they can use it for training o3 and newer models. Eventually, AI models will train themselves, leading to the big AGI and ASI breakthroughs we\u2019re waiting for.\n\nGwern suggests that OpenAI may already be on the verge of a big breakthrough, or they\u2019ve already done it behind closed doors:\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why OAers are suddenly weirdly, almost euphorically, optimistic on Twitter, watching the improvement from the original 4o model to o3 (and wherever it is now!) may be why. It\u2019s like watching the AlphaGo Elo curves: it just keeps going up\u2026 and up\u2026 and up\u2026 There may be a sense that they\u2019ve \u2018broken out\u2019 and have finally crossed the last threshold of criticality, from merely cutting-edge Al work, which everyone else will replicate in a few years, to takeoff \u2013 cracked intelligence to the point of being recursively self-improving and where o4 or o5 will be able to automate AI R&D and finish off the rest.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about OpenAI being close to the next massive improvement in AI but also the future beyond that. Access to superintelligence will make subsequent AI developments easier and more efficient because an AI mind will handle the next innovations.\n\nAlso, in a scenario where OpenAI might be close to AGI and ASI, it would obtain an incredible advantage over competitors. Other AI firms that have not established their own superintelligence will have to develop AI with traditional methods. In contrast, OpenAI would have ASI employing its own discoveries to create better AI, and it\u2019ll do it more efficiently.\n\nThis is all speculation at this point, as OpenAI has yet to make any announcements. But it\u2019s all based on the recent hype from Sam Altman and other OpenAI engineers. Of course, they always seem to go out of their way to hype OpenAI\u2019s efforts on social media, so this all could simply be more of the same.\n\nAlso, if and when ChatGPT AGI and ASI are reached, don\u2019t expect it to be affordable or even available publicly. At least, not initially. OpenAI rivals might be just as close to AGI and ASI, but they might be more restrained in teasing imminent breakthroughs.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also the safety aspect to consider. Artificial intelligence, from the current ChatGPT models to AGI and ASI, will have to be aligned with humanity\u2019s interests so it doesn\u2019t develop its own agenda, which could almost certainly endanger our species.\n\nBack to GPT-5, it\u2019ll still be interesting to see what OpenAI does next in terms of ChatGPT upgrades. More news about o3 should come soon. Then, GPT-4o will celebrate its first anniversary this summer. Some sort of upgrade for the base ChatGPT model is surely due soon."

            "article_content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) have historically focused their virtual health care enforcement efforts on \u201ctraditional\u201d telemarketing, broker, runner, and related schemes. These arrangements generally involve sales agents, recruiters, or marketers who direct patients to purported telemedicine companies, which then enter into payment arrangements with physicians and/or non-physician practitioners for the provision of medically unnecessary health care services. The practitioners often have limited or no interaction with the supposed patients, do not review or have access to patient medical records, and order or prescribe medically unnecessary items or services from a predetermined list.\n\nIn July 2022, the OIG formalized its concerns regarding such arrangements in a Special Fraud Alert. As noted by the OIG, these schemes implicate multiple civil and criminal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the civil False Claims Act (FCA), and criminal fraud statutes. The OIG further stated that these arrangements have the potential for considerable harm to both federal health care programs and program beneficiaries, including (1) inappropriate increases in costs for medically unnecessary items and services, (2) patient harm or delayed clinical services, and (3) corruption of medical decision-making.\n\nWhile DOJ and the OIG have continued to pursue and investigate telefraud schemes, two cases announced in 2024 demonstrate a shift in telemedicine enforcement from \u201ctraditional\u201d schemes to more sophisticated investigations and potential criminal exposure in certain matters.\n\nFirst, in June 2024, Ruthie He, the founder, CEO, and clinical president of Done Global (Done), and David Brody, clinical president of Done and the sole physician shareholder of Done Health, P.C., were indicted, arrested, and arraigned in a first-of-its-kind telemedicine criminal prosecution (see our prior post here). Both He and Brody face a seven-count indictment alleging conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nThe indictment alleges that He and Brody orchestrated a scheme to generate over $100 million in revenue by inappropriately offering Adderall and other stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Among other allegations, the defendants purportedly violated the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine and directed practitioners to prescribe and renew Adderall prescriptions without clinical justification. The practitioners were allegedly paid based upon an above-market pay structure tied to the number of patients ultimately receiving prescriptions. Indeed, the indictment asserts that prescribing practitioners often were not licensed in the states where prescriptions were issued and that Adderall and other stimulants were ordered in violation of state physician supervision requirements.\n\nThe prosecution of He and Brody is proceeding in federal court in the Northern District of California before Judge Breyer. In October 2024, He\u2019s bond was revoked, and she was remanded to custody as a flight risk. On December 2, 2024, He filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, moved to compel disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion asserts that the indictment fails to satisfy the knowledge requirement under the Controlled Substances Act, that the health care fraud conspiracy elements have not been adequately alleged, and, in the alternative, that He should be entitled to grand jury materials. On December 16, 2024, DOJ opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing the sufficiency of the indictment and contesting the disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion to dismiss is currently pending.\n\nIn addition to He and Brody, several other Done personnel have cases pending in the Northern District of California. Two Done nurse practitioners and an executive leader have cases pending before Judge Breyer. In the last related case, a Done physician has entered a plea agreement.\n\nSecond, also in June 2024, a behavioral health telemedicine holding company and its practice affiliates (collectively, Supportive Care) agreed to pay approximately $4.6 million to resolve allegations related to the submission of false claims to Medicare and the Connecticut Medicaid program. Interestingly, DOJ alleged that the telemedicine company submitted false claims for \u201ctelehealth originating site facility fees.\u201d Under the applicable Medicare billing code, telehealth originating site fees are only billable when the originating site (in this case the nursing facility) provides administrative and clinical support for the telehealth patient. Instead, here, the telemedicine company and its affiliates billed for the originating site facility code.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ alleged that Supportive Care submitted false claims for psychological services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. DOJ alleged, however, that the beneficiaries were not in fact residing in the nursing facilities and had been transferred to various hospitals and admitted as inpatients. The settlement resolved both sets of FCA allegations.\n\nThese two cases demonstrate that DOJ and the OIG are expanding their investigation and enforcement activities beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d telefraud arrangements into more complex areas. In the Done prosecution, DOJ is seeking to criminally enforce allegedly fraudulent telehealth activity implicating compliance with state corporate practice and physician supervision requirements. In the Supportive Care resolution, DOJ and the OIG focused on the alleged failure to adhere to telehealth-specific codes. Both matters portend a trend likely to continue in 2025 whereby a maturing telehealth industry is subject to more sophisticated government investigations.\n\n[View source.]"

            "article_content": "OpenAI\u2019s new model, called GPT-4b micro, was trained to suggest ways to re-engineer the protein factors to increase their function. According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "The retail industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, thanks to the transformative power of machine learning. A recent article by Akhilesh Kota sheds light on how machine learning is revolutionizing the dynamic pricing landscape, enabling retailers to make more informed and adaptive decisions. The insights delve into the nuances of this innovative approach, emphasizing its role in reshaping consumer experiences and business profitability.\n\nUnderstanding Dynamic Pricing\n\nDynamic pricing is a strategy that adjusts prices in real-time, responding to fluctuations in demand, competition, and external factors. Unlike traditional static pricing, it uses advanced algorithms to analyze and react to market conditions with accuracy and speed. When combined with machine learning, dynamic pricing becomes even more powerful. Machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and refine pricing strategies based on actionable insights. This enables businesses to stay competitive, meet customer expectations, and maximize revenue. By ensuring prices are neither excessively high nor unsustainably low, dynamic pricing balances profitability with customer satisfaction, driving sustainable business growth.\n\nMachine Learning: The Game Changer\n\nThe application of machine learning in dynamic pricing brings unprecedented sophistication to pricing strategies, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Machine learning algorithms excel in several key areas:\n\nAnalyzing Market Trends: These systems detect subtle shifts in consumer preferences, competitor pricing, and market conditions, enabling proactive and informed pricing adjustments.\n\nPredicting Demand: By forecasting demand patterns for specific products and timeframes, businesses can optimize inventory levels, avoid stockouts, and maximize revenue opportunities.\n\nEnhancing Personalization: Tailored pricing strategies based on individual customer profiles, preferences, and purchase history create a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.\n\nBy automating complex analytical processes, machine learning not only reduces human error but also enables faster, more accurate responses to dynamic market conditions, empowering businesses to stay competitive.\n\nData as the Backbone\n\nThe success of machine learning in dynamic pricing hinges on the quality and diversity of data inputs. Retailers need to collect extensive information, such as historical sales trends, customer demographics, competitor pricing, and broader economic indicators. These datasets are essential for training algorithms that evolve and optimize pricing strategies over time. Furthermore, integrating real-time data allows these models to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions, ensuring prices remain competitive and aligned with current demand. This combination of comprehensive data and real-time updates empowers businesses to make informed, agile decisions, helping them gain an edge in today\u2019s fast-paced and competitive markets.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nThe potential of machine learning in dynamic pricing is vast, but it comes with challenges that businesses must navigate carefully. Ethical concerns, such as unintentional price discrimination, can erode consumer trust if not addressed transparently. Moreover, the implementation of machine learning systems demands substantial investment in infrastructure, skilled professionals, and technical expertise. These hurdles can be daunting, particularly for smaller organizations. To overcome them, businesses should prioritize transparency in pricing strategies and ensure algorithms adhere to ethical standards. Investing in scalable, user-friendly technologies and fostering a workforce skilled in data science can simplify adoption, ensuring the benefits outweigh the challenges.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThe integration of machine learning into dynamic pricing represents a transformative shift toward a smarter and more adaptive retail landscape. As technology continues to advance, several key developments are expected to shape the future of pricing strategies:\n\nImproved Algorithms: Enhanced models will delve deeper into consumer behavior, identifying subtle trends and preferences for precise price adjustments.\n\nSeamless Integration: Dynamic pricing systems will increasingly connect with inventory management, marketing, and customer engagement tools, creating unified ecosystems.\n\nGlobal Applications: Machine learning will enable region-specific pricing strategies, catering to the unique demands of diverse markets and cultural contexts.\n\nThese advancements will not only empower retailers with better decision-making tools but also foster customer satisfaction by ensuring transparent, fair, and competitive pricing tailored to individual needs.\n\nIn conclusion, Akhilesh Kota\u2019s insights into machine learning-powered dynamic pricing reveal its immense potential to transform retail. Leveraging data and advanced algorithms enables businesses to enhance efficiency, boost profitability, and adapt to evolving market demands. Embracing these innovations will be essential for retailers aiming to thrive in a competitive and rapidly changing industry landscape."

In the film, Israelis described what it was like to experience the deadliest day for Jews since World War II as the Oct. 7 attacks unfolded, with around 1,200 people killed, 5,000 injured and 251 taken hostage. And in Gaza, where more than 40,000 people have reportedly been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliation against Hamas, Palestinians described \u2014 and recorded \u2014 the horrors of large-scale devastation.\n\nAs outrage over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza deeply divided American campuses and in some places devolved into hate-filled rhetoric and arrests, this June 2024 documentary with Retro Report investigated how universities responded, how powerful interests joined the fray, and how the conflict over the conflict ultimately spiraled out of control.\n\nThis documentary, updated in May 2024, offered a sweeping examination of the critical moments over the course of the past three decades leading up to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the role of a central player: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn this January 2024 documentary, correspondent Ramita Navai investigated rising support for militant groups, including Hamas, since the Oct. 7 attack, Israel\u2019s military campaign in the West Bank, and the implications for a region on edge.\n\nThis December 2023 documentary with The Washington Post examined how Hamas was able to breach Israel\u2019s vaunted security barrier and carry out the attack that ignited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nRe-released in October 2023, this seminal 2002 documentary examined how the Israeli-Palestinian peace process begun at Oslo in the 1990s was derailed and ultimately undone by the dynamics of politics and violence. The documentary included interviews with key figures from both sides of the negotiating table, including Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Saeb Erekat and Ehud Barak.\n\nExplore more from FRONTLINE on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

            "source": "The Washington Post",
            "article_content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 The ceasefire deal in the war between Israel and Hamas this week reflected a shift within the militant group\u2019s internal dynamics: With its senior leadership dead, it was Hamas\u2019s political representatives abroad who led the negotiations over a conflict started by hard-line commanders inside Gaza.\n\nHamas negotiators in Doha, Qatar, still coordinated closely with military leaders in Gaza, and the deal required their approval. But 15 months of fighting have depleted the group\u2019s military strength, sapped its political influence and opened a void in leadership inside the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cThis is a new pattern of decision-making in Hamas, which means that the outside leadership has more impact than they had four or five months ago,\u201d said Michael Milstein, a former adviser to the Israeli military on Palestinian affairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael says it killed military commander Mohammed Deif and political chief Ismael Haniyeh last summer. Two months later, in the biggest blow to the movement, Israel killed Yahya Sinwar, the architect and leader of Hamas\u2019s deadly attack of Oct. 7, 2023, that triggered Israel\u2019s ferocious war.\n\nSinwar had been appointed to replace Haniyeh, a promotion that suggested that Hamas\u2019s Gaza-based faction was maintaining control. Israel believes Sinwar\u2019s brother Mohammed, also based in Gaza, has replaced Deif.\n\nBut no one, in Gaza or abroad, has replaced Sinwar, seen in previous rounds as the hard-line voice and deciding vote. The Israeli campaign has hollowed out the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, and remaining leaders face the threat of Israeli assassination.\n\nThat left the negotiations to Khalil al-Hayya, who was Yahya Sinwar\u2019s deputy, and his four-person team, all of whom are from Gaza but living abroad, and Mohammed Sinwar in Gaza, according to regional officials and people familiar with the negotiations.\n\n\u201cToday Khalil al-Hayya is considered the head of the Hamas movement in Gaza\u201d and is \u201cstrongest at this stage\u201d at the political and diplomatic level, said a person who worked for Yahya Sinwar and remains close to Hamas. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nHayya\u2019s team included senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamed and Mohammed Darweesh. \u201cThere are people outside of that immediate circle [negotiating team] that pull strings and have power and influence within the movement,\u201d said Gershon Baskin, who helped negotiate the release of kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas captivity in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaskin named longtime leader Khaled Mashal, head of the Hamas bureau abroad, and Mousa Abu Marzouk, another senior official. The Shura Council, a body of senior Hamas officials, also had to be consulted.\n\nIsraeli media often describes Mohammed Sinwar, a hard-liner like his brother, as the new head of Hamas in Gaza. But Avi Kalo, a former Israeli military intelligence official, said the balance of power has shifted to Hamas leaders based abroad, largely in Doha.\n\nMohammed Sinwar\u2019s \u201cpower is driven by his controlling the battlefield and commanders, but he does not have the same mandate as the Hamas leadership outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThat shifting dynamic, coupled with pressure from Trump and Qatar, generated new compromises from Hamas that has led us to this situation.\u201d\n\nBaskin described the Israeli focus on Mohammed as politically expedient, \u201cas it\u2019s very easy for the Israelis to create the evil devil who\u2019s in charge of everything \u2026 that if we kill that person, everything will be fine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, in the hours before the ceasefire deal was announced Wednesday, members of the Hamas political office were in communication with the group\u2019s military leadership in Gaza, including during a meeting with the Qatari prime minister, to get final approval on the agreement, according to an official briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\n\nFighters led by Hamas streamed out of Gaza early on Oct. 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 Israelis in communities near the enclave and take 250 hostage. About 100 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza. Israel has killed more than 46,500 Palestinians and flattened much of the densely populated enclave in the 15 months since.\n\nThe agreement has three phases. The first is an initial 42-day ceasefire and the gradual release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons. Israel is to begin pulling back its troops in Gaza and allowing a surge of humanitarian assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemaining Israeli hostages and additional Palestinian detainees are to be released in the second phase. The thorniest issues, still unresolved, are left to the third phase, when reconstruction and new governing and security structures in Gaza are supposed to be implemented.\n\nThe deal does not address who will rule Gaza going forward. Without a political solution for Gaza and the occupied West Bank, critics say, it\u2019s likely to collapse.\n\nPressure from President-elect Donald Trump, a renewed push by the Biden administration and domestic challenges facing both Israel and Hamas helped get a deal over the finish line. Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, applied new pressure on the Israeli negotiating team, according to a diplomat who was briefed on the talks.\n\nHamas\u2019s position, meanwhile, was weakened by mounting public anger and pressure to compromise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hamas negotiating team was more open to terms that the group had previously rejected outright, according to the diplomat, such as allowing a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from security zones.\n\n\u201cThe humanitarian situation was obviously having a big impact,\u201d said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza received the ceasefire with mixed emotions. In the hours immediately after the announcement Wednesday, deadly Israeli strikes continued across the Strip. While celebrations erupted, people kept their hopes modest. Some planned to return to bombed-out homes or to bury their dead.\n\nThe deal does not end the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out returning to the battlefield.\n\nHayya did not call the ceasefire a victory, as Hamas has after reaching ceasefires with Israel in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn this historic moment, we extend words of pride and honor to our people in Gaza,\u201d he said in a televised address from Doha on Wednesday.\n\nMouin Rabbani, a nonresident fellow at Qatar\u2019s Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies, said Hamas can spin its survival as a win. Israel vowed to eradicate the group, but \u201cit is still standing.\u201d\n\nMuch uncertainty remains. Even in its weakened state, Hamas is still the dominant political force in Gaza. Netanyahu has refused to propose a postwar political plan for the Strip. He has ruled out the return of the U.S.-backed Palestinian Authority.\n\n\u201cThe big question here that no one has an answer to, and I think that Hamas outside [the enclave] itself doesn\u2019t know for sure, [is if] the people inside of Gaza are going to be able to implement this deal.\u201d Baskin said."

            "article_content": "Recent data breaches have highlighted the critical need to improve guest Wi-Fi infrastructure security in modern business environments. Organizations face increasing pressure to protect their networks while providing convenient access to visitors, contractors, temporary staff, and employees with BYOD. Implementing secure guest Wi-Fi infrastructure has become essential for authenticating access, protecting data, maintaining compliance across all geographies, and ensuring business continuity.\n\nEvolved security solutions now combine zero-trust architecture with cloud-based captive portals to enhance network protection. These systems enable organizations to implement strict access controls, verify every device's security status, and maintain network separation. Through advanced features like conditional access and device registration, businesses can now offer secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining complete visibility and control over their network resources.\n\nChallenges in Wi-Fi Security Today\n\nDistributed organizations implementing guest Wi-Fi networks face increasingly sophisticated security challenges. The complexity of implementing and managing secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining network integrity has become a critical concern for both IT administrators and Security practitioners.\n\nCommon security vulnerabilities\n\nModern guest Wi-Fi networks face several significant security threats:\n\nLack of Network Micro-Segmentation: Networks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.\n\nNetworks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data. Weak Encryption: Most of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association.\n\nMost of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data.\n\nAttackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data. Inadequate Authentication: Some networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks.\n\nSome networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks. Rogue Access Points (APs): Attackers can set up rogue APs mimicking legitimate Guest Wi-Fi to lure users and steal sensitive information.\n\nIf not properly secured, the Wi-Fi guest networks pose significant security risks. Weak access controls allow unauthorized users to exploit the network, leading to data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. A critical issue is the lack of network segmentation; without proper isolation, attackers on the guest network may access internal systems, risking data breaches.\n\nInsufficient authentication and weak password practices further heighten vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement VLANs, strict authentication, and active monitoring. A well-segmented guest network helps maintain security while offering convenient access to visitors.\n\nWhy is BYOD the most critical category to monitor?\n\nBYOD introduces a mix of unmanaged and potentially insecure devices into the network. These devices often lack corporate-level security controls and might already be compromised with malware, creating a direct entry point for attackers once connected to the network.\n\nIf the attacker has access to the network through a BYOD, sensitive corporate data accessed via BYOD devices may increase the likelihood of unintentional or malicious data leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the potential actions that can be implemented to mitigate such issues :\n\nProper Network Segmentation\n\nAsset inventory\n\nEncryption\n\nAuthentication Mechanism (like Captive Portal)\n\nProfiled Security Policies\n\nMonitoring and Threat Detection\n\nZero Trust Approach\n\nPotential consequences for businesses\n\nSecurity breaches in guest Wi-Fi networks can have devastating impacts on organizations. Recent studies indicate that 40% of businesses have experienced information compromise through public Wi-Fi networks. The financial implications are significant, with some companies reporting ransomware payments exceeding $1 million to recover their data.\n\nBeyond immediate financial losses, businesses face:\n\nDamage to brand reputation and customer trust\n\nDisruption of normal business operations\n\nPotential loss of intellectual property\n\nCompromise of internal network resources\n\nLegal and compliance considerations\n\nOrganizations must navigate complex regulatory requirements when implementing guest Wi-Fi management systems. The legal framework includes multiple layers of compliance, they need to warrant the security level for their network while ensuring the confidentiality of the users' data, and they need to cooperate with the authorities when required while complying with limited data retention period obligation. It is even more difficult for international organizations because they need to monitor and stay updated on any regulations' changes in various countries and jurisdictions, operating at international levels creates diverse and even contradictory obligations, for example, the data retention policies are different among countries, in France, it is required to retain data logs for 1 year, but it is 6 years in Italy, while the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires users' data to be deleted after the purposes have been achieved. Some key regulations need to be taken into consideration:\n\nTherefore, businesses must implement proper documentation, monitoring systems, and security controls to maintain compliance with these regulations. Regular security audits and network infrastructure updates are essential to maintaining legal compliance while providing secure guest access.\n\nLeveraging Cloud Captive Portals for Enhanced Security\n\nCloud-based captive portal solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern network security infrastructure. These sophisticated systems provide organizations with centralized control over guest access while maintaining robust security protocols.\n\nHow Cloud Captive Portals Work\n\nCloud-captive portals function as gateway systems that authenticate users before granting network access. The system intercepts initial connection attempts and redirects users to a secure login page. Organizations can implement various authentication methods, including:\n\nSocial login integration\n\nSponsor\n\nDeclarative Email\n\nSMS Authentication\n\nThese solutions operate without additional hardware requirements, making them infrastructure-agnostic and instantly deployable across global locations.\n\nIntegration with Zero Trust frameworks\n\nModern Cloud Captive Portals should align seamlessly with Zero Trust security principles by implementing continuous verification and limited access protocols.\n\nThe integration enables:\n\nDevice Profiling & Authentication\n\nIntegrity\n\nAccess Control\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\nAutomation\n\nTraffic Monitoring & Compliance\n\nRequired security features to deploy a cloud captive portals solution\n\nModern captive portal solutions shall incorporate multiple layers of security protection. Innovative solutions now integrate with leading security solutions, enabling administrators to implement granular access controls and URL filtering.\n\nCloudi-Fi platform supports comprehensive compliance requirements through regional data center deployment, ensuring adherence to local privacy regulations. Automated encryption of personal data and transparent collection processes provide users and administrators complete control over information handling.\n\nAdvanced features include integration with cloud-based security platforms, enabling:\n\nCloud firewall implementation\n\nContent filtering capabilities\n\nBandwidth Control\n\nAutomated device onboarding\n\nThese capabilities offer a robust security framework that protects both the organization's network and user data while maintaining seamless access for authorized users.\n\nBenefits of a Zero Trust Captive Portal Solution\n\nThe implementation of Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift in securing guest Wi-Fi networks, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more comprehensive verification model. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations manage and secure guest network access.\n\nZero Trust Cloud Captive Portal solutions provide a scalable, centralized access control layer across multiple sites or large office campuses. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, they allow seamless deployment without needing extensive on-prem hardware, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and secure, device-specific access. The cloud-based platform dynamically scales to handle high volumes of traffic and multiple entry points, while continuously monitoring user behaviors. This architecture not only simplifies management but also enhances security, as threats are isolated, and access is tightly controlled based on identity, device, and risk assessment, all through a unified, cloud-driven approach.\n\nAdapting Zero Trust principles for guest access\n\nOrganizations must carefully adapt Zero Trust principles to maintain security while ensuring a seamless guest experience. The implementation requires a balanced approach that considers security requirements and user convenience. Key adaptation strategies include:\n\nRole-based permissions for the access control\n\nSponsoring, social login with MFA, mail address, \u2026 for user authentication\n\nSegmentation for network isolation\n\nTime-limited access tokens for session management\n\nBenefits of traditional security models\n\nZero Trust Architecture offers significant advantages compared to conventional security approaches. The model eliminates the inherent vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security by implementing continuous verification and granular access controls.\n\nThe transformation from traditional to zero-trust security brings multiple operational improvements:\n\nEnhanced Security Posture Elimination of lateral movement threats\n\nReal-time threat detection and response\n\nComprehensive audit trails Operational Efficiency Automated device onboarding\n\nCentralized policy management\n\nSimplified compliance reporting\n\nThe architecture's ability to maintain strict security controls while supporting dynamic access requirements makes it particularly effective for guest Wi-Fi environments. By implementing least-privilege access principles, organizations can ensure that guests receive only the necessary network resources while maintaining complete visibility and control over all network activities.\n\nIntegrating Zero Trust principles with cloud-based management platforms enables distributed organizations to effortlessly scale their guest Wi-Fi security efficiently. This combination offers network and security administrators powerful tools for monitoring network usage, enforcing security policies, and responding to potential threats in real time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transformation of guest Wi-Fi security through cloud-captive portals and Zero Trust Architecture marks a significant advancement in corporate network protection. Modern organizations require robust security solutions that extend beyond traditional perimeter defenses. The combination of continuous verification, granular access controls, and advanced monitoring capabilities creates a comprehensive security framework that addresses current and emerging threats while maintaining operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness leaders must recognize the critical role of secure guest Wi-Fi in maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data.

They built custom generative AI applications on their cloud provider using OpenAI\u2019s APIs for broader analysis, providing access to their LLMs (large language models) and ChatGPT to get more strategic and valuable answers to their business questions. The process was costly and complex, and it delivered suboptimal results. That all changed when they adopted federated learning.\n\nThe strategy of federation in AI deployments\n\nFederated learning is emerging as a game-changing approach for enterprises looking to leverage the power of LLMs while maintaining data privacy and security. Rather than moving sensitive data to LLM providers or building isolated small language models (SLMs), federated learning enables organizations to train LLMs using their private data where it resides. Everyone who worries about moving private enterprise data to a public space, such as uploading it to an LLM, can continue to have \u201cprivate data.\u201d Private data may exist on a public cloud provider or in your data center.\n\nThe real power of federation comes from the tight integration between private enterprise data and sophisticated LLM capabilities. This integration allows companies to leverage their proprietary information and broader knowledge in models like GPT-4 or Google Gemini without compromising security. More importantly, it means not having to deal with moving petabytes of data to a public cloud that\u2019s also hosting an LLM."

The Apollo moon landings were fake\n\nNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin assemble the American flag on the moon during their Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969. NASA astronauts on the International Space Station marked the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch with a video message on July 16. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nTwelve NASA astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, but in the decades since Apollo 11 astronauts first set foot on the moon, many theories have been put forward claiming that the whole Apollo program was staged. However, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has since released photos of the landing sites as they appear on the lunar surface many years later.\n\nSome of the questions moon landing deniers ask are \"Why are there no stars in the sky in the moonwalkers' photos? Why are the U.S. flags fluttering on the surface? Why do you see footprints in the pictures, but no marks from the lunar modules that landed there?\"\n\nIt turns out those questions are easy to answer than you may think.\n\nThere are no stars in the sky for the same reason you don't see stars during the day on Earth, according to NASA: The bright glow of daylight on the surface washes them out.\n\nU.S. flags planted into the lunar soil had metal rods sewn in them to appear as though they were moving, according to NASA. Without these wires, the flag would have hung straight down, making for a pretty lackluster photo prop.\n\nAnd the lunar modules, though heavier, didn't put prominent marks in the surface in some places because their mass was more evenly distributed than the astronauts' weight was in their boots.\n\n2. NASA is a lie\n\nNASA's Artemis 1 moon rocket arrives at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building on Sept. 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA's Kennedy Space Center)\n\nSome people actually believe NASA's whole function is not to explore space, but to generate space-related hoaxes. (The Apollo moon landing is a famous example that we'll explore in the next slide.) People who believe this conspiracy, sometimes flagged with the hashtag \"#NASAhoax\" on social media, will say that amazing space pictures of Mars, Pluto and even Earth are fake, computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nNASA was formed in 1958 \"to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes,\" according to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law shortly after the start of the space race against the Soviet Union.\n\nSince then, NASA has launched hundreds of satellites into orbit around Earth, the moon and several other worlds. In fact, NASA spacecraft have orbited, flown by or landed on every planet in the solar system. NASA also sends astronauts into orbit, where they conduct research at the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n\n\nIf you're not convinced, you are free to travel to Florida's Space Coast to watch a rocket launch for yourself. It's also quite easy to see the space station and other satellites with your own eyes with the help of a satellite tracker.\n\n3. The Earth is flat\n\nEarth as seen from space (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThis myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space \u2014 which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.\n\n\n\nOne way of demonstrating to yourself that the Earth is round is to consider how orbits of satellites work. Satellites constantly \"fall\" around the Earth as they are pulled around by our planet's gravity; they just need to be traveling fast enough at a high enough altitude to not slam into the atmosphere. Or, you can look at the amazing pictures taken by astronauts at the ISS.\n\n4. Planet Nine will kill us\n\nArtist's illustration of the hypothetical Planet Nine, which may lie undiscovered in the outer solar system. (Image credit: Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nIn April 2016, the New York Post tweeted, \"A newly discovered planet could destroy Earth as soon as this month.\" The newspaper was referring to Planet Nine, a theoretical planet at the edge of the solar system. An accompanying video also claimed that the new planet would be throwing all sorts of asteroids and comets at Earth, which would supposedly end up pummeling our planet.\n\n\n\nAlthough the existence of a ninth planet has not been confirmed, astronomers are actively looking for one to help explain motions of some objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects beyond Neptune. If the planet is actually found, the planet will pose no threat to us, according to the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown (who is one of the original backers of the Planet Nine theory).\n\n5. Alien research is happening at Area 51\n\nArea 51's restricted area covers over 90,000 acres (36,000 hectares) . (Image credit: Roger Holden via Getty Images)\n\nThe 1996 movie \"Independence Day\" is one of the main sources of the Area 51 hoax, which claims that aliens and their technology \u2014 recovered from crashed flying saucers \u2014 are being studied secretly at a classified military base about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. Some people in the area around the base claim that they have seen strange lights or objects flying in or out of this area.\n\n\n\nWhile the testing and development conducted at Area 51 is classified, the U.S. government has acknowledged its existence (although the CIA officially calls it \"Homey Airport\" or \"Groom Lake\").\n\nA part of Edwards Air Force Base, the area was a known location for high-technology airplane flights in the 1960s and 1970s. It first served as a proving ground for Lockheed U-2 and A-12 OXCART spy planes as early as 1955. UFO sightings reported in the area were indeed unidentified objects, but only because the planes were top-secret \u2014 not because they were flown by aliens.\n\n6. There is a killer planet known as \"Nibiru\"\n\nArtist's conception of the fictional rogue planet Nibiru, or Planet X. Nibiru does not exist, so don't be fooled. (Image credit: gilderm | sxc.hu)\n\nConspiracy theorists say another dangerous planet is Nibiru, which was first mentioned in the 1976 book \"The Twelfth Planet,\" by Zecharia Sitchin. In the book, Sitchin translated ancient Sumerian cuneiform and claimed that the text is proof of a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru that orbits the sun every 3,600 years.\n\n\n\nYears later, self-proclaimed psychic Nancy Lieder claimed to have communicated with extraterrestrials who said Nibiru would collide with Earth in 2003. When that didn't happen, the date was moved to 2012 (and linked, of course, with the 2012 doomsday predictions). Of course, the collision never occurred, the world didn't end in 2012 and no astronomer has ever found a planet on a collision course with Earth.\n\n7. There is a face on Mars\n\nThe original 'Face on Mars' image taken by NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, in grey scale, on July, 25 1976. Image shows a remnant massif located in the Cydonia region. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took a picture of what appeared to be a face on Mars. Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.\n\n\n\nNASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.\n\n8. The moon Iapetus is an alien Death Star\n\nSaturn's moon Iapetus. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIapetus is a moon of Saturn that looks somewhat like the infamous Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with a large crater that resembles the fictional weapon's superlaser focus lens. The Death Star is a planet-killing machine that destroys entire worlds with its outrageously powerful laser. It was prominently featured in the 2016 movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" as well as in 1977's \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\"\n\n\n\nA Daily Mail article published in May 2016 claimed Iapetus is an artificial object crafted by aliens. As \"evidence,\" the article cited a photo taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. In the photo, there's a line around the moon's equator that resembles the equatorial trench around the Death Star.\n\nBut this line isn't nearly as interesting as the Death Star's trench, which houses the battle station's engines, thrusters and docking bays. That line is nothing more than a mountain ridge, and Iapetus is actually just made up of boring old rock and ice. Cassini has flown by the moon to take pictures several times without being blasted by deadly alien lasers.\n\nSaturn's moon Mimas, with it's giant crater Herschel, also looks surprisingly like the Death Star.\n\n9. Saturn's hexagon is alien technology\n\nThis movie, made from images obtained by Cassini's imaging cameras, is the first to show Saturn's hexagon in color filters and the first movie to show a complete view from the north pole down to about 70 degrees north latitude. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/Hampton University)\n\nSaturn's hexagon was first spotted when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by the giant, ringed planet in 1980. The bizarre, six-sided structure on the round planet's north pole caused quite the stir, because straight lines and polygons are not so common in nature.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the Voyager returned its first images of Saturn's strange feature, even stranger theories arose to explain it, including that it was somehow related to alien technology, or perhaps even was a gateway to hell. The hexagon is not artificial, but rather a weird-looking hurricane at Saturn's pole.\n\nNASA has done several flybys of this region with the Cassini spacecraft, studying the haze particles and other features of the storm, to try to learn more about its unusual properties.\n\n10. Mars is as big as the moon\n\nThe solar system to scale. The diameter of Jupiter (middle, with red spot) is about 11 times that of Earth (third planet from the left). Mars is the second-smallest planet in the solar system (fourth planet from left). (Image credit: Lunar and Planetary Institute)\n\nOriginating in 2003, the infamous Mars hoax asserts that Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in the 60,000 years prior, and that the planet will appear as large as the full moon. What started out as a misconstrued email turned into a recurring rumor that gets reshared every August and, naturally, has spread to social media as it became more popular.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mars is indeed relatively close to Earth in a cosmic sense, it will never be as large as the full moon. It will appear as a red dot in the sky, just as the ancient astronomers saw it. If you'd like to see Mars magnified, take out a telescope or look at one of NASA's spectacular Mars pictures."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "As Donald Trump prepares for his inauguration, the world is preparing for the beginning of the second Trump Revolution. Trump\u2019s second term will be very different from his first, when his powers were more limited and restrained. In 2016 he did not win a majority of the popular vote.\n\nNow things are different. He received more votes than his opponent. His cabinet supports his radical agenda. He has control of both houses of Congress and of the Supreme Court. Despite what some critics say, the situation is not the same as Germany in 1933. But it is a rightist revolution, nevertheless.\n\nIt is unprecedented for the US. Trump\u2019s election threatens to dismantle the country\u2019s liberal democratic institutions and lead to further global political instability. Trump will reverse policies and undo agreements to inhibit climate change.\n\nOne way or another, we are all going to be affected. The world we have occupied, and the things that many of us have taken for granted since the Allied victory over fascism in 1945, could be profoundly challenged.\n\nThe Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges.\n\nHow did the US come to elect a convicted felon accused of trying to overturn an election? And what does the new Trump era mean for the world economy? Is he simply just the latest manifestation of the 1980s neoliberal \u201cgreed is good\u201d political motto? Or will his extreme nationalism and isolationism put him on a collision course with other world powers?\n\nI have been an economist for five decades. My research in economics has also led me to consider the roots of authoritarianism, the limits of socialism and the crises of left-wing politics. Since 2019 I have also been involved with colleagues, including political scientist Gerhard Schnyder, on a research project looking into the growth of populism.\n\nOne question that\u2019s vital to understanding the current situation is whether neoliberalism led to the rise of Trump. The difficulty is that the word neoliberalism has been stretched enormously in meaning, to cover many leading politicians, including Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Tony Blair, Emanuel Macron, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Trump himself. The leaders of the Hungarian, Yugoslavian, and Chinese Communist parties, who introduced more markets into their planned economies (after 1956, in the 1950s and 1980s respectively), have all been described by prominent academics as neoliberal. Seemingly, anyone who supports some markets is neoliberal.\n\nSince the late 1970s, I have supported a mixed economy with a private sector and markets, alongside public regulation, strategic planning and a strong welfare state. Some of the prominent critiques of neoliberalism seem to reject a mixed economy. Yet mixed economies with strong welfare states are among the best performing systems in the world.\n\nTrump\u2019s economic protectionism contrasts with the free trade rhetoric of Reagan and Thatcher, which was inspired by influential Chicago economists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. Instead of using an overstretched term, we should identify more specific forces and events. Here, the rise of Chicago style economics, and the election of Thatcher in 1979 and Reagan in 1980 are highly relevant.\n\nRead more: Three possible futures for the global economy if Trump brings in new trade tariffs\n\nHayek and Friedman revived a 19th century strand of liberalism that promoted free markets with minimal government regulation, and a reduction of the size of the state. Although their analyses differ in some important respects, they both underestimated the vital role of the state in sustaining a modern market economy.\n\nIn increasingly complex economies, more state regulation is required to make market competition work. Even from a business point of view, increasing state intervention is needed to educate and train the workforce and to reduce absences due to ill health. To serve human welfare, as well as business interests, the majority of 20th century liberals became promoters of a welfare state.\n\nBut by the late 1950s, as a curious anomaly, the Chicago school of economists had abandoned the free market policy of opposition to oligopolies and monopolies. With this major concession to the large corporations, Chicago economics inspired Thatcher, Reagan and other leading politicians around the world.\n\nFrom 1980 onwards, their policies led to reductions in taxes for the rich and rising inequalities of wealth and income, as French economist Thomas Piketty and others have demonstrated. Trade union power was reduced and real wage levels began to stagnate. As Piketty has shown, more wealth and power was passed to the rich.\n\nGlobalisation created some economic insecurity. Manufacturing jobs moved to China and other countries where labour was cheaper, as deindustrialisation accelerated in the developed west. Where there was inadequate retraining in alternative skills \u2013 as in the US and the UK \u2013 the traditional working class lost out.\n\nCorporate power started to become increasingly concentrated. And, contrary to Chicago aspirations, during the 1980s, and after, in the US and UK, there was no significant reduction in the overall burden of taxation or in the size of the state. But the rich and the large corporations have prospered. Huge companies like Amazon, Google and Walmart (founded in 1994, 1998 and 1962 respectively) now dominate the global corporate landscape.\n\nUsing some core ideas in mainstream economics, intellectual developments since the 1980s have led to an enhanced celebration of greed and self-interest over the virtues of public service and care for others. Notions of duty or public service have become unfashionable. They are excluded from many economic models, where it is typically assumed that everyone maximises their own satisfaction or utility.\n\nRising inequality and threats to democracy\n\nLike all revolutionaries, Trump did not come from nowhere. The Chicago economists had promoted the virtues of private property over the survival of representative democracy. They saw the latter as a virtue, but property mattered much more. In fact, the evidence suggests that both are vital. Consider the (nominal) GDP per capita of the top 30 economies in the world, excepting smaller countries such as Hong Kong, Iceland, Luxembourg, Macau, Qatar, San Marino and Singapore. All 30 are currently democracies, except the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. All are capitalist mixed economies, but with welfare states of various sizes.\n\nThe best performers are Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the US. In seven of these countries in the full list, the welfare state is much stronger than in the US. By several criteria, social democratic welfare capitalisms, with larger public sectors and higher levels of taxation, have performed better than Anglo-American capitalism.\n\nFor prosperity, the existence of a private sector is important, but so too is democracy. Representative democracy can counter any slide toward dictatorship, help protect human rights and encourage pluralism and tolerance. There is also evidence that democracy reduces the chances of war and famine, and that it helps to put pressure on governments to deal with pollution and other environmental problems.\n\nThe proportion of the global population living in liberal democracies increased markedly in the second half of the 20th century. I am a member of the babyboom generation, born just after the end of the second world war. This generation has witnessed the forward march of democracy. In the 1970s, dictatorships fell in places like Greece, Portugal and Spain.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw another surge of democratisation, with new democracies emerging in Latin America. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the cold war brought democracy to much of central and eastern Europe. But since the beginning of the 21st century, liberal democracy has been in retreat. It is now threatened in one of its first and most important homelands.\n\nA world ripe for populism\n\nUnder Reagan and his Republican successors, the US Republican party was transformed from a pragmatic political organisation, which was capable of compromise and reaching some consensus with its opponents, to a party with an uncompromising ideology in favour of the rich.\n\nBoth Reagan and Thatcher ensured that political developments in favour of the rich were not reversed. Research shows that economic inequality can lead to a greater inequality of political power. In other words, politics reverts to an elite activity, by those and for those with money and influence.\n\nInequality of power leads to further economic inequality \u2013 a circular and cumulative process. It can lead to politicians being seen as out of touch with ordinary people.\n\nIn the US, the issue is compounded by how the parties are funded. The Citizens United organisation, for example, was founded in 1988 in the US to promote a deeply conservative agenda. In 2010 it won a case in the Supreme Court that ended restrictions on corporate spending in federal election campaigns. Since 2010 Citizens United has supported Trump.\n\nThe information ecosystem\n\nYears before the political rise of Trump, the information ecosystem had already been undermined by monopoly ownership of big media, and the rise of social media as a home for conspiracy theories, misinformation, and attacks on experts.\n\nIn the past, most news and information was filtered and guided by specialists, working in accredited institutions. Science itself is an institutionalised system to screen and authenticate knowledge. Such a system is always imperfect. The new digital technologies of the 1990s raised hopes of open information systems, free and unfiltered.\n\nBut mass and social media have undermined these established mechanisms of accreditation and led to different outcomes. Even more seriously, big money and powerful political influencers have learned to manipulate the information ecosystem to their own advantage, with some experts saying this is an \u201cindustrial scale\u201d problem.\n\nAs Walter Lippmann showed in his classic 1922 book, Public Opinion, information overload can often prompt people to adopt \u201ccultural stereotypes\u201d rather than evidence-based opinions. Today we now know much more about how people can select and interpret information in biased ways. For example, there is \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d, where people seek information that confirms a belief and ignore contradictory evidence. Biases like this are profuse in echo chambers like X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook where algorithms insure users are largely exposed to information that confirms their preexisting beliefs.\n\nThere is also the \u201cframing effect\u201d, where the same evidence presented in different ways can lead to different responses. For example, people might react differently to a statement about a success rate (\u201cThis procedure has a 70% success rate\u201d) compared to a failure rate (\u201cThis procedure has a 30% failure rate\u201d), even though the information conveyed is identical.\n\nThe information explosion led by 24-hour news, smart phones and social media has greatly exacerbated these problems. These major limitations present difficulties in a democracy.\n\nRead more: The dynamics that polarise us on social media are about to get worse\n\nRepeated politico-economic shocks\n\nIn recent years, the problems of dealing with information overload have become much worse. When people lose trust in experts, then they often turn to populists, who provide easy answers instead of addressing real underlying problems. We have seen this in recent years with right-wing populist governments and representatives being elected across Europe.\n\nIn the UK, right-wing politics is grappling with an ideological transformation in many ways similar to that the US Republican party has undergone. Nigel Farage\u2019s populist party, Reform UK, has surged to 25% in the polls. And the traditional centre-right Conservatives are debating to what degree it should adopt Reform\u2019s approach, with some arguing for an electoral pact with Farage.\n\nBut we\u2019ve already seen the Conservatives deploy many tactics used by Trump during the last 14 years of their time in government. Condemn experts. Promote simple solutions to complex problems. Endorse prejudice. Claim to represent the will of the people. The world has become ripe for such populism.\n\nAt the same time, globalisation continues to undermine job security, particularly in manufacturing, in the US and other western economies. Real wage growth has stagnated in the US for decades. There have been significant increases in US real wages since 2019, but not enough to restore confidence in government economic policies.\n\nConfidence in government was also undermined by the Iraq invasion in 2003, led by then George W. Bush and Tony Blair, following false information that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. When no such weapons were found, trust in establishment politicians was severely damaged. Hundreds of thousands of people died in the war and subsequent instability in Iraq.\n\nThe 2008 financial crash and subsequent austerity measures led to widespread political discontent and stimulated various forms of populism. Capitalism had suffered its biggest financial crisis since the 1930s. Banks had to be bailed out and governments had to rescue financial markets. In the US, 8 million jobs were lost in two years. World trade dropped by 20%.\n\nMarkets eventually recovered, but the crash brought suffering to millions. In November 2008, Queen Elizabeth II asked a UK group of economists why they did not see the crash coming. Adequate answers were not forthcoming. All this added to a growing mistrust of politicians and scientific experts.\n\nThere is some evidence that these trends were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Inundated with misinformation on social media, large swathes of the population lost faith in the current political and economic system. Information abundance led not to enlightenment, but to a mistrust of experts, the blaming of other groups, and to a resurgence of racism and nationalism.\n\nTrump built on these economic and political developments. He successfully courted the new billionaire elite and the owners of mass media. For many, it did not matter that President Biden\u2019s policies had grown the US economy and greatly reduced unemployment. Many focused instead on the surge in prices, which was partly due to COVID-19 and the Ukraine war.\n\nThe rightist populist mindset was not dented by this economic success. Anti-immigration rhetoric won out. Trump made much use of the anti-immigrant card, referring to them as \u201cstone-cold killers\u201d, \u201cmonsters\u201d and \u201cvile animals\u201d.\n\nHistorian and complexity scientist, Peter Turchin and his team have collected data on long-term political cycles, which reveal patterns and processes of decay that undermine the viability of states. They examine how and why past societies collapsed.\n\nRead more: History's crisis detectives: how we're using maths and data to reveal why societies collapse \u2013 and clues about the future\n\nWriting for The Conversation last year, Daniel Hoyer, who works alongside Turchin, said that one of the most common patterns that in the historical record was how extreme inequality shows up in nearly every case of major crisis. \u201cWhen big gaps exist between the haves and have-nots, not just in material wealth but also access to positions of power, this breeds frustration, dissent and turmoil.\u201d\n\n\u201cAges of discord\u201d, as Turchin dubbed periods of great social unrest and violence, produce some of history\u2019s most devastating events, including the US civil war of the 1860s, the early 20th-century Russian Revolution and the Taiping rebellion against the Chinese Qing dynasty, often said to be the deadliest civil war in history.\n\nHoyer writes: \u201cAll of these cases saw people become frustrated at extreme wealth inequality, along with lack of inclusion in the political process. Frustration bred anger, and eventually erupted into fighting that killed millions and affected many more.\u201d\n\nTurchin calls this \u201celite overproduction\u201d, where aspiring groups try to gain shares of concentrated wealth and power. Discontent increases, with battles between existing and new elites, vying for power. Some elites gain control of parts of the media, undermining public trust. Norms of public discourse and behaviour are undermined. States fracture internally and key public institutions decline.\n\nTrust in government\n\nTrump has achieved power in a country that records a low level of trust in government. This mistrust was fertile ground for misinformation and the abuse of social media in Trump\u2019s election campaign. Although distrust in government is not the only causal factor, it is useful to look at levels of trust in other democracies for comparison.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has researched trust levels in 50 governments over 2019-23, which covers the years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The countries with the highest trust levels, expressed in percentage scores, are shown in the chart below:\n\nThey all have trust levels of 60% or above. Nine of these ten countries are in Europe. Four of them are Nordic states. All of them elect their governments by some system of proportional representation, including Ireland that uses a single transferable vote system.\n\nNow consider the levels of trust in government in three other highly developed democracies: France has 43%, the UK 40%, and the US 31%.\n\nPerhaps it is no coincidence that the ten countries with the highest trust in government have systems of proportional representation. By contrast, France, the UK and the US, which have much lower levels of trust in government, do not have proportional representation. France and the US are also systems where the elected presidents have substantial executive powers.\n\nIn UK constituencies the first-past-the-post electoral system creates a flip-flopping process of alternate periods of Tory and Labour government.\n\nIn France the presidential system has created movements from the right to the left and back. Although Emmanuel Macron is another centre ground politician, his main challenge in recent presidential electoral contests has been from the far right.\n\nIn the US, two parties \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 have been the only viable choices, not only for president, but for two houses of Congress, for more than a century. Since the 1960s, the system has become more polarised. Because of voting logjams in Congress, presidents have used executive orders and other powers to get things done.\n\nProportional systems also mean that coalitions are more likely. Coalitions do not please everyone, but they can reduce shifts to the extremes and encourage the search for consensus positions.\n\nBut research by political scientists on the effects of proportional representation versus other systems is in some respects inconclusive. And recent elections in places like Sweden, Austria and Germany show this system can help populist parties into power and prominence. So there is no perfect electoral solution, and there never has been.\n\nRead more: All British politicians should immediately distance themselves from the foreign interference of Elon Musk\n\nHow then can populist politics be countered? The control of the media by a few super-rich moguls must certainly been seen as factor, and legislation assuring greater competition should be prioritised if we are to have well-balanced democracies.\n\nAnd without restricting free expression, there must be measures to counteract fake news \u2013 fact-checkers are needed now more than ever.\n\nEconomic and political reasons for popular discontent must be tackled. Governments cannot continue to duck the problem of extreme inequalities of wealth and power. Tighter legislative controls on large corporations would encode their responsibilities to people and to the planet.\n\nSchools also need to prepare young people for their duties as citizens, to educate them in the dangers of dictatorship, and in the need to defend a vibrant, pluralist system of representative democracy, where we have duties to others and not simply to ourselves.\n\nWhat next?\n\nSo what will the next four years bring? As it was in his first term as president, Trump\u2019s focus will be maintaining his grip on power and lucratively serving himself and the billionaire elite around him. He has already indicated plans to cut welfare programmes including Medicaid, and has said that he will abandon policies to deal with the climate crisis, which will accelerate global warming.\n\nTrump has also announced that he will reduce the size of the federal state and has tasked Elon Musk with identifying areas to slash, promising mass job cuts. Unlike his first presidency in 2017-21, he is now facing less constraints on doing this.\n\nTrump is no economic liberal. His reckless tariff policy reflects this. He has threatened large tariffs of between 10% and 100% on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports into the US. These will be imposed by his government as taxes on imports. Companies will react by raising their prices, thus raising inflation in the US. He does not believe in free trade. Neither does he appreciate the potential inflationary and other adverse economic consequences of high tariffs and a global trade war.\n\nTalking of war, Trump has suggested that he will wind down or terminate support for Ukraine. He would placate Russia, unwary of the consequences of appeasing dictators. This raises the question of by how much is he being influenced by the Russians. The situation in the Middle East also remains volatile. There is no guarantee that Trump, having made several reckless foreign policy statements regarding Canada, Greenland, Panama and elsewhere, will be able to provide diplomatic solutions.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan to round up and deport millions of illegal immigrants will lead to further discord within the US itself. The US is already a deeply fractured country. These policies will greatly exacerbate internal divisions. Some US states will resist Trump by providing safe havens for immigrants.\n\nDespite the promise of so much turmoil, so far, the stock markets have not reacted adversely. In the short term, it is possible that tax cuts for billionaires and some other Trump measures will stimulate the financial markets. But this is unlikely to last long. Cuts in the federal government could create havoc. Internal battles could undermine political and economic confidence. A global trade war would contract the global economy, leaving the US adversely affected.\n\nThe rich may gain a lot, at least for a while, and until the adverse consequences develop in magnitude. But the poor and disadvantaged will suffer. Their plight will be blamed on immigrants and the resistance within the federal and state machines. The economic and political failings will be used to justify greater authoritarianism, including limitations on free speech. We live in very dangerous times.\n\nFor you: more from our Insights series:\n\nTo hear about new Insights articles, join the hundreds of thousands of people who value The Conversation\u2019s evidence-based news.
