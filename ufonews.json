        "article_content": "Taylor Community Library will host a talk by renowned UFO researcher and author Raymond Szymanski on Oct. 16. As an acclaimed expert in UFO investigations, Szymanski will share experiences with his deep dives into extraterrestrial phenomena, bolstered by his 40-year career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB).\n\nHis talk, \u201cNot \u2018Swamp Gas\u2019: The True Story of the 1966 Michigan UFOs,\u201d will offer Szymanski\u2019s perspective on one of the most significant UFO waves in American history\u2014the 1966 Dexter-Hillsdale sightings.\n\nSzymanski\u2019s journey into UFO research began at WPAFB, a base infamous for its alleged connection to extraterrestrial activity, including the 1947 Roswell incident.\n\n\u201cIn my first week there in 1973, as a co-op student, my mentor asked me, \u2018Have you heard about our aliens?\u2019 That\u2019s when I thought, \u2018Whoa, what kind of special place did I land in?\u2019\u201d Szymanski said. His initial exposure to rumors of alien connections at WPAFB sparked a lifelong passion for uncovering the truth.\n\nOver his four decades at WPAFB, Szymanski honed his investigative skills and built a network of colleagues that granted him rare access to information related to UFO activity.\n\n\u201cYou gain a lot of confidence over years of working, and the network gives you an instant pass,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the information I had gleaned while working there, I started doing some serious field research. I didn\u2019t care if I found evidence for or against it\u2014I just wanted to find the truth.\u201d\n\nThis meticulous, logical approach laid the foundation for his books, including \u201cFifty Shades of Greys,\u201d \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret Truth,\u201d and \u201cSwamp Gas My Ass.\u201d\n\nThe Dexter UFO Incident of 1966\n\nSzymanski\u2019s upcoming talk at Taylor Community Library will focus on the Dexter UFO sightings of March 20, 1966, an event that left an indelible mark on southeastern Michigan. UFO sightings surged across the region during this period, and the Dexter-Hillsdale incidents were among the most widely reported. Police officers, residents, and even military personnel filed official reports describing flying saucers with capabilities far beyond earthly technology.\n\nSzymanski will explore these events in detail, offering new insights based on his research for his book Swamp Gas My Ass. One of the critical elements of this investigation involves first-hand accounts from witnesses like Connie Bell, who encountered a UFO near Peach Mountain. Szymanski recorded her testimony, where she described seeing a craft with flashing red and white lights\u2014an encounter that has only been shared once publicly. Szymanski will share the audio testimony during his library talk.\n\nHe said the Dexter case was particularly significant because of the credibility of the witnesses.\n\n\u201cBefore the night was over, 12 police officers were running through the property, chasing these lights,\u201d Szymanski said, adding that in a different sighting that night, a patrolman observed an object hovering over his car for 10 to 15 minutes, joined by three other objects before they all disappeared together. The consistency of these accounts adds weight to the mystery, and Szymanski aims to shed light on how authorities systematically minimized such reports at the time.\n\nWright-Patterson\u2019s alien lore\n\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base has long been rumored to be a focal point for alien research, particularly in connection with the 1947 Roswell crash.\n\n\u201cAliens who supposedly crashed near Roswell, along with their ship, have been said to be stored in a Wright-Patt hangar,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cOver the years, stories about secret projects like Project Blue Book, a government investigation into UFO sightings, have fueled speculation that WPAFB harbors the remains of extraterrestrial craft and even bodies.\u201d\n\nSzymanski\u2019s experience at WPAFB allowed him to conduct direct field research to investigate the truth behind these rumors.\n\nHe said the recent shift in governmental attitudes toward UFOs, marked by the June 2021 release of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s UAP report, has further validated his decades of research. Szymanski views this document as one of the most important developments in UFO history.\n\n\u201cIt confirmed three key things: these are real physical objects, they present a flight hazard, and they are potentially a national security issue,\u201d he said.\n\nA future of ongoing exploration\n\nAs UFO sightings continue to rise globally and the possibility of extraterrestrial life becomes more accepted, Szymanski remains at the forefront of UFO research. The UFO phenomenon, once relegated to the fringes of science, is now gaining mainstream recognition, with individuals from all walks of life eager to share their experiences.\n\n\u201cPeople want to tell their stories,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the stigma of reporting sightings lessens, non-stop, people are coming forward more and more, saying, \u2018I know I\u2019m not crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn addition to his UFO investigations, Szymanski is also working on other projects, including a book on metal detecting and possibly publishing hundreds of stories shared by everyday citizens about their UFO encounters. His presentation at Taylor Public Library offers a rare opportunity to hear directly from one of the most knowledgeable experts on UFO activity in the United States.\n\nEvent details\n\nRaymond Szymanski\u2019s presentation, titled Not Swamp Gas: The True Story of the 1966 Michigan UFOs, will take place on Oct.16 at 6 p.m. at the Taylor Community Library, located at 12303 Pardee Rd, Taylor. The event is free, but registration is required. Szymanski will also hold a book signing after the talk, offering autographed copies of his Alien Shades of Greys trilogy.

        "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAI-generated images are more impressive than ever, with some even winning photography awards and fooling experts in the process. The best part? You don\u2019t need to be a professional artist or have any technical skills to create them. But not all AI image generators are created equal \u2014 some excel at realism, while others are riddled with easy-to-spot errors. One thing is for sure: very few can generate text reliably. To find the best one then, I pushed each AI image generator with successively challenging prompts. Here are my findings.\n\nWhich is the best AI image generator?\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nFinding the best AI image generator is difficult since the results can vary wildly from one prompt to another. However, we know that generative AI tech tends to struggle in certain areas more than others so we can tailor our prompts to highlight these weaknesses and see where each one shines \u2014 or fails. Virtually all image generators can handle simpler art styles so I\u2019ll limit testing to realistic scenes this time.\n\nIf you ever need to stress test an AI image generator, try asking for images with intricate details like hands, hair, or text. Only a handful of them can handle these well, with others often producing distorted or unrealistic results. Another good test is complex scenes with multiple subjects or unusual perspectives, which tend to trip up even the best models.\n\nWith that in mind, I decided to test a handful of different AI image generators. Specifically, I picked Google\u2019s Imagen 3, Meta\u2019s Imagine, DALL-E 3 via Microsoft Designer and ChatGPT, and Grok. And for my first prompt, I asked for an image of a person crying. This request may seem too surface, but the result variance was fascinating.\n\nPrompt 1: A person crying, with tears streaming down their face\n\nMicrosoft Designer / DALL-E 3 Meta Imagine Google Imagen 3 ChatGPT / DALL-E 3 Grok\n\nAs you can already tell, images from different AI models look nothing alike. While part of this is because my prompt was rather vague, every image generator I tested was also trained on a different dataset. Meta used public images from Facebook and Instagram, for example, while it\u2019s less clear how most other companies obtained their training datasets.\n\nReplicating anatomy has always been tricky for AI image generators and these results only proves that fact. Google\u2019s Imagen 3 produced an extremely convincing result, with others like Meta\u2019s Imagine generated . I retested this prompt with minor variations to improve the sample size but Imagen 3 did win every single time.\n\nMicrosoft Designer uses OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 under the hood, meaning it should produce similar results as ChatGPT. And that proved to be true in my testing, with both services delivering decent results.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3, followed by DALL-E 3\n\nPrompt 2: An action-packed scene of two dancers mid-performance in a rain-soaked street\u2026\n\nMeta Imagine Google Imagen 3 Microsoft Designer Grok ChatGPT / DALL-E 3\n\nI increased the complexity and detail of my prompt this time, while keeping human subjects in the frame. Imagen 3 yielded an excellent result once again, only faltering with one subject\u2019s fingers. On the other hand, Meta\u2019s Imagine botched one dancer\u2019s limbs and face entirely and I would consider the result unusable.\n\nMicrosoft Designer offered cartoon-style results, which looked passable but wasn\u2019t what I was looking for. ChatGPT\u2019s attempt was much worse, with an extra limb sprouting out of one dancer. Thankfully, Grok swung the pendulum back with a reasonable result besides the dancers\u2019 interlocked fingers.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3 / Grok\n\nPrompt 3: Generate an image of an Airbus A380\u2026taxiing down a runaway with tropical trees in the background.\n\nMicrosoft Designer Google Imagen 3 Meta Imagine Grok ChatGPT / DALL-E 3\n\nI may sound like a broken record at this point but Imagen 3 continues to decimate the competition. Even though this prompt requires the AI to generate text on the fuselage, Google\u2019s model handled it with ease. The airline\u2019s name is replicated perfectly and aside from the odd runway taxiway markings, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell that the image has been AI generated.\n\nGrok delivered a similarly impressive result, although not on the first try, and still garbled some windows on the plane\u2019s upper deck. The chatbot uses a relatively new image generator called Flux, created by the researchers who developed Stable Diffusion. Given the latter\u2019s reputation in the image generator space, it\u2019s no surprise that Grok can produce excellent results.\n\nUnfortunately, the other AI image generators delivered sub-par to comically bad results here. Meta\u2019s Imagine spit out garbled text and the wrong plane. DALL-E 3 via ChatGPT almost nailed the text on the side of the plane but generated malformed runway markings. Microsoft Designer uses the same DALL-E 3 model but somehow delivered even worse-looking unrealistic images.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that adding terms like \u201cphotorealistic\u201d or \u201cHD\u201d did little to make the AI-generated results any more authentic-looking or lifelike. The impact was minimal at best, even though it\u2019s standard practice to include these terms as part of good prompting.\n\nWinner: Imagen 3, followed by Grok\n\nPrompt 4: Famous personalities\n\nGrok Grok\n\nA lot has been said about the dark side of AI image generators and their ability to sway public opinion through false narratives. To combat this problem, most generative AI platforms now have guardrails preventing you from requesting images that mimic a specific person.\n\nUnsurprisingly then, my prompt was turned down by every single AI image generator \u2013 except Grok. Elon Musk created Grok as a maximum \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI, which is just marketing speak for a chatbot with fewer guardrails than its competitors. This lack of restrictions extends to AI-generated images, as well, which means you could technically generate images of world leaders, celebrities, and even Musk himself in questionable settings.\n\nWinner: Grok by default\n\nWhich AI image generator do I recommend?\n\nMany of the AI image generators I tested have unique strengths that make them better than the rest, so here\u2019s my top pick depending on my priorities. Quality : Google\u2019s Imagen 3 may not have the most recognizable brand name of all the AI image generators on this list, but it stands out for delivering realistic images and extremely believable results. The only downside is that you only get one image at a time and the AI processing can take several seconds each time you send in a prompt.\n\n: Google\u2019s Imagen 3 may not have the most recognizable brand name of all the AI image generators on this list, but it stands out for delivering realistic images and extremely believable results.

The tool generates an image within a second of typing in a prompt, which feels almost instantaneous compared to other offerings on this list.\n\n: Meta Imagine stands out if you need a quick image since you don\u2019t even need to hit the Enter key to see a result.

Cost : With so many AI image generators available today, is paying for one even worth it? Doing so will unlock some nice features, since AI image editing is typically locked behind subscription services like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and DALL-E 3. For simple AI image generation, though, I\u2019d recommend Imagen 3, Meta Imagine, and Microsoft Designer.\n\n: With so many AI image generators available today, is paying for one even worth it?

Censorship: Grok offers one of the easiest AI image generators with some of the least restrictions, so it\u2019s worth a try. The only downside is that you\u2019ll need an X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) subscription to use the service. From a practical standpoint, though, the best AI image generator may very well be the one already on your device. For example, Meta AI is already integrated within WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. If you already use either app, Meta Imagine should serve you for basic image generation needs.\n\nLikewise, the Pixel 9 series ships with Google\u2019s new Pixel Studio app powered by Imagen 3. Alternatively, you can also request AI-generated images via the Gemini app on any Android device. The latter still uses the last-gen Imagen 2 for now, but it will move up to Google\u2019s latest model soon.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

Today it serves as a hub for the Maritime Museum of San Diego, housing offices, a research library and more. Multiple former passengers are believed to haunt the boat today, one of whom is miner John Norbom, who died in an onboard explosion in 1911. There have been reports of the bathroom stalls, where the explosion took place, locking themselves, and some visitors claim to have seen a ghostly figure dressed in a fedora and coat looming around the ship. Earthquake victims and others who were injured in the explosion are believed to roam the boat, evidenced by reports of mysterious slamming doors and disappearing objects. 1492 N. Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nCosmopolitan Hotel and restaurant\n\nOriginally designed as a home for cattle rancher Don Juan Bandini, the Cosmopolitan Hotel is said to have seen a few friendly apparitions. When Bandini\u2019s youngest daughter, Ysidora, leaned too far over the home\u2019s second-floor balcony railing and fell, it\u2019s believed that she was saved by Colonel Cave Johnson Couts, who caught her below. The two supposedly married soon after, but Ysidora\u2019s ghost is said to linger in room 11 of the hotel, where she once lived. There have also been sightings of an apparition of a cat roaming the hallways. Both are reported to be playful and friendly. 2660 Calhoun St., San Diego\n\nDavis-Horton House\n\nFormerly known as the William Heath Davis house, the Davis-Horton house was built in 1850, making it the oldest surviving structure in San Diego. It was once used as a makeshift hospital and much of its paranormal presence has been attributed to the fact that many died in the building. Among the numerous ghosts that have been spotted at the residence are a mysterious Victorian woman and a man wearing a World War II uniform. The home is on the National Registry of Historic Places and currently serves as the office for the Gaslamp Quarter Historical Foundation as well as the Gaslamp Museum. Tours are offered weekly. 410 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nDel Mar Fairgrounds\n\nRumors of paranormal activity at the fairgrounds have been circulating among employees for years. From magically moving furniture to strange sounds at night, many employees have reported supernatural experiences with the spirits of the fairgrounds. Former fairgrounds spokeswoman Linda Zweig decided to call on South Coast Paranormal to investigate in early 2011. The team uncovered what they believed to be \u201cvoices from the disembodied\u201d and spent five nights awake on the supposedly haunted fifth floor of the grandstand to investigate. 2260 Jimmy Durante Blvd., Del Mar\n\nEl Campo Santo Cemetery\n\nA few blocks from the Whaley House in Old Town San Diego, the El Campo Santo Cemetery has been continuously studied by paranormal experts due to the volume of supernatural reports from the area. When the city was becoming overcrowded in the 19th century, graves were relocated and many were paved over to make way for a road, disrespecting the spirits at rest below. Most paranormal reports from the cemetery include ghosts roaming the grounds, many dressed in period appropriate clothing, as well as car alarms going off and vehicles not starting when parked in front of the graveyard. 2410 San Diego Ave., San Diego\n\nElfin Forest\n\nThe Elfin Forest is home to a number of ghost stories, from the vengeful white witch who is believed to be searching for the murderer of her son and husband, to the 10-foot owl that hovers around the area. Nicole Strickland from the San Diego Paranormal Research Society said that many have reported feeling a sense of doom when passing through the area in the dark. 8833 Harmony Grove Road, Escondido\n\nHorton Grand Hotel\n\nRoom 309 of the Horton Grand Hotel has a haunting history. The room was once occupied by notorious gambler Roger Whitaker, known in the mid-1800s for his drinking and cheating habits. One night, his debts caught up with him when he was shot dead by creditors while hiding in the room\u2019s armoire. Today, the room has been reported as a site for paranormal activity, which many believe is caused by Whitaker\u2019s ghost. A female spirit belonging to Ida Bailey is also said to be present at the hotel. Bailey was the owner of a brothel that once operated right where the hotel was built, and has been reported to haunt the spot in the form of white mist or a cold chill. 311 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nHotel del Coronado\n\nThe ghost of 24-year-old \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d Kate Morgan is believed to haunt this lavish hotel. Morgan checked into the hotel on Thanksgiving Day in 1892. Five days later, she was reported to have been found dead, dressed in black with a lace shawl over her head and a gunshot wound in her right temple. Police found no sure way to identify her immediately, so Morgan was referred to as \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d by many news outlets. Today, she is said to be the hotel\u2019s resident ghost, playful but harmless. Guests and staff have reported flickering lights, electricity issues and various other oddities in the room that Morgan stayed in, and paranormal experts have been able to document this activity using infrared cameras, radiation sensors and sound detectors. 1500 Orange Ave., Coronado\n\nHunter Steakhouse\n\nPerched on a hill above the Buena Vista Lagoon, Hunter Steakhouse was built atop the old Buena Vista cemetery which is believed to have held around 50 bodies. In 1970, some of those bodies were moved to a different cemetery to allow for commercial developments, and it is said that the developer covered up bodily remains to speed up construction. Customers of the steakhouse have reported experiencing power surges, cold spots and a ghostly figure lingering near the stairs of the bar. 1221 Vista Way, Oceanside\n\nJulian Pioneer Cemetery\n\nMany Gold Rush-era ore miners were put to rest in the Julian Pioneer Cemetery in the 1870s. The cemetery was declared a California historical landmark in 1948, and has drawn paranormal experts for decades due to reports of ghostly men in 19th-century mining clothes as well as an eerie woman in a nightgown. 2811 Washington St., Julian\n\nLake Morena\n\nNamed one of \u201cthe most haunted campgrounds in the U.S.\u201d by Outside Magazine, Lake Morena is said to have supernatural energy. A San Diego Union article from 1983 titled \u201cMore than Fish Haunt Morena\u201d recounts the horrifying stories of those who had experienced strange happenings at the park, from the sound of thundering footsteps to haunting men appearing to walk on air. Today the spooky encounters have continued, with campers hearing screaming and feeling an omnipotent presence. 2550 Lake Morena Drive, Campo\n\nMt. Woodson Castle\n\nThis 27-room, 12,000-square-foot castle is believed by some to be occupied by the ghost of former owner and designer of the home Amy Strong. The castle was completed in 1921 and was listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1978. Supposedly, the sound of Strong sewing on her machine fills the night, despite the fact that she died in 1950. Some say that a worker who lost his finger while working on the home can also be heard scratching the rocks outside trying to recover the finger. While the chief financial officer of Personal Touch Dining, which now manages the castle, claims she has never seen a ghost on-site, others aren\u2019t so convinced. Speculation surrounds the Zodiac room that Strong built in the home and her increasing interest in the spiritual realm in her older days. 16302 N. Woodson Drive, Ramona\n\nOld Point Loma lighthouse\n\nOver 150 years old, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse is a beacon for ghostly encounters. Visitors have reported hearing heavy footsteps, moaning and labored breathing while exploring the space in addition to sporadic cold spots. Some believe that the spirit of former Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who landed at San Diego Bay in 1542, occupies the space. Others believe that it is the spirit of Captain Robert Decatur Israel, the lighthouse\u2019s final lightkeeper, who remains to protect his precious lighthouse. The lighthouse was shut down in 1891 and now remains part of the Cabrillo National Monument. 1800 Cabrillo Memorial Drive\n\nProctor Valley\n\nStories of the gigantic hairy beast from the Proctor Valley area date back to more than a century ago, with stories of disembodied limbs frightening some and enticing others to go out monster hunting. The monster has become a sort of legend for the community, with a local playwright penning a musical comedy show titled \u201cThe Return of the Proctor Valley Monster\u201d which has been performed locally many times. The Bonita Museum keeps a footprint on display that is believed to belong to the Proctor Valley monster. Some blame the Proctor Valley\u2019s missing cattle on the monster, while others simply chuckle at the mention of it. Proctor Valley Rd., Chula Vista\n\nRancho Buena Vista Abobe\n\nThe Rancho Buena Vista Adobe was built in 1846 and is filled with historical artifacts and architecture. Over the years it has changed ownership several times. The city of Vista purchased the property in 1989 and now operates it as a historical museum. Experts believe the Adobe to serve as a portal to connect the living and spirit worlds, thankfully one that is believed to only accept peaceful ghosts. 640 Alta Vista Drive, Vista\n\nSan Diego Bay\n\nThere have been reports of San Diego\u2019s very own sea monster lurking in the bay since 1873. The initial sighting was reported by Captain George Charlesworth, who reported a 30-foot \u201cserpent-fish\u201d that he claims drew itself out of the water and onto the sand. Charlesworth\u2019s sighting led to an Academy of Sciences meeting and several expeditions in an attempt to sight the monster, but to no avail. All that was left were markings in the mud where the creature was believed to have slithered away.\n\nStar of India\n\nThe Star of India tall ship is the world\u2019s oldest active sailing ship, having been on the sea since 1863 and making a total of 21 voyages around the world before its retirement. The ship is believed to be haunted by the spirits of those who died aboard, including young stowaway John Campbell, who died falling 100 feet from the rigging, and Army Capt. McBarnet who slit his own throat and ultimately bled to death. All sorts of paranormal activity have been reported since. The ship is part of the Maritime Museum of San Diego and is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. 1492 N Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nUSS Midway Museum\n\nThis decommissioned Navy aircraft carrier-turned-museum is said to be home to a number of ghosts. Back when the ship was still in service, many crew members believed there to be a crew of ghosts living among them, and to this day, visitors and staff have reported ghostly sightings all around the ship. The museum\u2019s curator and leader of San Diego\u2019s largest paranormal group, David Hanson, has deemed the ship as \u201cparanormally active\u201d rather than \u201chaunted\u201d due to the negative connotation that the latter holds. He believes that the crew members that linger on Midway have returned out of love for the ship and are not to be feared. 910 N Harbor Drive, San Diego midway.org\n\nVilla Montezuma Museum\n\nThis Sherman Heights mansion was named a historical site by the city of San Diego in 1970 due to its Victorian style architecture. Built in 1887, the mansion is believed to be haunted by former resident Jesse Shepard. Shepard was a writer, musician and spiritualist who only resided in Villa Montezuma for a few years, despite having the mansion specially built to include music rooms and hidden doorways. The story goes that Shepard used to host seances in the home, claiming to have communicated with the spirits of Mozart and Beethoven. He is believed to have died on a piano bench, eerily right as he finished playing a song. Witnesses say a bright and enchanting energy has been left in his wake. Today, tours of the mansion museum are available Fridays through Sundays. Chair of the friends of the Villa Montezuma Louis Torio describes the mansion as \u201cmagical\u201d and radiating a \u201cpositive energy.\u201d 1925 K St., San Diego\n\nWhaley House\n\nBuilt atop San Diego\u2019s old execution grounds, the Whaley House in Old Town was once home to an unlucky family of five. Despite being aware of the land\u2019s dark history, entrepreneur Thomas Whaley decided to proceed with the construction of his family\u2019s home in 1857, and even placed a large arch in the parlor room of the home to mark the exact spot where former Yankee thief Jim Robinson experienced a drawn out and grueling execution. The Whaley family experienced a total of five deaths during their time living in the home, including several children and Thomas\u2019 wife, Anna. The home has been said to be haunted by their spirits ever since. The home was deemed \u201cthe most haunted house in America\u201d by Life magazine. Today, the home is open to the public for self-guided daytime tours or haunted night tours. A tour guide at the home reported that a doll in the nursery room of the home is known to shift positions at night when the museum closes for the day. 2476 San Diego Ave., San Diego."

There is an energy that recalls past lives lived inside their walls, permeating every creaking floorboard.\n\nAuthor and paranormal investigator Katie Hopkins will share her experiences and explorations into realms beyond the ordinary \u2013 including haunting occurrences at the Russell House, in special fundraising events Oct. 19.\n\n\u201cParanormal 101 Presentation and Book Signing\u201d is at 5 p.m. at the historic Snowden House, 306 Washington St., hosted by Friends of the Grout\u2019s Historic Houses. Hopkins will discuss history of the paranormal, why research is important to paranormal investigators and various types of investigation methods.\n\nHopkins, of Cedar Rapids, will also sign copies of her books, \u201cSeeing Spirits: Opening the Empathic Door\u201d and \u201cIowa Haunted Corridor.\u201d Copies will be available to purchase for $15.\n\nFollowing the presentation, guests will venture into shadowy corridors and spaces where spirits may linger in grand 1861 Rensselaer Russell House Museum, 520 W. Third St., and the historic Victorian-era Snowden House. Both homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hopkins and her husband Josh and Lollman Paranormal will lead the paranormal investigation at both houses using the latest paranormal investigation equipment.\n\nBoth events are fundraisers for the Friends of the Grout Historic Houses, benefiting the Russell House Museum and Snowden House. Pre-registration is required for both events. The presentation and book signing are $15 for members; $20 for non-members. The investigation is $50 for members; $55 for non-members. To register visit www.gmdistrict.org/calendar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for different ways to raise money to support preservation of our two houses. We thought something like this might attract a different and perhaps a younger audience,\u201d said Hawkeye Community College instructor Marcea Seible. She also serves on the Friends board.\n\n\u201cWe would love to sell out. We\u2019re hopeful that it will be a popular event, and we can do something similar in the coming years,\u201d Seible explained.\n\nHopkins was 10 when she saw her first spirit in the basement of a friend\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThat was the focus of my first book. I \u2018ve always been interested in the paranormal and supernatural. My first interest was in history \u2013 that\u2019s what drew me into the paranormal, too, exploring really cool historical places where ghost hunters get to go into,\u201d she said.\n\nShe earned a history degree at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls and a master\u2019s degree in higher education from Kaplan University. She worked as an intern at the Grout in 2008 and returned in 2012 as a museum assistant, which included managing the Rensselaer Russell House Museum.\n\nWhether or not the Rensselaer Russell House is haunted, it has had its share of tragedy and loss. In 1862, 5-year-old Genevieve Russell fell into a well on a neighboring property and drowned. Her funeral wake took place in the Russell home. Once, while in the master bedroom looking at a photograph of Genevieve, Hopkins felt a small hand grab her leg. She\u2019s convinced she was touched by the child\u2019s spirit.\n\n\u201cI was in the Russell House alone eight hours a day. I\u2019d see things move and hear things \u2013 footsteps on the stairs or glassware sitting on the dining table rattle, or find the photo of Genevieve moved, when I was the only one there,\u201d Hopkins recalled.\n\nOn one occasion, she closed the museum, and the next morning found every drawer and cabinet door open, although the house was still locked up tight. Hopkins once heard the doorbell signal someone entering and searched the house to find no one else there. Other people recount seeing a girl in an upper window of the house, and a light at night when the museum is closed.\n\nIn 2012, with Hopkins\u2019 encouragement, the Grout board allowed the Calhoun County Paranormal Investigators to set up video and recording equipment and electromagnetic field detectors and stayed overnight in the house.\n\n\u201cI really made a connection with that house and the spirits in it. I\u2019m so excited to be back to do these fundraisers,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many historical houses and buildings fall into disrepair. People lived in these houses and experienced love, loss and tragedy. These are so much more than just old buildings.\u201d\n\nThe need for funds is serious and ongoing, said Seible.\n\n\u201cAll money goes directly to upkeep and maintenance at the houses. Both houses need work, the Russell house, in particular. It really needs foundation work \u2013 limestone is crumbling in some places, so that\u2019s the most pressing issue.\u201d\n\nClose Nicholas Erickson, artifacts registrar at Grout Museum District, looks over the telegram sent to Henry Grout informing him his brother, Warren, had been shot and killed in Tombstone, Ariz., in 1883.

The more you come back to it, the more details you'll spot.\n\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.\n\nWriter/director/star Alice Lowe follows 2016\u2019s Prevenge with another bold, challenging, and pleasingly bonkers comedy. This one is a 'reincarnation rom-com' in which her character Agnes repeatedly falls for the same bloke, Alex (Aneurin Barnard), over the centuries.\n\nThe kicker is that he\u2019s shallow and uninterested in her, but she won\u2019t take no for an answer, whether they\u2019re in Victorian England or '80s New York. Each time, she suffers an untimely demise, before the same characters are reincarnated with her around a century later.\n\nNick Frost is George, an abusive husband in one era, a stalker in another. Jacob Anderson\u2019s Scipio is a servant, a pop star\u2019s manager, and more. And Tanya Reynolds plays Meg, the most sympathetic recurring character, who\u2019s in love with her self-centred, deluded friend Agnes (who mistakenly thinks she\u2019s the smarter of the pair).\n\nTimestalker has something to say about romantic obsession: like a teenager, Agnes is slow to learn from her mistake of idolizing an unsuitable pretty boy. It\u2019s also a neat switch on gender norms in Hollywood comedies past, to which Lowe has fun paying tribute: the '80s will be familiar to fans of everything from Working Girl to Back to the Future.\n\nBut there is nothing Hollywood about Timestalker, filmed in Wales, full of British talent, and peppered with Lowe\u2019s bawdy humour. While not all of the jokes will land universally, some of the sharpest refer to Agnes\u2019 sex drive, whether in reference to Victorian dildos or to a put-down that\u2019s hopefully firmly consigned to history: \"Keep your knickers on!\"\n\nTimestalker is released in UK cinemas on October 11.\n\nFor more, check out our guide to upcoming movies."

Ambros and Ruvkun first discovered microRNA and its potential role in gene regulation in 1993 while studying the development of the teensy roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, a creature commonly studied by biologists.\n\nSince then, the two collaborators and other scientists have shown that microRNAs are a key feature of the genomes of all multicellular organisms , including humans.\n\nRelated: Scientists just discovered a new way cells control their genes \u2014 it's called 'backtracking'\n\nThanks to their discovery, \"researchers will have a much better understanding of how cells work,\" Olle K\u00e4mpe , the vice chair of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, said at a press conference Monday (Oct. 7) .\n\nCurrently, there are no medical applications for this work, but there may well be in the future, K\u00e4mpe said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFor instance, microRNAs may sometimes contribute to the development of cancer by regulating gene activity in ways that encourage the growth and spread of tumors . Some diseases stem from mutations in genes that code for microRNAs, such as congenital hearing loss and some eye and skeletal disorders . In addition, dysregulated microRNA activity has been found to be associated with the development of epilepsy .\n\n\"We don't yet have any way to treat these disorders where microRNA networks are perturbed, but we hope that someday that will come,\" K\u00e4mpe said.\n\nEvery cell in our bodies contains the same 20,000 genes or so that encode instructions to build proteins , the basic building blocks of life. However, different types of cells, such as muscle or nerve cells, have specialized characteristics and functions, so they require different supplies. Thus, to build the necessary proteins, distinct sets of genes are activated in each type of cell . This happens both during embryonic development and throughout an individual's lifetime, as cells take cues from within the body and the surrounding environment.\n\nWhen a gene gets \"activated\" \u2014 meaning the cell is going to utilize its code \u2014 the DNA within that gene is first converted into small molecules called messenger RNAs, or mRNAs, via a process known as transcription . These molecules are later delivered to protein-construction sites in the cell, where they're used as templates to make proteins.\n\nFor a long time, scientists thought that gene activity was mainly regulated by specialized proteins that latch onto DNA, called transcription factors. These proteins had been discovered in the 1960s . Ambros and Ruvkun's discovery of microRNAs decades later turned this long-held assumption on its head.\n\nIn a series of lab experiments in C. elegans, the duo identified a microRNA that they dubbed lin-4. This molecule can bind to mRNA, preventing the production of its corresponding protein. In 2000 , the scientists discovered another type of microRNA, called let-7, that appeared to be found throughout the animal kingdom.\n\nFlash forward two decades and scientists have now discovered a wide array of microRNAs, including more than a thousand in the human body. These molecules are now lauded as essential governors of cell development and function.\n\n\"I am delighted to hear that Dr Ambros and Dr Ruvkun have jointly been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2024,\" Janosch Heller , an assistant professor in biomedical sciences at Dublin City University, said in a statement shared by the U.K. Science Media Centre. \"Their pioneering work into gene regulation by microRNAs paved the way for groundbreaking research into novel therapies for devastating diseases such as epilepsy but also opened our eyes to the wonderful machinery that is tightly controlling what is happening in our cells.\""

        "article_content": "Listen to this story\n\nWith tools like Cursor, Claude, and ChatGPT canvas are on the boom, allowing users to build software using natural language, it feels highly reminiscent of the times when LC/NC platforms also lowered the barrier to entry for app development and made it easier for companies to teach their developers the existing solutions within the companies.\n\nThe community is now questioning the relevance of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms in the AI era. How do these platforms continue to stay relevant in a landscape dominated by artificial intelligence?\n\nWhile these tools were a great choice for prototyping an idea or starting a project, LC/NC platforms are a nightmare when considering scaling a project, which seems to be the same for modern AI coding tools. Not much has changed.\n\nAmidst the challenges and shift towards AI coding tools, is there still a role for low-code, no-code platforms, like Bubble and Webflow, in today\u2019s landscape, and are they able to coexist with emerging AI solutions?\n\nAccording to a Reddit user, even when he got help from AI to write a custom function for the no-code platform, it failed terribly. Two days later, he started writing the code himself and it worked out pretty well.\n\n\u201cWhen building an app you want to own with popular low-code/no-code platforms, even if they mention that you legally own an IP to your app, what meaning does it hold if you cannot run it on-premise?\u201d Andreas M\u00f8ller, the co-founder of toddle, told AIM. This seems to be a common reason why the adoption of low-code no-code platforms took some time.\n\nWe witness the same with AI tools, given the hallucinations and other privacy issues. But in certain cases, they are able to do the job a lot quicker than any no-code platforms that ever existed.\n\nFor example, Meghana Jagadeesh, the founder & CEO of GoCodeo, mentioned at Cypher 2024 that LC/NC tools will still be relevant and will grow in the future, but with an AI twist in them.\n\n\u201cWhen AI capabilities are added to LC/NC platforms, it gets easier for non-tech guys to build specific functions. These tools are a great choice to get started before scaling it for a large user base,\u201d she said, suggesting that we should not confuse LC/NC tools with traditional development as they cater to different user needs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have Git, a version-controlling system, I\u2019m obviously not going to build a big project on your platform. That is a deal breaker for every developer,\u201d said M\u00f8ller while explaining why it is necessary for every developer to have a version-control system to build a SaaS application.\n\nDue to these issues, we saw companies like Klarna drop solutions built on top of LC/NC platforms and create in-house solutions using AI for better scalability and profit.\n\nThis is the reason we are seeing tools like toddle and Apptile, which are a little different from the traditional LC/NC platforms. Samyam Annappa, founder and CTO at Apptile, told AIM that coding typically makes up less than 25% of the total project cost. Most of the time goes into setting up the infrastructure\u2014analytics pipelines, payment gateways, notifications, device testing, and managing both iOS and Android versions.\n\n\u201cThat is where tools like Apptile simplify this by taking care of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Additionally, our architecture supports real-time content updates, unlike tools like Cursor, which necessitate code changes, App Store reviews, and App Store rejection handling for content updates,\u201d he added, further suggesting that to stay relevant in the AI era, LC/NC platforms must overcome traditional issues and offer streamlined solutions.\n\nSimilarly to Apptile, tools like toddle, which is not entirely an LC/NC platform but something in between LC/NC and traditional platforms, allows users to build specific functions and host your infrastructure, and has plans to go open source by the end of 2025, so you can actually own your software.\n\nWill LLMs replace LC/NC Platforms?\n\nLC/NC platforms have to adapt to the changes all developers are going through \u2013 the AI change. Jinen Dedhia, the founder of DronaHQ mentioned on HackerNews that he also believes that LLMs can remove the need for LC/NC platforms and the only way to stay relevant is to tightly integrate AI capabilities to LC/NC platforms.\n\n\u201cBut I do see the merit in this thinking that LLMs can eat LCNC platforms for breakfast. However, I am excited to see how with time near perfect applications can be churned out with about 80-90% work done and engineers can figure the last few miles and reach the finish line but 50x faster,\u201d he added further.\n\nIn fact, the LC/NC platforms produce very well-structured code behind the scenes and they can train LLMs to build apps following their well defined structure, which means their apps can still take advantage of the LLMs but will have less bugs than just letting the LLMs produce a stand-alone app.\n\nWhile LC/NC platforms may provide a simplified interface for creating applications, they do not eliminate the need for a foundational understanding of programming concepts, same as the AI tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot.\n\nOf course, the LLMs can produce more versatile apps than LC/NC platforms but considering LLMs as a competitor to LC/NC platforms might not be a correct idea."

These firms invest millions into innovative startups each year that have led many young companies on a path towards success.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about money; Silicon Valley has developed an infrastructure that facilitates growth and success for startups like no other place can provide. The region boasts a pool of skilled and experienced professionals in areas such as software development, marketing, finance, and more. This makes it easier for startups to find the right talent who can help turn their ideas into reality.\n\nFurthermore, the culture of risk-taking and failure is deeply ingrained in Silicon Valley\u2019s startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to take calculated risks, learn from their mistakes and keep pushing forward. This mindset fosters a supportive environment that celebrates failure as a learning experience rather than a setback.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s reputation for being at the forefront of innovation and its thriving startup culture make it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs looking to make their mark on the world. The area offers unparalleled access to resources, funding opportunities, networking events, and a community of like-minded individuals all united by one goal: to change the world through technology.\n\nThe origins of the startup culture in Silicon Valley\n\nThe origins of the startup culture in Silicon Valley can be traced back to the 1950s, when the area was primarily known as the \u201cValley of Hearts Delight\u201d due to its vast orchards and farms. However, with the arrival of large technology companies such as Hewlett-Packard and IBM in the 1960s, this region began its transformation into a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nOne of the key factors that contributed to the growth of the startup culture in Silicon Valley was the presence of top-tier universities such as Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. These institutions not only attracted highly skilled individuals but also fostered a culture of experimentation and interdisciplinary collaboration. Graduates from these universities often stayed in Silicon Valley, bringing their fresh ideas and knowledge to fuel new startups.\n\nAnother crucial element in shaping Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture was the formation of Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. This company not only produced groundbreaking technological advancements but also laid down a foundation for future entrepreneurs by allowing employees to have stock options \u2013 an innovative approach at that time. This practice became known as \u201cFairchildism\u201d and encouraged employees to take risks and pursue entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nIn addition to these internal factors, external events like World War II played a significant role in shaping Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture. The war effort focused on developing advanced technologies opened up opportunities for research and development which later led to spin-off companies such as Varian Associates.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until 1971 when Intel Corporation introduced its first microprocessor that Silicon Valley truly catapulted onto the global stage as an epicenter for innovation.

It is no wonder that it continues to attract ambitious individuals and aspiring entrepreneurs from all over the world who dream of making it big in this dynamic ecosystem.\n\nHow the startup culture is evolving in Silicon Valley: diversity and inclusivity\n\nThe startup culture in Silicon Valley is constantly evolving, and one of the most notable changes in recent years has been a focus on diversity and inclusivity. With its reputation as the hub of innovation and technology, Silicon Valley has long been seen as a predominantly white and male-dominated industry. However, there has been a concerted effort to shift this narrative and create a more diverse and inclusive startup community.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this change is the recognition that diversity brings new perspectives and ideas to the table, ultimately leading to better products and services. Many startups have also recognized that having a diverse team can attract a wider customer base and open up new markets. As such, inclusivity is not just about creating a more equitable workplace; it\u2019s also good business sense.\n\nTo promote diversity in startups, many companies are implementing policies such as blind recruitment processes where names, gender, or other identifying details are removed from job applications. This helps to combat unconscious bias and ensure that candidates are selected based on their qualifications rather than personal characteristics.\n\nIn addition to hiring practices, many startups are also focused on creating an inclusive work environment by fostering a culture of belonging. This involves actively promoting an atmosphere where everyone feels valued regardless of their race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or ability. Companies are investing in programs such as implicit bias training for employees at all levels to help them recognize their own biases and create an inclusive workplace.\n\nAnother important aspect of improving diversity in Silicon Valley is representation in leadership positions. Startups are now making efforts towards increasing representation amongst executives with initiatives like diversity quotas for board seats or investing in leadership development programs targeted towards underrepresented groups.\n\nFurthermore, there has been increased investment in resources for underrepresented communities within the startup ecosystem. Programs such as mentorship opportunities for minority entrepreneurs or incubators specifically aimed at supporting women-led businesses have emerged with backing from influential investors.\n\nWhile there is still progress to be made, the startup culture in Silicon Valley is evolving towards a more diverse and inclusive community. With efforts being made to foster an environment of belonging, combat biases, increase representation, and provide resources for underrepresented groups, Silicon Valley is setting an example for other industries to follow suit. As diversity and inclusivity continue to be prioritized in startups, we can expect to see more innovative ideas and successful businesses thriving in this world-renowned hub of entrepreneurship.\n\nChallenges facing the startup culture in Silicon Valley\n\nThe startup culture in Silicon Valley is widely known for its innovative and fast-paced nature, making it a hub for entrepreneurs and investors alike. However, with great opportunities also come numerous challenges that startups in this region face. In this section, we will delve into some of the main obstacles that startups encounter in Silicon Valley.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the startup culture in Silicon Valley is the extremely high cost of living. The region has one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, which means that businesses have to spend a significant portion of their budget on office space and housing for their employees. This can be particularly difficult for early-stage startups with limited funding and resources. As a result, many startups struggle to attract top talent due to higher salaries needed to cover living expenses.\n\nIn addition to high costs, another major challenge faced by startups in Silicon Valley is fierce competition. With thousands of new businesses emerging every year and established companies constantly expanding their operations, it can be challenging for startups to stand out amongst their competitors. Not only do they have to compete for customers but also for talented employees who are often lured by bigger companies offering more attractive compensation packages.\n\nThe competitive nature of Silicon Valley can also lead to difficulties in securing funding. While there are abundant venture capitalists and angel investors in the area, they tend to be quite selective as they receive countless pitches from promising young companies every day. This makes it essential for startups to have a unique value proposition and a solid business plan before approaching potential investors.\n\nFurthermore, despite being renowned as an inclusive place where diverse ideas thrive, diversity remains a persistent issue within the startup community in Silicon Valley. The tech industry has long been criticized for its lack of diversity, especially when it comes to gender and race representation among founders and employees. This poses a challenge not only for addressing inequality but also hinders access to different perspectives and ideas necessary for innovation.\n\nMoreover, regulatory hurdles can also prove to be a significant challenge for startups in Silicon Valley. The region is known for its relaxed and flexible regulations, but with the rapid growth of new technologies and industries, government agencies are continuously updating their laws and policies. This can create legal complexities for businesses, especially those dealing with cutting-edge technologies.\n\nWhile the startup culture in Silicon Valley offers countless opportunities for companies to thrive, it is not without its challenges. High costs, intense competition, difficulty securing funding, lack of diversity, and regulatory hurdles all play a role in shaping the landscape of this unique entrepreneurial hub. Nevertheless, these obstacles have also fostered a community of resilient and determined individuals who constantly push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nLessons that can be learned from the unique aspects of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is known for its unparalleled success in fostering innovation and driving economic growth. This region has not only produced some of the most influential companies in the world, but it has also established a unique set of characteristics that sets it apart from any other place on earth. In this section, we will dive into the lessons that can be learned from the distinct aspects of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture.\n\n1. Embracing Failure:\n\nOne of the most prominent features of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is its acceptance and even encouragement of failure. Entrepreneurs in this region are not afraid to take risks and try new things, knowing that failure is just another step towards success. In Silicon Valley, a failed business venture is seen as a valuable learning opportunity rather than a mark of shame or defeat. This mindset allows entrepreneurs to continuously refine their ideas and come back stronger after each setback.\n\n2. Culture of Collaboration:\n\nAnother vital element of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is its collaborative environment. Unlike competitive corporate cultures, startups in this region often work together, share resources and knowledge, and support one another\u2019s growth. The concept here is that everyone benefits when there is collective progress within the startup community.\n\n3. Focus on Disruptive Innovation:\n\nThe startups in Silicon Valley are built with an aim to disrupt existing markets by introducing new technologies or business models. This focus on disruptive innovation allows entrepreneurs to think outside traditional boundaries and push beyond what seems possible, resulting in groundbreaking solutions to complex problems.\n\n4. Access to Capital:\n\nThe abundance of capital resources available in Silicon Valley plays a significant role in shaping its vibrant startup culture. With top venture capitalists actively seeking out innovative ideas to invest in, startups have access to capital at every stage of their development \u2013 from seed funding to series A, B, C and beyond.\n\n5.Culture Diversity:\n\nSilicon Valley attracts talented individuals from all over the world due to its inclusive international environment. This rich mix of diverse cultures, ideas and perspectives fosters a culture of creativity and collaboration that enables startups to think globally from the very beginning.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is unique in many ways, and there are several lessons that entrepreneurs can take away from it. These include embracing failure as a learning experience, promoting a collaborative mindset, focusing on disruptive innovation, having access to capital resources, and fostering diversity within the workplace. By incorporating these elements into their own startup cultures, entrepreneurs can strive towards achieving similar success in their respective industries.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the startup culture in Silicon Valley is truly one of a kind. From its innovative mindset to its supportive community and access to top talent, it offers a unique ecosystem for entrepreneurs to thrive. This environment has been instrumental in the success of countless startups and continues to attract ambitious individuals from all over the world. As technology continues to evolve, we can only expect this vibrant culture to grow even more, solidifying Silicon Valley\u2019s position as a global hub for innovation and entrepreneurship."
