        "article_content": "Q: We are seeking records on UFOs, and were told to try the Freedom of Information Act. First question, can you explain the Freedom of Information Act? Then, how do we go about requesting records?\n\nJ.V., Glendale\n\nA: The Freedom of Information Act (abbreviated as FOIA) provides you with the right to request access to records of the executive branch of the United States government. The records are to be provided, unless they are subject to certain exemptions whose purpose is to protect disclosure deemed harmful to: (a) national security, (b) privacy of individuals, (c) proprietary business information (such as trade secrets), (d) the actual functioning of our government, and/or (e) other interests that are deemed of significant importance. The exemptions are real, but FOIA requests often are productive.\n\nThe act dates from 1967 and took many years to become law. The objective is to make our government more transparent. As to UFOs (which the government now refers to as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d), federal agencies have been required this year to organize and tag documents. Congress has expressed clear interest in determining what agencies know about UFOs. Thus, the agencies are to disclose their information by the end of this fiscal year. The records are also to be housed at the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nHere, then, is an outline of a FOIA request you can consider: Using letterhead, set forth the date you are sending it; then list the name and address of the executive agency where the request is being sent; then \u201cRE: FOIA REQUEST\u201d; followed by \u201cDear Sir or Madam: This is an authorized request to you under the Freedom of Information Act. Please provide the following records to the undersigned on a timely basis. \u2026\u201d Here, clearly set forth the records sought, describing them, if possible, by year(s), name of the party or parties involved, and/or the circumstances or events in focus. Then close the FOIA request with a sign off.\n\nNote that some agencies have instructions on where a FOIA request is to be sent (you can look for that online, or call to inquire). While it is not required that the FOIA request be transmitted by certified mail/return receipt requested, doing so is one way to seek to show that you not only sent it, but that it was received. The agency is required to respond within 20 working days (excluding weekends and legal holidays).\n\nQ: There was a local incident that at first was well reported. An older person was run over by a hit-and-run driver. We think they have since found the identity of the driver, who may be a local official, but there is radio silence. Our neighbor suggests we try a Public Records Act request. Can you give us some guidance on that?\n\nM.B., (location withheld)\n\nRelated Articles News | Am I liable for a slip and fall at a bowling alley?

Ask the lawyer A: The Public Records Act is found at California Government Code Sections 6250 through 6277. The act gives you, as a member of the public, the right to request information from California governmental agencies, which includes both state and local/municipal governments. In some instances, you may be able to learn online or by phone where to send the request, depending on which agency the request is going to (such as, the police department, highway patrol, zoning commission, district attorney\u2019s office or mayor\u2019s office, among others). As with a FOIA request, be specific about what you are seeking, and to whom and where the records are to be sent. The agency has 10 calendar days to respond to you, but may indicate it needs more time to locate, review and produce the records (which can mean a 14-day extension for \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d).\n\nAs with a FOIA request, some records may be deemed confidential or otherwise off-limits.\n\nA Public Records Act request, however, should not be costly or time consuming. It is the law, and compliance is expected to the extent authorized and permissible. I cannot say the request will unveil what you are looking for, and records you get may have redactions (which the agency can seek to justify), but, as they say, \u201cnothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d\n\nRon Sokol has been a practicing attorney for over 40 years, and has also served many times as a judge pro tem, mediator, and arbitrator. It is important to keep in mind that this column presents a summary of the law, and is not to be treated or considered legal advice, let alone a substitute for actual consultation with a qualified professional."

Lab 9 Films has revealed an official trailer for yet another new documentary about UFOs \u2013 this one called The Program. Ever since the US government started actually talking openly about UFOs, now officially known as UAP (\"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena\") sightings, Ufologists have been going crazy. They've gone beyond conspiracy drifting into full-on \"it has to be true!\" irrefutable belief. Of course. The Program is yet another new UFOs / aliens-are-real film from filmmaker James Fox, who also made The Phenomenon and Moment of Contact in the years before. Featuring narration by Peter Coyote (Bitter Moon, E.T.). The doc includes \"extensive interviews with insiders, experts and politicians. Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, and Stanford University's Dr. Gary Nolan, [are] among those who appear in the doc.\" It's another doc about extraterrestrials that now wants to dig into the question: is there a big government program keeping the truth a secret? (Is it called The X-Files?) What do you believe?\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for James Fox's UFO doc The Program, direct from YouTube:\n\nThis highly anticipated follow-up to director James Fox's other blockbuster UFO documentary films, The Phenomenon (2020) and Moment of Contact (2022), The Program explores the unprecedented bipartisan Congressional effort to uncover what US intelligence agencies really know about UFOs, now referred to as UAP. The first two public hearings in over half a century included testimony under oath from military & intelligence officers with jaw-dropping allegations of a clandestine program to analyze materials and non-human biologics. Through candid interviews with high-ranking insiders, elected officials, physicists, intelligence officers, and military whistleblowers, The Program goes behind the scenes to leave even the staunchest skeptics astounded by the assertions from a growing chorus of insiders that we are not alone. The Program is directed by ufologist / filmmaker James Fox, director of the other doc films I Know What I Saw, The Phenomenon, and Moment of Contact previously. Produced by James Fox & Lance Mungia. Lab 9 Films releases Fox's doc The Program in select US theaters + on VOD to watch later in 2024. Stay tuned."

        "source": "Yahoo",
        "article_content": "It's been a tumultuous week for OpenAI, full of executive departures and major fundraising developments, but the startup is back at it, trying to convince developers to build tools with its AI models at its 2024 DevDay. The company announced several new tools Tuesday, including a public beta of its \"Realtime API\", for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. It's not quite ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode, but it's close.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said the recent departures of chief technology officer Mira Murati and chief research officer Bob McGrew would not affect the company's progress.\n\n\"I'll start with saying Bob and Mira have been awesome leaders. I've learned a lot from them, and they are a huge part of getting us to where we are today,\" said Weil. \"And also, we're not going to slow down.\"\n\nAs OpenAI undergoes yet another C-suite overhaul \u2013 a reminder of the turmoil following last year's DevDay \u2013 the company is trying to convince developers that it still offers the best platform to build AI apps on. Leaders say the startup has more than 3 million developers building with its AI models, but OpenAI is operating in an increasingly competitive space.\n\nOpenAI noted it had cut costs for developers to access its API by 99% in the last two years, though it was likely forced to by competitors such as Meta and Google continuously undercutting their prices.\n\nOne of OpenAI's new features, dubbed the Realtime API, will give developers the chance to build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can't use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. (The voice ambiguously based on Scarlett Johansson's is not available anywhere.)\n\nDuring the briefing, OpenAI's head of developer experience, Romain Huet, shared a demo of a trip planning app built with the Realtime API. The application allowed users to verbally speak with an AI assistant about an upcoming trip to London, and get low-latency responses. The Realtime API also has access to a number of tools, so the app was able to annotate a map with restaurant locations as it answered.\n\nAt another point, Huet showed how the Realtime API could speak on the phone with a human to inquire about ordering food for an event. Unlike Google's infamous Duo, OpenAI's API can't call restaurants or shops directly; however, it can integrate with calling APIs like Twilio to do so. Notably, OpenAI is not adding disclosures so that its AI models automatically identify themselves on calls like this, despite the fact that these AI-generated voices sounds quite realistic. For now, it seems to be the developers' responsibility to add this disclosure, something that could be required by a new California law.\n\nAs part of its DevDay announcements, OpenAI also introduced vision fine-tuning in its API, which will let developers use images, as well as text, to fine-tune their applications of GPT-4o. This should, in theory, help developers improve the performance of GPT-4o for tasks involving visual understanding. OpenAI's head of product API, Olivier Godement, tells TechCrunch that developers will not be able to upload copyrighted imagery (such as a picture of Donald Duck), images that depict violence, or other imagery that violates OpenAI's safety policies.\n\nOpenAI is racing to match what its competitors in the AI model licensing space already offer. Its prompt caching feature is similar to the feature Anthropic launched several months agoallowing developers to cache frequently used context between API calls, reducing costs and improve latency. OpenAI says developers can save 50% using this feature, whereas Anthropic promises a 90% discount for it.\n\nLastly, OpenAI is offering a model distillation feature to let developers use larger AI models, such as o1-preview and GPT-4o, to fine-tune smaller models such as GPT-4o mini. Running smaller models generally provides cost savings compare to running larger ones, but this feature should let developers improve the performance of those small AI models. As part of model distillation, OpenAI is launching a beta evaluation tool so developers can measure their fine-tune's performance within OpenAI's API.\n\nDevDay may make bigger waves for what it didn't announce \u2013 for instance, there wasn't any news on the GPT Store announced during last year's DevDay. Last we've heard, OpenAI has been piloting a revenue share program with some of the most popular creators of GPTs, but the company hasn't announced much since then.\n\nAlso, OpenAI says it's not releasing any new AI models during DevDay this year. Developers waiting for OpenAI o1 (not the preview or mini version) or the startup's video generation model, Sora, will have to wait a little longer."

        "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 ChatGPT maker OpenAI will allow any app developer to add snappy and humanlike voice interaction to their products, a move that could greatly increase the number of people interacting with a slick and sometimes provocative new generation of artificial intelligence technology. OpenAI\u2019s \u201cadvanced voice mode,\u201d which offers six AI voices that sound casual and expressive, with the ability to detect and react to different human vocal tones, has been available to ChatGPT subscribers since July. The technology will now be offered to the thousands of companies that pay to use OpenAI technology in their own products \u2014 and any new developer who signs up.\n\nOpening more of its AI inventions to outsiders could help grow OpenAI\u2019s revenue from usage fees it charges each time an app taps its technology. Increasing that income is crucial to the company, which is seeking billions of dollars in new funding and considering restructuring to remove its business from the control of its existing nonprofit board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced it was opening access to its voice technology at an event in San Francisco for software developers. At a news briefing ahead of the event, OpenAI executives showed how an app built on its voice technology could make a phone call to a business and place an order for chocolate strawberries.\n\nThe business was not real and the person who took down the order and asked questions that the AI voice nimbly responded to was an OpenAI executive role-playing, but app developers will be able to deploy that capability immediately, the executives said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it possible to interact with AI in all of the ways you interact with a human being,\u201d OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said at the press briefing.\n\nFully achieving that goal would be challenging with existing AI technology, which often makes mistakes. But if app developers rush to build on OpenAI\u2019s voice algorithms many more people could soon be using or exposed to automated systems that capably mimic people in some scenarios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRealistic voice synthesis technology has already been used in some call centers but if OpenAI succeeds in making it more sophisticated and widespread, then consumers could encounter fresh frustrations or scams as well as new conveniences.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission last week fined a political consultant $6 million for using AI to fake the voice of President Joe Biden in New Hampshire robocalls earlier this year.\n\nIn 2018, Google debuted its AI voice bot, Google Duplex, that could call restaurants or salons to make reservations. But the humans employed by local businesses receiving the calls didn\u2019t always like it.\n\nInitially, Duplex did not disclose that it was a piece of software, until the backlash prompted Google to reprogram it to always introduce itself as an AI system. The feature hasn\u2019t caught on broadly, although Google Pixel phones can screen calls using similar technology and the company\u2019s cloud unit offers voice technology for call centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice bots have drastically improved over the past several years, with OpenAI\u2019s new voice mode for ChatGPT winning plaudits for its ability to carry out snappy conversations, understand complex topics and questions, sing and respond to different tones of voice when it was first unveiled in May.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s system has been tuned to sound eager and polite, similar to the tone of ChatGPT\u2019s textual answers. The company offers six voices to choose from but retired its initial default, called \u201cSky,\u201d after Scarlett Johansson alleged the company copied her voice without permission. Documents shared with The Washington Post indicate a different actor was hired for recordings used to make the voice.\n\nOpenAI says 3 million developers in dozens of countries are now experimenting with its technology and using it to build new apps and features. Opening up its latest voice features could help grow that crucial user base and the revenue it provides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome tech investors and entrepreneurs say that just like the internet incubated giants like Google and smartphones enabled businesses like Uber and DoorDash, artificial intelligence will also spawn a wave of start-ups that become integral to peoples\u2019 lives.\n\nOther AI experts caution that new capabilities like convincingly expressive voices can cause havoc in the wrong hands. An AI narration service marketed for audiobooks and video games was adapted to make the fake Biden robocalls placed in New Hampshire in January.\n\nOpenAI says its rules ban developers from using its services to spam, mislead or harm people, and that it has built systems that monitor how people use its technology to shut down any who don\u2019t comply.\n\nDevelopers tapping the new voice offering must \u201cmake it clear to their users that they are interacting with AI, unless it\u2019s obvious from the context,\u201d the company said in a blog post about the new tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI\u2019s systems have been abused in the past, despite similar rules being in place for ChatGPT and its other services, including a ban on political campaigning."

        "article_content": "I have been warned. This much is clear within minutes of ducking out of a helicopter onto the high-desert oasis of Skinwalker Ranch in northeastern Utah one searingly bright October afternoon. As a visitor approaching the dark and inscrutable paranormal forces patrolling this property, I could be targeted.\n\nThe admonition has come in several forms. There was the prayer for safe deliverance given by chopper pilot Cameron Fugal, brother of property owner Brandon Fugal, as we approached the ranch. This didn\u2019t necessarily rattle me, as I\u2019d recently watched Cameron deliver a similar invocation on season one of The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, the hit History channel show that has generated mainstream attention for the property.\n\nThere was the surreal experience of being greeted on the helipad by about half the show\u2019s cast, whom I felt I\u2019d come to know during my hours of binge watching\u2014standing stone-faced and shoulder to shoulder like some official tribunal ready to deliver grim news. Long-suffering ranch superintendent Thomas Winterton, looking typically Marlboro Man, shook my hand first, followed by glowering security chief Bryant \u201cDragon\u201d Arnold. Erik Bard, the spritely scientist, and red-bearded security man Kaleb Bench chatted nearby. It was as if my arrival was the only thing holding up the start of the season five shoot. When we go inside, Winterton presents me with a liability waiver, which strikes me as highly unusual\u2014there\u2019s nothing on the day\u2019s agenda beyond an in-depth conversation.\n\nBut what truly tweaked my antennae was a conversation I\u2019d had an hour earlier, at the Fugals\u2019 hangar in Provo. Brandon was on the phone, tending to his day job as a commercial real-estate titan, and Cameron and I were chatting amiably when he suddenly pivoted from a story about becoming a grandfather. \u201cEvery time we bring somebody new, the ranch interacts a little different,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually it\u2019s been mostly mild. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.\u201d This struck me as a roundabout way of saying I should at least be a little worried.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some guys that are like, \u2018This is so stupid\u2014we\u2019re gonna show those aliens who\u2019s boss\u2026\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s messed with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to those guys?\u201d I asked. \u201cSomething physical, or their cell phones wigged out, or\u2014?\u201d\n\nIt was indeed bodily harm, Cameron said. The previous owner, Robert Bigelow, was haunted by the place, both during his time there and after, when \u201call the negativity followed him home,\u201d Cameron explained. This sounded a little like the aftermath of a bad Red Lobster meal, but I\u2019d seen the entire series at that point, and I knew what he meant. I\u2019d just never thought of it happening to me.\n\nDuring the flight, as Brandon recounted the particulars of acquiring the 512-acre ranch, I mentally rifled through the catalog of hazards the show has intimated: unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP, which is the modern term for UFO); cryptic messages transmitted through sound waves or electromagnetic interference; and, possibly most relevant, those weird injuries, including vertigo, nausea, temporary paralysis, hearing impairment, and disorientation, some of which led to hospitalizations.\n\nShortly after we arrive, I inquire about the ranch\u2019s tendency to identify and punish skeptics. The crew immediately warms to the topic. The visitors with the most serious health effects, Winterton says, \u201care the ones that came\u2014myself included\u2014with kind of a cavalier attitude of, \u2018There\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s gonna bother me.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible the group has inferred a certain skepticism from my request, a few weeks earlier, to camp overnight at the ranch\u2014an inquiry that Fugal shot down, citing liability and safety reasons. Can the capricious forces patrolling the property intuit my thoughts? It sounds a bit fantastical, but after hearing about other skeptics\u2019 experiences, I\u2019m not so sure anymore.\n\nBut as with seasickness and combat, there\u2019s no way to gauge in advance how you\u2019ll fare until you\u2019re in the thick of it. The only thing I know for sure is that I\u2019m about to find out.\n\nRussel Albert Daniels\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nPrior to my arrival at the ranch, the most unnerving thing I\u2019d experienced was Brandon Fugal\u2019s driving. He had picked me up that morning in Salt Lake City in his Lamborghini Urus Performante. Soon we were hurtling south on I-15 at 90 miles per hour to his airport hangar, while he expounded on his skepticism over TSA screenings and Covid-era face masks.\n\nHalfway to Provo, he explains that he acquired Skinwalker Ranch as an \u201copen-minded skeptic. I believed that there was most likely a natural explanation for all that had been reported. I had never seen a flying saucer or anything of the sort.\u201d The Lambo touched 99 as he veered right to blow by a car dawdling along at 90.\n\nJust like on the show, Fugal wore a fitted suit with a crisp, white dress shirt, fancy cowboy boots, and trademark wire-rim glasses\u2014Harry Potter meets Gordon Gekko. He leans into the narrative arc of the hard-charging business icon: He says he started in real estate at age 18 and sold his first office a year later, works 16- to 20-hour days, and has since reshaped Salt Lake City\u2019s skyline. He reveres Elon Musk and frequently name-drops rock stars and politicians in his orbit. (He hired the band Air Supply to play at his 2021 wedding.) Fugal describes himself as a 1980s teenager in a 50-year-old body, and boasts a vast collection of rare books and film memorabilia, including a full-size exoskeleton from the set of Terminator 2. And, most relevant to Skinwalker, he uses his fortune to underwrite certain science-driven moonshots.\n\nCourtesy Jason Shook /The HISTORY Channel\n\nIn 2009, Cameron had just landed his brother\u2019s private jet when, on a whim, Brandon asked him: How old is the technology and the physics behind this jet-propulsion system? The answer\u2014the 1940s\u2014shocked him. Fascinated by the question of how science had stalled in that realm, Brandon began researching alternative forms of propulsion, which led to a brief partnership with a former client, Joe Firmage, an early internet entrepreneur and UAP aficionado. Firmage claimed he was on the cusp of breakthrough technologies that enable purported UFOs to move in unorthodox and physics-defying ways. The project cratered, but in the aftermath Fugal was introduced to Robert Bigelow, a maverick billionaire who used his Las Vegas real-estate fortune to build a private aerospace firm. Bigelow Aerospace developed an expandable habitat for astronauts on the International Space Station before shuttering operations in 2020.\n\nBigelow, who has also espoused the presence of aliens and UAPs, is largely responsible for putting Skinwalker Ranch on the map. Established as an agricultural homestead in 1905, for more than a century the ranch experienced reports of strange activity, and as a result had been named for shape-shifting witches of Navajo lore. As early as 1911, a newspaper reported locals hearing \u201cstrange noises\u201d emanating from the property, and a string of subsequent owners reported UAPs or other strange activity. Bigelow purchased it in 1996 from ranchers Terry and Gwen Sherman, who had been so spooked by their experiences there\u2014which included UAP activity, cattle mysteriously slain, dire wolf\u2013type creatures, and glowing orbs they say vaporized their dogs\u2014that they eagerly unloaded the place.\n\nAround the time he purchased the property, Bigelow founded and bankrolled the National Institute of Discovery Science, with the goal of conducting serious scientific study of UFOs and other paranormal activities at Skinwalker and beyond. He quickly installed a network of investigators who reported their own paranormal happenings at the ranch. A book written by chief investigator Colm Kelleher and news anchor George Knapp describes one incident in which something had disgorged the wiring within a closed-circuit ranch video camera while another camera, trained on it, captured no activity. The team produced another report detailing the 1998 killing of a perfectly healthy three-year-old cow. There were no signs of struggle and no tracks found, but the animal was missing its left eye and part of its left ear. Additionally, its heart was shredded, but its pericardium\u2014the sac that encloses the organ and its major vessels\u2014was intact.\n\nBigelow\u2019s project later morphed into the Pentagon-funded Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies program. From 2008 to 2013, the program recorded more than 530 instances of paranormal activity witnessed by more than 150 people.\n\nWhen Fugal met Bigelow in Las Vegas, he only knew what he\u2019d read in Knapp and Kelleher\u2019s book, and he told Bigelow he thought what had been seen at the ranch \u201cwas the product of groupthink mixed with misidentifying naturally occurring phenomena.\u201d\n\nBy that point Fugal was leading the largest commercial real-estate enterprise in the intermountain west, with 30 offices in 11 states. He didn\u2019t expect that alien sightings and disemboweled livestock would play well in his rarefied circles. \u201cI did not want my name associated with these topics,\u201d he says. But Fugal was intrigued, and after a series of lengthy conversations with Bigelow in 2016, he quietly bought the ranch for about $500,000 through a shell corporation called Adamantium Real Estate, named for the fictional alloy used to make Wolverine\u2019s claws in Marvel Comics. Several days before the closing, he flew out to see the ranch for the first time and was stunned by the dramatic landscape: the high-desert mesa plateau, the snaking course of Dry Gulch Creek, the clutch of dilapidated pioneer homesteads evoking a complex history.\n\nHe\u2019d been an Eagle Scout growing up and was now on the board of the Utah National Parks Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He figured he\u2019d have a scientific team determine there was nothing untoward about the property, then he would donate it for scout camps and youth programs.\n\nBut before he could put that plan in motion, things started happening.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWe settle into the main room of the Skinwalker Ranch headquarters, and the conversation naturally drifts toward the crew\u2019s conversion stories, meaning the experiences that led them to believe that strange forces are afoot here.\n\nWinterton, the ranch superintendent, grew up in the Uinta Basin, the geological feature that encompasses Skinwalker. His first time there\u2014as a nonbelieving building inspector\u2014he experienced severe vertigo and lightheadedness. \u201cI finally had to back up against the wall and then I kind of slid down towards the floor,\u201d he says.\n\nNone of these tellings is more compelling than Fugal\u2019s. In 2016, an employee recorded a UFO sighting on his phone\u2019s camera, snapping pictures of a horizontal object in the sky at a time when flight data showed there was no commercial or private air traffic over the ranch. The employee reported it to Fugal, who immediately began studying the images. Four months later, Fugal says he and two security guards saw a silver-gray spaceship-type object moving erratically above the mesa that borders the property.\n\nAnd thus Fugal made the shift\u2014in his words\u2014\u201cfrom being a healthy skeptic to an experiencer.\u201d Since then, he has intensively pursued an understanding of what he describes as \u201chigh strangeness.\u201d He erected a gate to seal off the property, installed a web of security cameras, and has poured millions of dollars into advanced technological instruments aimed at quantifying the ranch\u2019s mysteries.\n\nErik Bard, an X-ray physicist, is one of the lead experts Fugal hired to harvest and interpret the reams of data these instruments have produced. Before moving to the ranch full-time, Bard was a partner in a firm that makes components for machines that produce or measure X-rays; many of its products go to the national labs, he says.\n\nBard has his own conversion story. He had dismissed what he\u2019d heard about the ranch as \u201cE.T. interdimensional religious whatever.\u201d Then Fugal invited him to visit in October 2016\u2014coincidentally, the same day that Fugal saw the UAP\u2014and two things happened: On a trek out to the mesa, Bard pulled out his phone to take a picture and saw that the screen was flickering. At first, he thought he had broken it.\n\nWhen he and others in his group returned to the homestead, Bard says he couldn\u2019t keep his balance, and several others said they felt the ground spin. \u201cThe interesting thing is, I hadn\u2019t told them that I was experiencing it,\u201d he recalls.\n\nBard figured he\u2019d try to make sense of these occurrences using science. First, he examined the phone malfunction. In an area with poor reception, a smartphone\u2019s RF (radio frequency) components emit extra energy working to connect to a cell tower, which can interfere with other parts of the unit. Bard thought this was a perfectly good explanation, except that he couldn\u2019t reproduce it. Several months later he tried a different experiment using a powerful rare-earth magnet capable of lifting 1,750 pounds of iron. When he put his phone on the edge of the magnet, he reproduced the effect.\n\nThe answer seemed to be the ranch\u2019s unusual electromagnetic field, and specifically, a phenomenon called electromagnetic interference. In subsequent years, he and others have repeatedly dealt with more instances of what he experienced on his phone. Drones have mysteriously crashed; batteries on phones and other devices\u2014ranging from boom microphones to H4n recorders\u2014have suddenly drained. The ranch\u2019s computer and surveillance systems have malfunctioned. These glitches haven\u2019t just impacted the ranch\u2019s equipment, Bard says, but also the equipment being brought in by outside experts.\n\nBard, who is more engaging and animated in person than on TV, read that strong magnetic fields also affect the human nervous system. MRI technicians, Bard explains, experience many of the same symptoms that people have at the ranch, including vertigo and nausea. These studies plus his benchtop experiment pointed to a magnetic field anomaly. \u201cThat was the beginning of trying to put a physics interpretation on some part of the phenomenon,\u201d he says.\n\nThe source of the electromagnetic activity is another question: Bard speculates that it could be linked to some physics quirk in the space-time realm or something technological\u2014a cloaked craft or UAP. Bard is still hunting for answers.\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBard\u2019s super-magnet experiment is only one of the myriad scientific forays into the site, as the show\u2019s viewers know well. It\u2019s possible that no wild space in the country has been as closely scrutinized as this one. Just about everything across the landscape has been analyzed, poked, and sampled.\n\nThe crew has deployed hyperspectral imaging technology, which reveals light on parts of the spectrum humans can\u2019t otherwise see. There are aircraft transponder data receivers; laboratory-grade thermographic imaging systems; advanced magnetometers; forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, which detect infrared radiation and convert it to an image; and a geophone-based near-field seismometer, to ensure that no seismic wave goes undetected. Much of this tech is military-grade, Fugal says.\n\nThe team has mapped every inch of the ranch using a combination of LIDAR, drone-based photogrammetric mapping, and ground-penetrating radar. They\u2019ve collected and analyzed samples using X-ray fluorescence. At one point, Bard and his crew brought in a team to aim high-powered optical lasers\u2014devices colorfully known as a laser space cannons\u2014at the sky above the ranch to search for more evidence of whatever invisible forces may hover overhead.\n\nCurious findings keep the crew\u2014and viewers\u2014energized. Bard beckons me into the control room to show me what one of the simpler pieces of equipment\u2014a surveillance camera stationed in Homestead 2\u2014harvested. Feeds from the 50 or so audio-enabled security cameras across the property are available to Skinwalker Ranch Insiders, which is essentially a fan club. For a membership that starts at $8 a month, participants get access to \u201cdisturbing & anomalous audio, infrasonic, & frequency data,\u201d according to the website. The more than 10,000 Insiders who have so far subscribed also get 24-hour access to the ranch webcams. Not only that, Bard has steampunked the system so that they are also able to control the cameras, and swivel them if they spot something. This has essentially created a community of volunteer citizen scientists. (\u201cIt\u2019s like giving someone the keys to the International Space Station and being able to steer it around and position and explore the cosmos,\u201d Fugal says.)\n\nOne Insider reported what Bard shows me now: At 1:39 a.m. one night, a door on Homestead 2 abruptly slammed shut. There was no wind, and no sign of anyone on camera. Played on repeat in grainy night-vision video, it\u2019s undeniably creepy.\n\nRussel Albert Daniels\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always obvious that a TV show was the way to go. Fugal says after he was approached by the History channel in 2018, he only agreed to the show on three conditions: Nothing could be faked; the film crew had to use the investigators he\u2019d hired; and his identity was to remain secret. The History Channel team agreed to the first two mandates\u2014the show\u2019s creators say that any staged reenactments are based on eyewitness accounts\u2014but rejected the third, when the producers convinced him the research would only be believable if there was full transparency.\n\nAs it happened, the world was changing fast regarding perceptions of such phenomena\u2014in particular, UAPs. Owing to a surge in military-pilot sightings, whistleblower pressure, and media coverage, UAPs were being legitimized in Congress and acknowledged more openly by the defense and intelligence communities, shifting the phenomena from the tinfoil-hat realm into the cultural mainstream.\n\nIn 2018, Fugal and his team, including three scientists, shared some of the data they\u2019d collected with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Armed Services Committee in a confidential briefing in Washington, D.C. Fugal says he maintains contact with Utah\u2019s senior senator, Mike Lee, and the state attorney general, Sean Reyes. \u201cThere has been a seismic shift in the way the government is approaching the topic,\u201d he says.\n\nBut government knowledge is still largely blanketed in secrecy, and Bigelow\u2019s findings on the ranch have similarly remained hidden from the public, even to Fugal; the program was secretly funded by the Pentagon, and its contents remain undisclosed. This is partly why he pivoted in the opposite direction. Everything his team learns is shared openly, he says, through the show or the phalanx of cameras, or both.\n\nThis was a canny move, to not only be transparent with what was going on there but to make transparency part of the point: Maybe you don\u2019t believe in this, but you can believe in how we\u2019re doing it. For a curious public starved by generations of government intransigence, this has been raw meat tossed to hungry wolves. \u201cPeople want brutal honesty,\u201d he says\u2014and 2.22 million viewers tuned into the 2023\u2013\u201924 season, making it the 10th most popular non-sports cable program.\n\nFugal says he\u2019s never taken a penny for the show\u2014that he\u2019s given it all to charity and put it back into the ranch equipment. But he is clearly an adroit businessman with a nose for opportunity; soon after purchasing the ranch, he trademarked the name for purposes of the TV show and for use on merchandise such as T-shirts and mugs. The show has made him a celebrity\u2014it \u201chas turned my world upside down,\u201d he says. He was even recognized on the street during a recent trip to France and Italy.\n\nIt\u2019s clear he has fully shed any reservations he once harbored about serving as Skinwalker\u2019s front man. On the show, he drops lines like \u201cWe\u2019ll come to understand the dark forces that we\u2019re interacting with, but also the nature of our world and our reality\u201d without a hint of self-consciousness. He\u2019s a rabid fan of 1980s science fiction; one of his prized possessions is a copy of the E.T. screenplay. What better way to feed that appetite than to hypothetically possess his own E.T.?\n\nFugal says he\u2019s often asked what he believes they are dealing with. Could it be extraterrestrials? Multidimensional beings? Or some spiritual influence? \u201cI answer it\u2019s likely D: all of the above,\u201d he says. The data they\u2019ve collected over the years suggest there could be a wide range of origins and agendas associated with the phenomena. \u201cThe deeper the investigation digs both literally and figuratively,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more complicated it becomes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBy the time we wander out for a tour, the landscape is so dazzling I find it hard to muster much concern for my safety. The sky is vast and clear and the cottonwood trees are gilded in autumnal splendor. As we walk through and around the tumbledown homesteads, I pay particular attention to the largest of the three buildings that comprise Homestead 2\u2014the site of the mysterious slamming door spotted by a Skinwalker Ranch Insider.\n\nFrom the outside, the doorframe is dark and vacant, like a missing tooth; the modest two-room shack, now more than a century old, has gradually submitted to the forces of weather and age. Inside, leaves are scattered across the floorboards, and sunlight glides through the failing ceiling as if filtered through a julienne slicer. I see no evidence of wires that could have been rigged there to cause the sudden, unexplained movement. Gusts often cause doors to swing shut, but this one closed from the inside; the windows are empty cavities and there\u2019s a hole in the roof, so there would be no way to build up any air pressure inside. The camera had shown the whole room, and nothing had moved prior to the door opening. \u201cLook at the debris on the floor,\u201d Fugal says. If it had been windy, leaves and other detritus would have been blowing everywhere.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating, but there\u2019s no way to make sense of it, and little time to linger. Moving around in Rhino-type vehicles used on the show, we cruise over to the \u201cTriangle.\u201d Investigators zeroed in on this patch of otherwise unremarkable land between the headquarters and the homesteads as a potential hotbed of paranormal activity during the show\u2019s latter seasons after chronicling\n\nunexplained interference with helicopter flights, drones, and other forms of aerial exploration.\n\nThe site consists of a set of jeep roads that form its geometric namesake, but we didn\u2019t bother walking around; most of what makes the location interesting\u2014at least for fans of the show\u2014is invisible. The cast filled entire episodes with experiments that included elevating a squadron of drones and shooting rockets skyward to see if they could figure out what was occurring in the airspace above. These experiments have led the group to believe there may be some sort of interdimensional portal. It sounds far-fetched, but millions of viewers keep coming back for more.\n\nRussel Albert Daniels\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nCinematic as all of this is, what none of this technology has been able to provide so far is much in the way of concrete answers. The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch is a sumptuous buffet for conspiracy-driven UFOlogists and paranormal enthusiasts, unabashedly splicing supposition, folklore, and unexplained sightings with a series of high- and low-tech experiments. The result is a kind of true-believer cut-up, and viewers may feel they\u2019ve learned a lot but have no clue what any of it amounts to.\n\nFive seasons in, one question that emerges is whether a force intelligent enough to avoid detection, or reveal itself at will, can ever be identified. This plays into the producers\u2019 hands, of course; a malevolent force that can reveal itself in opportune moments yet avoid detection drives the need for more investigations, and more television seasons. It creates a waves-against-the-shore rhythm, in which the cast experiences something, excitedly conducts a series of experiments\u2014only to wind up, in some cases, with more questions than they had before. The tide advances and retreats, continually polishing the ranch\u2019s legend in the process. But how long can they maintain the tension, and keep the audience entertained, while concrete answers remain just out of reach?\n\nThe next day, Fugal revs up another one of his toys\u2014a Ferrari 488 Spider\u2014for a final lunch meeting. Just before we leave the restaurant, I ask him something I\u2019ve been pondering since he turned down my camping request: Will he even reopen the ranch to the public? Let us see for ourselves?\n\nHe shakes his head. Having a secure, living laboratory, he claims, will allow us to develop insights that could change the course of history. \u201cI know that sounds like hyperbole, but you look at the topics we\u2019re discussing, the implications,\u201d he says, \u201cif you don\u2019t understand the weight and significance, then you perhaps are not\u2026 I think the appropriate way to say this is, you\u2019re not ready.\u201d\n\nIf the public at large is frustrated by this, they\u2019re not showing it. Yes, there are some snarky reviews, but Fugal says he\u2019s selling plenty of hats, DVDs, and T-shirts. The crew was about to start shooting a sixth season, and the series has spun off into Beyond Skinwalker Ranch, a History channel show that will probe other paranormal hotspots.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll never be ready myself to grasp the significance of the site in the way that Fugal has. But my visit, in the end, did suggest one potential explanation for the enduring nature of this phenomenon. Maybe the real fantasy of Skinwalker Ranch isn\u2019t that answers to the strange occurrences there will be identified, but that they were ever identifiable in the first place.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can report: I never felt dizzy or experienced any sudden pain. I did not exit the ranch anxious that I was being shadowed by some unknowable force, nor did my phone or digital recorder glitch. But I did feel something. It was the same thing I\u2019d experienced coming off gigantic, twirl-you-upside-down amusement park rides\u2014the ones where the caution signs are a little larger, and even though they\u2019re for legal purposes, they add a fizz of danger. You know the sensation: You unbuckle and your hair is blown back and you feel buzzy from the thrill. Maybe, if you\u2019re a fan of The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, it\u2019s the same feeling you have watching the show, in its best moments.\n\nAre there really UFOs and dire wolves haunting this lonesome patch of high desert in eastern Utah? In the end, for millions of fans, the answer may not really matter.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

The introduction of the IBM Quantum System 2 marks a significant milestone in the field, bringing us closer to realizing the full potential of quantum computing. Central to this technology are quantum bits, or qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computers. Unlike classical bits, which can only exist in a state of either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This remarkable property allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, tackling complex problems that would take classical computers centuries to solve.\n\nCore Principles of Quantum Computing\n\nThe fundamental difference between classical bits and qubits lies in their quantum mechanical nature. While classical computers use bits to perform calculations sequentially, quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to solve complex problems in a fraction of the time. Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become correlated in such a way that their states are dependent on each other, regardless of the distance between them. This alignment with the quantum mechanical nature of the universe enables quantum computers to tackle problems that are currently unsolvable by classical means, opening up new frontiers in scientific discovery and technological advancement.\n\nQuantum computers use superposition and entanglement to solve complex problems\n\nQubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical bits\n\nQuantum computing aligns with the quantum mechanical nature of the universe\n\nQuantum Computing Explained\n\nHere are a selection of other articles from our extensive library of content you may find of interest on the subject of Quantum computing :\n\nTransformative Applications\n\nQuantum computing holds the potential to transform various fields, from material science and drug discovery to cryptography and artificial intelligence.

Remains of tiny crustaceans embedded in the fur also indicate the woolly rhino (Coelodonta antiquitatis) died in a shallow pool of water, the team noted.\n\nRadiocarbon dating suggests the young woolly rhino died and froze more than 32,000 years ago.\n\nWoolly rhinos roamed the Arctic tundra between 460,000 and 12,000 years ago , during the last ice age . They were huge beasts and the second largest herbivores in the mammoth steppe ecosystem after woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius). Like mammoths, woolly rhinos were well-adapted to the cold climate thanks to their coat of shaggy fur \u2014 but scientists still know very little about these prehistoric animals, according to the study.\n\nRelated: 'Closer than people think': Woolly mammoth 'de-extinction' is nearing reality \u2014 and we have no idea what happens next\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They dubbed the animal \"Abyisky rhinoceros\" after the local district and sent its remains to the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Sakha, where the carcass currently sits in a freezer.\n\nFor the new study, researchers temporarily defrosted the carcass and took samples of skin, fur and soft tissue for analysis. They also examined the woolly rhino's teeth, measured the length of one of its horns and noted the size of a large hump on its back, which appeared to be filled with fat.\n\nIllustration of a woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). (Image credit: De Agostini via Getty Images)\n\nThe horn was 9.4 inches (24 centimeters) long and presented three to four dark patches that typically correspond to the number of years lived by a rhinoceros, according to the study. The height at the shoulder of the carcass was close to 4.3 feet (130 cm). Together, this indicates the woolly rhino was 4 to 4.5 years old when it died and hadn't reached sexual maturity.\n\nIts fur was darker than that of a smaller woolly rhino calf discovered in 2014 in the same district. That calf, named \"Sasha,\" was frozen for at least 10,000 years and covered in thin, almost-blond hair . In contrast, adult woolly rhinos that were previously pulled from the ice have coarse, dark brown fur.\n\n\"The fur of the Abyisky rhinoceros has a uniform light brown color due to the combination of white, beige, and brown hair,\" the researchers wrote in the study. \"The coat is darker on the ears and feet and lighter on the back, belly, and hind legs.\"\n\nRemarkably, the Abyisky rhinoceros also had a 5-inch-high (13 cm) hump filled with fatty mass on its back, the likes of which scientists had never seen on a woolly rhino carcass. Fatty humps are relatively common in Arctic animals, Love Dal\u00e9n , a professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University in Sweden who was not involved in the study, told CNN . They evolved to beat the cold and store energy for when times get tough, he said.\n\nThe newly discovered 4-year-old appears to represent an intermediate stage of woolly rhino development. Specimens with preserved tissues like this one are invaluable for further research, and particularly for genetic tests that cannot be done on bones, Dal\u00e9n said."

Refresh your browser for the latest:\n\nTrump again criticizes prisoner swap involving WNBA star Brittney Griner\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Tuesday again criticized a prisoner swap involving WNBA star Brittney Griner and arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBout, the so-called \u201cmerchant of death,\u201d was exchanged in a 2022 prisoner swap for Griner, who had spent nearly a year in Russian captivity.\n\nTrump again essentially accused Griner of not being patriotic enough, saying she \u201ctied her shoes\u201d during the National Anthem.\n\nGriner played for Team USA in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, winning gold both times.\n\nThen, at the 2024 Paris Olympics, as Griner stood on the medal stand with her third gold medal draped around her neck, tears streamed down her face as she stood for the National Anthem.\n\nLast year, Bout urged Trump to seek refuge in Russia, saying he believed his life was \u201cin peril.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump falsely claims immigrants are being signed up to vote\n\nWhile touching on immigration, Trump claimed immigrants are being registered to vote, a claim PolitiFact has debunked before.\n\n\"There's a reason why they let all these people in, because they want to get them to vote,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump did not mention a Republican-led referendum question on the Nov. 5 ballot in Wisconsin, which aims to prevent noncitizens from voting in local elections in the future. Some cities do allow that, but nowhere in Wisconsin currently does.\n\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission has said they only know of four alleged cases of voter fraud related to citizenship since 2015. Wisconsin's voter registration form includes a checkbox confirming the voter is a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump calls Tommy Thompson 'the dean'\n\nTrump shouted out former Wisconsin Govs. Scott Walker and Tommy Thompson, who also spoke at the rally Tuesday. Trump called Thompson \"so respected\" and \"the dean.\"\n\nTrump said Thompson called him during his 2016 campaign, expressing doubts about Trump's ability to win Wisconsin and telling him to campaign in other battlegrounds.\n\n\"He said, 'Here's a deal. If I think you're going to win, I'll call you back,'\" Trump said. \"He called me about three weeks later. He said, 'It's time to come up, you're going to win this thing.'\"\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump falsely claims there was a 'coup' when Harris became Democratic nominee\n\nFormer President Donald Trump again falsely claimed that there was a \u201ccoup\u201d when Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nHe added that former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u201csays it was a coup,\u201d and also mentioned former Gov. Tommy Thompson as he repeated his claims \u201cit was a coup.\u201d\n\nBut a coup, or coup d\u2019etat, is defined as a sudden, violent and unlawful seizure of power, experts say. So while Biden\u2019s exit from the race was unusual, experts say it does not amount to a \u201ccoup.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comments undermining confidence in this year's presidential election echo the tactics he used in 2020 when he lost to Biden.\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump claims 50,000 people were turned away from Prairie du Chien rally\n\nAfter taking the stage at Dane Manufacturing, Trump claimed 50,000 to 60,000 people were turned away from his Saturday rally in Prairie du Chien.\n\nNear a thousand people were standing in line to get into the rally on Sunday morning, but the auditorium sat somewhere near 300 people. The crowd did not reach near the tens of thousands.\n\nThe rally was initially planned to be held outdoors but switched to indoors over Secret Service staffing concerns. The agency was responsible for securing the United Nations General Assembly summit in New York on the same day.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump starts after about a 30-minute delay\n\nTrump took the stage at 2:05 p.m., about a half hour behind schedule.\n\nIn the meantime, attendees heard standard songs on Trump's rally playlist, including \"YMCA\" and \"Macho Man\" by the Village People and \"Gloria\" by Laura Branigan.\n\nThere were some newer additions: \"Give Me Everything\" by Pitbull and \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson for the Oct. 1 rally.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nWisconsin union president accuses Trump of \"shell game\" on overtime\n\nA Wisconsin union president is accusing former President Donald Trump of playing a \"shell game\" when it comes to overtime pay and protections.\n\n\"He is claiming that he will eliminate taxes on overtime pay but he fails to mention that he would do so by eliminating overtime pay altogether,\" Stephanie Bloomingdale, the Wisconsin AFL-CIO president, said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nShe referred to Trump's recent comments at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania that he \"hated\" to give overtime and \"wouldn't pay\" it.\n\nBloomingdale also referred to Project 2025, which Trump has been trying to distance himself from in recent months.\n\n\"When Donald Trump comes here and tries to sell this underhanded scam, we are wise to the lie he is again trying to sell,\" she said. \"The truth is that Donald Trump does not care about the wellbeing of Wisconsin working people and he never has.\"\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visiting areas impacted by Hurricane Helene before Thursday's Wisconsin visit\n\nBefore heading to Wisconsin on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris will visit areas impacted by Hurricane Helene.\n\nHarris is scheduled to go to Georgia on Wednesday, according to a White House pool report. She will also travel to North Carolina, the pool report said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump traveled to the storm-hit battleground state of Georgia to survey damage from Hurricane Helene . Trump told reporters, \"We're not talking about politics now,\" but he then criticized President Joe Biden and Harris over the administration's hurricane response in the hours leading up to the trip.\n\nBiden has pushed back on false claims made by Trump over his response to the disaster.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a liar,\" read a post on X from Biden. \"I\u2019m working with governors and local officials to help those impacted by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\nHarris cut a previous campaign trip short to return to Washington, DC, for briefings about the disaster.\n\nShe is planning to address voters in the Fox Valley on Thursday, according to an advisory to voters from Wisconsin Democrats.\n\nThe visit would be Harris' fifth to Wisconsin since she became the Democrats' presidential nominee in late July. The Harris campaign early Tuesday declined to comment on her travel plans, and a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin did not respond to a message about the advisory.\n\n\u2014 Mary Spicuzza\n\nTrump crowd count at 500 indoors, 4,500 outside\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, the Dane Manufacturing facility held 500 people ahead of Trump's remarks, while about 4,500 stood outside the building.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nWalker, Thompson encourage '72-county strategy' for Trump in Wisconsin\n\nTwo of Wisconsin's former GOP governors greeted the crowd at Dane Manufacturing ahead of Trump's remarks, each stressing the need for Republicans to cut into the strong Democratic margins in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\n\"You need to go beyond your comfort zone. You need to talk to family and friends, neighbors and coworkers, including some who maybe don\u2019t typically vote for a Republican,\" former Gov. Scott Walker said. \"Remind them\u2026 this simple truth. Life was better when Donald Trump was President of the United States.\"\n\nWalker argued that any distaste for Trump's rhetoric is negated by his approach to the economy, the border and violent crime.\n\nThompson, in a rousing speech, reiterated his insistence that Trump can win Wisconsin by increasing his vote share in the state's two most liberal counties.\n\n\"You have to go where the votes are. You have to go where the opposition is. You have to come into Dane County, Milwaukee County and southwestern Wisconsin,\" he said. \"Dane County has the third-most Republican votes in the state of Wisconsin, and all we have to do is increase them.\"\n\n\"Democrats,\" he said, \"get the hell out of our way.\"\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nGov. Tony Evers criticizes Trump's visits\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday morning, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said \"I know Wisconsin families, and they\u2019re going to reject (Trump) again in November.\"\n\n\"As president, Donald Trump was a disaster for Wisconsin, and we haven\u2019t forgotten. A second term would be a heck of a lot worse \u2013 Trump\u2019s extreme Project 2025 agenda would hurt working families, cut Social Security and Medicare, dismantle support for public education across the country, and more,\" Evers said. \"Vice President Harris is the only candidate in this race fighting to lower costs, cut taxes, and invest in Wisconsin\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump campaign releases statement on Emhoff visit\n\nIn a statement, Wisconsin press secretary for Trump's campaign Jacob Fischer said \"no visit from Doug Emhoff can conceal the reality that the dangerously liberal Harris-Walz agenda will be one that Wisconsinites simply can't afford.\"\n\n\"Emhoff has stood on the sidelines for four years of failure, and it's time to retire his Second Gentleman title. President Trump and JD Vance will lower taxes, empower our businesses, and put hardworking Americans first, while Harris and Walz advance dangerously liberal policies and bankrupt our country,\" Fischer said.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nFormer Gov. Tommy Thompson 'so happy' Trump is competing in Dane County\n\nRepublican former Gov. Tommy Thompson told reporters at Trump's event in Waunakee he is \"so happy\" the former president honored his request to visit Dane County.\n\nIn an interview last month on WISN-TV's \"Upfront,\" Thompson said he told Trump during his August rally in La Crosse that in order to win Wisconsin, he'll have to compete in the liberal strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee counties -- areas that have rarely been a focus for Republican candidates.\n\nThompson, the state's longest-serving governor, told reporters Tuesday that by campaigning in both counties in one day, the former president will send a message that: \"I want your vote. I'm here in Dane County because I\u2019m going to compete for your votes all over the state of Wisconsin.\"\n\nTrump lost the village of Waunakee by 28 points in 2020 \u2014 about half his losing margin countywide.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nWhere is Waunakee, Wisconsin, the site of Trump's visit?\n\nWaunakee is located about 13 miles north of Madison, Wisconsin. It's located in the northern part of Dane County, a county that produces large Democratic margins that present headaches for Republicans.\n\nIn 2020, Trump lost the village of Waunakee by 28 points, about half his losing margin in the county. Waunakee has a population of about 15,000.\n\nEric Hovde, the Republican candidate for Senate running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, also visited Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee in September, where he took questions from employees.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nDiscovery World has hosted Harris, Vance, and now Trump\n\nTrump's appearance in Milwaukee tonight will take place at Discovery World, a science museum that juts out into Lake Michigan. The museum's current facility was built in 2006.\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump's running mate and Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance spoke at Discovery World at an event sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBTQ group.\n\nHarris also spoke at Discovery World in May, before she became the Democratic presidential nominee. During that visit, she focused on the economy and disparities that affect Black homeowners and business owners.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nMore:From admission cost to hours to exhibits, here's what to know before a Discovery World visit\n\nTrump to make his first Dane County campaign stop\n\nHundreds of supporters are lined up outside Dane Manufacturing in Waunakee awaiting a visit from Trump. His remarks are scheduled for 1:30 p.m.\n\nIt's Trump's first campaign event in Dane County, Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and a Democratic stronghold. Democratic President Joe Biden led Trump by more than 181,000 votes in the county when he defeated him statewide by about 21,000 votes in 2020. In Waunakee, Biden led Trump by about 2,600 votes.\n\nDane Manufacturing has served as a friendly space for Republican candidates in the liberal region. GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde toured the metal fabrication facility and fielded questions from employees about a month ago, and Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz did the same at the company's former location during his 2016 presidential bid. Cruz, who now backs Trump, at the 2016 stop referred to him as a \"sniveling coward.\"\n\nIn his Tuesday speeches, Trump is expected to criticize the current Democratic administration's economic policy.\n\n\"When Wisconsinites send President Trump back to the White House, he will lower input costs for our farmers, cut 10 regulations for each new regulation implemented, and help, not hurt, farmers\u2019 ability to feed the world,\" the Trump campaign said in a news release promoting the campaign events.\n\n\"While Kamala Harris desperately tries to run from her four years of failure for farmers, workers, and families across the state, Wisconsinites know that only President Trump can Make America Wealthy, Safe, Strong, and Great Again,\" the news release said.\n\n\u2014 Jessie Opoien\n\nHarris planning Fox Valley campaign stop Thursday in Wisconsin\n\nHarris will be returning to Wisconsin on Thursday to rally voters in the Fox Valley. The campaign hasn't yet confirmed her travel plans, but a Wisconsin Democrats advisory with a registration link went out to voters.\n\nHarris was last in Wisconsin in late September for a rally in Madison. The Fox Valley visit would be Harris' first to northeastern Wisconsin. Trump rallied in Green Bay in April for his first campaign stop of 2024, and running mate JD Vance was in De Pere recently.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat do the latest Trump-Harris polls show in Wisconsin?\n\nA new Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters will be released Wednesday afternoon, right in the middle of this week of campaign visits. The poll is considered one of the highest-quality surveys in the country.\n\nThe last poll, conducted between Aug. 28 and Sept. 5, showed Harris with a four-point lead over Trump. That was within the margin of error, as have been most Marquette polls this year in battleground Wisconsin.\n\nThe last poll also showed an important switch for Harris: For the first time, she led among voters who consider themselves \"very enthusiastic\" to vote. Harris closed an enthusiasm gap that presented problems for Biden, then pulled ahead of Trump in the latest poll.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp\n\nAbout 462,000 absentee ballots have been requested in Wisconsin\n\nElection Day is Nov. 5, but voting is well underway in Wisconsin. According to Sept. 30 data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, 461,704 voters have requested mail-in absentee ballots. About 87,000 of them have been returned by voters.\n\nEarly voting, which provides an opportunity to cast an absentee ballot at an in-person location, runs from Oct. 22 to Nov. 3 in Wisconsin. It's up to each city, town or village to decide how many dates, times and locations to offer.\n\nYou can register to vote, request an absentee ballot, look up what's on your ballot, find your polling place and more at myvote.wi.gov.\n\n\u2014 Hope Karnopp"

        "article_content": "Most times we ignore it, sometimes we fear it, but bottom line, wind is vital to the survival of our planet and is probably a bit more complex than you think.\n\nSimply put, wind is the movement of air. But what causes air to move in the first place? That is where it gets interesting.\n\nA world without wind\n\nPicture a world that was completely flat and motionless. This world has no changes in elevation, no changes in surface material (land vs. oceans etc). In this theoretical and boring world, the sun would heat each area exactly the same. This would be a world without wind.\n\nRelated: What is dew point?\n\nHow high and low pressure relate to wind\n\nThankfully, Earth is vastly different. We live on a constantly rotating, tilting sphere with large variations in land elevation and vast oceans. The sun heats each of these areas differently and therefore unevenly. This differential heating creates areas of high and low pressure, something we call the pressure gradient force.\n\nAir is constantly flowing from high pressure areas to lower pressure areas in an effort to balance out.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nThe Coriolis Force\n\nAir doesn't flow in a direct line from high to low pressure. Instead it is curved due to something called the Coriolis Force.\n\nThe Coriolis Force is caused by the Earth's rotation, and it directs air to flow clockwise around high pressure and counter-clockwise around low pressure.\n\nAir is also moving in a vertical direction. Areas of high pressure are characterized by sinking air, which tends to warm and lead to sunny, pleasant weather. In low pressure areas, the air rises, cools and condenses into clouds, leading to storms.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere all of those directions are reversed."

        "article_content": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 It doesn\u2019t feel like Christmas in Venezuela. At least not yet. Even if the president wants it to be. Residents of Caracas, the capital, woke up Tuesday to a towering Christmas tree standing in a popular public square, weeks after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared the jolly season would start earlier this year in the South American country.\n\nWorkers rushed to set up decorations in various neighborhoods, but the mood was far from festive.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s terrible because it\u2019s October,\u201d said Desir\u00e9 Aguiar, 32, before setting up her jewelry and accessories booth in a local market. \u201cHalloween hasn\u2019t even passed, and it\u2019s already Christmas? Are we celebrating them together?\u201d\n\nVenezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country\u2019s economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election .\n\n\u201cIf they start paying... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won\u2019t have anything left in December,\u201d Aguiar lamented. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really bad idea.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on Sept. 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever.\n\nMockery followed Maduro\u2019s decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision \u2014 another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro\u2019s predecessor , the late leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda.\n\nMaduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed.\n\nMaduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro\u2019s decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons.\n\n\u201cChristmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d Wilfredo Guti\u00e9rrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas.\n\n\u201cThe one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.\u201d\n\n___"

        "article_content": "Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], October 1: Gartner Digital Markets\u2013 the world\u2019s largest platform for finding software and services, including Capterra, GetApp, Software Advice, and UpCity\u2013recently convened the Insights Summit in India\u2019s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, Karnataka, to address the SaaS industry\u2019s pressing challenges. After a year of economic uncertainty, SaaS leaders seek innovative strategies to find efficient growth and secure their place on software buyer shortlists.\n\nThe Insights Summit featured a distinguished panel of speakers from Gartner Digital Markets, including Narayan Adeeb, VP of India Operations; Pit Rissiek, VP of Sales APAC and EMEA; and Saby Khanduja, Senior Sales Manager. Joining them on stage were SaaS leaders Dhivya Venkatesan, Head of Marketing at Sign easy, and Abhigna Kashyap, Senior Director and Global Head of Brand Content, and Social Media at LTI Mindtree.\n\nThe conference theme was \u201cSecuring Your Spot on Buyer Shortlists.\u201d The Insights Summit brought together 68 industry experts and thought leaders to provide actionable insights and best practices for SaaS businesses. Participants learned about the latest software buyer trends, emerging technologies, and effective marketing strategies to drive growth.\n\nThe event featured exclusive research that surveyed 3,500 software buyers and company decision-makers. The study focused on the challenges of software selection, the latest AI trends and buyer preferences, and strategies for software providers to optimise their performance on the Gartner Digital Markets platform. Additionally, participants had the opportunity to network with other India-based SaaS leaders seeking to accelerate their growth.\n\nGartner Digital Markets offers objective research and verified reviews to B2B companies searching for software in India through its Capterra India website. As a comprehensive resource, Capterra India is the country\u2019s go-to destination for software search. Software companies use the Gartner Digital Markets platform to reach active buyers and capture demand in India and worldwide.\n\nKey insights discussed in the Insights Summit included:\n\n* Optimistic SaaS spending is forecasted for 2025: 82% of companies surveyed plan to increase their software spending in 2025. India is the most confident of the countries surveyed, planning to increase its spending by 89%. Top priorities for software purchase are Cybersecurity (37%), IT management (31%), and AI (31%).\n\n* Customer reviews: Customer reviews are buyers\u2019 most influential information source for narrowing their initial purchase options and creating a shortlist of products (41%). Final purchase decisions are made predominantly after product trials (62%) and impressions made by the vendor\u2019s customer support (57%).\n\n* Buyer regret: Over half of companies have experienced regret over a technology purchase in the last year. The more a buyer relies solely on information from a vendor to buy software, the more often they experience regret. This makes it more necessary for vendors to boost their credibility through third parties.\n\n* AI adoption: More than a third of decision-makers plan to assess the value and risk of generative AI. From 2024 to 2025, there has been a 70% increase in organisations anticipating challenges evaluating the value and risk of generative AI.\n\nPit outlined Gartner Digital Markets\u2019 mission to assist software companies in building effective brands through profiles, reviews, and badges. He emphasised capturing in-market demand and gaining insights into market and product sentiment by analysing reviews of your product and competitors. Pit highlighted that building a compelling profile is crucial for brand positioning and noted that cost and pricing are the primary factors buyers consider when searching for software. He emphasised that reviews are pivotal in bringing credibility to your Gartner Digital Markets platform profile.\n\nThe event included a panel discussion headed by Saby Khanduja, during which marketing leaders Dhivya Venkatesan and Abhigna Kashyap discussed strategies for making their companies stand out to potential buyers. Topics covered included resource allocation, channel effectiveness, and reputation-building. The discussion was highly interactive, with participants engaging in lively Q&A sessions with the audience and sharing their experiences.\n\nReflecting on the Insights Summit\u2019s significance, Narayan Adeeb, VP of India Operations of Gartner Digital Markets, says, \u201cThe success of the Summit lies in the ambition that the software leaders brought with them along with their trust in us to help them build their brand and capture demand.

        "article_content": "Motorola may be catching up to companies like Samsung and Google regarding the number of years of Android updates it provides for its smartphones. A new Motorola phone could come with five years of updates, and it represents the second Motorola phone to do so in as many months.\n\nThe recently announced Motorola Moto G75 will come with five Android OS upgrades and six years of security patches. By our count, this would mean that users will be able to update their phone to at least Android 19, considering that the Moto G75 ships with Android 14. Last month, it was announced that the Motorola Edge 50 Neo would include five years of OS upgrades and security patches.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile five years of updates isn\u2019t as many as the seven years that companies like Samsung and Google promise, it still represents a significant increase from what Motorola had previously offered.\n\nMotorola confirms this update guarantee on its product page for the Moto G75, writing: \u201cKeep up with the latest version of Android by getting five OS upgrades \u2014 and six years of security updates \u2014 guaranteed through 2029.\u201d\n\nThe Motorola Moto G75 is a midrange smartphone with impressive features at its price point. It includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, a 6.78-inch Full HD+ LCD with a 120Hz refresh rate, and support for expandable storage via a microSD card of up to 1TB.\n\nThe new phone also boasts a 50-megapixel main primary camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and Quad Pixel technology and a 5,000mAh battery that supports 30-watt TurboPower wired and 15W wireless charging.\n\nThe new phone is available in Charcoal Gray, Aqua Blue, and Succulent Green. The Charcoal Gray model features a matte-finished back cover, while the Aqua Blue and Succulent Green models have vegan leather rear panels.\n\nIt looks like a very competent budget phone, though the real interest lies in its update policy. This is an area Motorola has long struggled with, and while it remains to be seen if the company actually makes good on this promise, it\u2019s a very encouraging step in the right direction.\n\nMotorola has not yet announced the pricing and availability details for the Moto G75."
