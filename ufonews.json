For instance, we recently happened upon a free AI web app called AirFry.AI that does one thing really well.\n\nAs the name suggests, this free tool is an AI assistant that helps you cook food in your air fryer. While air fryers are popular in part because they are so easy to use, they can require some trial and error when it comes to cooking times and temperatures for food. As such, you might end up scouring the web to find out how long to cook fries or chicken wings, and if you\u2019ve ever visited a recipe site, you know how far you have to scroll for the information you need.\n\nAirFry.AI is a useful and free AI tool. Image source: AirFry.AI\n\nAirFry.AI removes all of the hassle and tells you precisely what you need to know. Input the food you\u2019re trying to cook, choose between \u00b0C and \u00b0F, and click the \u201cAir Fry\u201d button. When I searched for \u201cfrozen tater tots,\u201d this was the answer: \u201cCook frozen tater tots in an air fryer at 400\u00b0F for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cooking. Enjoy your crispy tater tots!\u201d\n\nNo long-winded videos or lengthy stories about the author\u2019s great-great-grandmother\u2019s original tater tots from the 1800s.

These responses are often longer and more detailed, providing a list of ingredients and a numbered set of instructions. When I searched for \u201cgarlic chicken wings,\u201d AirFry.AI told me how much of each spice to include as well as instructions for mixing, marinating, preheating, and cooking.\n\nObviously, you could use ChatGPT or any other generative AI chatbot for similar purposes, but having it all set up ahead of time makes it less overwhelming."

        "date": "7h",
        "source": "Mint",
        "article_content": "Unlike many experts who are still awaiting a killer app in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), Naveen Rao, vice-president of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) at Databricks, says the world already has one -- it\u2019s coding.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of developers actually latch onto this, especially younger developers. LLMs (large language models) have also worked on code (besides text, images, audios, videos, etc.), and we're already seeing design automation happening through coding assistance. It (coding) is a sub-class of a much larger class of uses around true design automation,\" Rao told Mint in a recent video interview from his San Diego office.\n\nRao asserts that with many coding tasks getting automated, the ability to innovate in product design and create unique user experiences will become even more valuable.\n\n\"You can now create apps simply by describing them in English. As a result, the value of translating a design idea into an app has diminished because much of that process is now automated,\" he says.\n\nBeing a developer will mean using AI tools effectively, says Rao, adding that the focus will shift to understanding why certain apps succeed while others don\u2019t.\n\nRao underscores, though, that \u201cit will take 3-5 years to engineer these systems to be reliable and deterministic enough to be able to use them in core engineering.\" The reason is that GenAI still struggles with \u201challucinations\" (incorrect or misleading results) and lacks true reasoning capabilities despite claims to the contrary by some big tech companies.\n\nData is eating the world through AI\n\n\"Current LLMs primarily pattern-match based on probabilities, not reason. Unlike humans or even animals that learn through a cycle of action and feedback, LLMs don\u2019t engage in causal, real-world learning. While advancements, like the step-by-step reasoning introduced by OpenAI, are promising, there\u2019s a long way to go,\" elaborates Rao, who has a degree from Duke University in computer science and a PhD in computational neuroscience from Brown University.\n\nHe is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded AI companies Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for about $400 million, and MosaicML that was acquired by Databricks last July for $1.3 billion.\n\nWhat keeps Rao up at night is the gap between AI\u2019s potential and its current limitations, particularly in reasoning. According to him, AI models like DeepMind's AlphaZero, which hypothesize and learn through self-play in structured environments, provide a glimpse of what's possible, \u201cbut we\u2019re far from applying that in the real world.\"\n\n\u201cWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments,\" says Rao.\n\nThis push for reasoning, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily demand greater computing power, according to him. Instead, the shift is towards smaller, high-quality datasets and more targeted tuning, which may not require the massive compute resources associated with training larger models.\n\nRao says this transition from batch offline training to online learning could transform how we approach AI development going forward.\n\nWhy software won\u2019t eat the AI world\n\nRao also insists that software will not eat the AI world, referring to co-founder of US VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Andreessen's famous 2011 essay titled, \"Why software is eating the world\". In a 30 August thread on 'X' (formerly, Twitter), Rao argued that the \"...fundamental balance of compute and software is different with AI...In light of @nvidia's strong growth and recent earnings, clearly hardware is an essential ingredient to the current wave of AI\u2026\"\n\nRao says he's more \u201cexcited about the ongoing evolution of hardware, which continues to drive efficiency and lower costs.\" He cites the example of the human brain, which operates on just 20 watts of energy, \u201cshowcasing how far we still are from creating AI systems as efficient and advanced.\" He adds that there's significant progress being made in how AI systems interact with hardware, improving latency, cost, and accuracy.\n\nDatabricks, for instance, is exploring \u201cseveral exciting applications of AI and GenAI, particularly in task automation and creative processes,\" according to Rao. One area of focus is automating tasks like answering human resources (HR) queries or searching through company manuals, where \u201cyou can tolerate some error.\"\n\nYou can now create apps simply by describing them in English.\n\nAnother innovative use involves training LLMs to replicate a specific writing style, aiding news organisations by speeding up content creation. Databricks also supports the use of LLMs in scientific research, such as drug discovery, where AI assists in analysing protein interactions and advancing new drug development.\n\nDatabricks has been recognised as a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for data science and machine learning platforms, 'The Forrester Wave: Cloud Data Pipelines, Q4 2023,\" and the 2024 IDC MarketScape for worldwide analytic stream processing.\n\nKey customers using the Databricks' data intelligence platform to streamline data, AI, and analytics processes include Adobe, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation, Nasdaq, Air India, Parle, MakeMyTrip, Meesho, Tata Steel, and Shell.\n\nData is the AI oil\n\nDatabricks' DBRX model, for instance, can turn raw data into a fully trained, fine-tuned model. Databricks, says Rao, is now focusing on \"compound AI systems,\" which combine multiple AI models, including open-source and proprietary ones, to create advanced solutions. Using this approach, Databricks helped Factset, a financial software provider, improve its query accuracy and efficiency.\n\nData is an essential ingredient in making AI truly add economic value. So maybe now the mantra is: \u201cData is eating the world through AI\", says Rao.\n\nThat said, many companies struggle to bridge the gap between data readiness and effective AI implementation. A key challenge, says Rao, is to understand the economics of AI, which differs significantly from traditional software models like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), where many applications can run on a single piece of hardware.\n\nAI models, on the other hand, require dedicated physical infrastructure for each additional user. This, according to Rao, implies that scaling AI would involve costly hardware investments, resulting in lower gross margins (often below 20%) as compared to SaaS. On the development side, rising costs make profitability difficult, particularly as larger companies continue to raise capital and operate at a loss.\n\nIn this context, the key metric for CXOs when integrating AI is \u201cdefining clear success criteria.\" In AI, especially with custom LLMs, this involves creating an evaluation system, much like an exam, to measure the performance of the AI system, says Rao.\n\nHe adds that Databricks offers various tools for optimisation, such as re-ranking and fine-tuning models, which help improve performance. Establishing and refining these metrics is crucial for successful AI deployment.\n\nHe cites the example of Ola's Krutrim, which is one of Databricks\u2019 customers that built its own AI model using the platform, rather than relying on pre-existing models. Other customers like Freshworks and Air India are using custom LLMs and compound AI systems to automate tasks such as chatbots that assist with queries about baggage policies or refunds, according to Rao.\n\nOla\u2019s model is particularly notable, according to him, due to India's linguistic diversity, where multiple languages such as Hindi, English, and regional languages, are mixed in daily communication.\n\nNew skill sets\n\nThat said, Rao agrees that AI will have a deep impact on jobs, especially given the increasing use of copilots and fully autonomous AI agentic systems in enterprises. Autonomous AI agents, or the so-called 'Agentic AI' systems, refer to AI models that can achieve specific goals without any human intervention.\n\nIt's clear we must decide how humans remain integral to the process, says Rao. Databricks is working on this by developing tools that help customers build high-quality AI agents.\n\nThese agents go beyond simple tasks, automating complex processes using customer data to drive value. However, enterprise customers demand transparency, auditability, and security, making this a challenging area, according to Rao.\n\nWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments\n\nHe adds, \"AI will significantly change jobs, much like other technological advances have in the past. As AI advances, the key skills will include data engineering, system orchestration, product design and AI tool usage.\"\n\nBalancing innovation with responsible AI is also crucial, particularly regarding data privacy, bias, and transparency, Rao acknowledges. Databricks, he adds, excels in governance, with its Unity Catalog ensuring strict security across data and models.\n\nHe elaborates that while bias is application-specific and difficult to automate, Databricks offers filtering tools that allow companies to manage inputs and outputs, ensuring privacy, safety, and content moderation. However, these tools are designed to be flexible and customizable to suit various customer needs.\n\nDo we need a Chief AI Officer?\n\nGiven the complexity of the field, do enterprises need a Chief AI Officer? Especially, given that many large organisations already have senior executive roles like that of a chief information officer (CIO), chief technology officer (CTO), chief data officer, chief digital officer, and even a chief marketing officer (CMO), who oversee a lot of AI functions.\n\nAlso Read: TCS boss Krithivasan is unafraid of GenAI but unwilling to say the worst is past\n\nRao agrees, pointing out that companies reacted to the AI boom by rushing to integrate AI and hiring for this role without clear boundaries, leading to conflicts over budgets and responsibilities. According to him, a more practical solution may be combining data and AI into a Chief Data and AI Officer role, separating these duties from the broader productivity-focused role of a CIO.\n\nLast, but not the least, Rao says that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often misinterpreted. Some define it by how much human productivity it can replace, but true AGI would need to interact with the world, learn from its actions, and adapt\u2014something far beyond the current technology, he explains. He suggests that while AGI remains a distant goal, companies should focus on how AI can improve business processes and customer experiences today."

You know your house, you know when things don't feel quite right.\u201d\n\nHarris advises to try and be logical (Discovery+)\n\nAnomalous Sounds\n\nGhai says this one crops \u2018up time and time again\u2019 in cases he sees where people hear everything from \u2018whispering and chatting to actual spoken words\u2019.\n\n\u201cOr in the more sinister cases, someone whose voice is familiar to you,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s that mimicking sound - so your mum calling your name, but your mum's not there.\n\n\u201cThat kind of thing that happens a lot.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s a haunting\n\nWhile all of these can be classed as key signs of a haunting by the pros, obviously, you do need to rationalise as Harris says you shouldn\u2019t just \u2018assume\u2019 that\u2019s what it means.\n\n\u201cCheck for the logical things,\u201d she advises, urging to double check that windows are closed and the radiator\u2019s working if you get those cold spots.\n\n\u201cBecause it's only when you rule out all of those logical explanations that you're left with potentially a paranormal case,\u201d Harris adds.\n\nBut she does warn that once you\u2019re properly suspicious there is something in your house you should get \u2018professional advice\u2019.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and communicate with whatever you think might be there if you're not experienced in doing it, because it can make things worse,\u201d she warns.\n\nSpooky.\n\nSeries six of Help! My House is Haunted airs on Really, Fridays at 9pm. It\u2019s also available to stream on Discovery+."

        "article_content": "A breakthrough discovery of a new blood protein will finally help doctors identify patients whose immune systems react violently against nearly all blood transfusions.\n\nFor over half a century, a set of rare but devastating complications from simple blood transfusions have been linked to the elusive absence of a key immune-system triggering 'antigen' molecule, known as the AnWj blood group antigen.\n\nBut now a team of researchers in the UK have identified which compound found in 99.9 percent of human blood carries this AnWj antigen. They call it the 'Mal' protein.\n\nThis 50-year-old cold case was cracked by blood detectives with the UK's National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) group \u2014 who are routinely tasked with these kinds of medical mysteries by healthcare providers across the globe.\n\n'Often if the labs cannot resolve it we have to do a lot more work,' Nicole Thornton of the NHSBT's red blood cell lab said. 'That is where the interesting cases come from.'\n\nA team of researchers in the UK have identified which compound found in 99.9 percent of human blood carries the AnWj antigen, which they call the Mal protein. The breakthrough will help doctors finally identify patients whose bodies react violently against blood transfusions\n\nThe four major blood types, and their positive or negative variations, are all defined by the presence or absence of two key antigens, A and B, alongside another protein called the Rh factor, whose presence equates to the so-called positive blood types.\n\n'Since some antigens can trigger a patient's immune system to attack the transfused blood, safe blood transfusions depend on careful blood typing and cross-matching,' as the American Red Cross notes in their explainer on the issue.\n\nWhile the new discovery will likely be much too obscure to merit common use alongside the eight most common blood types (A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+ and AB-), its identification could help save hundreds of lives each year, researchers estimated.\n\nThornton, the head of NHSBT's International Blood Group Reference Laboratory 'Red Cell Reference,' her team and scientists with the University of Bristol worked with a variety of blood samples and tools to finally identify where the AnWj antigens reside.\n\nTheir work even included a 2015 sample given by the anonymous woman who was the first person to have ever been discovered to be 'AnWj negative' in the 1970s.\n\n'Mal is a very small protein with some interesting properties which made it difficult to identify,' said Dr Tim Satchwell, who assisted the investigation while he was a Research Fellow at the University of Bristol.\n\n'We needed to pursue multiple lines of investigation to accumulate the proof we needed to establish this blood group system,' Dr Satchwell told reporters in a press statement.\n\nThe decisive factor proved to be a method called 'whole exome sequencing,' a more cost effective and tailored form of whole genome sequencing that focuses solely on the DNA from a given patient that encodes or creates proteins.\n\nThis process helped the team lock-in on the rare genetic cases whereby DNA sequence deletions in the MAL gene prevented encoding of the Mal protein.\n\n'We would not have achieved this without exome sequencing,' Louise Tilley, a senior research scientist with NHSBT's Red Cell Reference said in a statement.\n\n'The gene we identified wasn't an obvious candidate and little is known about Mal protein in red cells,' she noted.\n\nThe MAL gene that was deleted in these rare cases gets its names from the 'Myelin and lymphocyte' (Mal) protein it encodes.\n\nMal proteins \u2014 'multi-pass membrane proteolipids' coated in fatty lipid molecules \u2014 appear to play an essential role in the movement of cells through the blood stream as well as the stability of cell membranes.\n\nAbove, two men donating blood this July at the West End Donor Centre in London, England\n\n'AnWj-positive individuals were shown to express full-length Mal on their red cell membranes, which was not present on the membranes of AnWj-negative individuals,' the team noted in their new study for the journal Blood.\n\n'The genetic background of AnWj has been a mystery for more than 50 years, and one which I personally have been trying to resolve for almost 20 years of my career,' Tilley told reporters.\n\n'It represents a huge achievement,' she added, 'and the culmination of a long team effort to finally establish this new blood group system and be able to offer the best care to rare, but important, patients.'\n\nAs Tilley emphasized to the BBC, it is 'quite difficult to a put a number' to just how many people will benefit from the newly identified Mal protein.\n\nBut, she noted that \u2014 every year \u2014 the NHSBT is typically the last hope for as many as 400 patients from across the world.\n\nIn their new study, Tilley and her colleagues reported that 'the most common reason for being AnWj-negative is due to suffering from a hematological disorder or some types of cancer which suppress antigen expression.'\n\nHematologic diseases, which afflict millions of Americans, include rare genetic disorders, sickle cell disease, conditions related to HIV, and complications from treatments like chemotherapy or blood transfusions.\n\n'Only a very small number of people are AnWj-negative due to a genetic cause,' the team noted. Among them: 'five genetically AnWj negative individuals in the study including a family of Arab-Israelis.'\n\nIt's these genetically AnWj-negative patients who will benefit most from Mal's discovery \u2014 as new lab tests will be devised to help pair them with the correct blood for any needed transfusions.\n\nNicole Thornton - the head of the NHSBT\u2019s International Blood Group Reference Laboratory 'Red Cell Reference' - holds a vile of the blood used to crack the 50-year-old AnWj mystery\n\n'Resolving the genetic basis for AnWj has been one of our most challenging projects,' Thornton said.\n\n'Now genotyping tests can be designed to identify genetically AnWj-negative patients and donors. Such tests can be added to the existing genotyping platforms.'\n\nOne staffer at Thornton's 'Red Cell Reference,' Philip Brown, explained that he himself had been diagnosed with a form of leukemia about 20 years ago that required life-saving blood transfusions and a bone marrow transplant.\n\n'Anything we can do to make our blood much safer and a better match for patients is a definite step in the right direction,' he said."

In the first eight months of 2022, the US saw 15.47 billion visitors to piracy websites .\n\nIn the first eight months of 2022, the . In 2023, software piracy was a major contributor to revenue loss for 40% of software suppliers \u2013 up from just 17% the year before.\n\nIn 2023, software piracy was \u2013 up from just 17% the year before. In 2023, as many as 33% of IT companies reported losing 6\u201310% of their revenue to software piracy, and 8% even said that the loss exceeded 30%.\n\nIllegal Software Downloads Statistics\n\nTo kick things off, we\u2019ll take a look at the numbers and figures on illegally downloaded software over the last few years.\n\nHow Much Software is Pirated\n\nOverall, software was the second-most-pirated type of media in 2023, after TV shows, making up 26.2% of the pirated items on the web that year.\n\nAnd although in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic (2017 specifically), the level of software piracy dropped from 39% to 37%, the pandemic years saw it go up again by 20-30%.\n\nMuso reports that in 2023, there have been 15.2 billion visits to software piracy websites worldwide. That figure is a 14.1% YoY increase from 8.75 billion visitors registered in the first eight months of 2022.\n\nThese eight months showed a 10% increase in software piracy compared to 2021.\n\nFrom January 2017 until November 2023, there were approximately 84.77 billion visits to software piracy websites. That\u2019s like every person on Earth visiting software piracy sites 10 times on average over this period.\n\nBSA tells us that almost 37% of all software on users\u2019 PCs is pirated. The market value of this unlicensed software is $46.3 billion.\n\nWhat Software is Pirated & How\n\nAs the following chart shows, mobile software was the most commonly pirated software in 2023, accounting for 36% of all illegal software downloads.\n\nIt was closely followed by desktop software at 30%. Moreover, it\u2019s estimated that as much as 37% of software worldwide is unlicensed.\n\nIn terms of how the software has been pirated, the 2021 Muso report states that 73.5% of it was illegally downloaded from the web and the rest from torrenting sites.\n\nThe data tells us that 100% of all illegally downloaded software was pirated through web downloads in 2022 and 2023.\n\nMost of the traffic (61.5%) was direct in 2022, but in 2023, 42% of it was via search engines when people looked for software piracy.\n\nSoftware Piracy Statistics by Region\n\nSoftware piracy is prevalent in many regions around the world. However, certain regions suffer more from it than others.\n\nAs this chart shows, piracy is particularly prevalent in China, Russia, the US, and India. Ukraine and Italy were also among the top 10 countries for piracy.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the biggest regions in the world for more details on software piracy.\n\nEMEA\n\nEurope may have robust anti-piracy laws, such as the EU Copyright Directive and the CPDA in the UK. But it nonetheless is home to significant software piracy.\n\nFor instance, the UK is among the top 20 countries for using pirated software.\n\nIn 2021, there were approximately 2.7 million British infringers of software copyrights, as you\u2019ll see in the chart below. Moreover, as many as 38% of surveyed Brits had pirated software in 2022.\n\nThe post-pandemic spike in piracy is likely due to the increasingly high cost of living in the UK.\n\nOther countries in the region have similar problems. For example, Russia accounted for over 8.5% of all software piracy worldwide in 2023.\n\nThis isn\u2019t surprising, given the international sanctions and software companies pulling out of the region due to the geopolitical situation.\n\nUkraine and Italy take the seventh and ninth spots among the top 20 countries that use pirated software.\n\nIran is another country in the EMEA region that\u2019s subject to sanctions that restrict the use of certain software, so it\u2019s not surprising that Iran ranked eighth.\n\nThe Americas\n\nIn the Americas, the US, Brazil, and Mexico are leaders in illegal software downloads, ranking among the top 20 countries for software piracy.\n\nThe US ranked third in the world in 2023 for software piracy, and this is actually an improvement. One year prior, the US was top of the list for the highest rates of software piracy.\n\nIn the first eight months of 2022 alone, the US had seen 15.47 billion visitors to piracy websites.\n\nAs for the previous years, as you can see from the graph above, the US and Brazil had relatively small shares of visitors to software piracy sites.\n\nThe largest shares in that time period (2020\u20132021) were held by Russia (7.2% to 8.02%) and China (see below).\n\nAPAC\n\nAccording to BSA, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region has the highest rate of software piracy in the world \u2013 61%. Given the number of APAC countries in the top 20 countries for software piracy, this isn\u2019t surprising.\n\nTake China, for example. In 2021, China had the highest number of visitors to software piracy websites in the world. In Q3 of 2021 alone, China had 467 million people visiting software piracy websites.\n\nThe figure made up 14.6% of all software privacy site visitors in the world that quarter (3.2 billion).\n\nHowever, in 2022, India shortly overtook China, becoming the third country for piracy rates, after the USA and Russia.\n\nHowever, according to Revenera, as of 2023, the PRC (excluding Hong Kong) is once again the leader in software piracy worldwide.\n\nOther APAC countries in the top 20 are Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, and Australia. Regarding Australia in particular, BSA reports that 20% of Aussies use pirated software.\n\nImpact of Software Piracy on the Market\n\nIn 2023, software piracy was a major cause of revenue loss for 40% of software suppliers \u2013 up from just 17% the year before.\n\nThis significant increase is a testament to the huge adverse impact of software piracy on the market. In 2023, as many as 33% of IT companies reported losing 6\u201310% of their revenue to software piracy.\n\n8% even said that the loss exceeded 30% of revenue. Moreover, 15% of companies don\u2019t even know how much they\u2019re losing to piracy.\n\nIn addition to financial impacts, software piracy can adversely impact a brand\u2019s reputation. In many cases, pirated software isn\u2019t subject to quality control and can have a negative impact on user experience.\n\nMoreover, in 2022, as many as 50% of people who downloaded pirated content, including software, reported malware infecting their devices.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that software is a type of creative work, and pirating it is just as harmful to creators as pirating music or books.\n\nIn practice, this erosion of IP stifles programmers\u2019 creativity and harms their competitive advantage and revenue.\n\nAddressing Software Piracy\n\nThe issue of software privacy is complex, and combating it requires a multifaceted approach. The stakeholders involved are legislators, technical experts, and educators, to name a few.\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll go over the building blocks of combating software piracy, including legislative and technical measures.\n\nLaws & Regulations\n\nSeveral international laws, such as the Berne Convention and the TRIPS agreement, standardize protection against any sort of piracy, including software.\n\nMany countries have adopted their own laws on a local level, such as the Digital Economy Act in the UK.\n\nHowever, the enforcement of such laws, on both a local and global scale, depends on the police\u2019s capacity and international cooperation.\n\nIn addition to the legislation, there are a lot of case law and lawsuits illustrating the impact of software piracy. For instance:\n\nBITMANAGEMENT SOFTWARE GMBH vs. The United States (2016\u20132022), which saw the US Navy pay out almost $155,000 for the illegal use of 3D modeling software.\n\nBITMANAGEMENT SOFTWARE GMBH vs. The United States (2016\u20132022), which saw the US Navy pay out almost $155,000 for the illegal use of 3D modeling software. Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot vs. J. Doe (2022\u2013 present), where developers sued Microsoft and OpenAI for allegedly pirating the developers\u2019 software to train AI systems. The case is still undecided.\n\nThese cases, as well as others, prove the adverse economic impact of software piracy. However, they also evidence the fact that the existing piracy protections aren\u2019t always sufficient.\n\nFor instance, the German software company that sued the US Navy in the 2016 case received much less than the original $155.4 million in damages it claimed.\n\nAnd a month ago, the judge in the Copilot case partially dismissed some piracy claims.\n\nTechnical Measures\n\nDigital Rights Management (DRM) tools represent an important technical measure against software piracy. Such solutions are already widely used by creators and companies to protect their IP, such as software.\n\nFor software products, DRMs can range from license activation keys and cloud verification to digital watermarking and geographical restrictions.\n\nPopular business software subscription models like SaaS are also a type of DRM in a way, as they allow users to subscribe to the software rather than own a copy of it.\n\nSuch DRM methods can be effective. But they can also be frustrating for consumers, as they\u2019re often seen as limiting fair use.\n\nWhat Does the Future of Software Piracy Look Like?\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear what will await the murky digital landscape of software piracy. Based on current trends and how rapidly piracy methods are evolving, we believe the issue will only persist.\n\nBefore new laws and anti-piracy protections catch up, we might see a few new privacy developments.\n\nNew Methods of Piracy\n\nWith the advancements and developments of DRMs like SaaS, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that software piracy methods will also advance beyond what we know today.\n\nAnd while AI can help combat these threats, we should also consider how it can assist malicious actors with new piracy approaches, such as reverse engineering.\n\nFor instance, given that SaaS is hosted on the cloud, pirates may target that infrastructure in the future to access the platforms.\n\nAchieving that would require employing social engineering and phishing to steal credentials \u2013 two tactics prevalent in cybercrime today.\n\nNew Types of Piracy\n\nIn addition to new methods of piracy, the prevalence of SaaS and other subscription models might also encourage the development of new types of piracy.\n\nIt\u2019s true that cloud-based SaaS deployment makes it challenging to download and distribute copies like traditional software pirates usually do.\n\nHowever, the shift to a subscription model can cause increased instances of unauthorized account sharing and the rise of illegal monetization of subscription credentials.\n\nTo address this potential issue, companies might have to invest in more sophisticated DRM systems. For example, they can be powered by blockchain technologies.\n\nSuch technologies would help track the usage of SaaS licenses and curb unauthorized use.\n\nEnforcement Challenges\n\nEarlier, we touched upon the challenges of international cooperation in software piracy law enforcement.\n\nThe global nature of the Internet and the cloud, economic disparities, and international sanctions worsen these challenges.\n\nFor instance, although many SaaS companies have left Russia, their software is still available thanks to the country\u2019s relaxed piracy laws.\n\nIt\u2019s, therefore, challenging for companies like Microsoft to enforce licensing restrictions in such sanctioned regions.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nSoftware piracy is a complex issue that remains prevalent today. In this guide, we reviewed the software piracy statistics around the world in recent years.\n\nWe saw that the APAC region takes the crown for software piracy, but Russia and the US aren\u2019t far behind. We also saw that software piracy adversely impacts the software market and the tech industry as a whole.\n\nAnd yet, addressing software piracy remains a significant challenge, not least due to tech advancements and ever-evolving piracy methods. Enforcement of piracy and copyright laws is also difficult in many jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, technological advancements can also help hinder malicious actors. The key is to employ them smartly and have robust enforcement frameworks in place.\n\nSources"
