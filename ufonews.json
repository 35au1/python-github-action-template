            "article_content": "A new documentary claims it is going to expose the 80-year long cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life.\n\nThe Age of Disclosure is directed and produced by Dan Farah and features contributions from 34 members of the US government, military and intelligence community.\n\nIn the UFO documentary it is claimed that for the past 80 years the existence of intelligent life beyond humans has been kept a secret and that governments around the world have been locked in a secret conflict with one another to use this alien technology for their own benefit.\n\nAdvert\n\nOver in the US the UAP Disclosure Act was introduced in the senate, with the aim of this thing to publicly disclose what the US government knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena.\n\nThese are essentially things which happen in the air, sea or in space which can't be explained as being man made or occurring from some natural phenomenon that we know of.\n\nIf there are things happening which cannot be explained by what we know about ourselves and our planet then they're UAPs, and this act will release information about them which has been kept secret from us.\n\nIn the trailer for The Age of Disclosure, former Defense Intelligence Agency official Jay Stratton claims to have seen 'non-human craft and non-human beings' with his own eyes.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe truth is out there. (Youtube/The Age Of Disclosure)\n\nIn the trailer he said: \"The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\"\n\nHe praised the documentary on social media, saying: \"The Age of Disclosure is the most revelatory, credible, and historic documentary ever made about UAP, non-human intelligent life, the Government\u2019s involvement, and the bi-partisan disclosure effort.\"\n\nIf that's true then this is pretty much what all those UFO hunters and true believers have been waiting for, someone saying they have been a first-hand witness to the evidence of non-human intelligent life.\n\nAdvert\n\nAmong the other contributors to the documentary are various high ranking US politicians including the director of national intelligence during Barack Obama's time in office.\n\nMeanwhile, senior CIA official Jim Semivan claimed that 'UAPs are here, they are real and they are not human'.\n\nFormer Department of Defense official Christopher Mellon called it the 'biggest discovery in human history' while his fellow former DoD member Luis Elizondo said there was 'information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species'.\n\nIs this what we've all been waiting for?"

I never went looking for the paranormal, it found me,\u201d he said.\n\nJust as his fascination with the Buoys and Timothy \u2014 he was the founder and publisher on the rock magazine Timothy which later became Pennsylvania Musician \u2014 led to the paranormal aspects of the Sheppton book \u201cCoal Region Hoodoo\u201d which led him to Bigfoot. The Bigfoot book evolved from two chapters in his \u201cCoal Region Hoodoo\u201d book.\n\nFurek, who splits his time between his hometown Mocanaqua and Hernando, Florida, said his Bigfoot research has struck a nerve within the believers\u2019 community.\n\nChapters in Coal Region Hoodoo \u2014\u201dThe Bigfoot Enigma\u201d and \u201cThe Bigfoot Hypothesis\u201d \u2014opened a few doors for him.\n\nHe was interviewed on Art Bell\u2019s \u201cMidnight in the Desert\u201d radio show and by George Noory on the \u201cCoast to Coast\u201d radio show which airs on over 600 affiliates and is considered the top paranormal show in the country by many in the paranormal community. York County\u2019s Fox TV 43 chose Coal Region Hoodoo as the Book of the Month in October 2023.\n\nThis year, interest in his paranormal research isn\u2019t slowing down. He\u2019s been invited for the second time to the the Central Pennsylvania Bigfoot and Cryptid Festival and conferences in Baltimore and Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s like an extended family. Everybody knows everybody else,\u201d he said of the paranormal community.\n\nIn 23 chapters over 197 pages, \u201cThe Lost Tribes of Bigfoot\u201d explores all the well-known Bigfoot sightings from the origin story to Chestnut Ridge, an area in the Laurel Highlands in Western Pennsylvania known as a hotbed for sightings. He also writes about hoaxes including The Piltdown Man and The Minnesota Iceman. He devotes a couple chapters to the hoaxers, a pet peeve.\n\nAsked why it was important for him to call out the hoaxers, he said, \u201cThey damage the reputation of legitimate paranormal research and need to be called out.\u201d\n\nAsked about interviewing Bigfoot witnesses, he said, \u201cOne guy from western Pennsylvania claimed that he has PTSD from seeing a Bigfoot at 15 feet. A neighbor of mine saw two Bigfoot creatures outside of Mocanaqua. I questioned him about it several times and all his responses seemed credible. An elderly guy from Catawissa told a police officer that he wasn\u2019t scared when he saw a Bigfoot because the creature had \u2018kind eyes.\u2019 The stories have a commonality, but they are all unique. Remember, too, that about three percent of anomalous sightings remain unexplained. People are seeing things.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s his own take on Bigfoot\u2019s existence? \u201cI\u2019m not a true believer or zealot. I\u2019m just fascinated with paranormal themes and looking for answers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only theory that makes sense is that an interdimensional pathway may link our reality to somewhere else. It\u2019s a theory explored by Einstein, Tesla, and others and may provide the key to understanding the universe\u2019s secrets.\u201d\n\nThe book is available in paperback and digital versions at amazon.com., hanger1publishing.com, and maximfurek.com."

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "\u2018A million dollars isn\u2019t cool; you know what\u2019s cool? A billion dollars!\u2019\n\nHollywood movie buffs will remember this iconic line by the fictional Sean Parker to the Mark Zuckerberg character in the film The Social Network. It\u2019s a scene that succinctly captures a crucial moment in the early days of Facebook, where Parker explains how valuable Facebook could be.\n\nBack then, a billion dollars was considered big and super cool. Since then, the world has moved on to trillion dollars in market cap for a few companies including Facebook (Meta Platforms). The more the number of zeroes following a non-zero number, the more cool it was. But that was only until the release of DeepSeek R1 last week\u2014the open source AI model that many experts consider to be revolutionary. Marc Andreesen, co-founder and general partner at one of the most successful and largest technology VC firms, termed DeepSeek R1 as \u2018one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014and as open source, a profound gift to the world\u2019.\n\nPioneers and arrows in the back\n\nAI pioneer OpenAI was valued at a whopping $157 billion at the time of its latest fund-raising event in October 2024 (Andreesen Horowitz is an investor in Open AI). For a company which, based on estimates, is likely to have made revenue of around $3.7 billion and losses of $5 billion in 2024, the $157-billion valuation reflects an unprecedented level of future growth expectations loaded in!\n\nBut now, questions will rise on the bloated valuations that OpenAI and some of the listed Magnificent Seven companies\u2014Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms Nvidia and Tesla\u2014command. All these companies have an AI element that has pushed up their valuations. These will come into question now.\n\nDeepSeek R1 has proven that a competitive LLM can be apparently built at roughly 3 per cent of the cost at which the US companies have built their best models. While there is a view from Alexandr Wang of Scale AI that Chinese AI labs (including DeepSeek) could be under reporting the Nvidia GPUs they have as they could have got it in violation of US chip export control restrictions. Even considering this speculative point, DeepSeek R1 costs are substantially lower.\n\nDeepSeek, in essence, has done to Silicon Valley what many Silicon Valley companies had done to each other\u2014history is loaded with examples of many companies that were pioneers in their field, but were outdone by a few who copied them and then did a better job\u2014Yahoo-Google, Nokia/Motorola/Blackberry-Apple, Myspace-Facebook etc. Many pioneers have ended with arrows in the back.\n\nAlong with this, DeepSeek is also sending a message \u2014 \u2018A billion dollars isn\u2019t cool, you know what\u2019s cool? A million dollars!\u2019 It\u2019s far cooler to build AI capabilities with a few million dollars, rather than pouring in billions. Maybe as Warren Buffet said, \u2018a fat wallet is the enemy of superior investments.\u2019\n\nWith over $200 billion of capex by just 5 of the Magnificent Seven companies in 2024, and with their capex expected to surge even more in 2025 to solidify their AI fortresses, these US Big Tech companies might now be pushed back to their drawing boards and reassess their approach to investing in AI. Investor scrutiny in assessing the ROI on these investments may also increase.\n\nThis will have implications for the AI rally from here. Last week could have well been an inflexion point in the AI boom."

            "article_content": "Photo Credit:\n\nGame Changer Ultra HD 5.1 Audio Version Leaked: Ram Charan and Shankar's epic collaboration for a political action entertainer titled Game Changer was released amid expectations on January 10, kickstarting the prestigious Sankranthi season's box office in Tollywood. The movie stars a bunch of renowned actors playing different roles in a set-up envisioned by Shankar's typical style of larger-than-life sets, exorbitant sequences, and specifics. The movie now became the first mega flop of Tollywood in 2025.\n\nGame Changer marks the 15th film in the careers of Ram Charan and Shankar. Kiara Advani was paired opposite Ram Charan for the second time and the theatrical trailer promised a racy commercial actioner. However, Game Changer bankrolled on a budget of about Rs 400 Crore, which was met with mixed to largely negative reviews from audiences, critics, and fans. However, the movie is clinging to its Telugu and Hindi versions at the box office.\n\nAlthough this Shankar's directorial fell prey to the piracy mafia immediately after its theatrical release, the fact that Game Changer movie's Ultra HD version with 5.1 Audio getting leaked online came as a severe disappointment to the fans. The movie is struggling to make an impact at the box office and on top of it, the piracy impact was rather huge on it. There is also a buzz that Game Changer will end up making its OTT debut very soon. More details will be revealed shortly.\n\nGame Changer Synopsis\n\nRam Nandan IAS is the district Collector of Visakhapatnam who takes charge. He is a dedicated officer and goes to any end to implement justice. His commitment to work puts him face-to-face with Bobbili Mopidevi (SJ Suryah), son of Chief Minister Sathyamurthy (Srikanth). As things get tighter, Sathyamurthy throws a surprise by announcing Ram as his heir for the CM's position. What Happens Next? Who are Ram's parents? Why did Sathyamurthy do what he did? What did Mopidevi do to win back his power and rights? Follow the story of Game Changer.\n\nGame Changer Cast\n\nThe movie stars Ram Charan as H Ram Nandan IAS, H Charan IPS, and Appanna, and Vijay Balram. Kiara Advani and Anjali played the two female leads, with S.J. Suryah, Prakash Raj, Nassar, Samuthirakani, Srikanth, Sushanth, Jayaram, Praveena, Naveen Chandra, Vatsan Chakravarthy, Murali Sharma, Murali Sharma, Harish Uthaman, Sunil, Subhalekha Sudhakar, Rajeev Kanakala, Priyadarshi Pulikonda, and Chaitanya Krishna among others played important characters in the political drama.\n\nGame Changer Crew\n\nWritten by Karthik Subbaraj, the movie directed by Shankar has dialogues penned by Sai Madhav Burra. Bankrolled by Dil Raju and Sirish under the Sri Venkateswara Creations and Zee Studios, S. Thaman composed the film's entire sound and music. Tirru worked as the cinematographer and Shameer Muhammed along with Ruben took care of the editing.\n\nDISCLAIMER- FILMIBEAT doesn't support or promote piracy as it is a criminal offence under the Copyright Act of 1957.

            "article_content": "A breakthrough discovery, the coins are worth around \u00a3258,000.\n\nThe discovery, made near the village of Holzthum in northern Luxembourg, includes 141 gold solidi, coins minted under the rule of nine Roman emperors between 364 and 408 AD. Found near the base of a burgus\u2014a fortified Roman watchtower used for military observation\u2014the coins are believed to have belonged to high-ranking military officers. \u201cThis is a major archaeological discovery, as it is extremely rare to study an intact ancient monetary deposit within its original archaeological context,\u201d announced Luxembourg's National Institute for Archaeological Research (INRA). The hoard\u2019s sheer size and exceptional condition have stunned researchers. Each solidus weighs around 4.5 grams of nearly pure gold, amounting to over 6 kilograms. Rebecca Usherwood, an Assistant Professor in Late Antique and Early Byzantine Studies at Trinity College Dublin, described the discovery as extraordinary.\n\nA Gallo-Roman site located in Echternach, Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cThis represents a huge amount of personal wealth for the individual or group who collected these coins,\u201d said Prof Usherwood. \u201cMost people in the Roman Empire would rarely, if ever, have seen a single gold coin. To find this many indicates the owner was of considerable social standing, likely a military officer rather than a common soldier.\u201d The coins, which were typically used for imperial gifts or military payments, are thought to reflect the site's strategic importance. The area where the hoard was found marked the edge of the Roman Empire, an area heavily fortified against external threats. Among the most notable coins are three bearing the image of Emperor Eugenius, who ruled for just two tumultuous years (392\u2013394 AD). Eugenius, supported by the Western Roman general Arbogast, attempted to revive pagan traditions but was defeated by the Christian Eastern Emperor Theodosius I at the Battle of Frigidus in 394 AD. Coins from Eugenius\u2019 brief reign are particularly rare, adding to the significance of the find. The solidi were uncovered during a series of excavations conducted between 2020 and 2024. Luxembourg\u2019s Army Mine Action Service was involved due to nearby unexploded ordnance from World War II. The discovery was kept secret for nearly four years to protect the site and its findings. Luxembourg law stipulates that the treasure\u2019s estimated value of $322,000 (\u00a3257,919) belongs to those with legal claims to the land.\n\nJust two of the hoard of Roman coins discovered.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If you have faith in Philadelphia, consider taking the Eagles +10.5 (-2500 odds). Washington backers can take the Commanders +23.5 (-2200 odds).\n\nIf prop betting is more up your alley, I recommend betting Saquon Barkley to rush for 60+ yards (-1900 odds).

I\u2019m losing faith, and I\u2019m not alone AMD could still make the RX 9070 XT a success\n\nIt looks like I may have played myself again. I was genuinely excited about AMD\u2019s RX 9070 XT, but now, I\u2019m starting to worry about its future. I always knew that the new AMD flagship wouldn\u2019t be able to compete against some of Nvidia\u2019s best graphics cards, but I had a lot of hope that it\u2019d still be a great competitor for a number of other reasons.\n\nI\u2019m not doubting the performance of the RX 9070 XT. I have no reason to, as we don\u2019t know a thing about it \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m worried. Not only are the GPUs still a complete mystery, but they\u2019ve also reportedly been delayed. At this rate, I fear that AMD may have lost the war before it even started, and I\u2019m not alone.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with RDNA 4?\n\nI felt pretty excited for the RX 9070 XT, but so far, the launch of RDNA 4 has been a harsh lesson in managing your expectations.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nFirst, the GPUs barely got a mention during AMD\u2019s 45-minute-long CES 2025 keynote. Then, the few slides that AMD released to the press offered very little information; we basically only learned a little bit about the RDNA 4 architecture and AMD\u2019s performance goals. The information was vague, too \u2014 think \u201cimproved ray tracing performance\u201d and the like.\n\nThe GPUs themselves were spotted at CES, but only those made by AMD\u2019s partners, and they didn\u2019t come with any specifications. So, at this stage, it\u2019s been revealed that the RX 9070 XT comes with three fans in its Gigabyte design. That\u2019s\u2026 not a lot.\n\nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s hope, or so I thought. AMD told Digital Trends that RDNA 4 would be released \u201cin a matter of weeks,\u201d and that the company thought that the new RX 9000 series deserved its own event. But only silence has followed.\n\nThe first update came not from AMD itself, but from B&H. The retailer put the RX 9070 XT up for sale with a January 22 preorder date. The cards had been taken down, but then they reappeared with a release date of March 22. Finally, this tracks.\n\nRadeon 9000 series hardware and software are looking great and we are planning to have a wide assortment of cards available globally. Can\u2019t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March! \u2014 David McAfee (@McAfeeDavid_AMD) January 20, 2025\n\nDavid McAfee, AMD\u2019s vice president and general manager of the Ryzen CPU and Radeon graphics division, revealed on X (Twitter) that the cards will go on sale in March. McAfee later added that AMD is holding onto the GPUs a little while longer in order to optimize their software stack, including FSR 4.\n\nMeanwhile, various leakers and tipsters are having a field day with AMD\u2019s troubled RDNA 4 launch. Recent whispers point to AMD still holding off to see how Nvidia fares. At this rate, AMD will likely get to see the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5070 in their full glory before it launches the RX 9070 XT.\n\nAMD wanted to announce its new graphics cards alongside Nvidia, but it clearly didn\u2019t have a solid plan for actually releasing them. Now, we\u2019ve had to cobble together various ideas about the cards from leaks, board partners, and social media posts, which doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of confidence.\n\nI\u2019m losing faith, and I\u2019m not alone\n\nAs soon as I saw David McAfee announce that RDNA 4 wouldn\u2019t be here until March, I knew what was coming \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t wrong. PC gaming enthusiasts, including both AMD and Nvidia fans, weren\u2019t happy with the way it\u2019s all gone down.\n\nScrolling through the hundreds of comments under McAfee\u2019s post reveals just how badly the general public wants to know what\u2019s going on.\n\nNot even, a proper announcement with slides of performance, features. Could be even \"price will be reveled at, a later date\". This is so bad PR\u2026 i have no words. \u2014 Tomasz Gawro\u0144ski (@GawroskiT) January 20, 2025\n\nSitting at over 500 likes, a comment from GawroskiT on X makes a dig at AMD\u2019s PR team. \u201cNot even a proper announcement. [\u2026] This is [such] bad PR. I have no words.\u201d\n\nAnother user, PlaysRingle, promises to ditch AMD for Nvidia based on how things are going. \u201cAMD is going to make me upgrade my RX 7900 XTX to an RTX 5080. I can\u2019t keep defending AMD when it keeps doing these things.\u201d\n\nI know that I\u2019m being fairly critical of AMD here myself, but I can\u2019t help feeling bad when reading these comments and seeing the reactions. Some of it is really quite harsh, such as this comment from noremac258: \u201cDoes AMD ever not fail to capitalize on an opportunity? [\u2026] AMD\u2019s graphics division is a disaster.\u201d\n\nWhat ARE you guys doing? What sort of \"marketing\" is this \"stealth\" reveal??? Your CES presence was so uninformative you'd have been better off not showing up at all, and all we get since then is THIS? \u2014 DGBurns (@davidgburns) January 21, 2025\n\nI tried to find more supportive comments, but there are very few of those to be found. However, Hardware Unboxed made a separate post defending AMD, which is what prompted McAfee to clarify that the delayed launch comes down to software optimization.\n\nAMD delaying the launch of RDNA4 to March is the right move. The last thing they want is stuffing up the launch yet again, which they risk doing if they launch before Nvidia. And very few people would have bought a 9070 XT just because it launched a week or two before the 5070.\u2026 \u2014 Hardware Unboxed (@HardwareUnboxed) January 20, 2025\n\nI know that X is a tough crowd, so I decided to check Reddit for more reactions. Long story short \u2014 it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nThe comments under this post, sharing that RDNA 4 won\u2019t arrive until March, are still harsh. One commenter said: \u201cNvidia\u2019s release was looking rather underwhelming, so AMD had to pull out all the stops to make sure they miss the opportunity this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perceive this as having no confidence in your own product. [AMD] had the opportunity here to seize this midrange market segment by coming out first,\u201d said another user, pointing out that waiting for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 might backfire.\n\nIn search of people who are more in favor of AMD than Nvidia, I ventured into the r/AMD community. This post quickly showed me that people aren\u2019t willing to cut AMD any slack.\n\nOther than the top comment thread pictured above, all the other highly-rated comments criticize AMD. \u201cAbsolute incompetence from AMD\u2019s GPU division, again,\u201d says one poster. \u201cDoesn\u2019t a significant amount of retailers already have the cards in stock? What a fumble,\u201d adds another.\n\nI could go on, but you get the gist. It\u2019s clear that people aren\u2019t pleased, and while the internet at large is hardly ever satisfied, some of this might\u2019ve been avoided if AMD had been more forthcoming about the RX 9000 series. People are frustrated with the delay, but also with the lack of information.\n\nAMD could still make the RX 9070 XT a success\n\nThings are looking a little bleak for RDNA 4 right now, but the internet is quick to forget. It\u2019s still entirely possible for AMD to turn this around and make the launch of the RX 9000 series a success.\n\nMy opinion is that sharing some information would be better than sharing next to none; even a basic spec sheet would go a long way. Although McAfee plays a key role in AMD\u2019s GPU strategy, most fans don\u2019t check his X account on a daily basis. Those people are either kept in the dark or they\u2019re left to rely on third parties to tell them what\u2019s going on.\n\nLetting the general public figure out AMD\u2019s plans based on social media means that a lot of people who might have otherwise been happy to wait will now be influenced by people who are decidedly not happy. If there are hundreds of comments all saying that AMD is doing a bad job, it\u2019s easy to start believing it yourself if you don\u2019t have anyone telling you otherwise.\n\nUnfortunately, right now, AMD is really not doing much to dispel that notion. A quick X post, even when coming from an AMD executive, doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nAside from some marketing efforts to drive up the hype, I think it\u2019s now more important than ever for AMD to lean into that performance-per-dollar metric that makes GPUs like Intel\u2019s Arc B580 such a great deal. The fact is that the RX 9070 XT might still be an exceptional GPU even if it won\u2019t be able to beat all of its Nvidia rivals.\n\nMost people won\u2019t be spending $2,000 (or more) on an RTX 5090. The GPU market needs graphics cards that provide value while being able to run the latest games, and to that end, AMD\u2019s usually done a pretty good job. Strangely enough, some of its best GPUs are the ones that didn\u2019t get a lot of love from the marketing department, such as the RX 7900 GRE \u2014 but that\u2019s no reason for the RX 9070 XT to also be launched with so little fanfare.\n\nIn the consumer graphics market, AMD is a small fish; Nvidia is a massive shark. Following a troubled launch, AMD may therefore now face an uphill climb with the RX 9070 XT \u2014 but I\u2019m still hopeful.\n\nIf AMD gets the pricing right, the RX 9070 XT might still turn out to be an amazing card. On the other hand, if it\u2019s too expensive when compared to its Nvidia rivals, it might end up being overlooked regardless of AMD\u2019s marketing efforts. And let\u2019s hope that those efforts actually begin soon, because so far, Nvidia\u2019s winning the battle \u2014 but AMD could still walk away unscathed from the war."

            "article_content": "Demystifying Artificial Intelligence in Data Pipelines\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to integrate into various sectors, its capabilities in automating complex processes and driving innovation are unmatched. However, one of the challenges that come with AI is its \u201cblack box\u201d nature, wherein the inner workings of machine learning models remain opaque, even to those deploying them. This issue is especially critical in fields like data engineering, where large-scale pipelines manage massive amounts of data that fuel these AI models.\n\nDr. Mohan Raja Pulicharla addresses this concern in his recent study titled \u201cExplainable AI in the Context of Data Engineering: Unveiling the Black Box in the Pipeline.\u201d His research emphasizes the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) in ensuring transparency and trust in machine learning models, particularly within the intricate frameworks of data pipelines.\n\nExplainable AI: Enhancing Transparency in AI Systems\n\nExplainable AI (XAI) refers to a set of methods and techniques that allow human users to understand how AI systems make decisions. In the context of data engineering, where data must flow seamlessly through various stages of collection, transformation, and analysis, XAI has a significant role to play.\n\nDr. Pulicharla\u2019s research highlights how traditional AI systems, while effective, often lack transparency. Engineers, decision-makers, and even end-users find it difficult to comprehend why a model arrived at a specific conclusion. This is particularly problematic when AI is used in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, or governance, where decisions can have significant consequences. Without insight into these decisions, AI systems can remain underutilized or mistrusted.\n\nBy implementing XAI within data pipelines, engineers can inspect models at various stages of processing. XAI offers a way to verify their accuracy, fairness, and reliability, leading to more informed and confident decision-making.\n\nAI in Data Engineering: Bridging the Gap Between Models and Data\n\nData engineering involves designing, building, and managing the data infrastructure required for analysis and decision-making in AI systems. As data moves through the various stages of a pipeline\u2014whether it\u2019s being ingested, transformed, or analyzed\u2014AI models are often applied to make sense of that data. Dr. Pulicharla\u2019s research illustrates that these models are only as effective as the transparency they offer.\n\nBy integrating XAI into data pipelines, the study focuses on demystifying how machine learning models handle data at each stage. For instance, an AI model used to predict customer behavior may process raw transactional data, apply a series of transformations, and eventually make a prediction. XAI can help engineers and analysts track how the model arrives at its conclusion, ensuring the results are both explainable and reliable.\n\nDr. Pulicharla emphasizes that XAI can help identify potential biases or inconsistencies in models that may otherwise go unnoticed. Given that data engineering pipelines often handle sensitive data, such as personal information or financial records, explainability is crucial to maintaining ethical AI practices.\n\nThe Practicality of XAI in Data Pipelines\n\nOne of the key takeaways from Dr. Pulicharla\u2019s research is the practicality of implementing XAI in real-world data pipelines. While XAI is often discussed in theoretical terms, his study delves into the technical aspects of how it can be embedded within existing infrastructure. This involves selecting the right tools and methods for achieving explainability without disrupting the efficiency of data pipelines.\n\nThe research outlines how model-agnostic techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) can be applied at various points in a data pipeline to interpret and explain model predictions. These techniques can be used to continuously monitor AI systems and detect any anomalies or unexpected behaviors.\n\nIn addition to practical implementation, XAI\u2019s potential long-term benefits include fostering trust between AI systems and their users. Whether it\u2019s a business analyst relying on AI-generated insights or a data engineer tasked with managing the pipeline, XAI ensures that the rationale behind each decision is clear, traceable, and defensible.\n\nA Step Forward for Ethical AI:\n\nAs AI systems become more prevalent in decision-making processes, the need for transparency and trustworthiness cannot be overstated. Dr. Mohan Raja Pulicharla\u2019s research on Explainable AI within data pipelines contributes to the ongoing efforts to make AI systems more accountable and understandable.\n\nBy focusing on the implementation of XAI in data engineering, his work highlights the critical role transparency plays in ensuring AI\u2019s successful integration into industries that depend on reliable data insights. This research points to a future where AI is not just a tool for automation, but also a system that can be fully understood, trusted, and relied upon by its users.\n\nFor more details, read the full research article here: https://www.ijisrt.com/explainable-ai-in-the-context-of-data-engineering-unveiling-the-black-box-in-the-pipeline."

            "article_content": "The violence in eastern Congo has escalated. Near Goma in North Kivu, 13 peacekeepers were killed by M23 rebels, while Congo has broken off relations with Rwanda. The North Kivu region is rich in gold and coltan.\n\nWithin three years, the March 23 movement (M23), supported by Rwanda, has managed to occupy large parts of North Kivu in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. In recent days, the militias have taken control of the strategically important town of Minova and briefly seized the small town of Sake before being partially pushed back by Congolese soldiers. From positions on the surrounding hills, the rebels are firing heavy artillery. According to the UN, peacekeepers are patrolling with the Congolese army and assisting in securing the civilian population, which repeatedly finds itself caught in the crossfire.\n\nAn attempt by the M23 rebels to capture the million-strong city of Goma, located on Lake Kivu, failed over the weekend for now. Thirteen soldiers from international peacekeeping forces were killed during this attempt. The governments of South Africa, Malawi, and Uruguay announced the deaths of their soldiers on Saturday. This prompted an emergency session of the UN Security Council in New York on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the conflict has displaced more than 400,000 people in the region since the beginning of the year. The displaced people are lacking food, water, and medical care. Many are fleeing to neighboring Rwanda out of fear that Goma might be captured.\n\nObjective: Control of Raw Materials\n\nThe offensives by the M23 seem to follow a clear logic: they want to gain control over the region's natural resources. These include gold, cassiterite, coltan, cobalt, and diamonds. After initially capturing parts of the Rutshuru and Masisi regions, the rebels are now moving towards the Walikale area, which is known for its significant coltan production. Coltan is a mineral that is strategically important for the energy transition.\n\nIn early August 2024, under Angola's mediation, a ceasefire agreement was signed between Rwanda and DR Congo. However, on October 20, the rebels resumed their offensive in the northwest of the country.\n\nIn December 2024, peace talks between DR Congo and Rwanda under Angola's mediation failed. A meeting between Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame was canceled at the last minute.\n\nFor a time, M23 rebels occupied the city of Kalembe, about 90 kilometers north of Sake, but were later driven out by a counteroffensive from the Wazalendo militias and the \"Nduma Defense of Congo R\u00e9nov\u00e9\" (NDC-R). DR Congo had accused NDC-R leader Guidon Shimiray Mwissa of war crimes and issued an arrest warrant, with the UN imposing sanctions. Now, he is fighting alongside the Congolese army.\n\nUN peacekeapers were killed near Goma, North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of Congo, January 25 Image: Arlette Bashizi/REUTERS\n\nUN: M23 Collects Fees on Coltan Production\n\nKalembe is located on an important transportation route that also provides access to key mining areas. \"The Walikale area is very rich in natural resources,\" confirms Augustin Muhesi, a political science professor in North Kivu. \"If the M23 wants to occupy this area, it is only to gain access to mining resources to finance their military operations.\"\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the M23 is already generating around $300,000 per month from taxes on coltan production in the Masisi and Rutshuru regions. In April 2024, the M23 surrounded the town of Sake, a traffic hub and last bastion before the provincial capital, Goma. The rebels also took control of the mining town of Rubaya, which holds large coltan deposits.\n\nResidents carry their belongings as they flee from Kibati, where fighting has intensified, towards the city of Goma Image: Jospin Mwisha/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAccusation: M23 Exports Coltan to Rwanda\n\nThe Congolese government accuses the M23 of exporting production from the Rubaya mines to Rwanda. According to a local civil society organization, the M23 has already distributed materials to resume mining operations at these sites.\n\nAccording to the latest UN report on the Democratic Republic of Congo, there are currently around 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers from the Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) on Congolese soil, supporting the M23 rebels, who number about 3,000 fighters. \"The RDF has no longer been limited to supporting M23 operations in the Rutshuru, Masisi, and Nyiragongo regions but has now directly and decisively intervened,\" the UN experts wrote. This has allowed both groups\u2014the M23 and the RDF\u2014to quickly expand their territory to the shores of Lake Edward, the report says.\n\nAccording to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a non-governmental organization that tracks global conflicts, the M23 rebel movement has been involved in nearly 1,700 violent incidents since resuming its activities in November 2021, which have claimed the lives of 1,746 people.\n\nThe article was updated by Antonio Cascais on January 26, 2025 to reflect new developments."

            "article_content": "I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a Mario and Zelda machine ever since. It\u2019s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch\u2019s best trick \u2014 pick-up-and-play portability \u2014 while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.\n\nBut the Nintendo Switch 2, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be the console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use its detachable Joy-Cons\u2019 many tricks, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC \u2014 or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.\n\nThe Switch 2\u2019s newly magnetic Joy-Con. Gif: Nintendo\n\nThe Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. If history\u2019s any indication, it should easily sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was almost nothing to play but Zelda, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip \u2014 but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the largest and most welcoming libraries of all time, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.\n\nSo: How can the budding handheld PC revolution escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won\u2019t say I know for sure, but I did just check the industry\u2019s temperature at CES 2025, the world\u2019s biggest tech show \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.\n\nHandheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck\u2019s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the 8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Lenovo Legion Go S, to the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2, and the giant 11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon, even the largest Windows handhelds didn\u2019t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.\n\nThere are four places I think the industry has to change \u2014 and maybe, band together \u2014 if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.\n\nA year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo\u2019s handhelds in particular. (The new one\u2019s on the left.) Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto\n\nOperating system\n\nBuyers need to know that their game will be ready to play when they press the power button on a handheld. That\u2019s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it\u2019s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded \u2014 but it\u2019s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.\n\nThat\u2019s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today\u2019s version of handheld Windows.\n\nFirst, Lenovo revealed it would produce the first authorized third-party handheld to ship with Valve\u2019s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows \u2014 something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds as soon as this April. Third, a Microsoft executive told The Verge that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining \u201cthe best of Xbox and Windows together.\u201d\n\nThese moves are heartening, as it\u2019s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn\u2019t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They\u2019re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too \u2014 to the point that today, a community-created fork of Valve\u2019s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience than Windows.\n\nIt\u2019s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we\u2019ve already seen the Deck can\u2019t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers don\u2019t see the raw sales numbers to bring big multiplayer games like Fortnite or Valorant to SteamOS. (They say cheaters are too big a risk.)\n\nBut, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet hard \u2014 not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won\u2019t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.\n\nNo other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, with a claim that was apparently false or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it\u2019d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.\n\nCES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they\u2019re not necessarily a bad idea! Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nScreen\n\nThis one\u2019s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should universally adopt a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.\n\nMany PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won\u2019t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld without a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate \u2014 VRR was the Asus ROG Ally\u2019s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals\u2019 chips offered the same FPS.\n\nLastly, HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s screen, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they\u2019re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It\u2019s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today\u2019s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.\n\nIs a screen like the one I\u2019m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.\n\nChips and battery\n\nUnless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom Aerith and Sephiroth parts for the Steam Deck feel like the only ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD\u2019s new Z2 line might not be all that different.\n\nAMD\u2019s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn\u2019t originally for handheld; they\u2019re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.\n\nThe Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it\u2019s looking at running its Legion Go S\u2019s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.\n\nAMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company\u2019s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC\u2019s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it\u2019s not a leap forward. That may require AMD\u2019s even newer RDNA 4 graphics, and it may require bespoke processors.\n\nThe MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath if you\u2019re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s why MSI hasn\u2019t fully launched the Claw as expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel certainly has bigger fish to fry right now than making custom handheld chips. \u201cIt\u2019s not a market that we\u2019re actively pursuing, but it\u2019s a market we\u2019re happy to enable,\u201d Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. \u201cIt is somewhat extracurricular,\u201d he added, explaining that it\u2019s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. \u201cWe\u2019re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.\u201d.\n\nSome manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today\u2019s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack \u2014 the Asus ROG Ally X doubled the size of its predecessor\u2019s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it\u2019s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can only be partially engineered away.\n\nWe need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.\n\nThe Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior. Photo by The Verge\n\nPrice\n\nThe PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo\u2019s lunch.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 \u2014 around $380 in today\u2019s money \u2014 and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve\u2019s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.\n\nOnly the least expensive model of Lenovo\u2019s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S will lower that bar to $499 this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it\u2019s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell said it was \u201cpainful\u201d but \u201ccritical\u201d to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the razor-and-blades business model where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that\u2019s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world\u2019s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.\n\nBut not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss less than a year after its debut. So it\u2019s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S\u2019s price, for example.\n\nTo compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of portable Xboxes or PlayStations or Steam Machines, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum."

In 2024, semiconductor giant Nvidia led the pack, with a 171% gain fueled by the AI wave. Using TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool, we will compare three Magnificent 7 stocks with a Strong Buy consensus rating and \u201cPerfect 10\u201d smart score to pick the one with the highest upside potential, according to analysts.\n\nInvest with Confidence: Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.\n\nJoin thousands of data-driven investors \u2013 Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNvidia stock has rallied over 132%, thanks to the robust demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) that are required to power AI models. The impressive growth in the company\u2019s revenue and earnings in recent quarters reflects the solid momentum that NVDA\u2019s GPUs are witnessing due to the ongoing generative AI boom. Given these AI tailwinds, Nvidia has surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) to become the world\u2019s most valuable company with a market cap of $3.61 trillion.\n\nLooking ahead, there are high expectations from the company\u2019s Blackwell platform. Moreover, the company is expected to benefit from the recently announced U.S. AI infrastructure project called Stargate.\n\nIs NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nRecently, Barclays analyst Thomas O\u2019Malley highlighted the semiconductor stocks that he likes for 2025, including Nvidia. The analyst stated that Nvidia remains the dominant player in AI compute. He expects the company\u2019s data center compute business to grow by nearly 60% year-over-year in 2025, driven by next-generation GPUs and advancements in networking architecture.\n\nO\u2019Malley expects the company\u2019s Blackwell offering to generate around $15 billion in revenue in the first quarter, with the potential to more than double the number quarter-over-quarter. Additionally, the analyst sees significant upside in the second half of 2025, supported by the robust momentum in the B200 cycle and the growth in the B300/Ultra offerings.\n\nWith 36 Buys and three Holds, Nvidia stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target of $176.86 implies 24% upside potential.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet shares have risen about 35% over the past year. The company reported market-beating third-quarter results, with 35% year-over-year growth in its Cloud unit and continued strength in the Search and YouTube businesses.\n\nDespite investors\u2019 concerns about the impact of growing competition in Search and regulatory pressures, Alphabet is optimistic about maintaining its dominance through its AI offerings.\n\nAlphabet is scheduled to announce its Q4 2024 results on February 4. Analysts expect the company\u2019s EPS (earnings per share) to rise more than 29% year-over-year to $2.12. They forecast a 12% growth in Q4 revenue to $96.62 billion.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for GOOGL Stock?\n\nHeading into Alphabet\u2019s Q4 2024 results, Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $225. The analyst expects Q4 results to reflect persistent momentum in Search, YouTube, and Cloud, with AI continuing to be in focus.\n\nNotably, Squali expects GOOGL\u2019s Q4 2024 results to be almost in line with the Street\u2019s estimates, with revenue up by low double-digits. Moreover, the analyst expects an operating margin of more than 30%, as efforts to control operating expenses are expected to have more than offset higher capital expenditure.\n\nOverall, Alphabet stock scores Wall Street\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys and eight Holds. The average GOOGL stock price target of $217.93 indicates about 9% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMeta Platforms stock has rallied 66% over the past year, thanks to the company\u2019s streamlining efforts and rebound in ad spending. However, regulatory pressures, significant losses in the Reality Labs unit (operating loss of over $58 billion since 2020), and massive investments in AI could limit the upside in the stock this year.\n\nOn Friday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion this year in capex to build AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg views 2025 as \u201ca defining year for AI.\u201d The company expects its massive AI investments to drive innovation and future growth.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is scheduled to announce its Q4 2024 on January 29. Analysts expect the social media giant to report about a 27% year-over-year jump in Q4 EPS to $6.75. Revenue is expected to rise 17% to $46.97 billion.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nIn reaction to Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement of the $60 billion to $65 billion in capex to support the company\u2019s product roadmap, Citi analyst Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating on META stock with a price target of $75 and called it his Top Pick. Josey added that while Meta\u2019s 2025 capex range is modestly ahead of his $58.5 billion estimate, he expects these investments to drive continued engagement growth and monetization benefits as \u201cnewer product vectors emerge, like Search (with Meta AI), Agents (with AI Studio), and Enterprise (with Llama 4), among others.\u201d\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on META stock based on 40 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating. The average META stock price target of $692.23 implies about 7% upside potential.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile analysts are highly bullish on the three Magnificent 7 stocks discussed here, they see higher upside potential in NVDA stock even after a stellar rally over the past year. Nvidia continues to capture the solid demand for its advanced GPUs in the AI space and is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the semiconductor market through continued innovation and strong execution.\n\nDisclosure"

            "article_content": "Joe Rogan has put forth an astounding theory on the polarizing case of the alleged alien mummies. Rogan's breakdown comes around a month after the tragic passing of a scientist researching the case.\n\nIn 2024, a New York Post report addressed the three-fingered humanoid alien mummies investigated in Peru in 2023. Speaking to the Daily Mail, American attorney Joshua McDowell, who'd claimed to have investigated the humanoids with an independent forensic team, asserted that the humanoids' fingerprints were \"straight\" unlike those of humans.\n\nThe Post alluded that Mexican journalist, Jose Jaime Maussan, presented some alleged mummified alien remains in front of Mexico's Congress back in 2023.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Edgar Hernandez published two research papers on the tridactyls, including the alleged alien mummy 'Maria.' The scientist reportedly passed away in a car accident in Huaytara, Huancavelica, Peru, in Dec. 2024.\n\nTrending\n\nGet the latest updates on One Championship Rankings at Sportskeeda and more\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nOn the Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) podcast's episode #2262 this month (January 2025), Joe Rogan discussed alien lifeforms and anatomy with Dr. Mark Gordon, a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) treatment and neurogenerative medicine expert.\n\nReuters recently reported that a press conference was held in Lima, Peru. Therein, experts suggested that the much-discussed humanoid remains, supposedly from Peru's Nazca region and of entities that were tridactyls (with three fingers), were humanoid dolls made by sticking together human and animal remains.\n\nJoe Rogan cited the 2024 New York Post report and alluded to the inbuilt three-finger structure, non-human fingerprint pattern (straight lines not spirals), and the indications that the humanoid referred to as 'Maria' might indeed be an extraterrestrial:\n\n\"They had a cranial capacity that is larger than most human beings ... It looks like a f*cking alien. But is that real? ... Look at that picture, what it actually looks like. That's f*cking crazy. That [Maria] does look like an alien.\"\n\nRogan emphasized how eerily similar it was to the archetype of the 'Greys' aka 'Grey aliens,' an oft-utilized alien representation in pop culture. It entails that an alien/ET is generally a grey-colored entity with a small hairless body, enlarged head, and large peculiar black eyes:\n\n\"What is that? If it's got three fingers and three toes, and it's got an alien face -- it looks like a 'Grey' [Grey alien]. It has a tiny slot for a mouth and tiny dots for a nose.

Many ufologists and ET/alien lifeform enthusiasts have often accused the U.S. government as well as other countries' governments of concealing alien remains and technologies from the general populace.\n\nBack in Feb. 2023, the American government shot down a few objects that some believed were Chinese spy balloons. The government had implied that the objects weren't ETs/ET-related technology. Nevertheless, Joe Rogan took to Instagram and jestingly reaffirmed his stance that the government was probably concealing alien-related knowledge. He wrote:\n\n\"Now all of a sudden I think it actually is aliens. #lookintoit\"\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Tim Burchett has brought up his theory about underwater alien activity.\n\nTennessee Representative Tim Burchett has taken the trending extraterrestrial conversation to the depths of Earth\u2019s oceans.\n\nAccording to a report from WREG Memphis News Channel 3 (via The Hill), The Republican congressman has openly declared his belief that aliens might be operating secret underwater bases right here on our planet. Burchett\u2019s claims are now making waves in Washington and beyond due to the interesting intersection between religion and science that his beliefs clash on.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s One America News show, he clearly states that he arrived at this point base on his thought process of the unlimited power of the most high. \u201cI just think travelin\u2019 light years, I think it happens,\u201d Burchett said. Burchett also pondered the unimaginable distances aliens might travel to reach Earth.\n\n\u201cThe light from those stars that we see at night left there before the time of Christ,\u201d he added, mixing astronomy and theology in his explanation.\n\nBurchett\u2019s fascination with the unknown isn\u2019t new. Last year in April, following a classified briefing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), he hinted that the U.S. government is deliberately withholding information about these mysterious occurrences.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a cover-up,\u201d Burchett alleged. \u201cWe\u2019ve had departments tell us that they have recovery units, but they won\u2019t release full reports. Everything\u2019s covered up.\u201d\n\nThe congressman\u2019s interest in aliens gained momentum in the summer of 2023, when whistleblowers came forward during a series of UAP hearings. These insiders alleged that the government has long concealed evidence of advanced crafts of either foreign or extraterrestrial origin.\n\nBurchett took action by requesting the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general investigate these shocking claims. Burchett described one case that had him particularly spooked. \u201cWhen they tell me something\u2019s moving at hundreds of miles an hour underwater, and our capabilities\u2026and these things, this one was, it was large as a football field underwater,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this was a documented case, and\u2026and I have an admiral telling me this stuff.\u201d he said.\n\nBurchett has even led efforts to establish a UAP caucus in the House, joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers demanding greater transparency from the military on all things alien. With tens of millions spent on mysterious investigations, Burchett believes Americans deserve the full story\u2014even if it means unearthing secrets that sound straight out of a sci-fi movie.\n\nInterestingly, Burchett isn\u2019t the first U.S. lawmaker to explore the outer edges of plausibility. One prominent example of recent congressional conspiracy theories involves Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). In 2018, she speculated about a secretive \u201cspace laser\u201d potentially being used to start wildfires in California.\n\nThe theory, which linked wildfires to a powerful and shadowy elite, was widely debunked and criticized but highlighted her willingness to amplify far-fetched claims. Her comments about various conspiracy theories, including QAnon, have sparked national debates and raised concerns about the influence of such ideas within government institutions."

            "article_content": "Experts urge at lecture\n\nBangladesh must harness the potential of quantum technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure cost-effectiveness and remain competitive in an increasingly interconnected world, said Sam Samdani, interim chief executive officer of QuantumCT and external adviser to American consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nSpeaking at a lecture titled \"Leveraging Quantum Phenomena: Reimagining a New World\", organised by the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) at the Anis Ud Dowla Conference Hall in the capital yesterday, Samdani called for greater focus on foundational sciences to prepare for the technological revolution.\n\nThis is the best time to be alive. AI helps us learn faster, better, and in more detail. It is no longer necessary to master English to access knowledge. AI makes learning available native languages. \u2014 Sam Samdani interim chief executive officer of QuantumCT\n\n\"The world is connected now. So, work done in Bangladesh can be useful in other countries and developments in other places can also help in Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\n\"Our students and business executives must be equipped to understand foundational sciences like quantum physics and find ways to apply them in real-world contexts.\"\n\nSamdani emphasised that quantum physics opens the doors to innovation across sectors. Drawing attention to existing breakthroughs like lasers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), he urged students and researchers to explore the \"strange phenomena\" of quantum effects and repurpose them for local applications.\n\nFor instance, he mentioned the potential of quantum-based sensors to revolutionise medical imaging with unprecedented resolution, enabling early detection of diseases.\n\nSome of these advancements are already in late-stage development and could hit the market within the next few years, he noted.\n\nAccording to him, Bangladesh needs a talent pipeline that is well-versed in quantum physics, mathematics, and AI to leverage these technologies effectively.\n\nSamdani also emphasised the importance of nurturing curiosity among young students and fostering a culture of learning.\n\n\"This is the best time to be alive. AI helps us learn faster, better, and in more detail,\" he said. \"It is no longer necessary to master English to access knowledge. AI makes learning available in Bangla and other native languages.\"\n\nSamdani underscored that investing in a mindset change is key to advancing these technologies. He suggested businesses focus on partnerships with global firms to adopt and adapt advanced technologies for local needs.\n\nCiting examples of cost-effective adaptations, Samdani said technologies like MRI machines, which are often expensive in their original form, can be modified to create affordable versions suitable for developing countries.\n\n\"Quantum physics, AI, and biotechnology are converging fields that offer immense opportunities for creativity and innovation,\" he added.\n\nSamdani urged the government to prioritise \"knowledge diplomacy\" by creating platforms for information exchange and collaboration.\n\nHe proposed establishing an online clearing house for quantum technologies, potentially hosted by institutions like the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.\n\n\"Knowledge diplomacy will be the soft power of the future, more impactful than traditional arms diplomacy,\" he remarked.\n\nAddressing the event, M Tamim, vice-chancellor of Independent University, Bangladesh, remarked on the human brain's difficulty in comprehending quantum phenomena, such as particles existing in two places simultaneously.\n\nDespite this complexity, quantum physics is now being applied to computing and communication, he said.\n\nHowever, Tamim raised ethical concerns, such as cloning and the blending of physical and digital realms, which are already emerging globally.\n\nHe noted that Bangladesh lags behind in adopting cutting-edge technology and highlighted the energy-intensive nature of quantum computing and AI.\n\nHe emphasised that universities must prepare students to tackle these challenges and take the lead in advancing such transformative technologies.\n\nThe event was also addressed by M Asis Ud Dowla, former president of MCCI, Kamran T Rahman, president of MCCI, Habibullah N Karim, senior vice-president of MCCI, and Farooq Ahmed, secretary general of MCCI."

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered how certain problems are so complex that even the fastest computers struggle to solve them? These types of problems are often found in industries like transportation, finance, healthcare, and science. They\u2019re called \u201coptimization problems,\u201d where the goal is to find the best solution out of many possible options.\n\nWhile regular computers (called \u201cclassical computers\u201c) are great for many tasks, they can have a hard time handling these massive challenges. Enter quantum computers.\n\nQuantum computers are an exciting new kind of technology that could change the way we solve difficult problems, especially Quantum Computing Problems. Instead of using regular computer bits (which are like tiny on/off switches), quantum computers use something called \u201cquantum bits,\u201d or qubits.\n\nQubits are super special because they follow the rules of quantum physics, which means they can process information in ways that classical computers can\u2019t. This makes quantum computers much more powerful at solving certain types of puzzles.\n\nWhat Are Optimization Problems?\n\nOptimization problems sound fancy, but you deal with them every day without even realizing it. Imagine you\u2019re trying to pick the fastest route to school on a map, or you\u2019re deciding how to spend your pocket money to get the best value. These are simple examples of optimization problems\u2014finding the best option out of many choices.\n\nNow imagine you work at an airport and have to decide the best way to schedule hundreds of flights, manage thousands of bags, and make everything run smoothly without delays. Or maybe you work for a delivery company and you want to find the most efficient way to deliver millions of packages across the country. These problems are way too complicated to solve with just guesswork!\n\nRegular computers try to solve these tough problems by testing every possible solution one by one, which can take an enormous amount of time. Even supercomputers may need days, months, or even years to do the job, depending on how big the problem is.\n\nWhat Makes Quantum Computers Different?\n\nQuantum computers are special because they use principles from quantum mechanics, a branch of science that studies the tiniest building blocks of our universe\u2014like atoms and particles. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be in multiple states at once, thanks to something called \u201csuperposition.\u201d This allows quantum computers to look at many possible solutions simultaneously, instead of one by one.\n\nQuantum computers also use something called \u201centanglement,\u201d where qubits are connected in a way that lets them share information instantly. These features allow quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nFor optimization problems, this means quantum computers can solve puzzles with millions (or even billions!) of possibilities in a fraction of the time it would take a classical computer.\n\nThis breakthrough is particularly exciting for industries like logistics, where the rise of technology has revolutionized traditional operations. If you interested in exploring this further, can check out our blog, \u201cF2000s and the Rise of Technology in Logistics,\u201d to learn how advanced computing and innovation are shaping supply chains globally.\n\nReal-Life Benefits of Quantum Computing in Optimization\n\nNow that we understand how quantum computers work, let\u2019s explore some real-life benefits for solving optimization problems.\n\n1. Faster Deliveries and Better Logistics\n\nHave you ever ordered something online and tracked its delivery route? Companies like Amazon or FedEx need to figure out the fastest and cheapest way to deliver packages to millions of customers. Using quantum computers, these companies could create better delivery plans in real time, saving money and ensuring you get your package as quickly as possible.\n\n2. Smarter Traffic Management\n\nTraffic jams are another optimization challenge. Cities around the world face growing traffic problems as more and more cars hit the roads. Quantum computing can help plan better traffic flows, reduce congestion, and make public transportation more efficient. This could save time, lower fuel usage, and reduce pollution!\n\n3. Improved Healthcare Scheduling\n\nHospitals deal with optimization problems all the time, like scheduling surgeries, assigning doctors, and managing beds for patients. Quantum computers could help hospitals make better schedules that improve patient care and reduce waiting times. This means more lives saved and a smoother healthcare experience.\n\n4. More Accurate Financial Predictions\n\nBanks and investment companies often deal with risky decisions, like where to invest money or how to predict market changes. These are complex optimization problems that involve analyzing a huge amount of data. Quantum computers could help make faster and smarter financial decisions, which could stabilize markets and improve the global economy.\n\n5. Advancing Science and Research\n\nFrom designing new medicines to improving renewable energy systems, scientists rely on optimization to solve tough problems. Quantum computers can speed up this research and bring us closer to breakthroughs in important areas like curing diseases or fighting climate change.\n\nChallenges and the Future of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computers sound amazing, but they\u2019re not perfect yet. Building and maintaining them is incredibly hard. They need to be kept in extremely cold environments and are still in the early stages of development. Right now, only a few companies and research labs have working quantum computers.\n\nStill, progress is happening quickly. Scientists and engineers are working hard to make quantum computers more powerful and accessible. Many believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, we\u2019ll see quantum computing become a common tool for solving real-world problems.\n\nWhy Should You Care About Quantum Computing?\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a scientist or an engineer, quantum computing is something exciting to keep an eye on. The benefits it could bring, from better technologies to smarter ways of solving problems, have the potential to impact nearly every part of our lives. Quantum computing could lead to a better, more efficient, and more sustainable future.\n\nThink of quantum computers like the superheroes of the technology world. They take on the toughest challenges and uncover solutions that normal computers just can\u2019t handle. And who knows? Maybe one day you\u2019ll be working on quantum computing or benefiting from its amazing advancements!\n\nQuantum computing may still sound like science fiction to some, but it\u2019s quickly becoming a reality. Its ability to solve advanced optimization problems could transform industries and improve the world in countless ways.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless, and we\u2019re just getting started!

            "article_content": "\u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d by Yuval Noah Harari is a sweeping and insightful exploration of our species\u2019 journey from its humble beginnings to the present day.\n\nSapiens explores the rise of Homo sapiens through key revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. This groundbreaking book examines how human history is shaped by \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies \u2013 that enable unparalleled cooperation. Harari investigates the impact of these revolutions on human society, from the dawn of agriculture and the rise of civilizations to the challenges of the modern world, including climate change, technological disruption, and the search for meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution: The book begins by examining the unique cognitive abilities that set Homo sapiens apart from other animals. Around 70,000 years ago, a \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d occurred, leading to the development of advanced language and the ability to create and believe in \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies. These shared fictions, while not objectively real, allow humans to cooperate flexibly on a massive scale, a feat unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This cooperation enabled the development of complex social structures, from small tribes to vast empires.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution: Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. This seemingly revolutionary shift, however, brought about significant drawbacks. Agriculture led to increased inequality, disease, and environmental degradation. Farmers, despite working harder than hunter-gatherers, often had less leisure time and a poorer diet. The domestication of plants and animals also led to the suffering of countless creatures.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution: Beginning in the 16th century, the Scientific Revolution challenged religious dogma and ushered in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Science provided humans with new tools and knowledge, allowing them to manipulate the natural world on an unprecedented scale.
