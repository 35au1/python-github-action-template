The industry, which argues that pharmacy benefit managers contribute to the high price of prescription drugs, is also pushing for curbs on the rebates they pay to PBMs in exchange for favorable placement on insurer coverage lists. CEOs of some of the largest drugmakers said this week they were encouraged after Trump said at a meeting with pharma executives late last year that these middlemen need to be eliminated."

            "article_content": "Hinge is employing AI to help with prompts\n\nIt won't write them for you\n\nThere are different levels of guidance\n\nIf the thought of crafting the perfect dating profile fills you with dread, Hinge has an AI solution. The popular dating app has rolled out a new feature called Prompt Feedback that uses AI to coach you in writing better responses to profile prompts. The company thinks AI assistance can make people's responses better for showcasing themselves or at least be less basic and boring.\n\nAccording to Hinge, Prompts are 47% more likely to lead to dates than photo likes, but over half of surveyed Hinge daters admitted they don\u2019t know how to craft good responses. Prompt Feedback's AI evaluates a dater\u2019s profile responses and offers personalized advice on how to tweak them for maximum impact.\n\nThe AI is fine-tuned with insights from Hinge\u2019s team of behavioral scientists. Notably, it doesn't rewrite your answer or make one up for you. It simply suggests ways to think about your answer and how to make it better, more detailed, and more likely to entice potential romantic partners. It's the supportive best friend in a movie who tells you, \u201cMaybe skip the joke about your childhood pet hamster and mention your love of hiking instead.\u201d\n\nAI romance\n\n(Image credit: Hinge)\n\nThe feature lives in the settings menu, where users can review feedback privately. Users will receive one of three levels of guidance: a simple \u201cGreat Answer\u201d if the response is already on point, \u201cTry a Small Change\u201d for a bit of fine-tuning, or a \u201cGo a Little Deeper,\u201d which is the AI\u2019s polite way of saying, \u201cYou can do better than \u2018I like long walks on the beach.\u2019\u201d\n\nHinge isn't unique in applying AI to dating profiles. Tinder uses an AI feature that can help pick out profile photos, while Grindr is developing a digital wingman of its own. Meanwhile, Bumble offers photo help as well as AI to help users design their entire profile and get conversations between users off to a good start.\n\nWriting a good profile takes effort, and dating app fatigue is real. For some users, the idea of AI critiquing their efforts might feel intimidating or unnecessary. For others, this could be the romantic nudge they need. Unlike the harsh criticism you might get from a sibling or brutally honest friend, this feedback is entirely optional. But if you\u2019re open to a little constructive coaching, the tool is there to help.\n\nYou might also like..."

Three kings ruled from the Palace of Versailles: Louis XIV until his death in 1715, then Louis XV from 1722 until 1774 and finally, Louis XVI until the Revolution of 1789. Louis XV was among the best-educated royals of his age, and his knowledge was of a mostly scientific nature. From the age of seven, he was passionate about cartography, and at age eleven, he discovered astronomy. \u201cIn addition to his core education, he touched upon anatomy and surgery, and from medicine, he went on to study botany. He read a great deal, assiduously consulted the maps in his geography gallery, attended dissections, studied plants at Trianon [a smaller building at Versailles] and observed the heavens, following every astronomical event,\u201d writes French art historian Beatrix Saule in the book that accompanies the London Science Museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour.\u201d While Versailles and its kings have always been regarded as sumptuous and somewhat decadent against a backdrop of the then-starving French peasantry, the scientific pursuits of the kings are not at the top of public consciousness. Until, that is, this show was put together.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I was surprised, therefore, that the revolution was mentioned only briefly in this exhibition: while it is written on plaques that scientific instruments were destroyed or stolen during the riots, it is not explained at length, nor is it explained fully as to whether the republic that followed adopted the scientific discoveries of their forebears. This, I feel, is a glaring omission, and one that will leave visitors wanting to know more: while the exhibition book mentions that \u201cdocuments and scientific instruments were scattered at the time of the revolutionary sales in 1793-94, when Versailles was emptied of all its furnishings\u201d and that objects were taken to various institutions, it does not feel thorough. True, the exhibition is entitled \u201cVersailles\u201d rather than \u201cFrance: Science and Splendour,\u201d but more background wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nThe star of the show is Louis XV\u2019s rhino. The male Indian rhinoceros presented to Louis XV in 1769 by Jean-Baptiste Chevalier de Conan, the governor of Chandernagore (now Chandannagar) in Bengal, has pride of place in the exhibition\u2019s main room. The plaque reads that he was killed during the revolution, possibly drowning in the fountains or after being stabbed with a sword. While he lived, the rhinoceros was among thousands of animals from Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the royal menagerie. They were a source of inspiration for many artists, such as the Flemish animal painter Pieter Boel, whose studies included a painting of one of the rarest birds in the menagerie, the cassowary, sent to Versailles in 1671 from Madagascar.\n\nThe other star of the show is the Clock of the Creation of the World (the Pendule de la Cr\u00e9ation du monde). At the time of its manufacture\u20141754\u2014clocks were considered to be the most sophisticated and most prestigious devices ever made. Its design and mechanisms are a spectacle to behold: at the top, a shining sun banishes the darkness, which is represented in the form of clouds. It really is marvelous to look at: like jewelry, it gleams brilliantly in the light, and the meteorological forms are very stunningly depicted. \u201cIn the lower part, held in a patinated bronze rock surrounded by raging waves, sits a terrestrial globe engraved with the different countries. This globe rotates on its axis in 24 hours, and the inclination of the poles varies according to the seasons. A long ray of sun indicates midday in the countries situated on the same latitude,\u201d the exhibition book explains further.\n\nA portrait of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) is also included in the exhibition\u2014she who was deemed by her lover Voltaire to be \u201ca great man whose only fault was being a woman.\u201d While living with and supporting the writer financially, she accumulated a very large library, carried out scientific experiments and wrote a great number of books. One of the first to appear, in 1738, was El\u00e9mens de la philosophie de Neuton (translated colloquially, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Newtonianism), which was thought to be by Voltaire but was, in fact, a collaborative effort. In addition to her literal translation of Newton\u2019s prose, du Ch\u00e2telet provided more accessible explanations of his arguments with clear examples: \u201cShe transformed his geometrical expositions into modern calculus, and also summarised the latest mathematical research and experimental vindications of his theories,\u201d says Versailles: Science and Splendour. I would have liked to have some space dedicated to the position of women in France at the time. Of the scientific community, how many were women? What level of education could a middle- or working-class woman attain? Sadly, this wider context is missing.\n\nThe construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles, which still function gloriously today, is given space. The plans for the mechanisms and piping that would deliver the requisite 9,500 cubic meters of water , composed by \u201csavants and engineers,\u201d along with the taxidermied rhinoceros and the Clock of the Creation of the World, really give the exhibition its splendor. That said, if I had the chance to curate such a show, I would dedicate one of the galleries to a reproduction of a palace room of Versailles, complete with paneled walls, gilding and paintings. The objects in the exhibition, though fascinating, are rendered a little clinical in their austere Science Museum settings. Nevertheless, the show is a tremendous feat and sure to spark curiosity in those who make the time to visit.\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour\u201d is at London\u2019s Science Museum through April 21, 2025."

With Tasks, users can schedule ChatGPT to perform certain actions at specific times, and receive notifications via email or directly through their phone.\n\nThe Tasks feature can be accessed through the profile icon in ChatGPT. You can select suggested tasks or create personalized reminders by asking ChatGPT directly.\n\nThese scheduled notifications can range from minor reminders like, \u201cPractice guitar daily,\u201d to comprehensive summaries, \u201cGive me an overview of today\u2019s financial news at market close.\u201d\n\nOpenAI president and cofounder Greg Brockman said in an X post that the company will focus on agents in 2025. As it relates to AI, an agent refers to programs that can autonomously perform assignments on behalf of a user.\n\nBloomberg reported that OpenAI is expected to release an enhanced agent, dubbed \u201cOperator,\u201d later this month. The upgraded agent is essentially Tasks, but with capabilities to write code or book travel.\n\nAccording to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, \u201cAgentic AI\u201d is on the rise.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter.\n\nLooking to keep your content fresh and relevant in 2025?\n\nThis will help. Today, Pinterest has launched its second annual \u201cPinterest Palette\u201d report, which provides an overview of key color trends in the app, based on research conducted for its Pinterest Predicts trends listing.\n\nAs explained by Pinterest:\n\n\u201cThe Pinterest Palette offers marketers inspiration driven by what over half a billion Pinners are searching, saving, and shopping for each month. Our in-house creative and insights teams worked hand-in-hand to map Pinterest Predicts trends and color clusters against first-party platform Pin color data. Looking at actions like saves, we were able to see which colors are driving engagement over time.\u201d\n\nThe report identifies the colors most likely to resonate with audiences this year, which Pinterest\u2019s team has narrowed down to five key hues.\n\nEach color gets its own overview, which includes Pin examples, hex codes, and a listing of tags related to that shade.\n\nIt\u2019s a good-looking report, which likely means that Pinterest has got the colors right, and they do feel fresh and vibrant, even if a bit Christmas-y.\n\n\u201cBrands can tap into the colors shaping the year ahead for mood boards, product launches, or creative campaigns. For example, health-focused condiment brand Primal Kitchen referenced Pinterest Predicts and the Pinterest Palette for their Colorful Kitchen Tour last year. Fusing the 2024 Pinterest Palette with their core brand colors, Primal Kitchen launched new dipping sauces with Predicts-inspired \u201cKitschens\u201d pop-ups in three major cities.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one way that you can use this insight, while it might also give you the spark of inspiration you need to refresh your branding efforts for the year ahead, with trending color tones that align with your audience.\n\nOr you might go with something else entirely, and that might also align with your customers\u2019 interests. There are no prescriptive rules here, but it is worth checking out Pinterest\u2019s color trends, and considering what they might mean for your brand efforts in 2025.\n\nYou can download Pinterest\u2019s \u201c2025 Pinterest Palette\u201d report here.\n\nRecommended Reading"

            "article_content": "The new Aurora Cloud Console, a groundbreaking, free-to-use plug-and-play solution for setting up your own decentralized network, has made it easier to create a blockchain than ever before.\n\nAurora Labs said in an announcement today that it\u2019s targeting decentralized application and memecoin developers who\u2019re fed up with the sluggish transaction speeds and lack of customization options on better-known blockchains such as Ethereum. Instead of deploying your dApp or token on that network, the Aurora Cloud Console gives you the option of creating a dedicated and customized blockchain for your own purposes.\n\nIn this way, it\u2019s breaking new ground in blockchain accessibility by tearing down the technical barriers to building decentralized networks.\n\nPreviously, the only people who would even dare to try and create their own blockchains are developers who possess years of expertise in software development, as well as knowledge of specialist programming languages like Solidity.\n\nWhat Aurora Lab\u2019s platform provides\n\nNow, it\u2019s possible for absolutely anyone to create their own blockchain, using Aurora\u2019s sophisticated no-code platform. Aurora Cloud Console aims to make the task as simple as creating an online store using a service such as Shopify. All you have to do is follow the step-by-step instructions, where you\u2019ll set parameters such as the gas fees, the native token and the kinds of permissions available. Once done, it will handle all the nasty, technical coding stuff for you. The end result will be a highly scalable Aurora Virtual Chain based on NEAR Protocol\u2019s ultra-rapid infrastructure, boasting superfast transaction speeds, EVM-compatibility and enterprise-grade security, plus access to a vast ecosystem of other dApps and Web3 services.\n\nAurora Labs has aspirations to get as many as 1,000 connected blockchains up and running by the end of the year. It\u2019s targeting creators of memecoins and other Web3 projects, and argues that building your own, customized EVM-compatible network will be the fastest way to scale.\n\nThe arrival of Aurora Cloud Console comes after the debut of TurboChain last month. That new network was one of the very first Aurora Virtual Chains to be deployed. It\u2019s a dedicated chain for the popular meme coin TURBO, which was previously deployed on Ethereum. By launching its own chain, the TURBO coin community is setting itself up for further growth, enabling users to pay their transaction gas fees using the TURBO token instead of ETH.\n\nAurora Labs Chief Executive Alex Shevchenko spelled out how big a deal the new platform really is, saying it allows anyone to create a fully customizable chain from scratch within days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve removed the complexity, so builders can focus on creating great products while tapping into a thriving ecosystem of liquidity, tools, and users,\u201d the executive explained. \u201cAurora Cloud Console is the gateway to Web3.\u201d\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

But analysts aren\u2019t betting on it.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8\n\nBank of America analysts revealed that although the U.S. software market grew 59% in 2023 and 23% in 2024, development projections still run below historical averages.\n\n\"Revenue multiples and growth expectations remain below 5-year median and pre-Covid levels,\u201d Bank of America said in its Jan. 14 report, pointing to the potential of three secular themes for 2025: Agentic AI, growing enterprise IT budgets, and sustained cloud migration.\n\nSalesforce's CEO Marc Benioff believes Agentic AI is a bold leap in the future of work.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nThree growth themes explained\n\nAgentic AI refers to AI systems that can learn, act, and make decisions autonomously, without constant human input. Bank of America sees it as a key differentiator for software companies.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI deployments could displace workers as early as 2H25 across industries, such as contact centers, software engineering and marketing,\u201d the firm noted.\n\nRelated: Analyst picks Microsoft as best stock to play AI spending surge in 2025\n\nThe second key trend is accelerated enterprise IT spending, which is expected to gather pace through 2026.\n\nTech heavyweights like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are spending heavily on AI and will likely expand their investments in 2025.\n\n\u201cDemand continues to be higher than our available capacity,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s finance chief, said during the company's earnings call last October.\n\nMoreover, sustained cloud migration remains a key growth driver for the software sector as optimization headwinds ease, Bank of America said.\n\n\"Although we remain selective on small caps, we are bullish on the software sector for 2025, particularly in 2H, as accelerating secular tailwinds and easing cyclical headwinds converge,\" the firm added.\n\nSo, who could be the winners in this gold rush? Bank of America has its bets.\n\nBank of America names Salesforce as its top pick for 2025\n\nBank of America sees potential for positive returns in undervalued names within subsectors like CRM (customer relationship management) and Infrastructure, which the firm identifies as particularly well-positioned for growth in 2025.\n\nRelated: Analysts reveal AI stock picks for 2025, including Palantir\n\nThe firm has named Salesforce (CRM) one of its top buys this year, alongside HubSpot (HUBS) , Microsoft (MSFT) , ServiceNow (NOW) , Datadog (DDOG) , GitLab (GTLB) , Global-e Online (GLBE) , Five9 (FIVN) , Monday.com (MNDY) , and Asana (ASAN) ."

China has been making agile policies that allow fast proof of concept, [as well as] failure and retry, which facilitates really quick iterations,\u201d said Ann Shi Yu, vice-president of autonomous driving company Pony.ai.\n\n\u201cThe competition in China is fiercer, which forces [companies] to progress,\u201d Shi said, noting that in the US only Alphabet-backed Waymo is capable of operating hundreds of fully autonomous robotaxis on public roads. In China, there is \u201cdefinitely more than one company doing that\u201d.\n\nPony.ai was operating around 250 robotaxis and roughly 190 robotrucks as of the end of 2024, according to Shi. Domestic rivals have also achieved a fleet size in the hundreds, including Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go which operates more than 400 robotaxis in Wuhan, Hubei province.\n\nThe panel discussion on AI at the Post\u2019s China Conference in Nansha on Wednesday. Photo: Nora Tam\n\nIn the field of robotics, UBTech\u2019s chief brand officer Michael Tam said that US competitors, including Tesla and OpenAI, \u201care a little bit advanced\u201d in terms of developing the \u201cbrain\u201d of robots, which is the artificial intelligence (AI) technology that controls a robot\u2019s sensors and movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the recent rise of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, which trained its large language model with fewer resources but ended up with one that matched or even exceeded in certain areas the performance of larger US competitors such as OpenAI and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, proved that \u201cthere\u2019s not so much [of a] gap between the US and mainland China\u201d for AI, Tam said."

Now he has to get consumers to care.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors and he wants the chatbot built on it to be used by 500 million people by the end of 2025, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t said how many people currently use Gemini, but market leader ChatGPT has about 300 million weekly users. The Gemini app was the 54th most downloaded free app on iPhones Wednesday. ChatGPT was No. 4.\n\nGoogle was caught flat-footed by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, despite being one of the pioneers of AI and spending years working on similar chatbots. The company has been scrambling to catch up ever since.\n\nGemini isn\u2019t yet a serious moneymaker, but it is central to Google\u2019s push to stay on the cutting edge of AI, a technology already starting to reshape the company\u2019s core search and ads businesses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s newest AI technology jumped ahead of ChatGPT maker OpenAI\u2019s technology last month on the Chatbot Arena rankings closely watched by people in Silicon Valley. OpenAI dominated the rankings for much of the past year.\n\nGoogle launched the Gemini chatbot, formerly Bard, a few months after ChatGPT and has updated it with dozens of new features in an effort to gain ground. OpenAI, meanwhile, began directly targeting Google last summer when it added a web-search function to ChatGPT.\n\nThe ChatGPT mobile app has been downloaded about 465 million times on Android and iOS devices, compared with 106 million for Gemini, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nMost of those downloads came on Android phones. Until recently, Gemini was part of Google\u2019s search app on Apple devices. A separate Gemini app for iOS made its debut in November. Google said it was downloaded more than 10 million times through the end of the year.\n\nUsage of AI features built into other applications, such as Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, aren\u2019t captured by publicly available measures.\n\nUntil recently, the Gemini chatbot team reported to the executive in charge of search and ads, but a recent reorganization moved it to the Google DeepMind division that does advanced research.\n\nPichai said at the time that the move would \u201cenable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app.\"\n\nGrowth in search advertising has slowed in recent years, and Google has increasingly looked to new business lines including subscriptions. It offers a premium version of Gemini with more features for $20 a month, similar to other chatbots.\n\nBut unlike its competitors, Google packages its Gemini subscription with perks including AI features in apps like Gmail and two terabytes of file storage.\n\nSifei Han, a data scientist living in Philadelphia, upgraded to the Gemini premium plan last year after being offered a two-month free trial. He said he mainly uses it for the extra storage, not the AI features.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with ChatGPT\u2019s style,\" said Han, who also pays for ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAbout 60% of Gemini\u2019s paying users kept their subscriptions six months after first signing up, according to an Earnest Analytics analysis of debit- and credit-card data from millions of anonymous consumers. That was better than some competitors such as Character.AI and Perplexity, but lagged behind OpenAI and Anthropic, which makes the chatbot Claude.\n\nSubscriptions to Gemini were a fraction of the $10.7 billion in revenue Google parent Alphabet made from subscriptions, device sales and purchases in its mobile app store in the three months ended September. Google\u2019s core advertising business brought in $65.9 billion during the same period. The company hasn\u2019t introduced ads in Gemini.\n\nGemini has been a source of controversy in the past. Google apologized to users and rolled back an image-generation feature last year after the chatbot produced images of Black soldiers in Nazi garb and sometimes refused to generate depictions of white people. It restored the feature six months later.\n\nIn addition to the chatbot, Gemini is powering features that perform complex tasks for users, like preparing research reports and generating podcasts based on a set of documents.\n\nGoogle sells the technology that powers Gemini to developers, uses it for the \u201cAI overviews\" that sometimes appear at the top of search results and recently began packaging it with the business versions of Gmail and Google Drive. Pichai has said all of Google\u2019s products with more than two billion users now have features powered by Gemini.\n\nThe company has also tried to convince device manufacturers to make Gemini the default assistant on mobile phones, which it already does on its own Pixel phones. Motorola and OnePlus, which both use Google\u2019s Android mobile software, made Gemini the default on some of their phones last year.\n\nWrite to Miles Kruppa at"

Image: Adobe Stock\n\nWhile the definitive diagnosis of iRBD requires in-laboratory video polysomnography, which can be both costly and challenging to interpret, a recent study used a 3D time-of-flight camera in a sleep laboratory with high accuracy, the researchers wrote.\n\nIn this study, During and colleagues sought to replicate and expand on those results utilizing a conventional 2D camera to monitor patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep difficulties and create a machine-learning analysis method, to replicate prior research attempted with a 3D lens in track sleep-related movements.\n\nTheir study featured 172 participants \u2014 81 with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls \u2014 evaluated between 2016 and 2022 at Stanford Sleep Center. The control group included 28 healthy sleepers and 63 individuals with other sleep disorders, who were matched to iRBD patients by age and sex.\n\nAll video-EEG polysomnography recordings were made with a 2D camera, shooting at 30 frames per second and were manually scored by two blinded sleep experts. A blinded sleep specialist also reviewed all recordings of iRBD patients to determine which individuals had visible movements in REM sleep.\n\nThe researchers then used an optical flow computer vision algorithm to analyze these recordings and extract features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility.\n\nAfter review, it was determined that the control group was comprised of 28 healthy individuals and 63 with a sleep disorder. Within the iRBD group, 11 individuals did not have visible movements during REM sleep.\n\nAccording to results, individuals with iRBD demonstrated an increased amount of movements (56.3 vs. 41.8 per hour; average movement duration, 3.4 vs. 4.2 seconds) and immobility periods, compared with controls.\n\nThe accuracy for distinguishing iRBD from other sleep disorders ranged from 84.9% to 87.2%, with the highest accuracy (91.9%) achieved when combining all five movement features and analyzing only short movements. Of 11 patients with iRBD without visible movements during REM sleep, seven were correctly identified.\n\n\u201cThis automated approach could be integrated into clinical workflow during the interpretation of sleep tests to enhance and facilitate diagnosis, and avoid missed diagnoses,\u201d During said in a related Mount Sinai press release. \u201cThis method could also be used to inform treatment decisions based on the severity of movements displayed during the sleep tests and, ultimately, help doctors personalize care plans for individual patients.\u201d\n\nReference:"

By signing, the US joins 120 countries working together to protect students, teachers, and schools from violent attacks.\n\nAttacks on schools occur in almost every armed conflict around the world. Each year, thousands of students and teachers are killed and injured, schools destroyed, and children denied the future only education brings.\n\nBy signing the declaration, countries promise to investigate and prosecute attacks that violate the laws of war, help victims, try to continue education during wartime, restore access after attacks, and protect schools from military use.\n\nIn the decade since the declaration was first launched, more than a dozen countries have revised their military guidance to ensure more protection for schools and education. Several have prosecuted people responsible for attacking schools. UN peacekeepers have stopped deploying in schools.\n\nUS policy already supports the declaration\u2019s key elements \u2013 for example, the US military includes schools in its official \u201cno strike\u201d lists, recognizing that schools not being used for military purposes are protected civilian property under the laws of war.\n\nSigning the declaration puts the US on the right side of a global movement its main military allies have already joined. Given its influence, the US move could help expand the group of countries putting their political muscle behind children and their education, encouraging allies, such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea to join. Signing better allows the US to use the declaration\u2019s guidance, written by military officers, to urge other countries to respect the laws of war, including when it trains other militaries. Protecting schools globally also protects the US\u2019 significant investments in international education before, during, and after conflict.\n\nThe US signing of the declaration couldn\u2019t be more timely or relevant. In the past year, almost every school in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, more than 3,790 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Countries that have not yet endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration should move quickly to do so, and show that schools, teachers, and students are off-limits in times of war."

(Credit: Ariel Schalit/AP.)\n\nListen\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 As Israel and Hamas close-in on a ceasefire agreement, the Catholic ordinaries in the Holy Land said the deal is a necessary step, but also acknowledged that more has to happen to \u201ccredibly address the deep-rooted issues\u201d at the core of the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this ceasefire will mark an important end to the violence that has caused immeasurable suffering. It is a necessary step to halt the destruction and meet the urgent humanitarian needs of countless families affected by the conflict,\u201d the Catholic ordinaries said in a Jan. 16 statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are aware that the end of the war does not mean the end of the conflict,\u201d the Catholic ordinaries said. \u201cIt is therefore necessary to seriously and credibly address the deep-rooted issues that have been at the root of this conflict for far too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenuine and lasting peace can only be achieved through a just solution that addresses the origin of this long-standing struggle,\u201d they continued. \u201cThis requires a long process, a willingness to acknowledge each other\u2019s suffering and a focused education in trust that leads to overcoming fear of the other and the justification of violence as a political tool.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1992, The Assembly of the Catholic Ordinaries in Holy Land includes the bishops, eparchs and exarchs of the Catholic Church holding jurisdiction over the territory of the Holy Land: Jerusalem, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Cyprus. The ordinaries belong to the Latin Church, Maronite Church and the Greek Melkite, Armenian, Syriac, and Chaldean Catholic Churches.\n\nCurrently, the assembly has 27 members. It is statutorily chaired by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, currently Italian Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa.\n\nPizzaballa, in a Jan. 16 statement, called the ceasefire the \u201cnecessary turning point we needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hope is that this is the beginning of a process \u2013 albeit lengthy \u2013 that will, hopefully, bring lasting peace,\u201d Pizzaballa said, while also noting that in the immediate the ceasefire agreement should make it easier to get humanitarian aid into Gaza where people are \u201cin desperate need of support.\u201d\n\nBishop Elias Zaidan, chair of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on International Justice and Peace also said he receives the news with great hope, calling it \u201can encouraging sign of peace for a region that has seen far too much bloodshed and destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pray that this peace can take firm and lasting root in the Middle East, and I renew my gratitude for the crucial, peacebuilding role that the United States has played in this ceasefire and hostage release,\u201d Zaidan, bishop of the Maronite Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon said in a Jan. 16 statement.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement was announced on Jan. 15. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said Jan. 16 that a \u201clast minute crisis\u201d with Hamas was holding it up. If approved, it would bring an end to the fighting in Gaza for 42 days, and free dozens of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.\n\nHamas started the current war with its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, in which it killed about 1,200 people and took another 250 people hostage. Of the estimated 100 hostages who remain in Gaza, one third are believed dead, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nIf an agreement is made and the ceasefire begins, Israel and Hamas would need to reach a second agreement for it to continue beyond the initial 42 days.\n\nThe Catholic ordinaries said in their statement, which was published before Netanyahu announced the deal was on hold, that they pray the ceasefire brings a sense of \u201cserenity and relief,\u201d and \u201callow all to find solace, rebuild their lives and regain hope for the future.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic ordinaries expressed an \u201cunwavering hope\u201d they maintain for the future. They also expressed hope that the ceasefire agreement inspires new efforts \u201cfor dialogue, mutual understanding and lasting peace for all,\u201d and called on political leaders worldwide to lead those efforts.\n\n\u201cFinally, we call on political leaders and the international community to develop a clear and just political vision for the post-war period,\u201d the Catholic ordinaries said. \u201cA future built on dignity, security and freedom for all peoples is a prerequisite for true and lasting peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge all parties to implement the immediate steps and negotiate the future steps of the agreement in good faith,\u201d the Catholic ordinaries continued.\n\nLike others, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development \u2013 the official aid agency of the Catholic Church in England in Wales \u2013 said that the temporary pause to the fighting brings a \u201cwelcome respite,\u201d but also highlighted the need for a long-term agreement.\n\n\u201cThis temporary pause will bring a welcome respite in hostilities, but it is vital this pause extends into a long-term ceasefire, a sustainable, just and lasting peace, and an end to the occupation to end the suffering of people in Gaza, bringing peace and security across the region,\u201d Janet Symes, the agency\u2019s head of region for Asia and the Middle said in a Jan. 15 statement."

The index was down 3% through Thursday.\n\nBut underneath the surface, a lot of damage has been done to the internals of the S&P 500, making the paltry decline more painful for investors.\n\nSince December 6, just 19% of stocks within the S&P 500 posted a positive return through Tuesday. More than half of the index's underlying stocks posted a negative return of at least 5%, and about 20% of the index posted losses of nearly 10% or more.\n\nSome of the worst-performing stocks during this time period include Chipotle, down 11%; Palo Alto Networks, down 12%; and Adobe, down 23%.\n\nOther technical indicators have showcased most stocks' overwhelmingly negative trading environment over the past six weeks.\n\nOne popular technical breadth measure, the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 200-day moving averages, plunged from about 75% on December 6 to as low as 50% on Monday, hitting its lowest level since November 2023.\n\nLPL Financial\n\nAccording to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, the 25 percentage point plunge in the popular market breadth measure, coinciding with just a 4% drop in the S&P 500 index, is a warning sign for investors, at least in the short term.\n\n\"This divergence between price and breadth implies fewer and fewer stocks participated in the post-Election Day breakout to new highs,\" Turnquist said in a note on Monday. \"While these deviations can persist for extended periods, they often foreshadow building vulnerabilities of a rally susceptible to stalling.\"\n\nTurnquist warned that if the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 200-day moving average dips below 48%, future returns could be weak, with average 12-month forward returns at -7.3% when that happens based on historical data.\n\nTurnquist highlighted the S&P 500's rising 200-day moving average at about 5,585 as a logical area of support for the index. A move to that level would represent further downside of 6% from current levels and a peak-to-trough decline of about 8%.\n\nAnother measure of the deterioration in market breadth is the equal-weighted S&P 500 index, which has declined as much as 7% since December 6, nearly double the S&P 500's decline over the same time period.\n\nDan Greenhaus, chief strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management, highlighted the breadth divergence in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.\n\n\"There's been huge drops in some of these stocks. AMD, Micron down 30%, 40%, 50% from their highs,\" Greenhaus said. \"You're doing a disservice by looking merely at the headline and saying, 'well, stocks are down 3%, 4%, 5% from the highs.' I think that obviously misses the larger story.\"\n\nUltimately, as damaging as the recent sell-off has been to the stock market's internals, Turnquist sees it as a buying opportunity for investors, even if it continues to trend lower.\n\n\"The silver lining to a deeper drawdown is that it could provide a buying opportunity back into this bull market, as most importantly, the S&P 500 remains above its longer-term uptrend, and fundamentals are on solid footing,\" Turnquist said.\n\nGreenhaus agrees, telling CNBC that specifically for the growing AI story and broader technology sector, as long as the fundamentals stay strong, putting money to work at these levels makes sense.\n\n\"If you believe that a lot of those stories remain intact, then this is a tremendous buying opportunity,\" Greenhaus said."

            "article_content": "Senators pressed some of President-elect Donald Trump's top Cabinet picks on Thursday on his central campaign promises, critical natural disaster relief and more.\n\nInterior secretary nominee Doug Burgum, proposed Environmental Protection Agency director Lee Zeldin, Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent and Housing secretary nominee Scott Turner all went before lawmakers. After fiery faceoffs earlier in the week, they were asked in calmer hearings about the nation's economy and readiness for natural disasters and climate change.\n\nBessent would be Trump\u2019s point person on key GOP priorities such as tax cuts and tariffs. Meanwhile, Burgum and Zeldin would both have sway over the Trump administration's energy policy, a cornerstone of the president-elect's reelection bid.\n\nHere are USA TODAY's top takeaways from the hearings.\n\nMore:Takeaways from Senate confirmation hearings: Democrats grill Trump Cabinet nominee\n\nBipartisan concerns about tariffs\n\nTrump often talks about implementing tariffs on foreign goods, deploying them during his first term and promising more in a second administration.\n\n\u201cThe word tariff, properly used, is a beautiful word - one of the most beautiful words I've ever heard,\u201d Trump told a crowd of Georgia supporters in September. \u201cIt's music to my ears.\u201d\n\nBessent, a prominent hedge fund manager, said Americans should think about tariffs in three ways under Trump: As a negotiating tool, way to remedy \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d and avenue for raising revenue.\n\nBut some lawmakers are nervous about mores tariffs.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Bessent that tariffs on Canadian goods, a move Trump has repeatedly said he's inclined to make, could impact the economy in his New England state.\n\n\u201cIt would raise the cost to businesses, probably cost jobs and cost to consumers,\u201d Welch said. \u201cSo what reassurance can we get from the Trump administration that there\u2019s going to be a do-no-harm policy to American consumers and Vermont workers and small businesses with a tariff policy?\u201d\n\nBessent argued Trump is sensitive to the needs of \"working America,\" but he admitted to lawmakers it's \u201cvery difficult for me to isolate Vermont especially.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., raised concerns about the impact of tariffs on U.S. farmers\n\n\u201cTariffs, for a time, strengthen America\u2019s negotiating leverage with other nations\u2026 but overuse of tariffs can inflate costs and provoke trade retaliation,\u201d Young told Bessent. \u201cAs Hoosier farmers have experienced first hand over the years, they often bare the impact.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to impose massive tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status are likely to reignite inflation and dampen economic growth, according to forecasters.\n\nYet his pledge to extend and expand the sweeping tax cuts passed in his first term and ease the regulatory burden on businesses could juice the economy and have mixed effects on inflation.\n\nClimate questions\n\nTrump has promised to expand oil production in the U.S., and he'll lean on Burgum to help. The former North Dakota governor told senators on Thursday he believes America has reached an energy crisis.\n\nRepublicans like West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who owns a coal mining business, told Burgum energy is \u201ca key that opens every door.\u201d\n\nBut Burgum also quickly faced questions about climate change, and he told senators he believes it exists.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, pointed to testimonies previously given by former Secretaries of Defense James Mattis and Chuck Hagel in which they said climate change is a critical national security threat and affects areas where troops are stationed.\n\nMore:'When can he start?': Trump allies bullish on Cabinet nominees getting confirmed\n\n\u201cWithin fossil fuels, the concern has been about emissions, and within emissions, we have the technology to do things like carbon capture to eliminate harmful emission,\u201d Burgum said.\n\nMore:What is carbon capture and how does it work? Inside the process that could slow global warming\n\n\u201cYou have military leaders who acknowledge that climate change is a major issue,\" Hirono shot back. \"For you to take the position that you're going to engage in active actions that will result in the burden of burning more fossil fuel, it's troubling.\"\n\nZeldin was also questioned about climate change during his hearing.\n\n\u201cDo you agree with President-elect Trump that climate change is a hoax?\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked.\n\nZeldin replied that he believes climate change is real, before defending his potential future boss.\n\n\u201cAs far as President Trump goes, the context that I have heard him speak about it was with a criticism of policies that have been enacted because of climate change,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cAnd I think that he\u2019s concerned about the economic costs of some policies where there\u2019s a debate and a difference of opinion between parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would respectfully disagree with you,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWildfire control \u2018very key\u2019\n\nBurgum would also run an agency that manages vast expanses of land, and wildfire control played a major role in his hearing.\n\nSens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., opened their remarks by addressing the California wildfires that have left 25 dead and thousands of schools, businesses and other structures destroyed in the Greater Los Angeles area. Lee directed Burgum that, if he's confirmed, addressing wildfires that shocked Western states should be a \"very key priority\" for the country's future.\n\nElsewhere, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned Zeldin on his willingness to advocate for Californians affected by the Los Angeles-area wildfires fires, referencing the state's traditionally blue voting record.\n\nTrump and certain House Republicans have signaled their interest in placing conditions on disaster aid for California, amid tense relations between the president-elect and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\u201cI assume, Mr. Zeldin, your response will not depend on whether disaster strikes a red state or a blue state, you will equally work to speed relief to those Americans affected?\u201d Schiff asked Thursday.\n\n\u201cYes, senator,\u201d Zeldin replied. The potential Trump pick vowed he would \"do everything in my power to be able to assist\" devastated communities.\n\nTax fight preview\n\nTrump\u2019s signature achievement during his first administration was a massive tax cut.\n\nSome of those tax cut provisions expire at the end of 2025. Trump wants to extend them and has promised new cuts, including ending taxes on tipped wages and Social Security payments.\n\nBessent said extending the Trump tax cuts is the single most important economic issue of the day.\n\n\u201cThis is pass- fail, that if we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing an economic calamity,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans on the committee echoed those comments. Democrats argued the tax cuts disproportionately benefited the rich, which Bessent disputed.\n\n\u201cCan we think of a better idea in the halls here than cutting taxes for the wealthiest people and expecting it will trickle down for everybody else\u2026 ?\u201d said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.\n\nBessent was also asked about everything from increasing the federal minimum wage to capping credit card interest rates and increasing economic sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBessent said he doesn\u2019t support increasing the minimum wage at the federal level. He argued the issue should be left to states, which already have widely varying minimum pay.\n\nHe was open to increasing sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"If any officials in the Russian Federation are watching this confirmation hearing they should know that if I'm confirmed, and if President Trump requests as part of his strategy to end the Ukraine war, that I would be 100% on board for taking sanctions up,\" Bessent said.\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson"

As AI moves beyond centralized data centers, we\u2019re seeing smartphones run sophisticated language models locally, smart devices processing computer vision at the edge and autonomous vehicles making split-second decisions without cloud connectivity.\n\n\u201cA lot of attention in the AI space right now is on training, which makes sense in traditional hyperscale public clouds,\u201d said Rita Kozlov, VP of product at Cloudflare. \u201cYou need a bunch of powerful machines close together to do really big workloads, and those clusters of machines are what are going to predict the weather, or model a new pharmaceutical discovery. But we\u2019re right on the cusp of AI workloads shifting from training to inference, and that\u2019s where we see edge becoming the dominant paradigm.\u201d\n\nKozlov predicts that inference will move progressively closer to users \u2014 either running directly on devices, as with autonomous vehicles, or at the network edge. \u201cFor AI to become a part of a regular person\u2019s daily life, they\u2019re going to expect it to be instantaneous and seamless, just like our expectations for web performance changed once we carried smartphones in our pockets and started to depend on it for every transaction,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd because not every device is going to have the power or battery life to do inference, the edge is the next best place.\u201d\n\nYet this shift toward edge computing won\u2019t necessarily reduce cloud usage as many predicted. Instead, the proliferation of edge AI is driving increased cloud consumption, revealing an interdependency that could reshape enterprise AI strategies. In fact, edge inference represents only the final step in a complex AI pipeline that depends heavily on cloud computing for data storage, processing and model training.\n\nNew research from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Microsoft Research Asia demonstrates just how deep this dependency runs \u2014 and why the cloud\u2019s role may actually grow more vital as edge AI expands. The researchers\u2019 extensive testing reveals the intricate interplay required between cloud, edge and client devices to make AI tasks work more effectively.\n\nHow edge and cloud complement each other in AI deployments\n\nTo understand exactly how this cloud-edge relationship works in practice, the research team constructed a test environment mirroring real-world enterprise deployments. Their experimental setup included Microsoft Azure cloud servers for orchestration and heavy processing, a GeForce RTX 4090 edge server for intermediate computation and Jetson Nano boards representing client devices. This three-layer architecture revealed the precise computational demands at each level.\n\nThe key test involved processing user requests expressed in natural language. When a user asked the system to analyze a photo, GPT running on the Azure cloud server first interpreted the request, then determined which specialized AI models to invoke. For image classification tasks, it deployed a vision transformer model, while image captioning and visual questions used bootstrapping language-image rre-training (BLIP). This demonstrated how cloud servers must handle the complex orchestration of multiple AI models, even for seemingly simple requests.\n\nThe team\u2019s most significant finding came when they compared three different processing approaches. Edge-only inference, which relied solely on the RTX 4090 server, performed well when network bandwidth exceeded 300 KB/s, but faltered dramatically as speeds dropped. Client-only inference running on the Jetson Nano boards avoided network bottlenecks but couldn\u2019t handle complex tasks like visual question answering. The hybrid approach \u2014 splitting computation between edge and client \u2014 proved most resilient, maintaining performance even when bandwidth fell below optimal levels.\n\nThese limitations drove the team to develop new compression techniques specifically for AI workloads. Their task-oriented method achieved remarkable efficiency: Maintaining 84.02% accuracy on image classification while reducing data transmission from 224KB to just 32.83KB per instance. For image captioning, they preserved high-quality results (biLingual evaluation understudy \u2014 BLEU \u2014 scores of 39.58 vs 39.66) while slashing bandwidth requirements by 92%. These improvements demonstrate how edge-cloud systems must evolve specialized optimizations to work effectively.\n\nBut the team\u2019s federated learning experiments revealed perhaps the most compelling evidence of edge-cloud symbiosis. Running tests across 10 Jetson Nano boards acting as client devices, they explored how AI models could learn from distributed data while maintaining privacy. The system operated with real-world network constraints: 250 KB/s uplink and 500 KB/s downlink speeds, typical of edge deployments.\n\nThrough careful orchestration between cloud and edge, the system achieved over ~68% accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset while keeping all training data local to the devices. CIFAR10 is a widely used dataset in machine learning (ML) and computer vision for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 color images, each 32X32 pixels in size, divided into 10 different classes. The dataset includes 6,000 images per class, with 5,000 for training and 1,000 for testing.\n\nThis success required an intricate dance: Edge devices running local training iterations, the cloud server aggregating model improvements without accessing raw data and a sophisticated compression system to minimize network traffic during model updates.\n\nThis federated approach proved particularly significant for real-world applications. For visual question-answering tasks under bandwidth constraints, the system maintained 78.22% accuracy while requiring only 20.39KB per transmission \u2014 nearly matching the 78.32% accuracy of implementations that required 372.58KB. The dramatic reduction in data transfer requirements, combined with strong accuracy preservation, demonstrated how cloud-edge systems could maintain high performance even in challenging network conditions.\n\nArchitecting for edge-cloud\n\nThe research findings present a roadmap for organizations planning AI deployments, with implications that cut across network architecture, hardware requirements and privacy frameworks. Most critically, the results suggest that attempting to deploy AI solely at the edge or solely in the cloud leads to significant compromises in performance and reliability.\n\nNetwork architecture emerges as a critical consideration. While the study showed that high-bandwidth tasks like visual question answering need up to 500 KB/s for optimal performance, the hybrid architecture demonstrated remarkable adaptability. When network speeds dropped below 300 KB/s, the system automatically redistributed workloads between edge and cloud to maintain performance. For example, when processing visual questions under bandwidth constraints, the system achieved 78.22% accuracy using just 20.39KB per transmission \u2014 nearly matching the 78.32% accuracy of full-bandwidth implementations that required 372.58KB.\n\nThe hardware configuration findings challenge common assumptions about edge AI requirements. While the edge server utilized a high-end GeForce RTX 4090, client devices ran effectively on modest Jetson Nano boards. Different tasks showed distinct hardware demands:\n\nImage classification worked well on basic client devices with minimal cloud support\n\nImage captioning required more substantial edge server involvement\n\nVisual question answering required sophisticated cloud-edge coordination\n\nFor enterprises concerned with data privacy, the federated learning implementation offers a particularly compelling model. By achieving 70% accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset while keeping all training data local to devices, the system demonstrated how organizations can leverage AI capabilities without compromising sensitive information. This required coordinating three key elements:\n\nLocal model training on edge devices\n\nSecure model update aggregation in the cloud\n\nPrivacy-preserving compression for model updates\n\nBuild versus buy\n\nOrganizations that view edge AI merely as a way to reduce cloud dependency are missing the larger transformation. The research suggests that successful edge AI deployments require deep integration between edge and cloud resources, sophisticated orchestration layers and new approaches to data management.\n\nThe complexity of these systems means that even organizations with substantial technical resources may find building custom solutions counterproductive. While the research presents a compelling case for hybrid cloud-edge architectures, most organizations simply won\u2019t need to build such systems from scratch.\n\nInstead, enterprises can leverage existing edge computing providers to achieve similar benefits. Cloudflare, for example, has built out one of the largest global footprints for AI inference, with GPUs now deployed in more than 180 cities worldwide. The company also recently enhanced its network to support larger models like Llama 3.1 70B while reducing median query latency to just 31 milliseconds, compared to 549ms previously.\n\nThese improvements extend beyond raw performance metrics. Cloudflare\u2019s introduction of persistent logs and enhanced monitoring capabilities addresses another key finding from the research: The need for sophisticated orchestration between edge and cloud resources. Their vector database improvements, which now support up to 5 million vectors with dramatically reduced query times, show how commercial platforms can deliver task-oriented optimization.\n\nFor enterprises looking to deploy edge AI applications, the choice increasingly isn\u2019t whether to build or buy, but rather which provider can best support their specific use cases. The rapid advancement of commercial platforms means organizations can focus on developing their AI applications rather than building infrastructure. As edge AI continues to evolve, this trend toward specialized platforms that abstract away the complexity of edge-cloud coordination is likely to accelerate, making sophisticated edge AI capabilities accessible to a broader range of organizations.\n\nThe new AI infrastructure economics\n\nThe convergence of edge computing and AI is revealing something far more significant than a technical evolution \u2014 it\u2019s unveiling a fundamental restructuring of the AI infrastructure economy. There are three transformative shifts that will reshape enterprise AI strategy.\n\nFirst, we\u2019re witnessing the emergence of what might be called \u201cinfrastructure arbitrage\u201d in AI deployment. The true value driver isn\u2019t raw computing power \u2014 it\u2019s the ability to dynamically optimize workload distribution across a global network. This suggests that enterprises building their own edge AI infrastructure aren\u2019t just competing against commercial platforms; they\u2019re also competing against the fundamental economics of global scale and optimization.\n\nSecond, the research reveals an emerging \u201ccapability paradox\u201d in edge AI deployment. As these systems become more sophisticated, they actually increase rather than decrease dependency on cloud resources. This contradicts the conventional wisdom that edge computing represents a move away from centralized infrastructure. Instead, we\u2019re seeing the emergence of a new economic model where edge and cloud capabilities are multiplicative rather than substitutive \u2014 creating value through their interaction rather than their independence.\n\nPerhaps most profoundly, the rise of what could be termed \u201corchestration capital,\u201d where competitive advantage derives not from owning infrastructure or developing models, but from the sophisticated optimization of how these resources interact. It\u2019s about building a new form of intellectual property around the orchestration of AI workloads.\n\nFor enterprise leaders, these insights demand a fundamental rethinking of AI strategy. The traditional build-versus-buy decision framework is becoming obsolete in a world where the key value driver is orchestrating. Organizations that understand this shift will stop viewing edge AI as a technical infrastructure decision and begin seeing it as a strategic capability that requires new forms of expertise and organizational learning.\n\nLooking ahead, this suggests that the next wave of AI innovation won\u2019t come from better models or faster hardware, but from increasingly sophisticated approaches to orchestrating the interaction between edge and cloud resources. The entire economic structure of AI deployment is likely to evolve accordingly.\n\nThe enterprises that thrive in this new landscape will be those that develop deep competencies in what might be called \u201corchestration intelligence,\u201d or the ability to dynamically optimize complex hybrid systems for maximum value creation. This represents a fundamental shift in how we think about competitive advantage in the AI era, moving from a focus on ownership and control to a focus on optimization and orchestration."

            "article_content": "\u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi\u201d is a phrase attributed to French king Louis XIV, the Sun King, though it is considered by historians to be apocryphal: meaning \u201cI am the state,\u201d it speaks to the king\u2019s absolute and divinely ordained power. Three kings ruled from the Palace of Versailles: Louis XIV until his death in 1715, then Louis XV from 1722 until 1774 and finally, Louis XVI until the Revolution of 1789. Louis XV was among the best-educated royals of his age, and his knowledge was of a mostly scientific nature. From the age of seven, he was passionate about cartography, and at age eleven, he discovered astronomy. \u201cIn addition to his core education, he touched upon anatomy and surgery, and from medicine, he went on to study botany. He read a great deal, assiduously consulted the maps in his geography gallery, attended dissections, studied plants at Trianon [a smaller building at Versailles] and observed the heavens, following every astronomical event,\u201d writes French art historian Beatrix Saule in the book that accompanies the London Science Museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour.\u201d While Versailles and its kings have always been regarded as sumptuous and somewhat decadent against a backdrop of the then-starving French peasantry, the scientific pursuits of the kings are not at the top of public consciousness. Until, that is, this show was put together.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I was surprised, therefore, that the revolution was mentioned only briefly in this exhibition: while it is written on plaques that scientific instruments were destroyed or stolen during the riots, it is not explained at length, nor is it explained fully as to whether the republic that followed adopted the scientific discoveries of their forebears. This, I feel, is a glaring omission, and one that will leave visitors wanting to know more: while the exhibition book mentions that \u201cdocuments and scientific instruments were scattered at the time of the revolutionary sales in 1793-94, when Versailles was emptied of all its furnishings\u201d and that objects were taken to various institutions, it does not feel thorough. True, the exhibition is entitled \u201cVersailles\u201d rather than \u201cFrance: Science and Splendour,\u201d but more background wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nThe star of the show is Louis XV\u2019s rhino. The male Indian rhinoceros presented to Louis XV in 1769 by Jean-Baptiste Chevalier de Conan, the governor of Chandernagore (now Chandannagar) in Bengal, has pride of place in the exhibition\u2019s main room. The plaque reads that he was killed during the revolution, possibly drowning in the fountains or after being stabbed with a sword. While he lived, the rhinoceros was among thousands of animals from Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the royal menagerie. They were a source of inspiration for many artists, such as the Flemish animal painter Pieter Boel, whose studies included a painting of one of the rarest birds in the menagerie, the cassowary, sent to Versailles in 1671 from Madagascar.\n\nThe other star of the show is the Clock of the Creation of the World (the Pendule de la Cr\u00e9ation du monde). At the time of its manufacture\u20141754\u2014clocks were considered to be the most sophisticated and most prestigious devices ever made. Its design and mechanisms are a spectacle to behold: at the top, a shining sun banishes the darkness, which is represented in the form of clouds. It really is marvelous to look at: like jewelry, it gleams brilliantly in the light, and the meteorological forms are very stunningly depicted. \u201cIn the lower part, held in a patinated bronze rock surrounded by raging waves, sits a terrestrial globe engraved with the different countries. This globe rotates on its axis in 24 hours, and the inclination of the poles varies according to the seasons. A long ray of sun indicates midday in the countries situated on the same latitude,\u201d the exhibition book explains further.\n\nA portrait of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) is also included in the exhibition\u2014she who was deemed by her lover Voltaire to be \u201ca great man whose only fault was being a woman.\u201d While living with and supporting the writer financially, she accumulated a very large library, carried out scientific experiments and wrote a great number of books. One of the first to appear, in 1738, was El\u00e9mens de la philosophie de Neuton (translated colloquially, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Newtonianism), which was thought to be by Voltaire but was, in fact, a collaborative effort. In addition to her literal translation of Newton\u2019s prose, du Ch\u00e2telet provided more accessible explanations of his arguments with clear examples: \u201cShe transformed his geometrical expositions into modern calculus, and also summarised the latest mathematical research and experimental vindications of his theories,\u201d says Versailles: Science and Splendour. I would have liked to have some space dedicated to the position of women in France at the time. Of the scientific community, how many were women? What level of education could a middle- or working-class woman attain? Sadly, this wider context is missing.\n\nThe construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles, which still function gloriously today, is given space. The plans for the mechanisms and piping that would deliver the requisite 9,500 cubic meters of water , composed by \u201csavants and engineers,\u201d along with the taxidermied rhinoceros and the Clock of the Creation of the World, really give the exhibition its splendor. That said, if I had the chance to curate such a show, I would dedicate one of the galleries to a reproduction of a palace room of Versailles, complete with paneled walls, gilding and paintings. The objects in the exhibition, though fascinating, are rendered a little clinical in their austere Science Museum settings. Nevertheless, the show is a tremendous feat and sure to spark curiosity in those who make the time to visit.\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour\u201d is at London\u2019s Science Museum through April 21, 2025."
