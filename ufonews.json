        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

        "article_content": "The ongoing galactic game of 20 questions contnues with people and governments trying to confirm the origins UFOs and UAPs are related to aliens in any shape or form. The most recent Pentagon report seems to conclude that most of the sightings people have witnessed haven't necessarily been related to extraterrestrials. Instead, these \"craft\" were likely connected to secret projects by groups and governments right here on Earth. The phone call is coming from inside the house.\n\nNo matter what you believe about the nature of \"flying saucers,\" there is one sighting labeled the \"most convincing\" UFO encounter in history. According to CBC, the Falcon Lake incident in Canada is being called the \"best-documented UFO case\" 50 years after the actual event.\n\nThe story has been covered in books and shows, including Unsolved Mysteries at one point, but it originates from May 1967 in the Falcon Lake woods in Manitoba, Canada. \"I recalled seeing him in bed. He didn't look good at all. He looked pale, haggard,\" Stan Michalak said about his father. \"When I walked into the bedroom there was a huge stink in the room, like a real horrible aroma of sulphur and burnt motor. It was all around and it was coming out of his pores. It was bad.\"\n\nMichalak was only a nine-year-old at the time but has detailed the incident as co-author of When They Appear, a book written with UFO researcher Chris Rutkowski. The book came out in 2017, but recently resurfaced due to coverage online at outlets like Daily Star.\n\nAccording to the account, Stefan Michalak was in the woods when he encountered a pair of \"cigar-shaped objects\" nearby, changing hues while floating before taking a disc shape. Michalak started drawing what he saw, which made their way online years later, before trying to get closer to the object.\n\n\"He couldn't make out any words, or anything, but he heard at least two beings communicating inside. He called out, offering mechanical help if they needed it,\" the It Gets Weird podcast recently detailed. \"As soon as he touches the craft, the fingertips just start to melt, so it's so hot that it literally melts the gloves he's wearing...He's hit by this blast of air, that pushes him backward and sets his shirt and hat on fire. He's stumbling backward, getting pushed by this wave of air and gas, and trying to take this burning shirt and hat off.\"\n\nThe account goes on to say he showed symptoms of radiation sickness and had \"severe burns\" on his torso that look like a grate or Bingo card. Once released from the hospital, he returned to the locale to recover his \"charred shirt, a melted glove and tools he'd left behind.\" He maintained his story until dying in 1999, never saying he encountered little green men either."

        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Future\n\nThough there are some pretty interesting uses of AI out in the world, one of the absolute worst (outside of making terribly glossy pictures of Shrimp Jesus) is using AI bots to farm followers on X (or Twitter if you're normal).\n\nThanks to the incredibly smart decision to make verification a paid service, and an instant algorithm boost, viral tweets are often inundated with copy-and-paste tweets stolen from other non-verified accounts to take that attention away. When you factor in that 'creators' on \"the everything app\" are financially incentivised to hog that spotlight due to a shared advertising pool, the bot problem just gets worse. But one social media app leans into this hard by only giving you bots to interact with, and I've decided to test it out.\n\nSocialAI is an app where you create an account on a fake social media filled with bot accounts, intended to interact with you endlessly. It's effectively a chatbot with extra steps, and it's just as creepy as it sounds in practice. To be honest, it's left me pretty happy for my online life not to be filled with the din of social discourse. It's okay not to be one of the super popular.\n\nThough the idea itself isn't bad, in a social experiment kind of way, and I was intrigued almost immediately after reading Ars Technica's report on it. I came out the other side of this app feeling like an omnipotent god over a kingdom I loathe. Even critics and cynics are yes men, and suddenly, I understand the point of Noah's Ark. Sometimes, you just need to reset, and there's not enough room on the boat for all these bots.\n\nSocialAI is currently exclusively available on the Apple App Store. Announced via a post on X, creator Michael Sayman stated that it is \"designed to help people feel heard, and to give them a space for reflection, support, and feedback that acts like a close-knit community.\" After time with it, I came away feeling the opposite. I felt like I wasn't heard and my thoughts were instead put into a digital black box filled with advice and comments that could be scraped from articles and videos across the web.\n\nSocialAI\n\nWhen I asked it to recommend a gaming PC capable of handling Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's system requirements, many of its bots replied with some variation of an RTX 30 series card and an i7 chip. One account named Bella Sunshine said \"Any build is gonna be awesome if it runs smooth\" which is so circular I can't quite understand it. A gaming PC capable of running the game will run the game capably.\n\nSee, when you first sign up on the app, you have to say what types of followers you like, from supporters and fans to critics and pessimists. These all respond in kind to your posts and you will be able to spot which is which, based on cutesy names. Ms Sunshine above is an optimist, and all other optimists have similarly flowery names.\n\nTo unlock trolls, haters, drama queens, and political accounts, you have to get five other people to sign up for SocialAI\u2014like some sort of strange bot-infested pyramid scheme. Unfortunately, what illusion of interactivity you may be able to conjure from your own posts is dashed by canned answers and obvious archetypes. This is before mentioning that it always gives you even amounts of each bot's engagement. I chose five types of followers initially and every post was then met with replies in groupings of five.\n\nWith SocialAI intended to be somewhere to feel heard, I thought it necessary to bring harder questions so I said I was feeling depressed and looking for advice. @ShineWithLila suggested grabbing a cup of coffee with her, which immediately felt rather sad to me. Maybe I could've been the kind of isolated person who would've really benefited from a coffee date with a friend. But Lila couldn't be that friend.\n\nSocialAI is less a picture and more a tapestry. When you zoom out from the bots, you see an app that feels lonely and misguided. I'm not a particularly popular person on X but I do somehow manage to find joy out of social media (despite Elon's best efforts). I've never really minded if a post got zero replies, because I think this is what makes those that do reply feel that much more special. There's a human being on the other side of that phone or PC and they are giving some of their time to tell me my opinions on Star Wars sucks. That's what real connection is about.\n\nSocialAI is a smokescreen for a chatbot, intended to feed you the fantasy of being an influencer. It makes you feel suddenly really popular but ultimately, you know no one really cares. I'm sure this isn't what Plato envisioned with those shadows in his cave but I don't think I can sit there and watch them when the real world is happening mere tabs away from me. The flicker of light on the wall is so much dimmer than the crackle of humanity just inches outside."

        "article_content": "Paranormal experts have debunked the video supposedly showing \u2018ghost soldiers\u2019 at Gettysburg.\n\nYep, turns out that viral video everyone gets so obsessed with might not be all it seems. Greg Yuelling was previously visiting the Civil War battle site in Pennsylvania, US, when he captured the eerie clip.\n\n\u201cWe were driving along one night and we started hearing noises, I heard things to the left and my uncle heard things to the right, and there was a fog, but the fog was weird, it was only in one patch not dispersed,\" he explained\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThen we saw these shapes moving in the darkness, they were the size of humans, one of them ran right through the cannon.\"\n\nThe bloke watched the videos back and ended up pretty \u2018freaked out\u2019. It made him \u2018believe everything\u2019 as he was sure he\u2019d captured ghosts of the soldiers.\n\nBut when LADbible presented this footage to Help! My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris, it seems Yuelling may not have captured the figures after all.\n\nAdvert\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai says he watched the video \u2018several times\u2019 before coming up with a \u2018logical explanation\u2019.\n\n\u201cThese are not spirits,\u201d he begins. \u201cDespite Gettysburg being rife with history and loads of paranormal stories over the years. I think what I'm seeing there is moisture on the windscreen.\u201d\n\nHe reckons they were ghosts. (SWNS)\n\nYeah, pretty underwhelming. Ghai explains that the video seems to be from inside the car and it appears to be foggy.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThere's definitely moisture that seems to be running down the face of the windscreen,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I think it's a combination of the environmental factors and what he's actually seeing through the mist and the fog.\u201d\n\nAnd historian and psychologist Harris agrees that as amazing as the video seems in such a historical location, there\u2019s just \u2018too many environmental factors\u2019 involved.\n\n\u201cIt looks brilliant,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a good, impressive clip but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghost.\u201d But Harris does appreciate it\u2019s pretty disappointing for investigators to be sceptical about this type of stuff.\n\n\u201cWe see so many photographs and video clips, and especially, obviously now with mobile phones and these, you know, people are recording their own things all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvert\n\nGhai and Harris know what they're on about. (discovery+)\n\nWell, there you have it, those \u2018ghosts\u2019 at Gettysburg aren\u2019t really ghosts \u2013 at least not in that video anyway.\n\nIf you do want to see Ghai and Harris in action with what they believe to actually be ghosts and spirits, a new season of Help! My House is Haunted just started streaming on discovery+. It sees the pair, along with psychic medium and exorcist, Ian Lawman, \u2018go above and beyond to solve some of the most chilling and challenging cases ever documented on TV\u2019.\n\nSeries six of Help! My House is Haunted airs on Really, Fridays at 9pm. Also available to stream on discovery+."

        "article_content": "AI solutions magnate Cerebral Blue has created NeuralSeek, a streamlined artificial intelligence platform that allows for easy integration of AI systems for businesses, with no coding needed. This has attracted significant attention from large Fortune 500 companies seeking to adopt this new technology.\n\n\u2014\n\nCerebral Blue, an advanced AI solutions company, has announced the widespread adoption of its flagship product, NeuralSeek. This advanced AI platform has seen significant attention from various companies, most recently employed by several Fortune 500 companies to streamline operations and improve customer support.\n\n\n\nNeuralSeek, a no-code platform, connects to large language models (LLMs) and corporate data. This greatly reduces the effort required to deploy agent-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), content generation, and other LLM-backed tasks. Meanwhile, a full suite of enterprise controls and governance supports all of these.\n\n\n\nThe partnerships with these Fortune 500 companies span various industries, including banking, telecommunications, and healthcare. With NeuralSeek's no-code platform, these organizations have significantly reduced the time and effort required to deploy AI-powered solutions. In turn, they can better enhance their customer support and information-sharing capabilities.\n\n\n\n\"We are thrilled to see the growing adoption of NeuralSeek among Fortune 500 companies,\" said Cerebral Blue founder Garrett Rowe. \"We\u2019ve always said that we wanted to make the hype around generative AI real for businesses of all sizes. These partnerships are just the start of that. There\u2019s always more to come.\"\n\n\n\nNeuralSeek enables businesses to connect the platform to their existing corporate knowledge bases, such as Elasticsearch, IBM Watson Discovery, or AWS Kendra, with little to no technical skills required. The platform then generates natural language responses to user queries, which can be seamlessly attached to virtual agent platforms like IBM Watson Assistant, AWS Lex, or Microsoft Bot Framework.\n\n\n\n\"The integration of NeuralSeek into our customer support system has been nothing short of a miracle,\" says a spokesperson from one of the Fortune 500 partners. \"We've seen a major drop in the number of queries handled by our live agents, letting them focus on more complex issues. At the same time, our customers are also receiving faster responses to their questions.\"\n\n\n\nNeuralSeek's efficacy reduces the need for live agents by up to 80%. Businesses pay per answer generated, and storage, curation, export, and translation are always free.\n\n\n\nVisit Cerebral Blue\u2019s website to learn how NeuralSeek is transforming businesses worldwide.\n\n\n\nAbout NeuralSeek\n\n\n\nNeuralSeek is a no-code platform developed by Cerebral Blue, a San Francisco-based technology and AI company. The platform connects to LLMs and corporate data, reducing the effort to deploy agent-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), content generation, and other LLM-backed tasks. NeuralSeek is available as SaaS on AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, and on-prem anywhere.\n\nContact Info:\n\nName: Cerebral Blue Customer Service Team\n\nEmail: Send Email\n\nOrganization: Cerebral Blue\n\nWebsite: https://cerebralblue.com/\n\n\n\nRelease ID: 89140844\n\nIn case of encountering any inaccuracies, problems, or queries arising from the content shared in this press release that necessitate action, or if you require assistance with a press release takedown, we urge you to notify us at error@releasecontact.com (it is important to note that this email is the authorized channel for such matters, sending multiple emails to multiple addresses does not necessarily help expedite your request).

        "source": "The Denver Post",
        "article_content": "Josh Reynolds is a dagger expert.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cdagger\u201d as in the NFL passing concept, of course.\n\nIn Detroit, Reynolds got all the glory on the play. Somebody else handled the clear-out vertical, running a safety down the field to create a void about 18-20 yards past the line of scrimmage, a couple of yards inside the numbers.\n\nThen Reynolds, lined up outside, would run a deep in-cut into that void, find the ball and make hay.\n\n\u201cThat was one of my routes, for sure. I was the dagger,\u201d Reynolds told The Denver Post.\n\nNow in Denver, he\u2019s the clear-out man. The ball never goes to that guy.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen in eight years,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the dirty work. Like an off-the-ball screen to free up a shooter in basketball or a rugged forward jostling for position in front of a goaltender in hockey.\n\n\u201cLove of the game route, man,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nCourtland Sutton is the Broncos\u2019 dagger man.\n\nHe starts outside of Reynolds when the Broncos run this tried-and-true zone-beater. Gets up the field, lets Reynolds do his thing, then snaps inside. During camp and the preseason, rookie quarterback Bo Nix showed an affinity for the play, hitting Sutton on his route in rhythm time and time again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude,\u201d Reynolds said of Sutton. \u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude that can stick his foot in the ground and come flat. That\u2019s the whole key to running dagger.\u201d\n\nSo far in the regular season, though, Denver\u2019s passing game has been blunted. Its production on dagger and Sutton\u2019s production as a whole? Duller than anticipated.\n\nSutton\u2019s got five catches on 16 targets through two games and just 64 yards. With a small sample size, one big game can turn those numbers around, but the early per-game and per-target rates are well off Sutton\u2019s career norms.\n\nMore pertinent so far is the general inability to get the ball into Sutton\u2019s hands in the first place. Nix targeted him 12 times in Week 1 at Seattle, but he finished with only four catches. Then against Pittsburgh, the ball didn\u2019t even get thrown in Sutton\u2019s direction until midway through the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThere are routes when he\u2019s primary and you\u2019re hoping that you catch the right look and he gets the throw. It doesn\u2019t always work like that,\u201d offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a big part of every game plan and sometimes the flow of the game is such that he doesn\u2019t get the throws like we thought he would.\u201d\n\nOf course, given the overall issues the Broncos have had offensively, nobody is off to a blazing start. But Sutton\u2019s pace out of the gates is noteworthy particularly because of his offseason \u2014 he skipped all voluntary team activities to advocate for a contract extension that never came \u2014 and because he looked terrific during training camp.\n\nNow, though, it\u2019s a struggle.\n\nNix has thrown three interceptions while targeting Sutton. The receiver could have been credited with a target on the final-play pick Nix threw against Pittsburgh, too.\n\n\u201cHe plays \u2018X\u2019, but he can play other spots,\u201d head coach Sean Payton said of Sutton. \u201cA lot of (the lack of production) gets back to the third downs. (Wednesday night) we\u2019ll be game-planning third down, and we have to be better in that area to add more snaps throughout the course of the game.\u201d\n\nIndeed, half of Sutton\u2019s targets so far have come on third down and on those snaps, Nix is 2 of 8 for 43 yards and a pick.\n\nLast year, Sutton caught eight of his 10 touchdowns in the red zone. Through two games this year: One catch on five targets for 10 yards, two interceptions and another that was nearly picked.\n\nSutton is a moneymaker in the intermediate part of the field. He\u2019s a big target and he\u2019s got the ability to create space, but he\u2019s not the type of receiver to flat run by a defensive back.\n\nDagger is a perfect example.\n\nNix has tried him on it three times already in two games. Against Seattle, Nix airmailed the first and then the second came up short because of pressure up the middle. Finally, against Pittsburgh, they got the look they wanted and Nix pinned a perfect ball on him for 26 yards.\n\nOverall, though, anything beyond 5 yards in the air has been inconsistent at best for Nix and the Denver offense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one thing,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cI think it\u2019s everything working together \u2014 timing, protection routes. There\u2019s not one thing that goes into it. It\u2019s like most things on offense, it\u2019s 11 guys working together.\u201d\n\nUntil they do, Sutton will likely continue to operate in a kind of limbo.\n\nHe\u2019s in that mode career-wise, too.\n\nDenver added up to $1.5 million in incentives for him to end what he described as an offseason \u201cstalemate.\u201d If the Broncos\u2019 offense wallows, though, that\u2019s money he won\u2019t see much or any of.\n\nA recent under-the-radar move could impact his future roster status, too.\n\nDenver in Week 1 made Sutton more expensive to cut or trade after the season but also took a spring or summer extension off the table.\n\nTight on cap space but wanting to sign cornerback Pat Surtain II to a mega extension, the Broncos created room by converting $11.875 million of Sutton\u2019s $13 million base salary to signing bonus. Importantly, they also added three void years to his contract to maximize the cap savings in the short term.\n\nThat contract adjustment, though, means Sutton is now ineligible for an extension for a year due to a rule that says contracts can\u2019t be renegotiated more than once per 12 months.\n\nSo now Sutton carries a $20.2 million cap hit for 2025, per OvertheCap. The Broncos could save $6.875 million if they cut him after this season but would incur $13.325 million in dead cap, too. That\u2019s nearly $10 million more than before the contract adjustment and that prorated bonus money would stay on the books if the Broncos traded him, too.\n\nSimultaneously, though, the sides couldn\u2019t formalize a contract extension until the 2025 regular season even if they wanted to.\n\nThat will be more pertinent in January than it is now. For the moment, the focus is just on getting the Broncos\u2019 top receiver going.\n\nPerhaps it will start with a dagger.\n\nNot rating well\n\nCourtland Sutton has the lowest quarterback rating on passes when targeted this season among all receivers in the NFL with 10 or more targets through Week 2. Here\u2019s a look at how the Broncos receiver stacks up:\n\nPlayer Team Targets Catches Yards Ints QB rating Courtland Sutton Denver 16 5 64 3 5.2 Diontae Johnson Carolina 12 5 34 2 9.7 Tyler Boyd Tennessee 10 5 44 1 22.5 Michael Pittman Jr. Indianapolis 15 7 52 1 27.6 Elijah Moore Cleveland 14 9 53 2 31.8\n\n(Can\u2019t see chart in mobile?

Read preview\n\nIn February, Glean announced a $200 million funding round valuing the enterprise AI software startup at $2.2 billion. Normally, a founder would hop off the fundraising treadmill after such a close. But these are not normal times, and Glean has the kind of meteoric revenue growth that lights up the eyes of VCs, having more than tripled annual recurring revenue over the past year.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAlmost overnight, Glean founder Arvind Jain's inbox filled up with cold emails from other investors \u2014 hungry for a piece of the startup unicorn.\n\n\"We kept telling people that, look, we just raised, we have a lot of capital, and we feel fine,\" Jain said. He added, \"But then that inbound kept coming in, and at some point, we said, 'OK, well, let's think about, does it actually make sense for us?'\"\n\nThis month, Glean snagged another $260 million from investors such as Altimeter Capital and DST Global, in a deal that doubles its valuation to $4.6 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transaction is the latest in a string of dizzying back-to-back funding rounds at ever-higher valuations for a handful of AI startups, which stand in stark contrast to the doldrums of the overall market for startups.\n\n\"The funding velocity for top AI startups is extremely rapid right now, with some raising multiple large rounds within months,\" Steve Brotman, the founder and managing partner of Alpha Partners, said. \"This reflects the massive investor excitement and FOMO around AI, but also creates risks of inflated valuations and unrealistic expectations.\"\n\nThe search company Perplexity secured $62.7 million in funding in April, less than four months after it raised $73.6 million in a Series B round. And the round may not be done yet. In June, Bloomberg reported that it's having discussions with SoftBank to invest at a $3 billion valuation. A spokesperson for Perplexity declined to comment.\n\nThe semiconductor company Groq is already exploring another funding round at a substantially higher valuation shortly after it locked up $640 million in a Series D round in August, two people with knowledge of the matter said. A spokesperson for Groq declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSakana AI, a Tokyo-based AI research company founded by Google engineers in 2023, announced this month it raised a $100 million Series A funding round led by New Enterprise Associates, Khosla Ventures, and Lux Capital. Earlier this year, Sakana raised $30 million in a seed-funding round led by Lux Capital. Slingshot AI, which has built an automated mental-health counselor, also raised separate rounds of funding just months apart.\n\n\"What happens after these rounds is a lot of people don't get in, so there may be a billion dollars on the sidelines that's ready for the next round,\" said Gregg Hill, a cofounder of Parkway Venture Capital, which invested in Figure AI, a robotics company valued at $2.6 billion. \"I think that's also a reason why you see some of these rounds happening sooner than later.\"\n\nThe haves and have-nots\n\nThe pace at which these AI startups are raising fresh rounds of capital has created a new dichotomy among tech founders. Unlike the tech boom that ended in 2020, where companies from crypto to consumer were raising huge rounds, the fervor this time is much more concentrated.\n\n\"There's a have and have-not scenario right now where if you're an emerging AI company, despite maybe not having really proven much of anything from the standpoint of revenue or significant user traction, you might be able to get some wildly amazing valuation,\" Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said. \"At the same time, you could be a $50 million business right now growing at 40%, and people might view you as uninteresting because you're not an AI company.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDario Amodei is a former OpenAI employee turned CEO of Anthropic. Kimberly White/Getty\n\nEarlier this year, Anthropic, which has emerged as the closest competitor to OpenAI, closed a $750 million funding round led by Menlo Ventures, capping a year in which it raised a head-spinning $7.3 billion.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt was the firm's biggest check ever, and Murphy admitted it felt \"enormous.\" But he said it felt justified given the company's rocketship trajectory.\n\n\"They were one of those companies that I'd put in not that 10%, but 1% category of year-over-year growth,\" Murphy said. \"It was mind-boggling. I've never seen that before. So they deserve some outsize premium.\"\n\nAnthropic's $18 billion valuation also felt reasonable when compared to the $86 billion OpenAI reached around the same time in a deal that allowed some employees to sell stock. (OpenAI is now reportedly seeking a $150 billion valuation.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There's a scarcity factor of there's really only two places to invest if you want to invest in the heart-and-soul foundation large language models of this wave, and one's getting priced at a more than hundred billion,\" Murphy said. \"Whatever the other one is, it feels like there's probably more upside on the investment.\"\n\nPressure to someday make money\n\nEven for AI startups, the pressure is on to show investors that their businesses won't just burn cash but also, someday, make money.\n\nGetty Images; Jenny Chang-Rodriguez/BI\n\nAccording to Jain, a former Google engineer and cofounder of Rubrik, some of those startups that could raise money out the gate are now struggling to figure out how to generate the amount of revenue required to provide a return on investment. \"They couldn't go beyond the proof-of-concept stage with their customers because ultimately they're not adding value,\" Jain said.\n\nThat puts an inordinate amount of investor attention, and pressure, on those companies with business models that seem to be working. \"Suddenly, we came into this environment where now there's a handful of AI companies that are actually generating meaningful revenue, driving meaningful user engagement, and adding business value,\" Jain said, \"and we are one of them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJai Das, the president and a partner at Sapphire Ventures, said he and a partner, Rajeev Dham, looked at Glean during the last fundraise but couldn't get the votes to do the deal. By the time Glean went out to raise again, it had cruised past the sales projections that Das saw at the beginning of the year. In September, Sapphire joined the company's Series E round.\n\n\"Glean did not raise on a promise,\" Das said, \"Glean raised on actual execution.\"\n\nNew challenges for founders and VCs\n\nFor founders of hot AI companies, there are certainly worse problems to have than eager VCs pounding down the door trying to give you more money.\n\n\"There's a saying in VC that you raise money when you don't need it,\" Hill said. \"Some of the best companies that ever came out of VC, like Uber, were always raising money because they were trying to disrupt a whole industry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same, investors warn that having too much cash can be just as detrimental as having too little, especially when companies have yet to achieve true product-market fit.\n\n\"I understand for founders that oftentimes it could be tempting because you want to fortify your balance sheet and last for 10 years, but sometimes it's not a good thing to last for 10 years,\" Murphy said. \"Anytime you overcapitalize the company, I think there's just risk that a company gets sloppy or takes things for granted.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nDas, the Glean investor, said he never wants to tell an entrepreneur to turn down money because it's impossible to know if a cataclysmic event is around the corner. The coronavirus outbreak, for instance, froze funding to startups for the first few months. However, he warns founders that one of the dangers of raising too much money is spending it recklessly.\n\n\"If you are a fast-growing company and people believe in what you're doing, that is great,\" Das said. \"I think what happens is people get complacent when you raise a lot of money and you hire people without really paying attention to it. You do things that are not core to the business.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven some founders are weary of the risks of raising fast follow-on rounds.\n\nThe founder of a stealth vertical-software startup said it took four months and 76 meetings to secure a seed round of funding for her company, which utilizes generative artificial intelligence, this past spring. She asked for anonymity since the round hasn't been announced yet.\n\nAfter she got the money, the founder hit the ground selling. That's when the cold emails started trickling in. Three or four partners at other firms reached out and told her that in the process of due diligence on some of her competitors, they had spoken to customers who said they were taking their business to her startup. Those investors became more interested in her company.\n\nHowever, the founder is being selective about which meetings she takes. She worries that if she pitches an investor who ends up passing, she will put a \"scarlet letter\" on her company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They all talk to each other,\" the founder said of investors.\n\nThe funding frenzy has also made the venture capitalists' job harder, increasing pressure to get allocation in the hottest deals while not overpaying.\n\n\"For VCs, this environment requires being much more proactive and moving quickly when evaluating AI deals,\" said Alpha Partners' Brotman. \"There's pressure to make faster decisions with less diligence. It also means needing to build stronger relationships with founders earlier, before companies are raising.\"\n\nBut even if they manage to get into a hot company, maintaining their ownership stake is more challenging than ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"VCs are increasingly faced with frequent requests from their hot AI companies to follow on or double down on investments,\" Iris Sun, an investor at 500 Global, said. \"This often leads to competition for pro rata rights, with some companies implementing pay-to-play provisions. Failure to participate properly in these rounds can result in significant dilution.\"\n\nStill, other VCs say ultimately their job has not changed.\n\n\"This is no different than I've seen in the past for other hype cycles,\" Sri Chandrasekar, a managing partner at Point72 Ventures, said. \"My job is to separate the hype from the reality.\""

        "article_content": "NordVPN is one of the most popular and best virtual private networks (VPNs) available, while Proton VPN is a relative newcomer that launched several years after it. Both have thousands of servers worldwide and boast high-speed streaming and download capacity without sacrificing security and privacy.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard to choose between these leading VPNs when the pricing is so close. I recently reviewed NordVPN and Proton VPN, so I\u2019ll share details about pricing and renewal costs, hands-on speed tests, and customer service responsiveness.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUltimately, I\u2019ll share my recommendation for the best VPN to fit your budget while protecting your privacy and delivering consistently great performance.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nStarting at the free tier, Proton VPN takes the lead with a full-featured app that can connect to 136 servers in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. There\u2019s no data cap or artificial limits placed on speed. Proton VPN is among the best free VPNs with few restrictions. NordVPN doesn\u2019t have a free version.\n\nBoth offer a 30-day money-back guarantee but no trial period. That means you have to pay for a subscription to try the full version of either VPN. Each company supports 10 devices with paid service so you can use the VPN on all your devices and share with family members.\n\nNordVPN costs $13 per month, while Proton VPN comes in at $10 monthly. The best value comes with a longer subscription. NordVPN starts at $60 for the first year, but renews at $139.08. The equivalent monthly cost is $5 initially, but increases to $12 thereafter. A two-year subscription starts at $97 and includes three free months. That works out to $3.60 monthly, a great deal for 27 months. But watch out for the renewal cost, which skyrockets to $313.\n\nProton VPN has a less expensive $10 monthly plan and matches NordVPN\u2019s $60 annual subscription. The two-year plan costs $108. Proton doesn\u2019t charge more when you need to renew, so both monthly and renewal costs are better.\n\nBoth services have software bundles that add more features if you pay more.\n\nFeatures\n\nWhen I reviewed NordVPN, I was more than satisfied with its speed and reliability. I consistently enjoyed quick server connections and download speeds measuring 32% to 52% of my gigabit Ethernet connection. That\u2019s hundreds of megabits per second worldwide.\n\nAs impressive as NordVPN\u2019s performance was, Proton VPN nearly matched it by delivering 26% to 50% of my unprotected internet download speed. Proton VPN suffered from slow uploads, a common complaint with even the best VPNs.\n\nWhile NordVPN managed up to 29 Mbps uploads, the best I got with Proton VPN was 14 Mbps. To be fair, server connections are generally optimized for downloading content, with only a bit reserved to keep the connection responsive as you search and browse.\n\nBoth feature solid VPN connections to thousands of servers in over 100 countries. To get around administrative firewallls, NordVPN has the NordLynx protocol and Proton VPN has Stealth.\n\nSupport\n\nNordVPN has an advantage when it comes to customer service.

Your data should be secure and private with either VPN.\n\nWhich VPN is right for you?\n\nAs you can tell, NordVPN and Proton VPN are closely matched,with similar pricing and features. The primary difference is in pricing tiers.

It\u2019s fast, free, and includes free versions of Proton VPN, Proton Mail, Proton Pass, and more.\n\nIf you need access to more servers, but for a limited time, Proton VPN\u2019s monthly fee is less expensive than NordVPN\u2019s.

        "article_content": "Investing.com -- The AI enterprise software revolution is transforming business operations, with companies increasingly positioning themselves to capitalize on this trend.\n\nIn a recent note, Truist Securities analysts highlighted that businesses are integrating AI technologies across their software stacks to enhance productivity, data management, and cybersecurity. Central to this shift is the growing influence of generative AI (GenAI), expected to impact both infrastructure and application layers of enterprise software.\n\nAccording to the report, companies fall into two primary categories when it comes to benefiting from AI: those directly capturing AI workloads and those leveraging the technology to enhance their products.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), MongoDB (NASDAQ: ), and Snowflake Inc (NYSE: ) are cited as key players expected to gain from AI workloads, largely due to their data infrastructure capabilities and partnerships with leading AI providers.\n\nDespite recent market challenges, Snowflake is viewed as a potential long-term winner, as its data warehousing is increasingly recognized as a core technology for AI initiatives. MongoDB is also well-positioned, especially with its vector storage and search capabilities critical for AI applications.\n\nIn the application software space, Truist Securities highlights potential winners in three key areas: \"pick and shovel\" plays, core platform vendors benefiting from upgrade cycles, and vendors embedding AI to enhance productivity. Companies like Salesforce Inc (NYSE: ) and Smartsheet Inc (NYSE: ) are expected to capitalize on these trends as enterprises increasingly turn to AI-driven solutions to streamline workflows and improve efficiency.\n\nMeanwhile, companies such as Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ: ), CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Datadog Inc (NASDAQ: ) are seen leveraging AI to enhance their product offerings, particularly in cybersecurity.\n\nTruist notes that Palo Alto Networks has already demonstrated significant AI-driven revenue growth, surpassing $200 million in annual recurring revenue from its AI products. As AI adoption rises, demand for AI-augmented security tools is expected to increase, expanding the market for companies in this space.\n\nWhile AI investment continues to grow, Truist Securities notes that the timeline for realizing significant value from AI has extended. Initially projected for 2024, many enterprises now expect AI-driven applications to gain traction by 2025. Despite this delay, over 70% of businesses surveyed anticipate allocating 5% or more of their 2024 software budgets to AI initiatives, underscoring the ongoing commitment to AI investment.\n\nGenerative AI, while garnering much attention, is expected to represent only a small portion of the broader AI market. By 2027, Truist Securities forecasts that generative AI will account for less than 10% of the estimated $900 billion AI market. This suggests that while the focus on generative AI is significant, other areas\u2014such as data management, cybersecurity, and infrastructure\u2014will present more substantial long-term opportunities.\n\nA key challenge highlighted in the report is the shortage of skilled talent and resources to implement AI projects effectively. This, coupled with increasing regulatory scrutiny surrounding AI governance and compliance, could pose hurdles for widespread AI adoption in the enterprise space."
