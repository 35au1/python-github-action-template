        "article_content": "Do you fondly remember playing 8-bit adventures on the NES and original Sega consoles? Titles like Contra, Ninja Gaiden, and Mega Man 2, all from the late \u201880s, provided a unique gaming experience that\u2019s hard to replicate today with modern technology. Hard, sure, but it\u2019s possible\u2014as we\u2019ve now witnessed firsthand with the release of UFO 50.\n\n\n\nThe collection\u2014presented as a lost collection from a forgotten developer of the era\u2014features an assortment of single- and multiplayer games across multiple genres, from platformers to roguelikes, with even a few in-depth RPGs mixed in. All are created with an 8-bit retro style that harkens back to the days of gaming in your living room after school. You can beat some of the games in mere minutes, then move on to the next; others, however, require a few hours and multiple playthroughs. They\u2019re all unique, many of them are memorable, and some deserve no more than a single run-through.\n\nWhen we sifted through the Steam user reviews, we found an overwhelmingly positive reception from the gaming community. Most people love the indie retro collection and cannot praise the fun factor enough. As you\u2019ll see below, nostalgia plays a significant role in many of the reviews. Numerous players gave a thumbs up because it felt like playing a game from their childhood, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling young again and enjoying your hobby!\n\nBut a few couldn\u2019t get past many titles, which lack the quality-of-life features in modern gaming, or--they say--feel outdated and unnecessarily complex just for nostalgia\u2019s sake. Despite the positive reviews, the negative ones prove highly negative. Many curse out the game and its developers; they shout from the rooftops about how unfun they thought most of the retro titles were to play.\n\nSurprisingly, we didn\u2019t find many meme reviews, just plenty of positive or negative reviews to help you better understand the game. Here is UFO 50, as told by Steam reviews!\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\n.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

        "article_content": "Another New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nRIO RANCHO, N.M. \u2013 Another New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nThe portable classrooms at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary are the new home of the National UFO Historical Records Archive. It\u2019s the largest collection of UFO sighting documents in the country, and maybe the world.\n\nNow, thanks to a partnership with Rio Rancho Public Schools, the amateur collectors who kept all these records safe over the years are finally making them available to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally overwhelming. People don\u2019t have any conception until they come here how much material that we\u2019re talking about. And it really, I think, makes people pause and realize there\u2019s a lot more to this UFO subject than I ever thought,\u201d said David Marler, executive director of the National UFO Historical Records Center.\n\nMarler knows the idea of a UFO records archive probably sounds silly to some folks, but he says that skepticism is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t care what your take is on the UFO subject. In fact, we welcome differing opinions, differing perspectives,\u201d said Marler.\n\nThe National UFO Historical Records Center is a nonprofit organizing hundreds of thousands of declassified government documents, news clippings, photos, videos and more evidence from across the globe all under one roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional historical archive dedicated to a non-traditional subject. We want serious research to be conducted here in the hopes ultimately of maybe gaining a better insight into this mystery that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for 75 plus years,\u201d said Marler.\n\nHe says there are countless connections to be discovered now that all these case files are together.\n\n\u201cSome organizations interviewed witnesses that the other did not, and vice versa, and sometimes there\u2019s new insights provided by one investigative organization that was never obtained by this one,\u201d said Marler. \u201cThe more minds, the more set of eyeballs we have looking at the data as with any subject, the better we\u2019re going to be if we truly want to try to understand what we\u2019re dealing with when we talk about UFOs.\u201d\n\nMarler\u2019s collection \u2013 which used to live inside his Rio Rancho home \u2013 is largely a collection of other collections sent in from fellow UFO archivists. With all this extra space donated by Rio Rancho Public Schools, Marler says they\u2019re ready for more.\n\n\u201cWe have about 10 to 12 other collections that are also in the queue,\u201d Marler said. \u201cTwo individuals I know in Ohio have stated, \u2018You\u2019re already in my will. If anything happens to me, my material is coming to Rio Rancho.'\u201d\n\nWhether or not you believe in aliens, Marler says the overwhelming amount of documentation is worth preserving.\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important because it is an element of history, it is an element of our culture. So that\u2019s really how we try to view it,\u201d said Marler. \u201cIf we can\u2019t define the answers to the UFO mystery, maybe in 40, 50, 60, years someone might, but they can only do that by looking at the data.\u201d\n\nWhile this is a public archive, it\u2019s a not a free for all. Marler says you\u2019ll have to submit a request on their website to set up a time to come and visit. The idea is that you\u2019ll have full access to everything inside.\n\nBut why would Rio Rancho Public Schools get involved with something like this.\n\n\u201cOur students find the subject matter of UFO investigation very intriguing. And so we want to do is we want to use that as a catalyst in order to get students involved in other types of learning,\u201d said RRPS Chief Operating Officer Michael Baker. \u201cSo we think that the parents, as long as the students are learning, we\u2019re not trying to persuade thinking one way or another, we think we\u2019re going to see some really good benefits from this area.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials say the partnership is expected to last at least five years.\n\nAnother New Mexico city is shining a spotlight on UFOs, but not in the way you might expect."

        "article_content": "At first not many were using Google's NotebookLM to take notes. But it's been receiving more attention since it added a feature letting users create an audio summary of files in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice. Zacharie Scheurer/dpa\n\nA previously little known Google-created AI research and note-taking tool has \u201creally taken off\u201d after it added an audio feature which turned notes into podcast-like audio and the results went viral, one of its product managers has said.\n\nNotebookLM was first released last year as an AI tool to help users interact with their documents \u2013 allowing them to upload a range of files and get summaries and explanations based on that content.\n\nBut the app has begun receiving more mainstream public attention in recent weeks after it added a feature called Audio Overviews, which enabled users to create an audio summary of their upload files, but in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice.\n\nVarious results from using the tool quickly circulated online and brought new users to the app.\n\nNow Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs and one of the people leading the build of NotebookLM, says users are hungry for more editing control over the type of Audio Overviews they can create with the tool.\n\n\u201cThis is such an exciting time, because since we\u2019ve launched it everyone on Twitter and Reddit and even in our Discord is saying \u2018I want the knobs\u2019, particularly for more voices, or \u2018I want to change the length\u2019,\u201d she told the PA news agency.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to change everything, and we\u2019re definitely going to address this. We\u2019re shipping features quickly to give people more control, but we\u2019re trying to be thoughtful about which controls we ship first.\u201d\n\nAn update to NotebookLM has since rolled out, allowing users to tweak which topics or areas from their source notes they would like covered specifically.\n\nMs Martin added: \u201cI always get asked the question \u2018who is the tool for\u2019 or \u2018who is your target audience?\u2019 and most of the time I\u2019ve thought about it in the same way, which is; what is the person\u2019s profession? How are they applying this to their everyday life?.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we were very, very fortunate in that when we launched Notebook as Project Tailwind last year, we just launched the tool with none of those assumptions to try to find out how people would use it.\u201d\n\nShe said this lack of a specific target audience has helped show that the app could be applicable for anyone who \u201cworks on a computer\u201d, particularly when it came to the audio summaries, and the team building the app were already hearing stories of people listening to the Audio Overviews like a podcast to help them digest their notes.\n\n\u201cSpecifically for the audio, I think one of our key insights is that there are a lot of jobs that require you to digest a lot of information \u2013 and not just jobs \u2013 learners, students of all ages, educators\u2026 basically, if you\u2019re working on a computer, this is the sort of thing you could probably find utility in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of people that the way they use it is to listen to the audio first and then write their own questions down, and that had me thinking what a magical harmony between people, technology, information, knowledge, and I think we\u2019re just at the starting line of what this can do.\u201d\n\nNotebookLM has not had the high-profile launch of Google\u2019s flagship AI assistant, Gemini, which powers NotebookLM, but Ms Martin said the newfound fame the note-taking tool had found meant this \u201ctrue experimental product for Google\u201d was getting a more serious product road-map.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ll say in terms of how we\u2019re approaching the continuing rollout is that I think we\u2019ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they\u2019re using it every day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that the way we want to keep pushing forward is to really stabilise the experience, and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to try to connect this to everyday people and make it really relevant.\n\n\u201cSo I think that while the feature work that we\u2019re doing is exciting, I think now is the right time to also start addressing how do we make it so much easier to use.\n\n\u201cBecause for better or worse, that\u2019s not where a lot of our attention has been, but now that we have a lot more interest, a lot more users, let\u2019s make it a lot easier.\u201d"

She ultimately sought the help of a counselor. It was not until her most recent pregnancy that she also started to use an AI chatbot on the fem-tech app Soula, which she said helped with reducing depressive symptoms and reassuring her about her mental health.\n\n\"It tells me: 'Welcome back, LeRonika. Your reactions are natural,'\" said Francis, who is based in New Iberia, Louisiana.\n\nThe AI chatbot called \"Dua\" also sent her some videos that she could watch about self-hugging, a practice that could reduce stress levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I feel like Dua is there more than anything. It really showed me: OK, this is what you could do. Make sure you make time for yourself, too, because that's important as well,\" said Francis.\n\nSoula was co-founded by Natallia Miranchuk and Andrei Kulik, who conceptualized a 24/7 AI doula that could close the gap in mental health support for mothers during pregnancy and postpartum periods. Rather than replacing medical providers, apps such as Soula aim to increase broader access to maternal healthcare. Healthcare providers said that these apps could also help reduce the burden on the healthcare system, where wait times can be long and workers face burnout.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with OB/GYN doctors and doulas, who largely welcomed the rise in AI chatbots because they can make information more accessible to patients.\n\nAccording to data obtained from Sensor Tower, Soula now has more than 35,000 downloads. The startup has fundraised over $750,000 and is backed by investors such as Andrey Mikhaylyuk, the former vice president of product at Flo Health, a period tracking app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranchuk told BI that her experiences as a single mother of two and her work as a former maternity photographer inspired her to develop a supportive app for women. Initially conceptualized as a hub to connect doulas worldwide to those in need, the generative AI boom shifted the startup's focus to integrating a chatbot that could serve more populations.\n\n\"Women are shy to ask questions, even in the community, because they have the feeling that maybe 'as a mom, I should have known that, but I don't.' And she doesn't know where to go,\" Miranchuk said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe ease of customizing ChatGPT has spurred a wave of new AI-based chatbots like Soula. According to Sensor Tower, the companion apps Character.ai, Talkie, and Paradot have more than 73 million collective downloads, soaring more than 130% between 2023 and 2024. AI therapy apps such as Wysa and Woebot received over 1 million downloads, the data said.\n\nCorenia Smith, director of the Birth Justice Collaborative in Minnesota, said that while popularizing tools like chatbots can help broaden healthcare access, it is important to avoid a \"one size fits all\" and ensure that AI can reflect the communities it serves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are cultural practices that exist and have existed for thousands of years that people still use,\" Smith said. \"A human could talk about all their experience and what they've seen and give referrals. When you reach that limitation with an AI, it has to have the ability to hand over care or make a referral in a way where people don't feel dropped.\"\n\nThe role of a doula\n\nThe AI chatbot Dua aims to function like a doula, providing mothers with information about the pregnancy experience during a time of transition.\n\nDoulas are trained professionals who can provide non-medical, continuous physical, emotional, and information support for women before, during, and after childbirth, helping to reduce mental health-related morbidity for the mother and reduce infant mortality rates.\n\nAccess to doulas can be costly. While there's Medicaid coverage for doulas in several states, not all private health insurance plans cover these expenses. Long wait times and socioeconomic inequality also contribute to increased levels of stress and lack of healthcare usage among mothers and pregnant people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Traditionally, it's been something that's been available only to folks with a lot of money and a lot of resources. The people that benefit the most from doula care are those that might not trust the healthcare system,\" said Dr. Devon Rupley, an attending physician and OB/GYN specialist at NYC Health. \"That tends to be people of color who've had previously negative experiences with racism and bias that can really harm their experience in the healthcare system generally.\"\n\nRupley added that using an AI healthcare app to address basic questions can allow patients to spend higher-quality time with doctors by asking high-level questions and discussing their healthcare issues.\n\nDua is the Soula app's built-in AI chatbot. Soula\n\nHow to design an empathetic AI chatbot\n\nSoula enlisted real-life doulas to help train its chatbot and strike the right tone.\n\n\"We can't create it to be as personable as talking to a real-life person, but we can try to create that as much as possible,\" said Lexi Pacheco, a doula from Arizona who worked to help refine the dialogue in Soula's chatbot Dua. For $22 per hour, she helped improve the chatbot by using it \"hand-in-hand\" during her pregnancies, adding in her expertise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile asking questions on Google could yield more informational responses, Pacheco said mothers would want something that provided \"more of that reassurance that Google wouldn't.\"\n\nFor Armani Grant, a Soula user who became pregnant at 18, Google felt overwhelming. The chatbot allowed her to ask questions that she wouldn't feel comfortable asking her mother.\n\nPacheco said many women she's worked with reported similar experiences.\n\n\"They might even feel incompetent to ask the question, which no woman should ever feel, but with my history of working with people, they definitely tend to revert to: I'm sorry, I'm asking this question for some reason, and that might just be because of the societal pressure that more medicalized doctors have put on people that they don't give the time and day to us,\" Pacheco said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app isn't meant to completely replace a doula. Moreover, retention rates of AI healthcare chatbots can be low, said Johannes Eichstaedt, a computational social scientist and assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University. The high dropout rates for healthcare apps are \"an elephant in the room,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Pacheco said AI bots can help \"calm nerves\" and fill the gaps when patients feel they are \"bothering\" their healthcare providers.\n\n\"AI isn't like a healthcare provider to give you guidance, but it's supposed to be there to give you a little bit more comfort,\" Pacheco said."

If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here.\n\n\n\nThe agents are coming \u2014 the AI agents, that is.\n\nThis week, Anthropic released its newest AI model, an upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, that can interact with the web and desktop apps by clicking and typing \u2014 much like a person. It\u2019s not perfect. But 3.5 Sonnet with \u201cComputer Use,\u201d as Anthropic\u2019s calling it, could be transformative in the workplace.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the elevator pitch.\n\nWhether Anthropic\u2019s new model lives up to the hype remains to be seen. But its arrival signifies Anthropic\u2019s ambitions in the nascent AI agent market, which some analysts believe could be worth close to $50 billion by 2030.\n\nAnthropic isn\u2019t the only one investing resources in developing AI agents, which, broadly defined, automate tasks that previously had to be performed manually. Microsoft is testing agents that can use Windows PCs to book appointments and more, while Amazon is exploring agents that can proactively make purchases.\n\nOrganizations might be waffling on generative AI. But they\u2019re pretty bullish on agents so far. A report out this month from MIT Technology Review Insights found that 49% of executives believe agents and other forms of advanced AI assistants will lead to efficiency gains or cost savings.\n\nFor Anthropic and its rivals building \u201cagentic\u201d technologies, that\u2019s welcome news indeed. AI isn\u2019t cheap to build \u2014 or run. Case in point, Anthropic is said to be in the process of raising billions of dollars in venture funds, and OpenAI recently closed a $6.5 billion funding round.\n\nBut I wonder if most agents today can really deliver on the hype.\n\nTake Anthropic\u2019s, for example. In an evaluation designed to test an AI agent\u2019s ability to help with airline booking tasks, the new 3.5 Sonnet managed to complete less than half of the tasks successfully. In a separate test involving tasks like initiating a product return, 3.5 Sonnet failed roughly one-third of the time.\n\nAgain, the new 3.5 Sonnet isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 and Anthropic readily admits this. But it\u2019s tough to imagine a company tolerating failure rates that high for very long. At a certain point, it\u2019d be easier to hire a secretary.\n\nStill, businesses are showing a willingness to give AI agents a try \u2014 if for no other reason than keeping up with the Joneses. According to a survey from startup accelerator Forum Ventures, 48% of enterprises are beginning to deploy AI agents, while another third are \u201cactively exploring\u201d agentic solutions.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how those early adopters feel once they\u2019ve had agents up and running for a bit.\n\nNews\n\nData scraping protests: Thousands of creatives, including actor Kevin Bacon, novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, and the musician Robert Smith, have signed a petition against unlicensed use of creative works for AI training.\n\nMeta tests facial recognition: Meta says it\u2019s expanding tests of facial recognition as an anti-fraud measure to combat celebrity scam ads.\n\nPerplexity gets sued: News Corp\u2019s Dow Jones and the NY Post have sued growing AI startup Perplexity, which is reportedly looking to fundraise, over what the publishers describe as a \u201ccontent kleptocracy.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new hires: OpenAI has hired its first chief economist, ex-U.S. Department of Commerce chief economist Aaron Chatterji, and a new chief compliance officer, Scott Schools, previously Uber\u2019s compliance head.\n\nChatGPT comes to Windows: In other OpenAI news, OpenAI has begun previewing a dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot platform, for certain segments of customers.\n\nxAI\u2019s API: Elon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, has launched an API for Grok, the generative AI model powering a number of capabilities on X.\n\nMira Murati raising: Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is reportedly fundraising for a new AI startup. The venture is said to focus on building AI products based on proprietary models.\n\nResearch paper of the week\n\nMilitaries around the world have shown great interest in deploying \u2014 or are already deploying \u2014 AI in combat zones. It\u2019s controversial stuff, to be sure, and it\u2019s also a national security risk, according to a new study from the nonprofit AI Now Institute.\n\nThe study finds that AI deployed today for military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance already poses dangers because it relies on personal data that can be exfiltrated and weaponized by adversaries. It also has vulnerabilities, like biases and a tendency to hallucinate, that are currently without remedy, write the co-authors.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t argue against militarized AI. But it states that securing military AI systems and limiting their harms will require creating AI that\u2019s separate and isolated from commercial models.\n\nModel of the week\n\nThis week was a very busy week in generative AI video. No fewer than three startups released new video models, each with their own unique strengths: Haiper\u2019s Haiper 2.0, Genmo\u2019s Mochi 1, and Rhymes AI\u2019s Allegro.\n\nBut what really caught my eye was a new tool from Runway called Act-One. Act-One generates \u201cexpressive\u201d character performances, creating animations using video and voice recordings as inputs. A human actor performs in front of a camera, and Act-One translates this to an AI-generated character, preserving the actor\u2019s facial expressions.\n\nImage Credits:Runway\n\nGranted, Act-One isn\u2019t a model per se; it\u2019s more of a control method for guiding Runway\u2019s Gen-3 Alpha video model. But it\u2019s worth highlighting for the fact that the AI-generated clips it creates, unlike most synthetic videos, don\u2019t immediately veer into uncanny valley territory.\n\nGrab bag\n\nAI startup Suno, which is being sued by record labels for allegedly training its music-generating tools on copyrighted songs sans permission, doesn\u2019t want yet another legal headache on its hands.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the impression I get from Suno\u2019s recently announced partnership with content ID company Audible Magic, which some readers might recognize from the early days of YouTube. Suno says it\u2019ll use Audible Magic\u2019s tech to prevent uploads of copyrighted music for its Covers feature, which lets users create remixes of any song or sound.\n\nSuno has told labels\u2019 lawyers that it believes songs it used to train its AI fall under the U.S.\u2019 fair-use doctrine. That\u2019s up for debate. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily help Suno\u2019s case, though, if the platform was storing full-length copyrighted works on its servers \u2014 and encouraging users to share them."

        "date": "5h",
        "source": "Popular Science",
        "article_content": "For the first time, physicists have observed a \u201cblack hole triple\u201d in space. This new system is about 8,000 light years away from Earth and is made up of a central black hole that is in the act of consuming a small star spiraling very close to it. Surprisingly, a second star appears to also be circling the central black hole, but much further away. The discovery is described in a study published October 23 in the journal Nature.\n\nHitting a triple\n\nMost of the black holes that scientists have detected appear to be part of a pair called a binary system. These systems are made up of the black hole and a secondary object like a star, much denser neutron star, or another black hole. The binary system then spirals around each other and are drawn together by the black hole\u2019s gravity.\n\nFor this new black hole triple, there is an additional object orbiting the central black hole. The closer star orbits the black hole about every 6.5 days. The authors estimate that the more far-off companion orbits the black hole every 70,000 years.\n\n[Related: The hunt for the first stars in the universe.]\n\nThat a black hole appears to have a gravitational hold on an object that is so far away is raising some questions about the origins of this black hole itself. Scientists believe that black holes form from a supernova\u2013the violent explosion of a dying star. During a supernova, a star releases a huge amount of energy and light in one final burst before it collapses into an invisible black hole.\n\nIf this newly-observed black hole resulted from a typical supernova, the energy it would have released before it ultimately collapsed would have kicked away any more loosely bound objects orbiting on its outskirts. In theory, that second outer star shouldn\u2019t still be hanging around.\n\nThe team believes that the black hole formed through a more gentle process instead\u2013direct collapse. During direct collapse, a star simply caves in on itself and forms a black hole without that last dramatic burst. A gentle origin like this wouldn\u2019t really disturb any loosely bound, faraway objects.\n\nSince the new triple system includes a very far-off star, the system\u2019s black hole was potentially born through that gentler direct collapse. While astronomers have been observing violent supernovae for centuries, this new triple system may be the first evidence of a black hole that formed from this more gentle process.\n\n\u201cWe think most black holes form from violent explosions of stars, but this discovery helps call that into question,\u201d study co-author and MIT physicist Kevin Burdge said in a statement. \u201cThis system is super exciting for black hole evolution, and it also raises questions of whether there are more triples out there.\u201d\n\nChance discovery\n\nThis discovery also came about almost by chance. The physicists found it while looking through a repository of astronomical observations taken by telescopes in space and around the world called Aladin Lite. They used Aladin Lite to search for images of the same part of the sky, taken by different telescopes tuned to various wavelengths of energy and light.\n\nOriginally, they were looking within the Milky Way galaxy for signs of new black holes. Out of curiosity, Burdge reviewed an image of V404 Cygni, a black hole roughly 8,000 light years from Earth. In 1992, V404 Cygni became one of the very first objects in space to be confirmed as a black. Since then, it has been documented in over 1,300 scientific papers and is one of our most well-studied black holes. However, none of these studies reported this strange triple system.\n\n[Related: 1.5 billion cosmic objects dazzle in the largest infrared Milky Way map ever created.]\n\nWhile looking at optical images of V404 Cygni, Burdge saw what looked like two blobs of light that were close to one another. The first blob was the black hole and an inner star orbiting close by. That star is so close to the hole that it is releasing some of its material onto the black hole itself and giving off visible light. However, that second blob of light was most likely coming from a very distant star that had not been observed before.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can see two separate stars over this much distance actually means that the stars have to be really very far apart,\u201d said Burdge.\n\nCalculations found that the outer star is 3,500 astronomical units (AU) away from the black hole. One AU is the distance between Earth and the sun. The outer star is thus 3,500 times further away from the black hole as we are to the sun, or 100 times greater than the distance between Pluto and the sun.\n\nThe team then questioned whether the outer star was linked to both the black hole and its inner star. To find an answer, the team looked to Gaia, the satellite that has been tracking the motions of all the stars in the galaxy for a decade. They analyzed the motions of the inner and outer stars over the past 10 years of Gaia data and found that the stars moved in tandem compared to some of the nearby stars. According to their calculations, the odds of this kind of tandem motion are about one in 10 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not a coincidence or accident,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing two stars that are following each other because they\u2019re attached by this weak string of gravity. So this has to be a triple system.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go fly a (space) kite\n\nThe team then wondered how this system could have formed in the first place. The violent explosion of a typical supernova would have kicked that outstar away a very long time ago.\n\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re pulling a kite, and instead of a strong string, you\u2019re pulling with a spider web,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cIf you tugged too hard, the web would break and you\u2019d lose the kite. Gravity is like this barely bound string that\u2019s really weak, and if you do anything dramatic to the inner binary, you\u2019re going to lose the outer star.\u201d\n\nTo test out this kite string theory, Burdge carried out computer simulations to see how this kind of triple system could have evolved and kept the outer star.\n\n[Related: Biggest black hole jets ever seen span 140 Milky Way galaxies.]\n\nAt the beginning of each simulation, he introduced three stars. The third star was the black hole, before it became a black hole. He then ran tens of thousands of simulations. Each simulation had a slightly different scenario for how the third star may have become a black hole and affected the motions of the other two stars. For example, he simulated a supernova and changed the amount of energy and the direction all of that energy traveled in. He also simulated scenarios of direct collapse, where the third star caved in on itself to form a black hole, without sending off any energy.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of simulations show that the easiest way to make this triple work is through direct collapse,\u201d Burdge says.\n\nThis extra outer star also revealed the system\u2019s age. The team observed that the outer star is in the process of becoming a red giant, a phase occurring at the end of a star\u2019s life. They believe that the outerstar is about 4 billion years old, based on this transition. Since the neighboring stars are born around the same time, the team believes that this black hole triple is also 4 billion years old.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been able to do this before for an old black hole,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cNow we know V404 Cygni is part of a triple, it could have formed from direct collapse, and it formed about 4 billion years ago, thanks to this discovery.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Venom 3 will hit theaters later this week, and while that might be exciting to many Spider-Man fans, it\u2019s nothing like the real thing, Spider-Man 4, the movie that keeps popping up in more and more reports.\n\nSony and Marvel were quick to confirm that a sequel was in the works back when No Way Home was still making a killing at the box office. But it\u2019s been nearly three years since then, and we had no official Spider-Man 4 release date announcement. We know Tom Holland is coming back to the role. It\u2019s something Sony and Marvel also said almost three years ago.\n\nInterestingly, Tom Holland did talk about the Spider-Man 4 work that\u2019s happening right now, suggesting that a release date announcement is imminent. That was a few days ago, and the actor felt short of revealing any exciting details.\n\nFast-forward to Tuesday night, when Holland was a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. It\u2019s where he revealed that Spider-Man 4 will start production next summer. Leave it to Holland to do what Sony and Marvel can\u2019t or won\u2019t.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nThis implies that Spider-Man 4 will have a 2026 release date, as rumors said, but we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nWhile Holland didn\u2019t mention any Spider-Man 4 plot details, a well-known Marvel insider did share one big scoop. And it\u2019s great news if it\u2019s real. This is where I tell you that big spoilers might follow below.\n\nBefore the Spider-Man 4 production start time reveal, Fallon reminded Holland that the last time the actor was a guest on the show, it happened via Zoom. At the time, he outright lied about the involvement of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in No Way Home.\n\nThe Spidey meme recreation from the Spider-Man: No Way Home Blu-ray announcement. Image source: Sony\n\nThen, Fallon asked Holland whether Spider-Man 4 is happening, and that\u2019s when the beloved MCU star confirmed it all. He said that Spider-Man 4 will start shooting next summer.\n\n\u201cEverything is good to go, we\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he teased, adding that it\u2019s all \u201csuper exciting.\u201d That\u2019s somewhat in line with what Holland said on a podcast a few days ago.\n\nDuring that interview, Holland did not reveal any scheduling details. But he implied there\u2019s pressure to deliver Spider-Man 4, as the movie is part of the larger MCU landscape. Also, Holland talked more about the process of making the next Spider-Man movie.\n\nHe suggested he wants more creative control, as he learned how to put his foot down when it comes to his MCU involvement. The actor said he wants to do Spider-Man 4 and tell a great story rather than starring in a sequel for the sake of making it.\n\nI\u2019m bringing this up as it felt like Tom Holland could have a say in what happens with this variant of Peter Parker in the MCU. That he could save the Spider-Man 4 story. And I\u2019ll remind you of all the rumors that suggested the plot might need saving.\n\nSpecifically, reports said that Sony wants Spider-Man 4 to match the ambitions of No Way Home. That means making another multiverse movie in which Maguire and Garfield return. Marvel wanted a more down-to-earth story.\n\nMore recent rumors said that the big villain in Venom 3 could appear in Spider-Man 4. That\u2019s Knull, whose reportedly played by Andy Serkis. While that\u2019s an interesting prospect, it would also turn the movie into a multiverse adventure that could compete against Avengers: Doomsday. By the way, Holland should have a big role in Avengers 5, where he might lead the new team.\n\nYeah I really don't think we're getting Knull in Spider-Man 4. Bummer because I was hoping for it. \u2014 MyTimeToShineHello (@MyTimeToShineH) October 22, 2024\n\nFast-forward to mid-October, and we have a development on the Knull plot from MyTimeToShineHello. Her newest scoop contradicts rumors from mid-September that Sony is setting up a connection between Venom 3 and Spider-Man 4. Knull would end up being the villain of the latter.\n\nI certainly hope this leak is right. Sony and Marvel can certainly find a way to save Knull for later and tell a different story in Spider-Man 4."
