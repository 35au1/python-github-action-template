The UFO \u2015 which the U.S. government now calls UAPs, or unidentified aerial phenomena \u2015 had no engine and no thermal signature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\u201d\n\nBarber said it was later confirmed to him that the object was from a \u201cnonhuman intelligence,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t know what it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he also picked up what he called an \u201ceightgon,\u201d which he described as \u201ca flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections.\u201d Barber described feeling \u201codd\u201d and growing more emotional as he got closer to the \u201ceightgon\u201d object.\n\n\u201cI felt like something connected with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.\u201d\n\nNewsNation also said it independently obtained footage of an egg-shaped object being moved by helicopter:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile few details can be seen, the object isn\u2019t dissimilar to some of those seen in flight in prior videos from other whistleblowers, footage later confirmed by the Pentagon as authentic.\n\nOne, called the \u201cTic Tac\u201d because of its similarity to the mint candies, shows a white object with no visible wings or engines moving rapidly through the sky as pilots react in awe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been no clear answer as to what the objects are, but some observers have noted that there are more down-to-earth explanations for them, such as drones or balloons, in some cases of potentially foreign origin and with advanced \u2015 but not alien \u2015 technology."

            "article_content": "It will be a close encounter of the informative and entertaining kind when a local paranormal investigator shares his experiences at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library in Gardner.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, who starred on the \"Expedition Bigfoot\" series on the Discovery Channel for several season and appears regularly on \"Paranormal Caught on Camera\" the Travel Channel, will discuss the phenomena of unidentified flying objects in New England at the library on Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLeBlanc, who lives in Leominster and is the author of two \"Monsterland\" books, said he had been unaware that Central Massachusetts had been such a hotbed of UFO activity until he began doing research for his first book.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, a renowned Leominster-based paranormal investigator, will discuss \"UFOs in New England\" at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

            "article_content": "Jake Barber says he had a number of strange experiences while recovering top secret aircraft\n\nAn explosive video which apears to show the retrieval of a crashed alien spacecraft by a US Air Force helicopter has surfaced, thanks to a whistleblower. The clip, described as genuine by leading UFO expert Ross Coulthart, is said to have been covertly filmed by an insider on the Pentagon's top-secret UAP crash recovery unit. It depicts a 20-foot \"egg-shaped\" UFO object dangling from a sling under a helicopter. This aligns with a tale recounted to Coulthart by ex-US Air Force mechanic Jacob Barber, who allegedly participated in salvaging a similar alien vehicle. Barber departed the Air Force after September 11, 2001, and assumed a 'cover' role as a civilian contractor. He shared with Coulthart: \"A lot of the work we did was on what I call 'The Range,' where the US government and its private partners used to test all kinds of things - weapon systems and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft - and so you see a lot of exciting things.\"\n\nRoss Coulthart says the footage shows a spacecraft from another world\n\nHowever, even amid all these cutting-edge military aircraft trials, Barber claims his confrontation with a wingless, windowless, propulsion-lacking anomalous vehicle shocked him. \"Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was not human,\" Barber declared, reports the Mirror. Barber recalls being sent on an unusual mission to fetch the unidentified object, where he used a sling from his chopper attached to a 150-foot \"long line\". What he recovered was something out of the ordinary and not resembling any known aircraft. \"I saw an egg, a white egg,\" he recalled.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There was no thermal signature. I was operating at night when I finally came in to pick it up. So, I'm working under night vision goggles at the time, and it was quite clear. I flipped them up, flipped them down and looked at it a couple of different ways.\" After this bizarre retrieval, Barber was informed by his higher-ups that the enigmatic white \"egg\" was a vehicle created by \"NHI,\" short for nonhuman intelligence. He encountered several other potentially extraterrestrial craft during his tenure with the USAF. He elaborated: \"There was another object. One was the egg; the other is what I called an 'eightgon.' The eightgon was essentially a flying disc with what seemed like eight delineated sections when looking down.\"\n\nBarber carried several alien craft beneath his helicopter [stock image]\n\nTrending\n\nHis role was merely to airlift these items from 'The Range' to a covert USAF research site; thus, he never saw the object from any angle other than above. While Barber lacks solid details on the Air Force's activities with these finds, he observed what are described as \"trans-medium\" vessels, capable of travelling through both air and seemingly, solid matter. Barber revealed that some US Air Force personnel were trained in a type of telepathy to control unidentified aircraft, stating: \"In the program, there was certainly a desire to explore the idea that perhaps UAP could be summoned, could be communicated with, could be controlled and could be persuaded to land, all by deploying people with psionic abilities to interface and communicate with the UAP,\" he alleged. He also shared his personal encounters with these phenomena, including a profound experience: \"I felt like something connected with me,\" Barber recounted.\n\nDonald Trump has vowed to lift the lid on some of America's greatest secrets \u2013 could he be about to reveal the truth about UFOs?"

            "article_content": "It will be a close encounter of the informative and entertaining kind when a local paranormal investigator shares his experiences at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library in Gardner.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, who starred on the \"Expedition Bigfoot\" series on the Discovery Channel for several season and appears regularly on \"Paranormal Caught on Camera\" the Travel Channel, will discuss the phenomena of unidentified flying objects in New England at the library on Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLeBlanc, who lives in Leominster and is the author of two \"Monsterland\" books, said he had been unaware that Central Massachusetts had been such a hotbed of UFO activity until he began doing research for his first book.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, a renowned Leominster-based paranormal investigator, will discuss \"UFOs in New England\" at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

Instead of providing developers with a kind of supercharged autocomplete, this next generation can prototype, test, and debug code for you. The upshot is that developers could essentially turn into managers, who may spend more time reviewing and correcting code written by a model than writing it from scratch themselves.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Many of the people building generative coding assistants think that they could be a fast track to artificial general intelligence, the hypothetical superhuman technology that a number of top firms claim to have in their sights.Read the full story.\n\n\n\n\u2014Will Douglas Heaven\n\nOpenAI has created an AI model for longevity science\n\nWhen you think of AI\u2019s contributions to science, you probably think of AlphaFold, the Google DeepMind protein-folding program that earned its creator a Nobel Prize last year. Now OpenAI says it\u2019s getting into the science game too\u2014with a model for engineering proteins.\n\nThe company says it has developed a language model that dreams up proteins capable of turning regular cells into stem cells\u2014and that it has handily beat humans at the task.\n\nThe work represents OpenAI\u2019s first model focused on biological data and its first public claim that its models can deliver unexpected scientific results. But until outside scientists get their hands on it, we can\u2019t say just how impressive it really is. Read the full story.\n\n\u2014Antonio Regalado"

Epoch AI responded with transparency about what happened and what they\u2019re doing to check if the o3 model was trained with the FrontierMath dataset.\n\nGiving OpenAI access to the dataset was unexpected because the whole point of it is to test AI models but that can\u2019t be done if the models know the questions and answers beforehand.\n\nA post in the r/singularity subreddit expressed this disappointment and cited a document that claimed that the mathematicians didn\u2019t know about OpenAI\u2019s involvement:\n\n\u201cFrontier Math, the recent cutting-edge math benchmark, is funded by OpenAI. OpenAI allegedly has access to the problems and solutions. This is disappointing because the benchmark was sold to the public as a means to evaluate frontier models, with support from renowned mathematicians. In reality, Epoch AI is building datasets for OpenAI. They never disclosed any ties with OpenAI before.\u201d\n\nThe Reddit discussion cited a publication that revealed OpenAI\u2019s deeper involvement:\n\n\u201cThe mathematicians creating the problems for FrontierMath were not (actively)[2] communicated to about funding from OpenAI. \u2026Now Epoch AI or OpenAI don\u2019t say publicly that OpenAI has access to the exercises or answers or solutions. I have heard second-hand that OpenAI does have access to exercises and answers and that they use them for validation.\u201d\n\nTamay Besiroglu (LinkedIn Profile), associated director at Epoch AI, acknowledged that OpenAI had access to the datasets but also asserted that there was a \u201choldout\u201d dataset that OpenAI didn\u2019t have access to.\n\nHe wrote in the cited document:\n\n\u201cTamay from Epoch AI here. We made a mistake in not being more transparent about OpenAI\u2019s involvement. We were restricted from disclosing the partnership until around the time o3 launched, and in hindsight we should have negotiated harder for the ability to be transparent to the benchmark contributors as soon as possible. Our contract specifically prevented us from disclosing information about the funding source and the fact that OpenAI has data access to much but not all of the dataset. We own this error and are committed to doing better in the future. Regarding training usage: We acknowledge that OpenAI does have access to a large fraction of FrontierMath problems and solutions, with the exception of a unseen-by-OpenAI hold-out set that enables us to independently verify model capabilities. However, we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training. OpenAI has also been fully supportive of our decision to maintain a separate, unseen holdout set\u2014an extra safeguard to prevent overfitting and ensure accurate progress measurement. From day one, FrontierMath was conceived and presented as an evaluation tool, and we believe these arrangements reflect that purpose. \u201c\n\nMore Facts About OpenAI & FrontierMath Revealed\n\nElliot Glazer (LinkedIn profile/Reddit profile), the lead mathematician at Epoch AI confirmed that OpenAI has the dataset and that they were allowed to use it to evaluate OpenAI\u2019s o3 large language model, which is their next state of the art AI that\u2019s referred to as a reasoning AI model. He offered his opinion that the high scores obtained by the o3 model are \u201clegit\u201d and that Epoch AI is conducting an independent evaluation to determine whether or not o3 had access to the FrontierMath dataset for training, which could cast the model\u2019s high scores in a different light.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cEpoch\u2019s lead mathematician here. Yes, OAI funded this and has the dataset, which allowed them to evaluate o3 in-house. We haven\u2019t yet independently verified their 25% claim. To do so, we\u2019re currently developing a hold-out dataset and will be able to test their model without them having any prior exposure to these problems. My personal opinion is that OAI\u2019s score is legit (i.e., they didn\u2019t train on the dataset), and that they have no incentive to lie about internal benchmarking performances. However, we can\u2019t vouch for them until our independent evaluation is complete.\u201d\n\nGlazer had also shared that Epoch AI was going to test o3 using a \u201choldout\u201d dataset that OpenAI didn\u2019t have access to, saying:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate o3 with OAI having zero prior exposure to the holdout problems. This will be airtight.\u201d\n\nAnother post on Reddit by Glazer described how the \u201choldout set\u201d was created:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll describe the process more clearly when the holdout set eval is actually done, but we\u2019re choosing the holdout problems at random from a larger set which will be added to FrontierMath. The production process is otherwise identical to how it\u2019s always been.\u201d\n\nWaiting For Answers\n\nThat\u2019s where the drama stands until the Epoch AI evaluation is completed which will indicate whether or not OpenAI had trained their AI reasoning model with the dataset or only used it for benchmarking it.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Antonello Marangi"

            "article_content": "Save this picture! From new delivery methods for adaptive re-use and mass timber structures to digital fabrication, new research aims to provide guidance on emerging construction methods and technologies.. Image Courtesy of Perkins&Will\n\nInnovation comes in many shapes and forms. 2025 is poised to witness continued advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence, sustainability, and biotechnology. These breakthroughs often arise from experimentation in industries like technology and healthcare, where companies have strong research and development teams and significant budgets. This enables them to produce new products and services that address society's evolving needs.\n\nIn a world confronting complex challenges, innovation in architecture plays a distinctive role. Unlike industries driven by rapid innovation cycles, architecture must balance creativity with practical solutions that are deeply rooted in human experience. What will it take for the architecture industry to fully harness its potential in shaping the future of our built environment?\n\n+ 2\n\nInterrogating this question, ArchDaily's editor Ankitha Gattupalli spoke to Leigh Christy and Yehia Madkour, architects and co-directors of Research and Innovation at Perkins&Will. Based in the Los Angeles studio, Leigh leads regional projects while also guiding firm-wide research efforts. Vancouver-based Yehia, whose work explores the intersection of design and technology, brings his expertise to the firm's research initiatives, driving innovation across 32 studios. Together, they shape the firm's research direction, advancing new approaches to design and technology.\n\nRelated Article What are Innovation Districts?\n\nArchDaily (Ankitha Gattupalli): How do you define innovation, and how do you believe it is understood when you discuss it?\n\nLeigh Christy (LC): The definition of innovation is not fixed; it evolves over time. Innovation is best understood as the combination of ideation and implementation. While ideation is central to many programs, the focus on research and application is critical for scaling and successful implementation.\n\nYehia Madkour (YM): Innovation goes beyond just generating a novel idea; it is about the execution of that idea. The true value of innovation lies in the process that follows the initial concept. There are three key steps to innovation:\n\nThe generation of a novel idea. The advancement of that idea in a meaningful direction. The creation of value, which may be societal, industrial, or personal, rather than strictly financial.\n\nAD: How do you see the architecture industry responding to the concept of innovation?\n\nYM: Architects are in a unique position to connect various elements\u2014working with clients to understand their evolving needs, collaborating with industry partners to adapt to changes, and considering economic, technological, and human factors. This central role allows us to generate innovative ideas. However, the industry, particularly in architecture and construction, tends to lag behind other sectors in terms of technological adoption.\n\nOne reason for this is the bespoke nature of design in our field, which presents challenges when attempting to apply standardized innovations. Each project often requires tailored solutions, making it difficult to implement broad, systematic changes like automation. While architects are positioned to generate many ideas, the industry as a whole still faces barriers to embracing innovation at scale.\n\nLC: I believe the approach to problem-solving through design thinking positions architects well to propose innovative solutions. We address challenges at the scale of every project, but what is particularly interesting is how we extend innovation beyond individual projects. We learn from past projects to drive future innovation, developing new tools when needed and remaining open to change when approaches prove ineffective.\n\nWhile the industry generates novel ideas, implementing systematic change and sharing progress remains inconsistent. Addressing issues like housing and climate change requires a multidisciplinary approach, with architects playing a key collaborative role alongside clients and professionals.\n\nAD: How do you decide which research areas are worth exploring?\n\nYM: Our research areas emerge from a combination of factors, including our understanding of global shifts and client-driven inquiries. Some areas are more focused on immediate applications, while others are more strategic and long-term in nature.\n\nFor instance, human experience remains central to our work and will continue to be a major research focus. Another key area is digital layering, as new technologies are continuously emerging, and understanding their integration is critical. We also prioritize urgent issues, such as environmental crises and climate change, which will remain pressing challenges for the foreseeable future.\n\nLC: An example of this approach can be seen in our mass timber research, which began over 10 years ago. It started with exploring its broader application after gaining attention in Vancouver. Initially, challenges like local availability, testing codes, and fire resistance were barriers. By partnering with structural engineers and fire consultants, we advanced the industry, and mass timber is now widely used across North America and Europe. We are now investigating its role in circularity and design for disassembly. While our mass timber research may eventually conclude, it will lead to new inquiries on alternative materials and structural systems.\n\nAD: How do you balance the potential of technology and research with the market's readiness for it?\n\nLC: This challenge ties into how we structure our research agenda. We focus on understanding both current industry needs and emerging questions from our client base. By recognizing patterns, we aim to create solutions that not only address immediate issues but also position us to address future challenges. It's about striking a balance between vision and practicality, ensuring we remain grounded in the current landscape while also preparing for the future.\n\nYM: While we concentrate on solving current needs, we also allocate time for strategic thinking. Some ideas may not be market-ready today, but they help us anticipate trends for the next 5 to 10 years. These long-term considerations may seem speculative now, but they are vital for positioning ourselves for future opportunities. Innovation involves accepting failure as part of the process, but it's essential to plan ahead, not just focus on immediate needs.\n\nAD: How do you integrate different disciplines to drive innovation and manage subject matter expertise on complex issues?\n\nLC: Collaboration is a two-way street. While our external partners bring valuable insights, we provide the projects necessary to test those ideas. This mutual exchange of expertise benefits both parties. Peer review is another critical aspect of our process\u2014before presenting our research as foundational, we seek feedback from others to refine our findings.\n\nCollaborating with specialists has been crucial in our research, such as when exploring toxins in materials or in our work on habitable materials where we learned about carbon footprint and human health. By identifying our specific questions, we can select the most suitable partners to help answer them.\n\nInnovation often requires human connection to move forward - Yehia Madkour\n\nAD: What do you see as the key barriers to innovation in architecture, and how can the industry overcome them?\n\nYM: The primary barrier to innovation in architecture is designing for one solution at a time. While this approach fuels creativity, each project's unique specifics often prevent the scalability necessary for widespread impact. In technology, scalability drives innovation by reaching millions, but in architecture, we often lack the scale to extend the impact of each idea.\n\nThe industry would benefit from a systems-thinking approach, where solutions are designed to be scalable and adaptable across different contexts. Without this systemic approach, innovation in architecture struggles to progress at the same pace as other industries. While this may seem like an unsolvable problem, I believe shifting our mindset could unlock a great deal of innovation.\n\nLC: While architecture can certainly adopt more systematic approaches, I've come to realize the importance of having a visionary role as well. Innovation in architecture isn't just about technology; it's about envisioning improvements to the built environment. This involves understanding the process that leads to a successful project, not just the final product.\n\nWhile it's tempting to look to the tech industry as the benchmark for innovation, there are other equally impactful forms of innovation, such as community engagement. Simple tools, like administering surveys, can make a significant difference in the design process.\n\nWhile we may not be as advanced in innovation as the tech industry, I believe there is immense potential in architecture to lead in innovation\u2014especially if we embrace a more comprehensive, systems-oriented mindset."

            "article_content": "WhatsApp, with its billions of users worldwide, has become a major target for scammers seeking to exploit its popularity. Understanding the various types of scams and learning how to avoid them is essential to protect yourself and your personal information.\n\nHow to Stay Safe on WhatsApp\n\nTo protect yourself from WhatsApp scams, it\u2019s crucial to adopt a healthy level of skepticism. Be cautious when interacting with unknown contacts, especially if they are requesting money or personal information. Avoid clicking on unsolicited links, scanning random QR codes, or downloading suspicious files. Always verify the identity of anyone who contacts you unexpectedly, and enable two-step verification on your WhatsApp account for extra security.\n\nThis article will explore some of the most common WhatsApp scams and provide tips on how to stay safe from these fraudulent schemes.\n\n1. Fake Donation Schemes\n\nIn this scam, fraudsters pose as charitable organizations or individuals in need of donations for personal or community causes. Once you send the money, the \u201ccharity\u201d disappears, and the scammer pockets the funds.\n\nAlways verify the legitimacy of charitable organizations before making donations. Reputable charities don\u2019t rely on random messages through WhatsApp to solicit donations. If you\u2019re inclined to donate, go through official websites or established fundraising platforms.\n\n2. Two-Step Verification Scams\n\nSome scammers may message you, claiming they mistakenly sent their two-step verification code to your phone number and ask you to forward it to them. This is an attempt to hijack your WhatsApp account by tricking you into providing the code they need to gain access.\n\nIf you receive such a message, do not share the verification code. Instead, secure your account by enabling two-step verification within WhatsApp settings and regularly updating your PIN. This adds an extra layer of protection to your account, making it harder for scammers to take control.\n\n3. Romance/Catfishing and Prostitution Scams\n\nSome scammers take advantage of people looking for relationships by pretending to be interested in romance. Over time, they build trust before inventing a crisis and asking for financial help. Similarly, you may be approached by someone offering illicit services, which is often just a way to get you to click on phishing or malware links.\n\nTo avoid falling for romance scams, be skeptical of people you meet online, especially if they avoid meeting in person or making video calls. Check their social media presence, and use tools like reverse image search to verify their photos. If someone asks for money early in the relationship, it\u2019s likely a scam.\n\n4. Fake Family or Friend Emergency\n\nIn this scam, someone poses as a friend or family member, claiming to be messaging from a new phone number due to an emergency. The scammer engages in conversation before eventually asking for money or personal information. These tactics often exploit the urgency of the situation to trick people into acting without verifying the identity of the sender.\n\nTo prevent falling for this scam, ask the individual for specific details that only the real person would know, such as their old phone number or personal details not readily available online. If the person cannot provide this information, it\u2019s likely a scam. Always double-check before sending any money or sharing sensitive information, and contact the real person through other methods if you have doubts.\n\n5. Free Gift Cards or Vouchers\n\nA common scam that continues to circulate on WhatsApp involves messages claiming that you\u2019ve won a free gift card or voucher, often from major retailers. These messages usually contain links that direct you to phishing sites or download malware onto your device.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid this scam is to remember that reputable companies do not give out free gift cards or vouchers through random messages. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always verify the legitimacy of any offer by visiting the company\u2019s official website directly rather than clicking on any suspicious links.\n\n6. Fake Tech Support or Account Verification\n\nIn this scam, someone pretends to be from WhatsApp or another tech company, asking you to verify your account details or provide sensitive information. They might direct you to a phishing website or attempt to hijack your account.\n\nTo avoid this, remember that WhatsApp will never contact you directly through the app to ask for verification details. If you need to verify your account, this process will typically happen through a phone call or SMS. Never provide personal information or passwords through in-app messages.\n\n7. WhatsApp Gold Scam\n\nOne of the oldest WhatsApp scams is the \u201cWhatsApp Gold\u201d hoax, where users receive an unsolicited message offering a supposed upgraded version of WhatsApp with exclusive features. The message includes a link to download this non-existent app, which often leads to phishing attempts or malware downloads.\n\nTo avoid falling victim to this scam, always be skeptical of unsolicited messages offering upgrades or special versions of apps. Official app updates come directly from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, so ensure that any downloads are from these legitimate sources. If the message contains a URL that doesn\u2019t look like it comes from an official app store or WhatsApp website, it\u2019s best to avoid it altogether.\n\n8. Fake Lotteries and Giveaways\n\nAnother scam involves messages claiming you\u2019ve won a lottery or giveaway. To claim the prize, you\u2019re instructed to click on a link or provide personal information. These scams usually result in phishing attacks or malware.\n\nLegitimate companies do not notify winners of contests or lotteries via WhatsApp. If you receive such a message, do not engage with it. Instead, research the company or promotion to verify whether it\u2019s real before taking any action.\n\n9. Cryptocurrency and Investment Scams\n\nWith the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, scammers often prey on people\u2019s desire to invest and make quick profits. Scammers might message you, promising large returns for a small investment or offering secret investment tips in exchange for money.\n\nBefore making any investments, always do thorough research. Avoid deals that seem too good to be true, and only invest through reputable platforms. Remember, high returns always come with high risks, and legitimate investments require careful consideration, not spontaneous decisions made over WhatsApp.\n\n10. Unsolicited QR Codes\n\nSome scammers send codes instead of links, asking you to scan the code for many reasons. When you scan these codes, they take you to fake websites or put your phone at risk for malware or scams.\n\nTo stay safe, do not scan codes sent from people you do not know. In apps like WhatsApp, there is no good reason for someone to send you a code instead of a link unless they want to hide something. Real codes are on boxes, screens, or known sites, not in messages from unknown people.\n\nBy staying alert and using these tips, you can lower the risk of falling for scams and keep your info safe.\n\nDisclaimer: We may be compensated by some of the companies whose products we talk about, but our articles and reviews are always our honest opinions.

            "article_content": "Job hunting can be an exhausting and time-consuming process. Between scrolling through endless job boards, deciphering lengthy descriptions, and trying to figure out which roles are actually worth your time, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. If you\u2019ve ever wished there was a way to cut through the noise and focus on opportunities that truly match your skills and goals, you\u2019re not alone. The good news? There\u2019s a smarter, more efficient way to tackle your job search\u2014one that uses automation and AI to do the heavy lifting for you. Imagine a system that not only finds job postings but also organizes, filters, and prioritizes them, leaving you with a clear path forward. Sounds like a fantastic option, right?\n\nThis guide by Eric Tech introduces a no-code workflow that transforms the way you approach job hunting. By combining tools like Make, Airtable, and ChatGPT, this system automates repetitive tasks, from pulling job postings off LinkedIn to summarizing descriptions and calculating how well each role aligns with your profile. It\u2019s not just about saving time\u2014it\u2019s about working smarter, so you can focus your energy on what really matters: landing the job that\u2019s right for you.\n\nAI Job Search Automations\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Automate your job search using no-code tools like Make.com, RSS feeds, Airtable, and ChatGPT to create a streamlined workflow that extracts, filters, and prioritizes job postings.\n\nThe system processes job data by summarizing descriptions, calculating match percentages, and organizing information into a structured Airtable database for easy prioritization.\n\nScalability allows the workflow to include additional job sources, handle errors, and adapt to evolving job search needs.\n\nCost management is crucial, with ChatGPT processing fees estimated at $1.55 for 100 job records, making optimization key to balancing efficiency and affordability.\n\nThe workflow is highly customizable, allowing users to refine prompts, add new metrics, and tailor filters to align with their unique job search strategies and goals.\n\nSearching for a new job can often feel overwhelming, with countless postings to sift through and repetitive tasks consuming valuable time. However, by using no-code tools such as Make, RSS feeds, Airtable, and ChatGPT, you can automate and simplify this process.\n\nHow the Workflow Functions\n\nThe automation process operates on a timer-based system that retrieves job postings at regular intervals, such as every three hours. This ensures that your job search remains consistent and up-to-date. The workflow includes the following steps:\n\nJob postings are extracted from LinkedIn using RSS feeds, providing a steady stream of opportunities.\n\nDuplicate entries are filtered out, making sure that you only see unique and relevant listings.\n\nBy automating these repetitive tasks, you can reduce clutter and focus on roles that truly matter.\n\nTransforming Data into Actionable Insights\n\nOnce job postings are collected, the workflow processes the data to make it actionable and easy to evaluate. Key steps in this stage include:\n\nExtracting critical details such as job title, description, and posting date using HTTP requests.\n\nSummarizing lengthy job descriptions into concise, 215-character summaries with ChatGPT for quick review.\n\nCalculating a job match percentage by comparing your skills and profile with the job requirements.\n\nThis combination of automation and AI allows you to efficiently assess the relevance of each job without manually analyzing every detail, saving both time and effort.\n\nNo-Cod Job Search Automation Workflow\n\nUncover more insights about No-Code Automation in previous articles we have written.\n\nOrganizing and Prioritizing Job Opportunities\n\nThe processed job data is stored in Airtable, a versatile database tool that organizes information into a structured and easily navigable format. Each job entry includes:\n\nJob title and description\n\nPosting date\n\nDirect link to the job posting\n\nMatch percentage\n\nBy sorting and filtering jobs based on the match percentage, you can prioritize roles that align closely with your skills and career goals. This structured approach ensures that your efforts are directed toward the most promising opportunities.\n\nExpanding and Customizing the Workflow\n\nThis system is designed to adapt and grow with your job search needs. You can expand its functionality to include additional job sources, such as other job boards or company career pages. Customization options include:\n\nRefining ChatGPT prompts to exclude irrelevant roles, such as internships or part-time positions.\n\nAdding new data points, like a competition metric, to evaluate the difficulty of securing a position.\n\nIncorporating filters to tailor results to your preferences, such as location or industry.\n\nThese adjustments allow you to create a workflow that aligns with your unique strategy, making sure a more targeted and effective job search.\n\nEnhancing Efficiency and Managing Costs\n\nWhile automation significantly reduces the time spent on job hunting, it is essential to manage costs effectively. For instance, using ChatGPT to summarize job descriptions and calculate match percentages incurs a fee. Processing 100 job records with GPT-4 costs approximately $1.55, making it a cost-effective solution for handling large volumes of data. To optimize efficiency while keeping expenses under control, focus on high-priority tasks and refine the workflow to minimize unnecessary processing.\n\nTo further enhance the system, consider adding features such as:\n\nCombining job match percentages with competition metrics for better prioritization of roles.\n\nExpanding the workflow to include more job boards or data sources, increasing the range of opportunities available.\n\nThese enhancements can help you refine your search and strategically target roles that offer the best fit for your skills and career aspirations.\n\nMaximizing the Benefits of Automation\n\nBy using no-code tools and AI, this job search automation workflow transforms the job search process into a streamlined and efficient system. From extracting job postings to prioritizing applications, it saves time and allows you to focus on the most relevant opportunities. With its scalability, cost management, and customization options, this solution is a powerful resource for job seekers aiming to optimize their search and improve their chances of success. Whether you are just starting your career or looking for your next big opportunity, this workflow provides a practical and adaptable approach to navigating the job market.\n\nMedia Credit: Eric Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "This is a guest post for the Computer Weekly Developer Network written by Gordon Robinson in his capacity as senior director of data management at SAS.\n\nRobinson writes in full as follows\u2026\n\nOver the past couple of decades, the role of the \u201cdata engineer\u201d emerged as businesses have become increasingly data-driven, catapulting the need for specialised skills to manage the large volumes of data being processed.\n\nGoogle popularised the title itself around 2010, underscoring the necessity for experts to design, build and maintain scalable data systems. The advent of technologies like Hadoop and Spark further emphasised the importance of these roles, which bridge raw data and actionable insights, aiding data scientists and analysts.\n\nDemand for data engineers In recent years, substantial advancements in AI, increased AI accessibility and rapid growth of data-driven decision-making have led to greater \u2013 and mounting \u2013 demands on data engineering teams. In fact, job postings for AI-related roles have surged by 119% over the past two years and, mirroring that change, data engineering positions have seen a 98% increase, says LinkedIn. Many businesses are facing challenges in meeting the demand for data engineers and filling these critical positions. Skilled data engineers are hard to find in the job market due to the demand outpacing the supply and the most talented often cost enterprises a premium to hire too. As a result, other employees, such as software developers and data scientists, often take on responsibilities typically managed by data engineers. These tasks include managing data pipelines, ensuring data quality and building infrastructure for data processing. The term \u201ccitizen data engineer\u201d refers to these non-specialist professionals, typically from roles such as business analysts, operations staff or software developers, who develop the necessary skills to perform basic data engineering tasks. Businesses are increasingly relying on these often self-trained individuals to alleviate some of the workload of their data engineering teams (if they have one).\n\nTools & training Given the lack of formal training for citizen data engineers, the onus falls on companies to ensure that these employees have the appropriate tools they need to simplify their tasks and bolster their knowledge. Some key requirements for these tools are: Low-code /no-code : A LC/NC interface is crucial for a citizen data engineer as it enables them to efficiently perform data-related tasks without requiring extensive programming knowledge, thereby bridging the gap between technical and non-technical professionals.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI : It is essential for data engineering tools to offer generative AI functionalities to support citizen engineers. This should encompass features such as natural language queries for locating relevant data sets, automatic suggestions for transformations and the generation of data flows.\n\n\n\nCollaboration : Collaboration capabilities are vital for data engineering tools, enabling cooperation among data engineers, data scientists, business analysts and end users.\n\n\n\nData governance : Integrated data governance and lineage are essential for organisations to understand their data, its quality and usage. Tools for citizen data engineers should simplify this management and help the organisation ensure compliance with regulations they may need to adhere to. Given the above, organisations will need to look beyond some of the traditional coding-only interfaces that the data engineers may use if they want to enable citizen data engineers."

            "article_content": "Despite all the incentives to buy, the PC market remains at a weak level. Only 245.4 million desktop PCs and notebooks with Windows, macOS and Chrome OS were sold in 2024. This is according to a preliminary estimate by market observer Gartner.\n\nAnzeige\n\nCompared to 2023, the PC market grew by 1.3%. There was no significant upward trend towards the end of the year either: in the fourth quarter, manufacturers sold 64.4 million devices \u2013 1.4 percent more than at the end of 2023. Gartner does not look at the distribution between desktop PCs and notebooks; the ratio is typically around 1:3.\n\nBefore 2023, more than 250 million computers were sold each year. In 2020 and 2021, the level was particularly high at more than 300 million units due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGartner always publishes preliminary figures on the PC market at the beginning of the year. As a rule, these estimates are already accurate. (Image: heise online)\n\nMany incentives do not help\n\nMicrosoft and all major notebook manufacturers have been focusing their marketing efforts on AI computers with Copilot+ since 2024. So far, however, only a few seem to be interested. Intel's announcement that it will have delivered a good 1.5 million Lunar Lake processors (Core Ultra 200V) with an AI unit in 2024 fits in with this. Qualcomm's ARM processors from the Snapdragon X series are expected to be even lower. The market share of Copilot+ PCs is therefore around one percent.\n\nThe approaching end of support for Windows 10 this coming October is also not encouraging new purchases. Microsoft only supports Windows 11 from Intel's Core i-8000 and AMD's Ryzen 2000. Windows 11 can only be installed with tricks on all systems with older CPUs. Without Windows 11, however, private users will no longer receive any important security updates.\n\nAnzeige\n\nMeanwhile, the figures for the second half of 2024 are glossed over by subsidies in China. Among other things, the government is promoting new purchases of desktop PCs and notebooks through trade-in bonuses: Since August, anyone handing in an old device has received a 15 percent refund on the new computer. China is planning further such programs for 2025.\n\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt Mit Ihrer Zustimmung wird hier ein externer Preisvergleich (heise Preisvergleich) geladen.

            "article_content": "It will be a close encounter of the informative and entertaining kind when a local paranormal investigator shares his experiences at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library in Gardner.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, who starred on the \"Expedition Bigfoot\" series on the Discovery Channel for several season and appears regularly on \"Paranormal Caught on Camera\" the Travel Channel, will discuss the phenomena of unidentified flying objects in New England at the library on Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLeBlanc, who lives in Leominster and is the author of two \"Monsterland\" books, said he had been unaware that Central Massachusetts had been such a hotbed of UFO activity until he began doing research for his first book.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, a renowned Leominster-based paranormal investigator, will discuss \"UFOs in New England\" at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

            "article_content": "Fundamental research in cryptography that\u2019s used worldwide to facilitate internet banking, e-commerce services, and secure messaging systems is now taking root in India as well.\n\nThe principal goal of those developing or using cryptographic systems is to improve system security. Cryptography \u2014 from the English roots of \u201chidden writing \u2014 is the name for techniques that secure information by converting plain text into ciphertext. It is concerned with the creation and use of encrypted messages that only the sender and the receiver can understand and which a malicious actor who interferes with the communication can\u2019t.\n\nSending secret messages isn\u2019t new. Archaeologists have unearthed clay tablets made by the ancient Mesopotamians in which they wrote down cryptic formulae to make ceramic glazes. In the first century BC, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar used the eponymous Caesar cipher to relay messages of strategic value to his generals.\n\nMore recently, many Polish codebreakers fled their country after Adolf Hitler invaded it in 1939 to work with reputed British mathematicians, including the father of modern computing Alan Turing, to crack Germany\u2019s famed Enigma cryptosystem. Turing\u2019s work in particular established much of the foundational theory for modern algorithmic computing.\n\nScientists have devised many sophisticated methods to prevent adversaries from cracking secret codes and gaining unauthorised access to sensitive information. These methods achieve their goals by using algorithms and protocols to protect some data\u2019s confidentiality, integrity, authenticatability, and non-repudiation.\n\n\u2018Hard\u2019 problems\n\nCryptographic algorithms convert messages in ways that make it very difficult, very expensive or both to decode them. A common way to achieve this has been to place some sensitive information behind the answer to a very difficult problem. An agent can access the information by solving the problem, so the harder the problem, the more inaccessible the information.\n\n\u201cHence the search for harder and harder problems \u2014 for instance, even those that quantum computers may find hard to solve,\u201d R. Ramanujam of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, said.\n\nAs computational techniques evolve, particularly with advancements in quantum computing, the interplay between complexity and cryptography will continue to be a crucial area of research and development, he added.\n\nModern cryptographic systems are built on problems that demand far too many resources to be solved.\n\n\u201cAs they say in the crypto community, if your cryptosystem is broken, either a spy is dead or a million dollars is missing,\u201d Ayan Mukherjee, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, said. \u201cSuch is the seriousness of the effect of a broken cryptosystem. Thus, oftentimes, people use the old and the trusted to secure their communications.\u201d\n\nThis is also why, he added, \u201cThe field of cryptography is very slow-moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a close connection between complexity theory and cryptography, hence many [researchers] work on these connections, clarifying notions and building finer techniques,\u201d Ramanujam said.\n\nAreas where Indian researchers are working extensively include communication complexity (the amount of communication required to complete a computational task), proof complexity (the computational resources required to prove or disprove statements), and algebraic coding theory (using algebra to encode and decode data).\n\nLocks and keys\n\nThe goal is to make sure an adversary, especially one with enormous computational resources, can\u2019t crack the code. At the heart of any cryptosystem is the key: a secret value an algorithm uses to encrypt or decrypt data.\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a simple example. It works by mapping the existing alphabet to one where the starting letter is offset by some number of letters. This number is the key. For example, if the key is 14, the encrypted alphabet begins with the letter O (the 14th letter) rather than A. Thus the words FIGHT FOR ROME become TWUVH TCF FCAS.\n\nWhen the sender encrypts data with a key, only someone who knows the key can decrypt the message and read it. More sophisticated systems use two keys \u2014 one each for the sender and the receiver \u2014 and map them in a separate secret way.\n\nA famous example is public-key cryptography, which is used to secure information over the internet. The receiver uses a single algorithm to generate two keys called the public key and the private key, and shares the public key with the sender. Any message the sender encrypts with the public key can be decrypted by the private key.\n\nResearchers prefer the algorithms that generate keys to be one-way functions, a name in mathematics for functions that are simple to use but hard to crack. In cryptography, this means they can be used to easily encrypt messages but can\u2019t be cracked without knowing the key. As Ramanujam put it, the challenge is like protecting a house with a strong alarm system that the house\u2019s residents can still use without training.\n\nSome one-way functions are very difficult to crack and thus very secure \u2014 but which also take a long time to decrypt messages. This is one of the principal reasons mining for bitcoins has become a very energy-intensive process. The bitcoin system uses a one-way function that has required more computational resources to decrypt messages as the size of its blockchain has increased.\n\nThis is why some cryptography researchers in India and abroad are working on simplifying the decryption side in particular. Researchers are also considering whether shorter proofs (of the hard problems) can be used to verify the integrity of data in artificial intelligence and large language models.\n\nCryptography isn\u2019t just a mathematical or academic curiosity but is of considerable practical interest, Yael Kalai, whose work on proofs won her the 2022 Turing Award, told the 11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in September (the author was in the audience). \u201cIn today\u2019s world, the biggest problem we have to solve is trustworthiness,\u201d she said.\n\nSince researchers have solved the problem of authentication and security in communications, she added, the current problem is computation.\n\n\u201cPeople are computing things for us. How do we know that they are computing correctly? How do we certify the huge and often crazy computations people are coming up with? That is a huge new research problem now.\u201d\n\nPossibility of disruption\n\nTwo research areas that could disrupt current cryptographic systems with significant economic and social consequences are homomorphic encryption and quantum information technologies, per a recent paper by the Organisation of Economically Developed Countries (OECD).\n\nHomomorphic encryption is a cryptographic method that allows certain calculations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first and without accessing the secret key. The result of such computations remains in encrypted form and can be revealed later, when necessary. According to the paper, this technique could surmount the problem of processing encrypted data without decrypting it first, which increases risk.\n\nSecond, a mature quantum computer could easily break some encryption methods widely used today. Some researchers are thus working on algorithms that can resist attacks powered by a quantum computer, an enterprise called quantum resistant cryptography (QRC). In fact marrying cryptography with quantum physics paves the way for encryption technologies based on the laws of quantum physics, which can be more convoluted than mathematical concepts alone.\n\nResearchers worldwide have been working on QRC since 2006, including in publicly funded research projects in the European Union and Japan. In India, Mukherjee\u2019s group at IISER Pune, and those at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Raman Research Institute (RRI), both in Bengaluru; the Centre for Development of Telematics, New Delhi; and at Pondicherry University are working on it as well.\n\n\u2018A huge deal\u2019\n\nCryptography research in India is taking off in other aspects, too, catching up with that in the European Union, the U.S., and China. The National Quantum Mission the Cabinet approved in 2023 includes a research hub for quantum communication. The mission is to enable satellite-based secure quantum communications between ground stations over 2,000 km, long-distance secure quantum communications with other countries, inter-city quantum key distribution over 2,000 km, and multi-node quantum networks, among other outcomes.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation is also planning to launch a satellite with ultra-secure quantum communication capabilities.\n\nIn July, a team of Indian scientists from RRI, IISc, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, and the Bose Institute in Kolkata published a paper describing a way to generate true random numbers that are crucial to making secure private keys and nearly unhackable passwords.\n\n\u201cThis new method offers the enhanced protection we all need in our daily lives, by using truly random numbers to generate keys that will be used to encrypt the passwords,\u201d the Department of Science & Technology said in a statement.\n\nApart from the Ministry of Science & Technology, major government funders for cryptography research in the country include the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Department of Telecommunications.\n\n\u201cThe present status of quantum cryptography is to build quantum-secure cryptosystems,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s based on the idea that, in the near future, we will have quantum computers. When that happens the current cryptosystems will fail. This is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe consequences will also affect India\u2019s cryptography policy. According to a recent study commissioned by the Thales Group, the volume of sensitive data in the cloud could surge from 51% of all organisational data to 68% by 2027. As more data enters and lives in the cloud, \u201cencryption techniques for data at rest, in motion, and in use are becoming more pervasive, evolving into a standard practice for protecting cloud-resident sensitive information against emerging cyber threats,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere is widespread data loss as well: the report said almost three-fourths of all organisations have faced multiple data breaches in the past year, foremost due to inadequate encryption. Some 71% initiated formal cryptographic programmes and 81% have dedicated encryption teams.\n\nT.V. Padma is a science journalist in New Delhi."

            "article_content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nFor children today, artificial intelligence (AI) won't be a marvel or a menace\u2014it will simply be there. As unremarkable as Wi-Fi or running water. It's not a question of whether they'll adapt to AI; they're already growing up with it.\n\nAlexa's voice mingles with bedtime stories. ChatGPT drafts homework outlines. Google Home turns on the lights and plays morning playlists.\n\nAI is settling into family homes, classrooms, and even cribs, not as an anomaly but as a quiet companion.\n\nMy daughter is growing up with humans and AI. Literally. She just turned one and already recognises her mom, her dad, and her AI assistant. We have the Amazon Alexa at home, and my partner and I use Siri on our iPhones all the time. As a result, she sees AI as a natural part of her life. Alexa and Siri are two names she is familiar with, just like 'Mama' and 'Papaa.'\n\nWhen she cries, we say, \"Alexa, tell Raaha to stop crying,\" Alexa blinks blue and green, luring her to think it's her friend. And she stops crying.\n\nWhen tears roll down her cheeks, Alexa's soothing lullabies often succeed where parenting hacks fail. A simple command transforms chaos into calm. This isn't the splashy tech revolution futurists warned about.\n\nDon't forget the foundation. AI here is not forced. It didn't announce itself. It's here to weave itself into the fabric of daily life. Like a flawless merger.\n\nA decade ago, Skype calls felt like science fiction; toddlers swipe through virtual classrooms today without batting an eye.\n\nSimilarly, today's AI-powered toys, chatbots, and voice assistants will become as banal as microwaves by the time Generation Alpha enters middle school. The shift is happening in the mundane moments.\n\nAlgorithms suggest learning apps tailored to individual needs. Toys respond to emotional cues, fostering a strange form of companionship. And yet, these tools are less about transforming life and more about streamlining it. For today's kids, there's no awe or fear. It's just life.\n\nAI's creeping omnipresence creates a paradox.\n\nOn one hand, it's a miracle of modernity. Need a quick science lesson? AI tutors have you covered. Want to track developmental milestones? Machine learning apps will cheerfully send reminders. But this efficiency comes at a cost. If Alexa answers every curious \"why,\" will children still learn the joy of discovery? If empathy is simulated, will they grasp the depth of real human connection?\n\nAlso Read: AI in the real world\n\nI wrestle with these questions daily. I marvel at AI's ability to ease daily burdens. As a sceptic, I wonder: Are we outsourcing too much? AI may smooth the edges of chaos, but it also raises a nagging fear\u2014what happens when the lines between human and machine blur too much?\n\nOutside the home, the AI ecosystem is reshaping every facet of society. Schools are piloting AI tutors that promise personalised education, a far cry from one-size-fits-all classrooms. In healthcare, AI tools detect patterns in patient data, offering diagnostics faster than human doctors. Even our social interactions are subtly guided by recommendation algorithms dictating what we see, read, and share.\n\nBut with ubiquity comes complacency. Who ensures these systems remain ethical while children grow up surrounded by invisible, algorithmic hands? Bias in AI is no theoretical issue. A 2019 study found that facial recognition software misidentified Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more frequently than white ones. When these systems shape our children's realities, vigilance isn't optional\u2014it's imperative.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe next frontier for AI isn't innovation\u2014it's normalisation. Systems will become more personalised, more humanlike, and more integrated into the spaces we inhabit. Picture this: smart homes seamlessly adapting to moods, smart cities optimising every resource, and AI tools that learn not just how we think but how we feel. Our children will inherit this reality\u2014a world where AI doesn't stand out; it blends in.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will be part of their lives. It's whether it will shape them more than they shape it.\n\nA Quiet Revolution, Carefully Tended\n\nIt's to make life a little smoother, a little easier quietly. As parents, educators, professionals and citizens, our responsibility is to ensure this transition is thoughtful and deliberate. AI shouldn't raise our children. It should support us in raising them.\n\nIn business, think of AI as a dependable assistant. It simplifies tasks, spots problems, and lets leaders focus on big-picture decisions. It's not the boss; the behind-the-scenes helper keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nIn education, AI works like a helpful tutor. It finds where students struggle and offers the right tools to support them. But the teacher inspires creativity, critical thinking, and emotional growth\u2014skills no machine can truly replace.\n\nAlso Read: Human intelligence must guide artificial intelligence\n\nFor now, I'll keep asking Alexa to play lullabies when the chaos peaks. But I'll also keep asking myself harder questions. Will this ecosystem of AI enhance our humanity\u2014or dilute it? The answer, perhaps, lies in how we choose to nurture this strange, quiet revolution. Maybe it's not as scary as it's portrayed in the movies, as it's quietly evolving into our regular ecosystem anyway.\n\nPersonally, I'm okay with AI if it can help my baby stop crying. More okay with it helping me automate the most boring task in my profession."

            "article_content": "The quantum computing revolution is changing technology as we know it. Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.\n\nThis transformative technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Underscoring this point, a recent McKinsey & Co. research report projects that quantum computing could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in economic value by 2035.\n\nJust as the internet boom created giants like Amazon and Google, quantum computing could give rise to a new generation of industry-leading companies, offering early investors the potential for extraordinary gains. Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ (IONQ -6.40%) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI -12.54%) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps."
