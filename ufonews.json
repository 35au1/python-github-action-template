            "article_content": "I spent an entire day of CES wearing a little yellow bracelet. To the unsuspecting nearby humans, it probably looked like a fitness tracker. But the whole time, this yellow Pioneer wearable from Bee AI recorded everything around me. It wasn't storing audio like a typical recorder app, but it processed my conversations, then gave me personalized to-do lists and readable summaries of my in-person chats.\n\nA few days before the trade show, I spoke with the founder of another new company, Omi, which was officially unveiled for the first time today. Guess what it does? Record everything around you to create an activity log, and then have AI disseminate the information to give you actionable insights and tasks from your day, almost like a personal assistant. Omi's wearable can go around your neck, but it is best worn stuck to your forehead near your temple\u2014it has an electroencephalogram inside, and Omi claims that if you think specifically about talking to the wearable, the device will understand and perk up to receive your request.\n\nThis is the new world we're in, with artificially intelligent wearables continuously recording the world around us. Voice assistants\u2014which first landed in speakers and on our phones, but quickly moved to our wrists and faces\u2014at least required active engagement like a tap or a wake word to activate their ability to eavesdrop. But the next wave of hardware assistants, which also includes the forthcoming Friend pendant, can absorb information passively and work in the background. They are always listening.\n\nThe wearable hardware leading this space is often cheap\u2014Bee AI's watch is just $50, and Omi's stick-on bead is $89\u2014but the real magic is in the software, which often requires a subscription as it taps into multiple large language models to analyze your conversations.\n\nBee AI\n\nBee AI's yellow wearable listens to your interactions, then provides text transcripts in a mobile app. Photograph: Tristan deBrauwere\n\nBee AI was founded by Maria de Lourdes Zollo and Ethan Sutin. Both previously worked at Squad (Sutin was the founder), which enabled media screen sharing in video chats so people could remotely watch the same movie or YouTube video together. The company was acquired by X (back when it was called Twitter), and the pair both joined briefly to work on Twitter Spaces. Zollo has previously worked at Tencent and Musical.ly, which subsequently became TikTok.\n\nSutin says he explored the idea of a personal AI assistant back in 2016 when chatbots were all the rage, but the technology wasn't there yet. That's not the case anymore. The company launched its Bee AI platform last February in beta, with an active community providing feedback. It only just began selling its Pioneer hardware a little more than a week ago. (The \u201cBee\u201d name plays with the idea of ambient computing, as if something is buzzing around and taking in information.) You don't need the company's hardware to use Bee AI\u2014you can just interact with the AI via the iPhone app\u2014but Zollo says the wearable offers a richer experience as it can record continuously all day. An Android app is on the way at the end of the month.\n\nThe wearable is simple. It has two microphones for noise isolation, and Sutin says that if you can hear the person you're speaking with in a busy environment, the wearable should be able to hear both parties as well. It can be worn as a band on the wrist or clipped to your shirt. There's an \u201cAction\u201d button in the center; pressing it once mutes the mics, and pressing it again enables them again. You can press and hold the button, and this action is user-configurable, so that can trigger things like processing the current conversation or awakening the \u201cBuzz\u201d AI assistant to ask it a question. (There's no speaker on the wearable, so answers will be spoken out through your phone.) When the mic is muted, there's a red LED. When it's recording, you'd think the green LED would be lit up, but there's nothing to indicate that this wearable is picking up everything around you."

            "article_content": "This story was originally published on CIO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CIO Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEngineers are struggling to develop generative AI tools and applications, according to IBM research published Wednesday. Morning Consult conducted the survey of more than 1,000 U.S.-based enterprise AI developers.\n\nWhile AI developers say high performance, flexibility and ease of use are critical for enterprise tooling, those traits are also the rarest among available solutions, the report found. Engineers often point to the lack of standardization in the development process, difficulty developing ethical lifecycles and the need for customization as the top inhibitors of progress.\n\nEnterprise developers typically use between five and 15 tools to create AI applications. More than 1 in 10 developers leverage 15 or more in the process, and nearly all use coding assistants in some capacity to save time.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDeveloping enterprise-grade generative AI applications is critical for businesses across industries, but tool and tech stack complexities can derail the efforts.\n\nAI developers have only grown in importance since the race to adopt generative AI kicked off more than two years ago. Last year, the role entered the top 10 highest-paid positions for the first time, according to a Stack Overflow survey published in September 2024. Last year, AI developers earned around $160,000 in annual compensation.\n\nWhile AI-specific roles are still relatively new, enterprise interest is palpable. Machine learning and AI engineering positions have grown 27x since 2014, according to a SignalFire report. Comparatively, roles for cloud engineering and DevOps only jumped about three-fold in the same period.\n\nEnterprises have worked to enhance the developer experience and keep employees engaged as their job market prospects proliferate. JPMorgan Chase, for example, focused on simplifying workflows even as the environment became more complex.\n\nThe potential benefits of AI skills have also pushed technology workers to beef up their own AI skills. Demand for prompt engineering courses increased by 456% year over year, according to O\u2019Reilly data.\n\nAs generative AI reshapes existing workflows and job functions, Gartner predicts around 4 in 5 engineers will need to upskill by 2027.\n\nIt\u2019s up to CIOs, who are most often tasked with guiding AI initiatives, to communicate what teams will need to be successful to the C-suite and board of directors as adoption moves forward.\n\n\u201cWe need to be quite realistic about our enterprise\u2019s ability to hire, train or source AI skills,\u201d Tina Nunno, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner, said during a conference in October 2024. \u201cThis has become a particularly sticky area.\u201d"

He does leave things open when cautioning, \"I think it's possible that there are ghosts.\"\n\n\"Energy can't be destroyed,\" adds Hambel, who rhetorically asks, \"When it leaves the body, where does it go?\"\n\n\"There's dimensional elements to it, I think, that maybe we don't comprehend,\" concludes Schuler before embarking on an unnerving ghost hunt.\n\nAbout Paranormal Prison\n\nLoudwire has teamed up with Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents to bring you 12 brand new episodes of Paranormal Prison!\n\nWe invite you and your favorite artists inside Ohio State Reformatory, where Ohio's most violent criminals lost their lives, but some of their souls still remain.\n\nSeason 2 of Paranormal Prison will air each Wednesday at 1PM ET on Loudwire's YouTube channel.\n\nParanormal Prison: Season 2, Episode 9 - Biohazard\n\nIn this episode, the crew explores one of the most haunted areas of the prison \u2014 the attic.\n\nApril 21, 1930, a fire ignited by criminals at the maximum security Ohio Penitentiary killed 322 inmates and hospitalized another 230 in one of the deadliest fires in American prison history.\n\nThe 300 surviving inmates were relocated to Mansfield Ohio State Reformatory and locked in the attic every night for safety, where violence and murder reigned.\n\nClear voices from the other side answer prompts and the Biohazard bandmates later seem convinced that there is paranormal activity running rampant after seeing something that wound up not being there after all...\n\nWatch Episode 9 directly below.\n\nREAD MORE: Rockers Tell Their Wildest Tattoo Stories\n\nAbout Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents\n\nInkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nConstruction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.\n\nFans are already looking forward to the 2025 installment, which takes place July 18, 29 and 20. The lineup, meanwhile, has yet to be announced, creating even more anticipation.\n\nInkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals. Since it's formation in 2011, DWP has become a leading promoter in heavy music and beyond, building up the U.S. festival circuit that dominates the spring, summer and fall months.\n\nThe DWP festival roster also includes Aftershock, Born & Raised, Bourbon & Beyond, Golden Sky Country Music Festival, Louder Than Life, Rocklahoma, Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville.\n\nVisit the Inkcarceration and DWP websites for more information."

            "article_content": "Part of what makes The Sims 4 such an enduring favorite among cozy gamers is that the options for how to play are basically endless. For some, it\u2019s all about Create a Sim, while others spend hours building their dream house in Build Mode. And then, there\u2019s always those generational challenges, carefully crafted a legacy family with specific rules and specifications. But it\u2019s not just Simmers who have endless options in The Sims 4. Their Sims have a true wealth of options when it comes to their chosen career, and some are better than others.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nFor those who have the game fully loaded with Expansion Packs, there are over 50 career options in The Sims 4. While some are part-time ways for teenage Sims to earn a few Simoleons, many are in-depth adventures up the career ladder to the covered Career Level 10. But which Sims 4 careers are the very best? Based on their depth and engagement, these 10 top the list.\n\n1. Reaper\n\nA Reaper gets to work in The Sims 4 Life & Death\n\nExpansion: Life & Death\n\nThe Reaper career is the newest addition to The Sims 4, and it shows. This career brings everything gamers love about Active careers, while polishing up some of the issues that earlier careers bring into play. Starting as a Grimtern and working their way up, Sims in this career field learn to reap souls and comfort the beloved they\u2019ve left behind.\n\nDoes it get a little bit repetitive eventually? Yes. But there are a good variety of daily tasks and showing up to work with The Grim Reaper himself never quite gets old.\n\n2. Detective\n\nClose the case in Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAn oldie but still a goodie, the Detective career was one of the first Active options in The Sims 4. In this job, Sims spend each day collecting clues to solve cases \u2013 with the active help of the big gamer in the sky, of course.\n\nThis is quite an involved career, with players engaged in tasks like visiting crime scenes and interrogating suspects. For those looking to feel involved in their Sims\u2019 career paths, it\u2019s a must.\n\n3. Doctor\n\nScanning patients is part of a day\u2019s work in The Sims 4 doctor career\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAnother entry from the original trio of Active careers is the Doctor role. Starting with patient intake and cleaning a lot of hospital beds, Sims work their way up to diagnosing and treating patients over time.\n\nThe tasks for this career can get repetitive once you reach the higher ranks, but it\u2019s nearly always entertaining. It\u2019s also hard work, with many steps to diagnose each patient before the day is done. Unfortunately, the Doctor career remains glitchy to this day, but that doesn\u2019t fully remove its charm.\n\n4. Freelancer\n\nFreelance candlemaking is a thing in Eco Lifestyle\n\nExpansion: Base Game, with more options from packs like Paranormal Stuff and Eco Lifestyle\n\nJust like in real life, the Freelancer career comes with its pros and minuses in The Sims 4. Your Sim will sign up with a specific agency based on their skills, from becoming a Freelance Writer, Crafter, or Artist down to investigating the Paranormal.\n\nThe Freelancer career can be glitchy, but when it works, it\u2019s very engaging. Sims will accept and complete gigs, with increasingly high-paid options as they successfully finish prior jobs. Ticking off the tasks can keep gamers engaged far more successfully than heading to the office for an Active career.\n\n5. Actor\n\nPut on a show as a Sims 4 actor\n\nExpansion: Get Famous\n\nFor Sims who dream of the spotlight, the Actor career offers an opportunity to rise through the ranks from one-off commercial gigs to their own feature film. Added three years after the initial introduction of Active careers, the Actor profession does away with some of the issues from earlier iterations.\n\nOn-the-job tasks include getting hair and makeup done, getting to know co-stars and the crew, and rehearsing lines before finally filming some scenes. This career offers some flexibility as players can choose which acting gigs their Sim takes on, making it a more dynamic option than straightforward ladder-climbing careers.\n\n6. Interior Decorator\n\nShowing off swatches as a Sims 4 interior decorator\n\nExpansion: Dream Home Decorator\n\nFor those Simmers who spend more time in Build Mode than anywhere else, this is the Active career to go for. As an Interior Decorator, Sims will get to step inside homes around town, remodeling them with new decor and furniture.\n\nThe gameplay for this career involves listening to clients and then getting into the Build Mode nitty gritty to bring them to life. While there isn\u2019t as much variety here as with some other Active careers, it\u2019s a great choice for those who treat The Sims 4 like an interior decorating game anyway.\n\n7. Video Game Streamer\n\nGaming for fun and profit in The Sims 4\n\nExpansion: High School Years\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the inception of it all, but there are few things quite as entertaining as having a Sim get really into gaming. The High School Years expansion added a new part-time career that reflects the reality of streaming as a way to make a living in the modern era.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t as dynamic as an Active career or as in-depth as a full-time profession, the Video Game Streamer job is just a ton of fun. Sims raise that video gaming skill and spend time streaming, earning money through tips from fans and learning the ropes for the Entrepreneurial skill. Whether it\u2019s a gateway to a longer-term Freelance career or your Sim\u2019s supplement during college, this part-time job is one of the best.\n\n8. Culinary\n\nEven home chefs know how to hustle in Sims 4\n\nExpansion: Base Game\n\nSome Simmers are in it for the cooking, as the constant stream of new cooking-centered content for The Sims 4 can attest. The Culinary career has been around from the beginning, but it\u2019s still one of the best thanks to the constant addition of new recipes and ways to prep food.\n\nThe Culinary career isn\u2019t an active one, but players will spend plenty of time cooking or mixing drinks for the daily tasks. With so many recipes to choose from and the recently expanded array of kitchen gadgets, Simmers can really get a lot out of this career even if they\u2019re only with their Sims at home.\n\n9. Business Owner\n\nSell clothes, cupcakes, and more in The Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nOwning a business doesn\u2019t always work as EA intended, but it\u2019s still one of the most interesting ways to deeply engage with the work element of The Sims 4. Sims can own a variety of business lots, from retail to bakeries and food carts and beyond.\n\nRunning these businesses is a full-on process, from buying or building the lot to creating and selling merchandise. Set prices, engage with customers, and get ready to earn\u2026 or not. This way of bringing in Simoleons is a bit like owning a real business and will take over the day-to-day, but some Simmers like it that way.\n\n10. Landlord\n\nCollecting rent in The Sims 4 Landlord career\n\nExpansion: For Rent\n\nOpinions on The Sims 4: For Rent are a bit mixed, but the ability to buy Residential Rentals and become a landlord is one of the best things the game offers. It\u2019s incredibly dynamic, with the ability to fill an owned unit with tenants, create house rules, and more.\n\nAs a Property Manager, players enjoy a variety of interactions that let them engage with their tenants, including asking about the living conditions and evicting them. Notifications will bring in various issues that Sims need to manage in their units, keeping gamers on their toes \u2013 sometimes a little too much."

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

These rocks have the potential to tell us about a period of solar system history not well-preserved on our own planet Earth, and they may record important clues about the early history and habitability of Mars. Witch Hazel Hill first caught my attention during landing site selection several years ago, when we were debating the merits of landing Perseverance in Jezero versus sites outside the crater.

            "article_content": "This story was originally published in the 2024 edition of Discovery magazine, the College of Science's publication. This edition of Discovery celebrated the 20th anniversary of the College of Science.\n\nThe University\u2019s Museum of Natural History is located on the southern end of campus, in a repurposed library space. Visitors are greeted by a mountain lion, looking ready to pounce. The small lobby includes displays about Nevada\u2019s mammals, native bird species, live beetles and reptiles and two live fish exhibits. Visitors that have coordinated a tour with one of the museum\u2019s curators can experience what is arguably the most exciting part of the museum: its scientific collections of over one million biological specimens, mostly held in large metal cabinets behind the exhibit space. The museum may have a modest footprint, but it holds biological treasures of scientific importance and conducts substantial public engagement.\n\nWith three faculty curators and two full-time staff members, education and collections coordinator Cynthia Scholl '08 (biology), '12 M.S. (biology), and herbarium curator Jerry Tiehm '74 (wildlife ecology), '78 M.S. (botany), the museum has an impressive list of accomplishments over the past year, including extensive public outreach. In 2023, the museum hosted over 3,000 visitors, including over 2,000 local schoolchildren.\n\nFor a museum funded primarily by grants and gifts, the director is proud of how far the museum has come in its 10 years on campus.\n\n\"We are small but mighty,\" Beth Leger, foundation professor in the Department of Biology and director of the Museum of Natural History, said.\n\nAn unnatural history\n\nThe Museum of Natural History wasn\u2019t always a part of the University\u2019s strategy, but for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, it was important to have a place that could house and properly maintain the specimens that University students and researchers had collected over the long history of the institution. The museum holds plant and animal collections that date back to the 1850s, but it wasn\u2019t officially established as a museum until 2013.\n\nWhen the Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center was built, it opened up space previously occupied by the life sciences library in the Max C. Fleischmann Building.\n\nLeger, a plant ecologist, was associated with the University\u2019s herbarium at the time and was asked to join a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant review panel about collections. She had the opportunity to learn about other community and university museums and their collections through proposal reviews and conversations with other panelists.\n\n\"And I thought, 'Why don't we have a museum? We should have a museum,'\" Leger said. \"I\u2019m seeing, literally, how it\u2019s done. I\u2019m reading about how other people are doing it, which is exactly what the NSF wants, this cross-pollination.\"\n\nShe asked her colleague Chris Feldman to join her for a cup of coffee, and broached the idea of building a museum. Feldman, a herpetologist who has a museum background, loved the idea, and the two of them got to work putting together a proposal to their respective chairs and deans. Professor Feldman was based in the College of Science\u2019s biology department, and at the time, Leger was based in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Science in the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources (CABNR).\n\nJeff Thompson and Ron Pardini, the respective deans of the College of Science and CABNR at that time, approved and submitted the proposal to University administrators.\n\n\"And not only did they say yes, we could have the space, they also gave us money to renovate,\" Leger said.\n\nShe added that it felt very lucky for all the pieces to fall together as they did.\n\n\"We just happened to have the space, we just happened to have the people, and all this came together in this very beautiful way,\" Leger said.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for what Beth and Chris do,\" Scholl said. \"There\u2019s always been someone working on the collections and trying to safeguard them. And there is a lot of history that we don't know.\"\n\nOne piece of known history near and dear to Scholl\u2019s heart is Fred Ryser, who was faculty at the University from 1958 to 1989. Ryser was one of the museum\u2019s most prolific collectors, having added birds, mammals, fish, plants and butterflies to the collections. Scholl is the cofounder and associate director of the nonprofit Nevada Bugs & Butterflies and has researched butterflies in the Great Basin for years. Ryser\u2019s butterfly collection represents some of the oldest documentation of species found around Reno.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know much about him besides his collection history, but I know I love him,\" Scholl said.\n\nTiehm, the museum\u2019s plant curator, has written a book about Nevada\u2019s plant collectors, which includes many emeritus University faculty.\n\nBiological specimens, which are preserved plants and animals, provide essential teaching and research material that serves as the foundation for a range of biological disciplines, from taxonomy to community ecology. Students and faculty at the University amassed some \"wonderful\" collections of the plants and animals of Nevada and the Great Basin Desert, recording the native biodiversity of the region over the years. Managing all these specimens, however, was not an easy task, and before the establishment of the Museum of Natural History, there was no central plan for oversight of specimens.\n\nThe Dixie Valley toad was discovered by Professor Emeritus Dick Tracy and alumna Michelle Gordon '06 (biology), '17 M.S. (biology).\n\nMaintaining collections is costly and time-consuming, and oftentimes falls on those who collected the specimens in the first place or those who inherited somebody else\u2019s collections. In the late 1980s, research priorities shifted away from studies of individual plants and animals. At the same time, there were a series of faculty retirements in the biology department. The department decided to move all its animal specimens into space in the Nevada Terawatt Facility in Stead. There, the animal collections languished for decades, away from the watchful eyes of faculty or the curious hands of students, while the plant collection was housed in a small room in a University building on Valley Road. Years later, two emeritus biology faculty, Dick Tracy and the late Peter Brussard, brought Feldman out to Stead to see the collections.\n\nHe immediately understood their scientific value, but also their precarious situation. Thousands of fish, amphibians and reptiles were stored in jars of alcohol, hundreds of birds and mammal skins and skulls in cabinets, and thousands of pinned insects in cases. Feldman began to regularly travel to the Terawatt facility so he could top off the jars with ethanol to save the fluid-preserved specimens and manage pests that might damage the dry specimens.\n\nSome of those specimens lie in preservation containers called coffins, which are also used for human cadavers. Leger visited the Terawatt facility with Feldman once and described the random specimens lying in coffins as \"creepy.\"\n\n\"We still have specimens there, some really big things,\" Leger said.\n\nThe College of Science\u2019s other museum curators can relate to the problems the curators of the Museum of Natural History are facing \u2013 there\u2019s no more space.\n\n\"We have literally run out of weird closets at the University,\" Leger said.\n\nThe largest challenge is ethanol collections, which preserve animal specimens in alcohol. Those specimens need to be stored in fire-safe containers, and all buildings have limits on the amount of alcohol they can store for fire safety. Moving the specimens into safe containers has also proven difficult, as many are kept in large glass jars that are no longer made at that size because they\u2019re unstable and prone to cracking. But the challenges faced by the curators don\u2019t deter them from the work.\n\n\"I'm very grateful for what we have,\" Scholl said.\n\nShe acknowledges that while a larger museum space would be ideal, there is still space to teach middle school classes, engage with undergraduates and support researchers. Leger\u2019s main concern is ensuring the museum\u2019s specimens don\u2019t experience a similar fate to those left behind at the Terawatt facility.\n\n\"Collections cannot rest on the enthusiasm of one person, because they last longer than one person's lifespan,\" Leger said.\n\nMuseum curation\n\nFortunately, Leger and Feldman have recruited several additional dedicated curators.\n\n\"We have curators for each section,\" Leger said, including plants, insects and vertebrates.\n\nScholl points out that the way specimens are collected and how collections are maintained can differ by background. Research collections typically have meticulous documentation and are stored to maintain specimens in excellent condition for future genetic analysis. Specimens collected for teaching purposes might not have research or documentation value, but they have outreach value.\n\nWhile the museum does accept collections from outside the University, \"you do not just get something into Jerry\u2019s plant collection without it being perfect,\" Leger said.\n\nTiehm named a new species of ranunculus after Beth Leger. R. legerae is found outside of Elko, hence its common name: Elko Buttercup. (Photo by Jan Nachlinger.)\n\nTiehm\u2019s work is detailed and he maintains a thorough collection of plants, with a focus on Nevada\u2019s flora. Tiehm has spent many years venturing into Nevada\u2019s wilderness and documenting its native plants. He and Jan Nachlinger '85 M.S. (botany), a retired ecologist, have compiled a complete list of Nevada\u2019s native plants, which will be published sometime in the next two years.\n\n\"This information exists nowhere else,\" Leger said.\n\nThe museum\u2019s insect curators include Matt Forister, the Trevor J. McMinn Endowed Professor in Biology and Foundation Professor, and Lee Dyer, Foundation Professor. The museum also receives specimens and identification support from Nevada Bugs and Butterflies, an organization run by Scholl and her husband, Kevin Burls '14 Ph.D. (ecology, evolution and conservation biology).\n\nFeldman is the museum\u2019s curator of vertebrates, including reptiles, mammals and birds. Some of the specimens in the museum were collected before regulations to protect species and limit poaching were established. The museum curators very carefully follow regulations when identifying which specimens to accept into the museum collections. Feldman has worked to establish permits that allow him to accept donations of already-dead animals, like roadkill.\n\nMuseum centers outreach and research\n\nRebounding after the pandemic shutdown, the spring semester of 2024 was the busiest yet, with four to five museum events each week, keeping Scholl busy.\n\n\"The only reason we have an outreach program is because of Cynthia,\" Leger said. \"We do what we think we can succeed at, and what feels good to Cynthia is this very organic science education based on place and local research, which is super unique.\"\n\nScholl curates the museum tours to focus on local natural history or on research being done by faculty at the University.\n\nWith this approach, \"they\u2019re asking the same questions the researchers are,\" Scholl said.\n\n\"In the last few years, I've gotten to involve more undergraduate students in curation,\" Scholl said. \"Some subset of the undergrads have helped with outreach. They really enjoy these unique work opportunities.\"\n\nFunded by a combination of grants and gifts, 14 paid positions were offered to undergraduates in 2023. Scholl added that, in addition to learning curatorial practices, outreach provides an opportunity for undergraduates to practice their science communication skills by simplifying science for, most often, a younger audience. The Museum of Natural History has begun to host larger and larger events, particularly by recruiting graduate student volunteers. Scholl has entire spreadsheets she\u2019s developed to recruit and organize graduate students who want to be involved in outreach.\n\n\"It's really great to have a big enough community that the students who want to do this can,\" Scholl said.\n\nThe museum has also recently started hosting identification workshops. So far, there have been bee, butterfly and plant identification workshops. Attendees include state and federal agency employees, students, hobbyists and other specialists.\n\nGraduate students volunteer at a \"Science Saturday\" event.\n\nThe museum also participates in University recruitment efforts like Nevada Bound and has been a part of many students\u2019 first experiences on campus by hosting lessons for NevadaFIT.\n\n\n\nResearch projects by faculty whose work requires collecting and maintaining specimens also receive support from the museum, and training projects associated with the research grants utilize collections from the Museum of Natural History.\n\n\n\n\"This is why we are critical,\" Leger said. \"We are serving so many of the University\u2019s goals outlined in its strategic plan.\"\n\nOne particularly clever use of the museum\u2019s collections was led by postdoctoral researcher Behnaz Balmaki, who investigated historic butterfly-plant interactions. Balmaki analyzed the types of pollen on the legs of butterflies in the collections and compared that to pollen found on wild-caught butterflies. Some species are extremely particular about the plants they visit, and as some plants become more vulnerable due to climate change, examining how those interactions have shifted over time allows scientists to better understand how butterflies might adapt.\n\nLeger and Scholl are also excited about a collection of aquatic invertebrates that they hope can take up residence near their original home at the University of Nevada, Reno at Lake Tahoe. Along with Aaron Koning, a recent faculty hire in the Department of Biology, they are currently developing a proposal to build an exhibit about the natural history of aquatic insects in and surrounding the lake.\n\nDreaming big\n\nThe museum directors and curators would love to move the collections and public space to the ground floor of a new building one day, in a space that is purposefully built to store the many irreplaceable, priceless treasures in the collection.\n\n\"The University\u2019s biodiversity collections are being cared for like never before but integrating them into an easily accessible space with earthquake and fire protection would be the absolute dream,\" Leger says.\n\nIn the short term, Scholl dreams of funding for school buses to transport students from Title I schools to the museum so there are no barriers for students attending underprivileged schools to learning about Nevada\u2019s natural history.\n\nScholl also emphasized that it can be difficult to help children understand that \"\u2026 these dead things help us protect things in the wild.\" To that end, Scholl would love more outdoor teaching spaces to work with children, where living pollinators and other organisms might visit.\n\n\"We are biologists because we love to be outside, because being in nature is healing, because looking at bees for an hour is extraordinary,\" Scholl said.\n\nFor Leger, the priority is \"dipping the museum\u2019s fingers into as many pies as possible\" to ensure all the museum\u2019s collections don\u2019t end up in some equivalent of the Terawatt facility, after the current batch of curators retire. Leger hopes to work with a donor whose vision for the museum extends as far into the future as hers.\n\n\"The way you codify it is just by becoming inevitable,\" Leger said. \"These collections will last indefinitely if we keep giving them the support they need.\""

            "article_content": "We\u2019re only one week into 2025, but, already, OpenAI is having a tough year. Here is everything that\u2019s gone wrong for the influential company in the last seven days, and a quick look at the potential frustrations and headwinds that it faces as it heads into the new year.\n\nSam Altman\u2019s sister sues him\n\nAnnie Altman, the sister of the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, has sued the executive, accusing him of sexual abuse. The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri on Monday, makes claims that Altman abused his sister when she was three years old and he was 12. The suit claims that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts of sexual assault,\u201d Annie suffered \u201csevere emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression, which is expected to continue into the future.\u201d The suit asks for damages in excess of $75,000, as well as a jury trial.\n\nThe allegations of abuse have circulated the web for over a year and first gained mainstream attention in the days after Altman was controversially ousted from OpenAI (he would later be reinstated). The litigation has obviously pushed the claims to a much wider audience. Were the case to head to trial, it could prove disastrous for OpenAI from a PR perspective.\n\nAltman\u2019s family released a statement Wednesday responding to Annie\u2019s litigation. \u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refused conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d The statement, which Altman shared on X, further characterizes Annie as mentally unwell and financially motivated. It states that though the family has financially supported Annie for years and she \u201ccontinues to demand more money\u201d from them.\n\nA former employee\u2019s family accuses the company of murder\n\nIn recent weeks, the company has also been subjected to conspiracy theories that allege it murdered a former employee. The death of Suchir Balaji on November 26th inspired immediate suspicion, despite the fact that the San Francisco Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has dubbed the death a suicide. That\u2019s because, in the months before his death, Balaji acted as a corporate whistleblower, making claims that the company was breaking U.S. copyright law. Only a few weeks before his death, Balaji penned an online essay in which he claimed to show that the company\u2019s approach to content generation did not fall under the U.S. definition of \u201cfair use.\u201d\n\nWhile police have said that there is \u201cno evidence of foul play\u201d in Balaji\u2019s case, his family has claimed that he was murdered by OpenAI and has demanded that the FBI investigate his death. In an interview with The San Francisco Standard, the Balaji family relayed that they \u201cbelieved their son was murdered at the behest of OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a $100 billion industry that\u2019d be turned upside down by his testimony,\u201d said Poornima Ramarao, his mother. \u201cIt could be a group of people involved, a group of companies, a complete nexus.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy hasn\u2019t been made publicly available yet.\n\nThe Cybertruck bomber allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his attack\n\nTo top things off, it was recently learned that the guy who blew himself up in a Cybertruck outside of Trump Tower used ChatGPT to plot the attack. Las Vegas police recently revealed details to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis is the first incident that I\u2019m aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\u201d said Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill. \u201cIt\u2019s a concerning moment.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly something that OpenAI is going to want to include in its ad copy (\u201cUseful for planning terrorist attacks!\u201d just doesn\u2019t have a great ring to it).\n\nPolitical headwinds\n\nOpenAI doesn\u2019t just face a slew of bizarre, splashy scandals, it also faces the political realities of Trump\u2019s second presidency. Elon Musk, the company\u2019s former founder (and investor) turned worst enemy, notably helped Trump win and is now enjoying unparalleled access to the federal government\u2019s levers of power. At the same time that he\u2019s been dubbed America\u2019s \u201cco-president,\u201d Musk is also waging a legal war on OpenAI that, while having been dubbed \u201cfrivolous\u201d by OpenAI, shows no signs of going anywhere.\n\nThe lawsuit that Musk filed last year alleges that the company has betrayed its original mission in favor of pursuing a for-profit business model (OpenAI did recently announce it would be ditching its original, weird structure to pursue a more traditional business strategy). When last we checked in on that litigation effort last November, Musk had expanded the lawsuit to include other entities close to OpenAI, including its backer, Microsoft.\n\nAt the same time, while Musk is engaged in the legal battle, and may be able to manipulate federal policy in ways that could prove disruptive to OpenAI, he can also leverage the soft power of his media platform, X, to damage the company\u2019s reputation. Indeed, Musk and his affiliates have seized on some of OpenAI\u2019s recent controversies, openly spreading damaging conspiracy theories. The Standard notes that, after Suchir Balaji died, Musk and others close to him helped to spread the conspiracy theories surrounding the coder\u2019s death: \u201cWhen Ramarao (Balaji\u2019s mother) tweeted about hiring the private investigator, Musk replied: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nThe fraught economics of OpenAI\n\nOpenAI\u2019s biggest dilemma may be less political than economic. That is, the massive amounts of money that are being used to prop up the company have left many onlookers wondering: Is OpenAI\u2019s business model even sustainable? Last year, the company self-reported that it lost some $5 billion, while garnering substantially less money in revenue. OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will grow to some $11 billion by the end of this year and will continue to explode exponentially in the years to come.\n\nIndeed, OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will reach $100 billion by the year 2029\u2014a mere four years from now. Granted, as a company, OpenAI has grown at breakneck speed (its revenue jumped 1,700 percent in the space of a year, the New York Times has reported), though skeptics still see its projections as PR fantasies designed to draw in perpetual cash infusions from true believers in the venture capital realm. Blogger Ed Zitron, who has referred to OpenAI as an \u201cunsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company,\u201d notes that the company\u2019s own estimations of its future revenue capacity are \u201cfucking ridiculous.\u201d Firmly repping the doubter camp, Zitron writes:\n\n\u2026the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it\u2019s not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.\n\nZitron notes that OpenAI seems to make a majority of its revenue from subscriptions to ChatGPT, which doesn\u2019t seem to be making enough money to make up for its ongoing losses. OpenAI also makes money by licensing usage of its algorithmic models for use in software products. As it is, it doesn\u2019t matter if their revenue increases if the cost of providing service remains so high. Sure, it could jack up prices, but OpenAI has competitors with deep pockets and similar benchmarks.\n\nIn short: OpenAI has its work cut out for it. Beset by powerful adversaries, ongoing lawsuits, and looming scandals that could prove disastrous for the company\u2019s brand, the company needs to prove that the media hype that carried it through the last few years can actually translate into cold hard dollars and cents. It\u2019s unclear, at this point at least, how it\u2019s going to do that."

            "article_content": "Grain prices have gotten off to a positive start in 2025, continuing the vein of form they found in December.\n\nEuropean prices are seeing the main lift, while UK and US prices have seen some falls. US prices were positive this week.\n\nThe French wheat price for December 2025 was at \u20ac233.75/t on Wednesday afternoon this week. It was relatively steady since the end of last week.\n\nOn 20 December, that price was at \u20ac226.75/t. It increased to \u20ac230.25/t on 27 December and on 3 January moved to \u20ac232.75/t.\n\nThe Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) in the UK is not predicting any big move in prices in the coming months.\n\nCommenting on wheat prices this week, it said: \u201cUnfavourable weather in the US and Russia, plus maize concerns in Argentina, offer support to prices short term.\n\n\u201cBut harvest pressures in the southern hemisphere may limit longer-term price gains.\u201d\n\nMaize prices have remained up in Europe and have gone back up in the US.\n\nHigh maize prices are generally a good thing for grain prices in Ireland, as maize becomes less attractive in animal feed if it is more expensive than wheat or barley.\n\nThere are concerns about the maize crop in Argentina, but a large crop is expected from Brazil so this may offset losses.\n\nFeed barley prices in France had moved up over the Christmas period, but went back down this week to \u20ac202/t in some regions.\n\nThe FOB Creil price for spring malting barley is steady at \u20ac240/t. It looks like there is very little trading happening in that market at present.\n\nOilseed rape\n\nHigh oil prices may be helping rapeseed prices. However, a large soybean crop could affect the rapeseed price. However, hot and dry weather is reported to be damaging soy bean crops in Argentina.\n\nOn 20 December, the November French oilseed rape price was at \u20ac464/t.\n\nIt moved to \u20ac461/t on 27 December, but on 3 January had increased to \u20ac470/t. On Wednesday afternoon this week, it had moved up again to \u20ac477.25/t.\n\nNative prices\n\nAt home, prices have been rising slowly but steadily. In November spot barley was reported around \u20ac220/t to \u20ac225/t.\n\nIn December, it moved to \u20ac230/t and in early January it is now at \u20ac230/t to \u20ac235/t.\n\nSpot wheat is also reported to have increased to \u20ac245/t to \u20ac250/t. November prices are looking similar to these prices.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the AHDB reported a spot barley price of \u00a3201/t on 3 January and a forward price for February of \u00a3204/t. All of these prices are dried unless otherwise stated."

The young bull kill reduced by 11,585 head \u2013 almost a 10% reduction on the 2023 number.\n\nThe bullock kill was back by almost 2% or 12,556 head to 681,377.\n\nThe cow kill took an unexpected lift in 2024 with nitrates issues forcing disposals on some farms, especially in the south of the country.\n\nThe continued decline in the suckler herd also drove numbers. The cow kill finished up 7% or almost up 30,000 head on the 2023 number.\n\nCalf slaughtering dropped by almost 10,000 head in 2024, down 32% on 2023 to just over 20,000 head in 2024.\n\nNumbers of cattle moving north for slaughter have dropped off in recent weeks. There were just over 26,000 cattle exported for direct slaughter in 2024, with the current price differential expected to drive numbers in 2025 as well.\n\nBeef quotes across the water continue to improve, with quotes up 10p to 15p/kg from before Christmas. Some large feeders have been able to get \u00a35.65/kg (\u20ac7.18/kg incl VAT) for in-spec stock this week, which is a big improvement on pre-Christmas quotes. A gap of over \u20ac1/kg remains between the English and Irish beef price.\n\nNI comment\n\nQuotes are on 516p/kg (\u20ac6.51/kg inc VAT) for U3 cattle, although 530p/kg (\u20ac6.69/kg) is widely available as a starting price with 4p to 10p/kg more on offer depending on numbers. Good-quality cows are on 420p to 450p/kg (\u20ac5.30 to \u20ac5.68/kg)."

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "7 Shares Email\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nNorth American venture funding spiked in the final quarter of 2024, closing out an up year for startup investment driven by continued momentum around artificial intelligence, Crunchbase data shows.\n\nAltogether, investors put $61.9 billion into U.S. and Canadian startups at seed through growth stage in the fourth quarter. It was the highest quarterly tally in nearly two years, with the strongest pickup seen at late stage.\n\nFor all of 2024, meanwhile, total investment was just over $184 billion \u2014 up 21% from the prior year.\n\nFor perspective, below we charted out total investment, color-coded by stage, for the past 12 quarters.\n\nThe funding gains were driven by larger average deal sizes rather than a rise in total rounds.\n\nMega-rounds for hot AI companies in particular drove tallies higher. Meanwhile, the number of reported startup financings 1 in Q4 actually declined to the lowest level in years, as charted below.\n\nFunding data for North America reflects what we saw in our global report: Clearly, 2024 was the breakout year for investment in AI companies. This was particularly evident in Q4, with an estimated 62% of all North American startup funding going to companies in the AI space, per Crunchbase data.\n\nBelow, to give a sense of the magnitude of the Q4 AI investment boom, we charted out investment to the space over the past three years.\n\nAs AI unicorns mature, we\u2019re also seeing more funding going into later-stage deals. While late- and growth-stage dealmaking was up markedly in Q4, early- and seed-stage dealmaking was flat to down.\n\nLooking at exits, that other all-important measure of startup investment success, the picture is also mixed. While the past quarter wasn\u2019t phenomenal on this front, we did see some large acquisitions and successful IPOs involving venture-backed companies. Given the huge pipeline of current and onetime unicorns, the hope is that 2025 will bring more of a pickup in exit activity.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at investment by stage as well as noteworthy exits for Q4.\n\nTable of contents\n\nLate stage and technology growth\n\nWe\u2019ll start with late- and technology growth-stage, since that\u2019s where most of the money goes.\n\nThis was particularly the case in Q4, with $45.9 billion going to investment at this stage \u2014 nearly three-fourths of all startup funding. Although deal counts were fairly flat, total investment hit the highest point of the year by far, as charted below.\n\nFor the full year, just over $107 billion went to late- and growth-stage dealmaking. That\u2019s an increase of more than 25% from the 2023 total of $85 billion.\n\nFor Q4 2024, roughly half of funding at this stage went to just three companies: cloud data platform Databricks and generative AI startups OpenAI and xAI. Databricks landed a $10 billion round, while OpenAI and xAI picked up $6.6 billion and $6 billion, respectively.\n\nTrailing behind was Anthropic, known for its AI chatbot Claude, which pulled in a $4 billion November financing backed by Amazon.\n\nEarly stage\n\nEarly stage dealmaking was more muted in Q4, with $13 billion in total investment, per Crunchbase data. It was the lowest quarterly tally of the year for both investment and deal count, as charted below.\n\nEven as total investment dipped, however, some giant deals still got done. At Series A, the largest round of the quarter went to Silicon Valley fusion power startup Pacific Fusion, which secured $900 million in an October financing.\n\nAfter that, artificial intelligence companies dominated among the largest funding recipients. This included Poolside, an AI platform for writing code that picked up a $500 million Series B, and Physical Intelligence, a developer of foundational models with robotics applications that landed a $400 million Series A.\n\nSeed stage\n\nReported seed-stage investment declined in Q4, with total funding estimated at $3.1 billion. That\u2019s a slight decline from the prior quarter, and the lowest seed funding total in years.\n\nDeal counts for the quarter also declined to a multiyear low, while the average round size increased some. For a bigger picture view, we charted out round and investment totals at seed for the past five quarters below.\n\nOverall, what we\u2019re seeing at seed stage provides a bearish contrast to the overall startup investment numbers across stages, which look pretty robust. It seems the trend among startup backers of late is to pile into companies with established momentum, with more risk aversion toward brand-new upstarts.\n\nThat said, we did see some exceptionally large seed rounds, many of them focused around \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 artificial intelligence. For instance, Toronto-based Moonvalley, a startup founded in 2023 focused on cinematic AI applications, picked up $70 million in November. And /dev/agents, a San Francisco startup focused on building an operating system for AI agents, pulled in $56 million.\n\nExits\n\nAs for exits, while it wasn\u2019t the most rollicking quarter, we did see some large public market debuts and acquisitions.\n\nIPOs\n\nIn the IPO arena, there was no major pickup in public offerings to close out the year. However, we did see one much-anticipated unicorn debut as ServiceTitan, a platform for home services providers, began trading on Nasdaq in December and was recently valued around $9 billion.\n\nAutonomous driving technology developer Pony.ai delivered the second-biggest IPO of the quarter, snagging a market cap around $5.5 billion.\n\nSeveral biotech and healthcare companies also made their debuts, including Upstream Bio, a developer of asthma treatments, Ceribell, focused on EEG technology, and CAMP4 Therapeutics, a developer of therapeutics to restore gene expression.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nWe also saw some good-sized acquisitions in Q4, particularly in the healthcare area.\n\nIn the largest startup M&A deal of the quarter, Carebridge, a Nashville, Tennessee-based home health provider, was acquired for $2.7 billion by Elevance Health. Runner-up was pharma giant AbbVie\u2019s $1.4 billion purchase of Aliada Therapeutics, a developer of therapies for diseases of the central nervous system.\n\nAnother pharma deal that could eventually yield a large payout is Merck\u2019s acquisition of brain cancer treatment developer Modifi Bio for $30 million upfront and up to $1.3 billion in milestone-based payments.\n\nAs for tech, two standout deals were ADP\u2019s acquisition of workforce management software provider WorkForce Software for $1.2 billion, and Stripe\u2019s purchase of stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion.\n\nBelow, we charted eight notable deals of the quarter.\n\nAdieu, 2024\n\nAs we bid adieu to 2024, those of us who make a living spotting trends amid mountains of data can feel grateful that this year was pretty straightforward. The big, overarching startup investment trend of the year was, of course, AI. That\u2019s where the lion\u2019s share of funding went, and, in the final quarter of the year, investor enthusiasm for the space only intensified.\n\nSo, will 2025 bring us more of the same? By some measures, likely yes.\n\nFor instance, there\u2019s no indication yet that startup investors intend to back away from AI. And given the high cost of building and scaling transformative companies in the space, we\u2019ll likely see continued appetite for mega-sized rounds.\n\nIn other areas of startup investment, however, we could see some winds of change in the new year. A resurgence in well-received IPO activity would certainly be a welcome development. It\u2019d also be nice to get a rebound for some of the less AI-adjacent startup sectors for which investment remains far, far below peak levels.\n\nRelated reading\n\nMethodology\n\nThis report covers funding to U.S.- and Canada-based startups. Mexico is included in our Latin America venture funding reports.\n\nThe data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of Jan. 3, 2025.\n\nNote that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.\n\nPlease note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.\n\nGlossary of funding terms\n\nSeed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.\n\nEarly-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.\n\nLate-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the \u201cSeries [Letter]\u201d naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.\n\nTechnology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a \u201cventure\u201d round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman"

            "article_content": "We\u2019re only one week into 2025, but, already, OpenAI is having a tough year. Here is everything that\u2019s gone wrong for the influential company in the last seven days, and a quick look at the potential frustrations and headwinds that it faces as it heads into the new year.\n\nSam Altman\u2019s sister sues him\n\nAnnie Altman, the sister of the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, has sued the executive, accusing him of sexual abuse. The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri on Monday, makes claims that Altman abused his sister when she was three years old and he was 12. The suit claims that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts of sexual assault,\u201d Annie suffered \u201csevere emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression, which is expected to continue into the future.\u201d The suit asks for damages in excess of $75,000, as well as a jury trial.\n\nThe allegations of abuse have circulated the web for over a year and first gained mainstream attention in the days after Altman was controversially ousted from OpenAI (he would later be reinstated). The litigation has obviously pushed the claims to a much wider audience. Were the case to head to trial, it could prove disastrous for OpenAI from a PR perspective.\n\nAltman\u2019s family released a statement Wednesday responding to Annie\u2019s litigation. \u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refused conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d The statement, which Altman shared on X, further characterizes Annie as mentally unwell and financially motivated. It states that though the family has financially supported Annie for years and she \u201ccontinues to demand more money\u201d from them.\n\nA former employee\u2019s family accuses the company of murder\n\nIn recent weeks, the company has also been subjected to conspiracy theories that allege it murdered a former employee. The death of Suchir Balaji on November 26th inspired immediate suspicion, despite the fact that the San Francisco Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has dubbed the death a suicide. That\u2019s because, in the months before his death, Balaji acted as a corporate whistleblower, making claims that the company was breaking U.S. copyright law. Only a few weeks before his death, Balaji penned an online essay in which he claimed to show that the company\u2019s approach to content generation did not fall under the U.S. definition of \u201cfair use.\u201d\n\nWhile police have said that there is \u201cno evidence of foul play\u201d in Balaji\u2019s case, his family has claimed that he was murdered by OpenAI and has demanded that the FBI investigate his death. In an interview with The San Francisco Standard, the Balaji family relayed that they \u201cbelieved their son was murdered at the behest of OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a $100 billion industry that\u2019d be turned upside down by his testimony,\u201d said Poornima Ramarao, his mother. \u201cIt could be a group of people involved, a group of companies, a complete nexus.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy hasn\u2019t been made publicly available yet.\n\nThe Cybertruck bomber allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his attack\n\nTo top things off, it was recently learned that the guy who blew himself up in a Cybertruck outside of Trump Tower used ChatGPT to plot the attack. Las Vegas police recently revealed details to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis is the first incident that I\u2019m aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\u201d said Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill. \u201cIt\u2019s a concerning moment.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly something that OpenAI is going to want to include in its ad copy (\u201cUseful for planning terrorist attacks!\u201d just doesn\u2019t have a great ring to it).\n\nPolitical headwinds\n\nOpenAI doesn\u2019t just face a slew of bizarre, splashy scandals, it also faces the political realities of Trump\u2019s second presidency. Elon Musk, the company\u2019s former founder (and investor) turned worst enemy, notably helped Trump win and is now enjoying unparalleled access to the federal government\u2019s levers of power. At the same time that he\u2019s been dubbed America\u2019s \u201cco-president,\u201d Musk is also waging a legal war on OpenAI that, while having been dubbed \u201cfrivolous\u201d by OpenAI, shows no signs of going anywhere.\n\nThe lawsuit that Musk filed last year alleges that the company has betrayed its original mission in favor of pursuing a for-profit business model (OpenAI did recently announce it would be ditching its original, weird structure to pursue a more traditional business strategy). When last we checked in on that litigation effort last November, Musk had expanded the lawsuit to include other entities close to OpenAI, including its backer, Microsoft.\n\nAt the same time, while Musk is engaged in the legal battle, and may be able to manipulate federal policy in ways that could prove disruptive to OpenAI, he can also leverage the soft power of his media platform, X, to damage the company\u2019s reputation. Indeed, Musk and his affiliates have seized on some of OpenAI\u2019s recent controversies, openly spreading damaging conspiracy theories. The Standard notes that, after Suchir Balaji died, Musk and others close to him helped to spread the conspiracy theories surrounding the coder\u2019s death: \u201cWhen Ramarao (Balaji\u2019s mother) tweeted about hiring the private investigator, Musk replied: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nThe fraught economics of OpenAI\n\nOpenAI\u2019s biggest dilemma may be less political than economic. That is, the massive amounts of money that are being used to prop up the company have left many onlookers wondering: Is OpenAI\u2019s business model even sustainable? Last year, the company self-reported that it lost some $5 billion, while garnering substantially less money in revenue. OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will grow to some $11 billion by the end of this year and will continue to explode exponentially in the years to come.\n\nIndeed, OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will reach $100 billion by the year 2029\u2014a mere four years from now. Granted, as a company, OpenAI has grown at breakneck speed (its revenue jumped 1,700 percent in the space of a year, the New York Times has reported), though skeptics still see its projections as PR fantasies designed to draw in perpetual cash infusions from true believers in the venture capital realm. Blogger Ed Zitron, who has referred to OpenAI as an \u201cunsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company,\u201d notes that the company\u2019s own estimations of its future revenue capacity are \u201cfucking ridiculous.\u201d Firmly repping the doubter camp, Zitron writes:\n\n\u2026the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it\u2019s not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.\n\nZitron notes that OpenAI seems to make a majority of its revenue from subscriptions to ChatGPT, which doesn\u2019t seem to be making enough money to make up for its ongoing losses. OpenAI also makes money by licensing usage of its algorithmic models for use in software products. As it is, it doesn\u2019t matter if their revenue increases if the cost of providing service remains so high. Sure, it could jack up prices, but OpenAI has competitors with deep pockets and similar benchmarks.\n\nIn short: OpenAI has its work cut out for it. Beset by powerful adversaries, ongoing lawsuits, and looming scandals that could prove disastrous for the company\u2019s brand, the company needs to prove that the media hype that carried it through the last few years can actually translate into cold hard dollars and cents. It\u2019s unclear, at this point at least, how it\u2019s going to do that."

            "article_content": "The war between Russia and Ukraine has become a major geopolitical crisis of the 21st century. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, numerous countries, including the US, UK, EU, Australia, Canada, and Japan, have imposed over 19,535 sanctions against Russia. Their primary focus has been on Russia's financial resources. Approximately half of its total reserves\u2014amounting to $350 billion\u2014were frozen, impacting its foreign currency reserves. According to the EU, approximately 70 percent of the assets of Russian banks were frozen by a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.\n\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine has undoubtedly influenced the relationship between Moscow and its allies. Following the imposition of sanctions on Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a significant swing towards China, signing a series of agreements. The impact of this war was not only on Western and Russian relations but also on Russia's close allies. In this regard, Central Asian countries are now forced to strike a difficult balance between their long-standing relations with Russia and other large powers. While the region has historically relied on Russia for economic and security relationships, the protracted conflict has produced new challenges and possibilities, prompting these countries to pursue a more assertive but cautious foreign policy. At the same time, this upheaval and Russia's dependence on China create a golden opportunity for China to strengthen its ties with Central Asia.\n\nThough, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the five Central Asian countries have gained more political and economic independence. Historically, the Central Asian Republics (CARs)\u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan\u2014have always viewed Russia as a guarantor of security for internal stability and protection against foreign threats. Since their independence from the Soviet Union, Central Asian countries have faced a difficult transition from a common Soviet history to divergent nation-building and economic liberalisation pathways. The five Central Asian states are part of one or more Russian-led organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and the Eurasian Economic Union. These institutions provide forums for regional security and economic partnership with Russia, allowing Russia to maintain a substantial influence in Central Asia's geopolitical landscape. For example, in 2021, when the Taliban reclaimed control in Afghanistan, Russia stationed military equipment on the Tajik-Afghan border as part of the CSTO and conducted joint military drills with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan within 20 kilometres from the Afghan border. This exhibition aims to demonstrate Russia's military readiness in its own backyard in the event of an attack on Central Asia by the Taliban or other terrorist outfits. Similarly, in January 2022, Moscow dispatched soldiers from the CSTO to quash unrest in Kazakhstan.\n\nEconomically, Central Asia also depended on Russia. Moscow's energy and trade participation in the region was intended to lock the governments into a vital dependency, giving the Kremlin control over their internal and foreign policy decisions. For example, Kazakhstan exports 80 percent of its oil through the Caspian oil pipeline, which passes through Russian territory. The number of economic migrants who go to Russia for work is relatively high compared to other migrant workers worldwide. For example, approximately nine million Central Asians live and work in Russia, and practically every major city relies on their labour. According to a June 2022 report by the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM), remittances from Russia to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan accounted for 31 percent and 27 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2020. The majority of this money is expected to come from their employees in Russia. In 2021, remittances from Russia accounted for 55 percent of total transfers to Uzbekistan and 51 percent to Kazakhstan.\n\nHowever, the CARs' internal unrest, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and growing concerns about sovereignty have forced Central Asian nations to look for new allies for long-term security cooperation and are diversifying their foreign policy in an effort to reduce Moscow's influence. Furthermore, Western sanctions on Russia led the CARs to seek alternate channels to sell commodities to the world market. Therefore, CARs have responded to the altering geopolitical landscape in a variety of ways, including preserving economic links with Russia, avoiding outright criticism of Moscow, and increasing partnerships with other global powers such as China, the West, and Turkey.\n\nSince the beginning of the Russian-Ukraine war, Central Asian leaders have also been at the forefront of the so-called \"multi-vector\" foreign policy approach, aiming for balanced relations with Russia as well as other countries such as China, the West, and Turkey. The states of the region refused to accept Russia's recently seized areas in Ukraine, and some issued public declarations in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity in the early days of the 2022 war.\n\nNonetheless, these powers did not openly condemn Vladimir Putin and his \"special military operation.\" Various factors are at play here, including economic reliance, Central Asian immigration, and membership in Russia-led institutions.\n\nMoreover, according to polls, the majority of Central Asians\u201470 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 55 percent in Kazakhstan, and 30 percent in Uzbekistan\u2014ascribe the regions current economic difficulties to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The popularity of the Russian language is declining, entertainment venues are refusing to host Russian performers, and there have been multiple anti-war protests in Almaty and Bishkek. Russia has blocked Central Asian media sites for attempting to provide unbiased coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. The public conversation has returned to the topic of decolonisation.\n\nOn the other hand, Central Asia is a strategically important region for China due to its abundant resources, transit links, and shared border, which are vital for China's security. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) underscores its interest in the region, leveraging growing unease and Russia's focus on Ukraine. Central Asian nations increasingly rely on China for both security and economic resources, potentially challenging Russian dominance and jeopardising Moscow's security interests. Despite a recent decline in historical hostility between the two sides, Russia believes that China's increasing economy might soon enable it to contest Moscow's geopolitical sway in Central Asia.\n\nNotably, China is assisting the CARs in strengthening their security and law enforcement capabilities by capitalising on their worries about Russia. During his visit to Central Asia in September 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that he supported Kazakhstan's territorial integrity in light of these exceptional circumstances. When Xi called the China-Central Asia Summit to order in Xi'an in May 2023, he emphasised the significance of the security, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the CARs. In the midst of the intensifying powerplay among the world's strongest nations, Beijing is taking big measures to expand its regional influence in order to counter the US's encirclement of China.\n\nChina is still dedicated to its long-standing regional objectives. With over half of China's trade and investment going to Kazakhstan, Beijing sees the country as its main economic partner in Central Asia. China's economic interests are further supported by the transportation opportunities that have emerged since Russia's invasion.\n\nBeijing is becoming increasingly interested in playing the role of a security supplier in the region due to its rising concerns about the unrest in Afghanistan and Central Asia. This development may cause future difficulties with Moscow. China-Central Asia's security cooperation has already been strengthened by BRI efforts. More robust security allies like China could undermine Russia's position as the principal security guarantor. China's growing influence in Central Asia after the invasion presents a challenge to Moscow's dominance, potentially altering the dynamics of security cooperation and posing future complications for Moscow.\n\nMd Tariqul Islam Tanvir is Erasmus scholar in the International Master in Central & East European, Russian & Eurasian Studies programme at the University of Glasgow.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nWe welcome your contributions and analysis of global events, and responses to our articles.

They litter the Old Testament and the New; once you start seeing them, you can\u2019t stop.\n\nA modern example of a short chiasm would be If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Jesus makes a pithy chiastic statement in Mark 2:27: \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily. Email* Sign Up This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Thanks for signing up. Please click here to see all our newsletters. Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nBut most chiastic structures are longer than one line, sometimes stretching across entire chapters, with a hinge point in the middle. Westerners are accustomed to a conclusion landing at the end, like the moral of the story or the punchline of a joke, but the ancient Near Eastern mind liked to embed the main idea dead center.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognize this structure as we read Scripture, from the Psalms to the words of Jesus, we risk placing the emphasis on the wrong point. As a Bible teacher, I see how chiasms honor the truism that repetition is the mother of learning. Chiasms are memory aids, God\u2019s kindness to past generations of worshipers who likely never held Scripture in their hands as well as to modern Christians in our distracted age. They are meant to help us remember.\n\nModern readers may wonder why this particular form of parallelism appealed so heavily to the ancient Near Eastern mind. I certainly did\u2014that is, until my mother died.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to take me to this appointment.\u201d I looked over at my diminutive 79-year-old mother, perched in the passenger seat, eyes apologetic, fretting with her purse.\n\nLike many in her generation, my mom found it difficult to accept even help that was easy to supply. \u201cYou are a person to love, not a problem to solve\u201d had become my mantra to her each time she expressed dismay at having interrupted my life in any way.\n\nBefore you begin to assume that my mother and I had an enviable relationship, let me say we did not\u2014but through much hard work, we found a real sweetness together in her final years. In December of 2021, her kids and grandkids moved her into an apartment five minutes from my home. We set up her antique furniture, hung her favorite pictures, and put out her favorite vase, the one with wisteria around the rim. I was excited to be able to drop in or run errands for her so easily.\n\nI planned a family dinner for her 80th birthday that January. Three days before it, she texted that she had a stomach bug and wasn\u2019t sure she would make it. She assured me she was fine. Please don\u2019t come over. But she was sicker than she thought.\n\nHer birthday passed in the ICU, and a week later she was placed on palliative care, coming home to my house for hospice. No more beeping monitors and sterile overhead lights. No more masks and visitor restrictions. Instead, a room flooded with sunshine, warm with color, and filled with loved ones.\n\nShe was, at this point, no longer communicative. But I knew if she could have spoken, she would have repeated the words she had strained to say again and again during her brief hospital stay: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to be a burden.\u201d\n\nMy brothers and I took our place at her bedside to keep a vigil familiar to many reading this. We listened as her breathing became more and more labored with each passing day. We witnessed the hard work of dying.\n\nOn the second day, the hospice nurse told me, \u201cYou know, you can coach her. Give her encouragement. Tell her she\u2019s doing well.\u201d I played her favorite hymns. I held her hand. I helped keep her clean and comfortable. I whispered a thousand times, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home. You\u2019re a person to love, not a problem to solve.\u201d\n\nAt last, she reached the end of her travail. A final deep exhale, a crashing silence.\n\nAnd it hit me: the marvelous and terrible symmetry of a long human life.\n\nEighty years earlier, hadn\u2019t she entered this world in a similar way\u2014through a great labor, with a deep inhale and a piercing wail? Had she not received much the same care in the hours after her birth that we provided in the hours before her death?\n\nI suspect the reason the ancients loved a chiasm was because it is the recognizable shape of the sweep of life. Perhaps God, in his kindness, designed it to be such. Bookends. Repetition. Symmetry.\n\nI reasoned that the other concentric layers of a human life could be mapped as well. Every human life is unique, but what might be the general pattern? I sketched out my thoughts.\n\nThe chiasm of a human life. The idea is not unique to me. I recall the saying that we are first children to our parents, then parents to our children, then parents to our parents, and finally children to our children.\n\nIf life is a chiasm, and if chiasms teach, what does the chiasm of life seek to teach us? If we become students of it, I believe it can \u201cteach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom\u201d (Ps. 90:12).\n\nRemembering that seasons of life follow a patterned order helps us inhabit the season we are in and prioritize how to use the time we are given. Since death announced its presence in Genesis 3, our days have been numbered. Perhaps God, in his infinite kindness, gave us a chiasm, a patterned measuring rod, to number those days rightly.\n\nKnowing that aging means the relinquishing of freedoms and abilities helps us embrace that process rather than hold onto self-reliance. It helps us to anticipate the next season, to savor the one we are in, and to be grateful for the ones we have already left behind.\n\nRecognizing that in some seasons we give care and in some we receive care helps us accept care when it\u2019s our turn to receive. We are not problems to solve in our extreme age any more than we were in our infancy. We are simply people to love, in a stage when others repay a debt of care they themselves received in their time.\n\nThe chiastic structure of life explains why we feel such shock when a life is cut short. We expect intuitively that human life should make a full arc. The asymmetry of a young or untimely death creates dissonance. No bookend. No parallel. No full circle. My mother\u2019s death was a good one by many measures, not least because of its blessed symmetry.\n\nBut if a chiasm puts the main point at the middle, how are our middle years noteworthy? Midlife offers a unique opportunity, a moment of perspective at the crossroads. If we have paid close attention to how we entered the chiasm, we will be better able to exit it with grace and submission. Looking back over the first half of life can help us anticipate the second half\u2014in both its losses and its gains.\n\nIf we focus just on our abilities and responsibilities, we see only gains in the first half of the chiasm of life and only parallel losses in the second. In a culture that values youth and vigor, we risk losing sight of what we learn over the years: wisdom. The wisdom of aging means that even as our bodies increasingly fail us, our internal lives grow richer and steadier. Bodies decline, but people develop.\n\nAt 55, I can already track the decline in my physical abilities. I am still in a stage where I am the supplier of help to others, but if the Lord grants me length of years, I will one day be only a recipient\u2014fed and clothed and cared for by someone else\u2019s hands and feet.\n\nThe days in which my body can yield help to others are numbered, and I want to number them rightly. My parents have helped me with the math. Watching them pass into old age has brought into focus for me the preciousness of the years I have left. My earliest caregivers have moved to receiving care. Their physical abilities grow more limited, but their insights are deepening.\n\nThey are the evidence to me that, while failing joints and heart valves and eyesight and hearing may increasingly unsteady our bodies, wisdom increasingly steadies our souls. Bodies decline, people develop. The lamp of wisdom burns brighter as the oil of life experience grows in supply.\n\nFor the believer, old age is an invitation toward burgeoning luminosity.\n\nIn my attic is a relic of days gone by: a cassette player my husband owned as a teen. In the living room is another relic\u2014the vase with wisteria trim. My mother\u2019s, passed on to me. It\u2019s not of enormous value, but unlike its electronic upstairs neighbor, its value is steadily growing with age.\n\nHere is where we bump into the problem with the way our culture views not just aging but also the elderly. My husband, Jeff, and I are affectionately called \u201cthe Olds\u201d by our kids, who thankfully still seek our advice and who regard us as a source of wisdom obtained through length of years. But our children are increasingly the exception.\n\nSo many cultural shifts have happened in so little time that many parents and children are estranged by their differing views. Whereas one\u2019s elders used to be seen as those increasing in wisdom with every passing year, they are now likely to be seen as increasingly obsolete (\u201cOkay, boomer\u201d). Less like a vase, more like a cassette player.\n\nWhen I listen to my 84-year-old father\u2019s advice, it occurs to me that he always waits patiently for me to end my question before responding. At 55, I often sit with a younger person to hear about their difficulty in marriage, parenting, or ministry; recognize a familiar pattern a few minutes into the telling; and, at the right moment, offer the same advice I have given on similar occasions.\n\nWe have a way of hitting the same roadblocks. If I have acquired a modest level of wisdom in middle age, how much more does my father hold at 84? There is godly wisdom, a gift God grants, but there is also the wisdom of age\u2014gained by sheer length of years and attention to those around us.\n\nThe wisdom of age is the basis for the fifth commandment\u2019s requirement to honor father and mother, a command given not to children, as we often assume, but to adults. (Note that the commands following it deal with the very adult sins of murder, adultery, theft, bearing false witness, and covetousness.)\n\nThe fifth commandment is intended to instruct adult children to show honor to elderly parents. The Puritans interpret correctly its greater implications in the Westminster Catechism, noting that it included showing honor to all who are our superiors in age and experience.\n\nPut succinctly: Honor the Olds. They know some things you don\u2019t. Their bodies are declining, but their personhood is ever developing. We can miss this so easily. I once heard a woman in her 30s gently reminding an audience of younger women that \u201colder Christian women are still valuable in the church.\u201d In accordance with the fifth commandment, I would offer a slightly altered wording. Those older than us are not still valuable. They are, rather, increasingly valuable.\n\nIn a culture that fetishizes youth and views aging as a journey into irrelevance and uselessness, God\u2019s family takes the view that people possess an ever-developing value, one that renders their contributions essential and indispensable.\n\nOur elders have much to offer us\u2014until they reach the stage in the chiasm of life when they don\u2019t. At some point, old age will take from them even the ability to think or communicate. And yet, they will still teach us. Aging requires a fortitude like nothing else. Caring for the aged grants unforeseen blessings to the younger generation. Those who hold the hand of the dying learn secrets to make them wise. They learn that the elderly are not an obligation but a sacred trust. My mother was luminous in her dying.\n\nThe grand symmetry of the human life can yield wisdom if we give it our attention. We move from the helplessness of birth to seasons of growth and possibility under the watchful care of our parents. We become caregivers to our children, then to our parents. We watch growth and possibility turn to decline and limited ability in our own lives. We return to helplessness. And we leave this life much as we entered. How kind of the Lord to give us a roadmap for aging until our last enemy, death, is defeated.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the lie that the first half of life is to be clung to. When we behold the arc from beginning to end, we learn to value all of it. We learn not just to number our days but to cherish them\u2014the days of our youth, the days of our twilight, and all the days in between.\n\nDon\u2019t let a youth-obsessed culture rob you of your sense of the value of all parts of life. We need our aging faces and slowing bodies to tell us the truth: that time is passing, and that it is exceedingly precious. Each season yields its own exquisite fruit. No need to cling to what was never meant to last. God is faithful in every season.\n\nJen Wilkin is an author, Bible teacher, and cohost of the Knowing Faith podcast."

            "article_content": "UCLA\n\nKey takeaways Computational microscopy has rapidly advanced in the last quarter-century, enabling researchers to visualize the extremely small and ultrafast by applying advanced algorithms to interpret scattering patterns of photons and electrons.\n\nUCLA physicist John Miao played a pioneering role in developing the foundational method that has defined and propelled this transformative field.\n\nIn a rare single-author review article, Miao provides the first comprehensive survey of computational microscopy and potential for future advancements such as determining the three-dimensional atomic structures of small but important elements including carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.\n\nIn 1999, then-graduate student Jianwei \"John\" Miao and his colleagues at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, demonstrated that a computational algorithm, combined with patterns of scattered photons, could reveal miniscule details previously impossible to capture with conventional microscopes.\n\nBuilding on an established method for determining atomic structures called X-ray crystallography, they expanded its application to structures that lack the uniform, repeating patterns found in crystals. The algorithm reconstructs images from diffraction patterns \u2014 the arrangement of electromagnetic beams after they are bent and scattered as they pass through samples. This technique diverges from traditional microscopy by combining diffraction and computation to effectively replace the objective lens.\n\nIf you imagine microscopes as computer hardware, Miao's approach is the \"killer app\" that unlocks their full potential. Over the past 25 years, scientists have integrated this approach into different types of microscopes, driving the field of computational microscopy to achieve unparalleled resolution and precision, and to capture the broadest fields of view yet on samples under investigation. These advances have led to brand-new insights into the structure and behavior of catalysts, superconductors, computer chips and next-generation batteries and materials.\n\nMiao, a professor of physics and astronomy in the UCLA College, has authored the first comprehensive review of computational microscopy. Published in Nature \u2014 a top journal that rarely features such single-author reviews \u2014 his article highlights innovative developments in the field, showcases multidisciplinary applications and outlines future directions.\n\nFor him, the quest to uncover fundamental knowledge through advances in microscopy reflects the philosophy of one of his favorite thinkers, the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza.\n\n\"Spinoza found ultimate happiness in discovering truth in nature,\" said Miao, who is a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. \"That philosophy is always on my mind. Each of us has only one life to live, and I am committed to seeking truth and addressing profound scientific problems.\"\n\nIn most forms of microscopy \u2014 whether using visible light, X-rays, electrons or other types of radiation \u2014 the waves in the beam interact as they pass through a sample. These waves can interfere out-of-phase, canceling each other out, or in-phase, amplifying their intensity.\n\nThe key to computational microscopy lies in unlocking phase information, which provides a far richer representation of a sample than intensity measurements alone. However, phase cannot be measured directly. Miao's method broke new ground by extracting phase information from diffraction patterns with an iterative computational algorithm. This algorithm alternates hundreds to thousands of times between analyzing a sample and analyzing the waves used to probe it.\n\nHis review article focuses on two closely related computational microscopy methods: coherent diffractive imaging, or CDI, and ptychography (with a silent \"p\" at the front).\n\nCDI uses a highly synchronized coherent beam to analyze a single diffraction pattern, enabling it to capture events occurring in millionths of a billionth of a second. Building on the foundation of CDI, modern ptychography was introduced in 2007, utilizing an iterative computational algorithm to reconstruct images from multiple overlapping diffraction measurements. Although slower than CDI, ptychography produces minute detail across a larger field of view and can correct for imperfections in the beam.\n\nBeyond detailing advancements in the techniques themselves, the review highlights new frontiers opened by computational microscopy, with applications spanning a wide range of scientific disciplines.\n\nResearchers have used CDI and ptychography to reveal intricate biological structures, capture magnetic and quantum phenomena on ultrafast timescales and conduct three-dimensional, nondestructive inspections of cutting-edge microchips. These techniques also enable real-time observation of future-generation batteries as they charge. In his own research, Miao adapted this algorithmic approach for advanced electron microscopes without examining diffraction to achieve a breakthrough: the first three-dimensional atomic mapping of amorphous materials, which lack the orderly, repeating structures typical of crystals.\n\nMiao expects that the expanding reach and versatility of computational microscopy will lead to significantly more breakthroughs. He and other researchers are investigating how artificial intelligence can accelerate the extraction of phase information from diffraction patterns, aiming to provide scientists real-time views of the phenomena they study. Miao also expects\n\ncomputational microscopy advancing to determine the three-dimensional atomic structures of high-tech materials, including elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which have traditionally been difficult to image at the single-atom level.\n\n\"Physics, chemistry, materials science, nanoscience, geology, applied mathematics, engineering, life sciences \u2014 every field stands to benefit,\" Miao said. \"The future is cross-disciplinary. Nature itself doesn't separate scientific disciplines; the best way to truth is to follow nature.\"\n\nIn the review, Miao acknowledges support from the National Science Foundation \u2014 including from STROBE, an NSF Science and Technology Center for which he serves as deputy director \u2014 the Department of Energy, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the U.S. Army Research Office."

            "article_content": "The world has lost a monumental figure in the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Reflecting on his incredible legacy, I am drawn to the enduring partnership between President Carter and my grandfather, Norman Borlaug. These two visionaries combined their dedication, ingenuity, and compassion to combat one of humanity\u2019s most significant challenges: hunger.\n\nNorman Borlaug, often called the Father of the Green Revolution, devoted his life to improving agricultural productivity and bringing modern farming practices to developing countries. President Carter became a champion for ending hunger and poverty with his deep commitment to human rights and his post-presidency focus on global health and development.\n\nTheir collaboration wasn\u2019t just about science or politics but humanity. Their partnership was rooted in a shared belief that no one should go hungry in a world of abundance.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, when famine ravaged parts of Africa, my grandfather worked tirelessly to bring new wheat and rice varieties to regions where traditional crops failed. President Carter provided critical support through the Carter Center, mobilized resources, and displayed political will to ensure these innovations reached the most needed people. Together, they proved that food insecurity was not an inevitable consequence of geography or poverty\u2014it was a solvable problem.\n\nOne of their most notable collaborations occurred in Africa, where they focused on improving agricultural practices in some of the most challenging environments.\n\nMy grandfather\u2019s scientific breakthroughs in plant genetics provided drought-resistant and high-yield crops. At the same time, President Carter\u2019s leadership ensured that the infrastructure, training, and political stability necessary for sustainable agriculture were implemented. The Carter's dedication to alleviating hunger complemented my grandfather\u2019s mission, creating a partnership that turned hope into tangible results.\n\nHowever, their partnership went beyond technical solutions. It was about empowering people. President Carter and my grandfather believed that the accurate measure of success wasn\u2019t in the number of fields planted or bushels harvested but in the lives transformed. Farmers who could now feed their families, communities that became self-sufficient, and children who no longer went to bed hungry were their most significant achievements.\n\nPresident Carter often spoke about the moral imperative to act, once saying, \u201cThe bond of our common humanity is stronger than the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices.\u201d My grandfather shared this belief, reminding the world that \u201cyou can\u2019t build a peaceful world on empty stomachs and human misery.\u201d Together, they demonstrated that science, policy, and compassion are a powerful trio in the fight against hunger.\n\nAs we celebrate President Carter\u2019s life, let us remember his political achievements and honor the partnerships that exemplified his post-presidency work. His collaboration with my grandfather is a testament to what is possible when individuals unite to address the world\u2019s most pressing challenges, regardless of their backgrounds.\n\nToday, the fight against hunger is far from over. Climate change, conflict, and inequality continue to threaten food security for millions. Yet, the legacy of President Carter and Norman Borlaug reminds us that progress is possible. Their partnership proves we can overcome even the most daunting obstacles by combining innovation with compassion and action with determination.\n\nAs I think about the shared legacy of these two extraordinary men, I am filled with both pride and responsibility. Pride in the work they accomplished together and the lives they changed, and an obligation to carry their mission forward. It is up to all of us to continue their work and ensure that every person has access to the most basic human rights: food.\n\nThank you, President Carter, for your unwavering belief in humanity and partnership with my grandfather. The seeds you both planted\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014continue to grow, feeding both bodies and spirits worldwide. Your legacy will endure in the annals of history and the fields and hearts of those whose lives you touched.\n\nRest in peace, and thank you for showing us what it means to lead with purpose, humility, and hope.\n\nJulie Borlaug is the granddaughter of Norman Borlaug."
