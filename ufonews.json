        "article_content": "Watch live! 2nd UFO hearing held by US congress, witnesses include fmr. miltary - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs this week, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You'll be able to watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

        "article_content": "Gemini is Google\u2019s most important product right now, with Google baking its genAI chatbot into as many products as it can. The Pixel 9 served as the key piece of hardware to showcase several new Gemini capabilities, including Gemini Live functionality. That\u2019s the equivalent of OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, which makes the AI sound like a real human.\n\nBut Google isn\u2019t happy rolling out Gemini to as many Android devices as possible. It\u2019s also targeting the iPhone, a potentially lucrative market for Google when it comes to its AI ambitions.\n\nRumors already say that Apple will soon offer chatbot choices to iPhone users by integrating Google Gemini into Apple Intelligence alongside ChatGPT. The latter will get a period of exclusivity since it\u2019s Apple\u2019s preferred partner for the launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhether or not Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, Google is testing another way to make Gemini available to iPhone users. The company rolled out a standalone Google Gemini app in some test markets, complete with Gemini Live functionality.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAn iPhone user posted screenshots on Reddit that prove the Google Gemini app for iPhone is legitimate. According to 9to5Google, the app is available in the Philippines, but you can\u2019t download it from the App Store in the US. I could not find a version of the app in the EU, but then again, the European block is never among the first regions to receive any new AI app.\n\nApp Store listing for the Google Gemini app. Image source: Reddit\n\nThe advantage of having a standalone Gemini app for iPhone is that you can talk to the chatbot directly without going through the iPhone\u2019s Google app. That\u2019s currenty the only way to access Google Gemini on iPhone without loading the chatbot in a browser. Gemini Live is not available in the Google app.\n\nHaving Gemini Live baked into a standalone Gemini app is even better. I got access to Advanced Voice Mode recently inside the ChatGPT app for iPhone, and it was an interesting experience. The smartphone is probably the place to talk to AI via voice rather than text prompts.\n\nGoogle Gemini app installed on an iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nGoogle will take advantage of the iPhone\u2019s Live Activity feature to let you talk to Gemini Live even when the screen is off or when you\u2019re using the iPhone for something else. ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode works similarly on the iPhone.\n\nAlso, if Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, it won\u2019t be available on most current iPhones. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series support Apple Intelligence. A standalone Google Gemini app would help fix that potential problem.\n\nGemini Live functionality in the Google Gemini app for iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Google will launch the Gemini app on iPhone, but it\u2019s probably only a matter of time until it happens. Apparently, Google started testing the standalone app only about a week ago."

        "article_content": "Quantum AI New York emerged on the scene in 2022 and is known as a pioneer in quantum computing that has a significant impact on the trading sector. It is a trading robot that is a dream come true for trading noobs who have zero knowledge of this field but still wish to earn bucks! Recently, Quantum AI New York began to penetrate New York as well, and the good news is that \u2013 it has some great reviews! One reason that has made Quantum AI South New York\u2019s app so successful is its easy-to-use interface. Not only New Yorkans but also traders worldwide are tempted by this trading bot. However, there\u2019s always a hidden downside to everything that looks appealing. Likewise, this app has its own share of drawbacks as well. To find out more, stay with us till the end of the blog.\n\nExplore the Quantum AI app\n\nWhat Is The Core Function Of Quantum AI New York?\n\nQuantum AI New York is a trading bot that offers CFD training to its users. Through this bot, users can easily set their parameters, decide their stop-loss limits or even allow the algorithm to trade on their behalf. Quantum AI in New York is on the boom because of its ability to deliver trustworthy results. However, the app claims a 90% win rate, while this has not been independently verified.\n\nHow Does Quantum AI Functions?\n\nIt uses quantum computing, which helps the bot process multiple signals at a time and make quick decisions that involve the least risk.\n\nWhat Sets Quantum AI Apart From Quantum AI Trading?\n\nIf you skim through Quantum AI New York app reviews, you\u2019ll find people confused over Quantum AI and Quantum AI trading. They both are mistaken as one, while both terms have different meanings.\n\nQuantum AI is a tech firm, located in UK and launched in 2022. It is known as a pioneer in the quantum computing space and provides assistance to everyday traders.\n\nMeanwhile, Quantum AI Trading is something different. It is the company\u2019s flagship investment robot. It combines quantum computing, machine learning and AI to evaluate crypto market data in the best ways and fetch accurate data, resulting in perfect execution.\n\nHow To Get Started With Quantum AI?\n\nQuantum AI in New York is believed to be very hard to use. However, that\u2019s not the case. Getting started with Quantum AI is super easy. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\nVisit the Quantum AI website and provide the required information.\n\nExplore the Quantum AI app\n\nVerify the information and log in.\n\nDeposit Funds as per your budget.\n\nPick your desired trading asset.\n\nAdjust your Quantum AI parameters and begin trading.\n\nQuantum AI Trading Platform Cost\n\nNot only does Quantum AI in New York charge a one-time fee, but throughout the world, users are expected to pay a one-time fee of $250 only. This fee unlocks live trading features, and they can begin trading. The app uses the deposited amount for trading purposes on your behalf.\n\nYou can pay on the platform using the following methods:\n\nCredit card Debit card Bank transfer\n\nWhat Assets And Products Can Be Used In Quantum AI For Trading?\n\nBe it the Quantum AI New York app or anywhere in the world; this trading bot offers many assets. Just bear in mind that you will not be the owner of the coins but have the contract for the value.\n\nLeverage Trading Options:\n\nUnder leveraged trading, also called margin trading, brokers lend a certain sum of money to the traders, and the traders use the lent money along with their own investment to trade. The expected profit is high in this type of trading, but the risk of loss shouldn\u2019t be neglected.\n\nOnce the trading process is completed, the trader pays the broker back the amount and keeps profits for themselves. This type of trading is only recommended to traders who can afford to pay back the money in case of loss.\n\nRegulated trading platforms may offer margin trading, but the offered margins won\u2019t be equal to bots or unregulated brokers.\n\nQuantum AI Availability\n\nEvery country has its own set of rules and regulations for trading and cryptocurrencies. Although automated trading is ruling the world, some countries still do not accept this trading bot. Countries like Canada, New York and Australia have huge acceptance of this app. And now, Quantum AI New York has also accepted this app.\n\nDeleting The Quantum AI Account\n\nDeleting a Quantum AI account is a simple process. You simply need to go to the bot\u2019s menu and head to the settings command. This will initiate the process. You may also request that their connected broker delete the account. However, we recommend the traders get in touch with their support team before deleting the account. That\u2019s because newbie traders usually face a brick wall, and they give up when their issue is resolvable. Also, note that deleting your account means you will lose your data connected with the bot and the broker.\n\nWithdrawing Money From Quantum AI\n\nGetting your funds from Quantum AI is an easy process. Usually, brokers are connected to the platform, and they store your trading funds; hence, transactions occur through the broker\u2019s platform. Here\u2019s a quick glimpse of the withdrawing process from Quantum AI:\n\nVisit the broker who is associated with the trading app\n\nLog into your trading account\n\nGo to your wallet and pick the preferred payment method\n\nEnter the amount you wish to withdraw\n\nClick the withdraw button, and the broker will transfer the funds to your selected account within 24 hours\n\nExplore the Quantum AI app\n\nIs It Easy To Use Quantum AI App?\n\nQuantum AI app in New York and worldwide is known for its automated features and streamlined user interface, which makes the app user-friendly for beginner traders as well. The app keeps every setting idealised so the users can begin trading as soon as they sign up on the app. However, depending on the user\u2019s preference, the user can adjust parameters and stop-loss limits.\n\nThe best part about this app is that users do not need to understand the market themselves to begin trading on this bot. That\u2019s because this app is a demo trading option. So you, as a new user, can discover features and learn the ropes of trading without investing your money. The available charts can help you see all assets on the dashboard.\n\nHow Much Profit Can We Earn Through Quantum AI?\n\nThis platform claims to offer income opportunities to users by trading crypto. Since Quantum AI in New York and worldwide is considered one of the most updated trading apps, one can easily earn through the bot\u2019s ability to gauge trends in the market and execute trades as per the situation.\n\nHowever, it is recommended to keep your expectations as low as possible because the Quantum AI app works by analysing the market trends. Although it does have a positive history, it might also fail to surpass certain expectations. It is important to risk as little money as you can because losses are bound to occur in trading.\n\nSome Important Features Of Quantum AI Trading Platform\n\nSkim through some unmatched features offered by Quantum AI in New York and worldwide:\n\nCFD Assets\n\nThis trading bot offers uncountable CFD assets. Users can find these assets on their dashboard used for trade.\n\nAutomated Trading\n\nThis app is the best solution for traders who have no knowledge about trading or are not tech-savvy. The app executes the trade itself most of the time.\n\nSmart Decision\n\nConsidering Quantum AI New York app reviews, it is noticed that the bot has helped many traders to witness successful trading. However, it might be repetitive to mention that losses are unavoidable in trading.\n\nDemo Trading\n\nIf you want to see how the trading works without risking your money, you can use its demo feature. This feature enables the users to practice the app\u2019s functions without any risk. Once the user is familiar with the functions, they can switch to their normal account.\n\nLegitimacy Of Quantum AI\n\nThe app has gained popularity in New York and worldwide. However, we can not be 100% confident when it comes to the app\u2019s legitimacy. The risk is always involved in trading bots and nothing can overcome that. But, if we specifically talk about this bot, then there are a few things that make the app questionable. For example, the app says that Elon Musk endorsed it. However, Elon Musk later clarified that he has no affiliation with this app.\n\nA few people claim this app to be a scam because of social media users expressing their anger over fraudulent experiences. However, no perfect conclusion could be given to the claims because those rants were not posted by any independent verifier,\n\nWhat else makes this app questionable is that there\u2019s no security information available on its website. It becomes a little difficult to verify that if the website is protected against antivirus or not. Plus, there\u2019s no sign of SSL encryption, making users doubtful about their information security. The bot mentions that it shares information with third parties. Therefore, if you wish to keep your information safe and secure, you can try out other similar platforms.\n\nRisks Associated With Quantum AI App\n\nThe only major downside of this online trading bot is that despite all the perks, a few\n\nHowever, while Quantum AI is easy to use, many traders will not make money. Trading bots are unreliable and risky; there is also no way of knowing whether they are placing trades that have a chance of making money. If you still want to use the Quantum AI trading system, always set stop-loss limits so you don\u2019t lose too much money\n\nConclusion \u2013 Quantum AI Review\n\nQuantum AI is one of the popular trading bots! You\u2019ll always find positive words if you skim through Quantum AI New York reviews or testimonials by traders worldwide. However, the only risk associated with Quantum AI is that it uses a bot to analyse the trends and trade on your behalf. Just in case if things don\u2019t go favorable, you will have no one accountable. Other than that, the app has great potential to enter new markets as well, as it is already thriving due to the profits it has earned to traders."

        "article_content": "One of the most gorgeous, uniquely animated paranormal series from 2020 has finally returned after nearly five years with a second season. Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, based on the original manga by creative duo Aidaro has finally returned to continue Hanako and Nene\u2019s misadventures dealing with iconic school ghost\u2019s from Japanese urban legends after leaving audiences holding their collective breath when Season 1 ended. The new trailer shows what appears to be a significant improvement in animation quality, and hints at some of the major events that take place in the manga\u2019s Clock Keepers and Picture Perfect story arcs. The new season could also finally adapt the Young Exorcist story arc, which, in the timeline of the series, should have been in the anime\u2019s first season.\n\nStudio Lerche will be returning to animate Season 2, with Youhei Fukui (My Hero Academia Season 2, Bakugan: Evolutions) set to direct the series. The main cast will remain the same as it was in the first season, with Masayoshi Oishi (Overlord) providing vocals for the series\u2019 new opening song while ANCHOR composes the main theme.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nLerche\n\nToilet-Bound Hanako-kun Offers Anime Fans Everything They Could Want From the Supernatural\n\nMuch like the action-packed supernatural anime Dandadan, Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun puts a unique spin on classic Japanese folk stories by spinning them to fit the story\u2019s specific world-building and situation. The series primarily follows Nene Yashiro, a first-year high school student who wants nothing more than for her crush to return her feelings. To try and win his heart, Nene unwittingly participates in an occult ritual that causes her to become afflicted by the Mermaid Curse. Not wanting to be turned into a literal fish, Nene makes a deal with the ghostly spirit Hanako to prevent her from turning into a fish \u2013 given that she doesn\u2019t become submerged in water. To repay him, Nene is forced to become Hanako\u2019s assistant and help him spread rumors and stories about different supernatural beings residing within the school.\n\nToilet-Bound Hanako-Kun has something for everyone. In addition to an intriguing supernatural mystery that effortlessly builds itself up over time, the series has a visually unique and striking art style that makes it easy to get drawn into each paranormal entity Nene and Hanako investigate. Plus, just beneath the surface of the series core narrative, there\u2019s loads of character development and angst that gets explored in a staunch, brutally human way. The series truly has something for anime fans from every corner of the community, and with the new season dropping in January 2025, there\u2019s no better time to get caught up with Season 1 to prepare for the paranormal ride of a lifetime."

For geothermal power to be generated from them, water would need to pass through \"fractures\" to reach a supercritical state of more than 750 degrees Fahrenheit, as Interesting Engineering explained.\n\nShould we be digging into the ground to find new energy sources?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nHowever, as the release noted, superdeep rocks are already under immense pressure and heat, making them more ductile, or flexible, like Silly Putty. Because of this, researchers were skeptical that the rocks could form or maintain fractures for the water to move through.\n\nNow, the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) team's findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, have confirmed previous theoretical work detailed in Geothermal Energy: fractures in these superdeep, superhot rocks are possible.\n\nThis knowledge may pave a path toward low-cost energy that can be part of the transition away from polluting dirty fuels driving the overheating of the planet. Moreover, the power would be abundant \u2014 \"roughly five to 10 times the energy produced by today's commercial geothermal wells,\" per a 2021 Clean Air Task Force report cited in the release.\n\n\"We have shown that the brittle-to-ductile transition is not a cutoff for fluid circulation in the crust, which is promising for the exploitation of deep geothermal reservoirs,\" said research lead Marie Violay, head of EPFL's Laboratory of Experimental Rock Mechanics. \"These are among the first experimental results that shed light on such extreme conditions.\"\n\nAccording to the release, Quaise Energy helped fund the study, along with Alta Rock Energy, the European Research Council, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.\n\nQuaise, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is among the forward-thinking companies investing in geothermal solutions, with its developmental gyrotron drills possibly providing a way to access abundant, renewable power in more than 90% of the world.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

The gadget is equipped with cameras to capture photos and videos and supports voice interactions powered by Ernie.\n\nThe company is not aiming to create a \"super app\" based on AI, Li said, signalling a divergence in strategy from other companies such as ByteDance, which has launched multiple standalone AI apps this year.\n\nBaidu also introduced Miaoda, which utilizes its LLM capabilities to generate code, allowing users to develop software applications without extensive coding expertise."

The investigation centers on FSD\u2019s ability to perform in \u201crelatively common\u201d reduced visibility conditions, such as sun glare, fog, and airborne dust.\n\nIn these instances, it appears that \u201cthe driver may not be aware that he or she is responsible\u201d to make appropriate operational selections, or \u201cfully understand\u201d the nuances of the system, NHTSA said.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTesla\u2019s X (Twitter) account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Gregory Magno, the NHTSA\u2019s vehicle defects chief investigator, wrote to Tesla in an email.\n\nThe postings, which included reposted YouTube videos, may encourage viewers to see FSD-supervised as a \u201cRobotaxi\u201d instead of a partially automated, driver-assist system that requires \u201cpersistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno said.\n\nIn one of a number of Tesla posts on X, the social media platform owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a driver was seen using FSD to reach a hospital while undergoing a heart attack. In another post, a driver said he had used FSD for a 50-minute ride home. Meanwhile, third-party comments on the posts promoted the advantages of using FSD while under the influence of alcohol or when tired, NHTSA said.\n\nTesla\u2019s official website also promotes conflicting messaging on the capabilities of the FSD software, the regulator said.\n\nNHTSA has requested that Tesla revisit its communications to ensure its messaging remains consistent with FSD\u2019s approved instructions, namely that the software provides only a driver assist/support system requiring drivers to remain vigilant and maintain constant readiness to intervene in driving.\n\nTesla last month unveiled the Cybercab, an autonomous-driving EV with no steering wheel or pedals. The vehicle has been promoted as a robotaxi, a self-driving vehicle operated as part of a ride-paying service, such as the one already offered by Alphabet-owned Waymo.\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology has remained under the scrutiny of regulators. FSD relies on multiple onboard cameras to feed machine-learning models that, in turn, help the car make decisions based on what it sees.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo\u2019s technology relies on premapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar (a laser-light radar), which might be very costly, but has met the approval of safety regulators."
