        "article_content": "Taylor Community Library will host a talk by renowned UFO researcher and author Raymond Szymanski on Oct. 16. As an acclaimed expert in UFO investigations, Szymanski will share experiences with his deep dives into extraterrestrial phenomena, bolstered by his 40-year career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB).\n\nHis talk, \u201cNot \u2018Swamp Gas\u2019: The True Story of the 1966 Michigan UFOs,\u201d will offer Szymanski\u2019s perspective on one of the most significant UFO waves in American history\u2014the 1966 Dexter-Hillsdale sightings.\n\nSzymanski\u2019s journey into UFO research began at WPAFB, a base infamous for its alleged connection to extraterrestrial activity, including the 1947 Roswell incident.\n\n\u201cIn my first week there in 1973, as a co-op student, my mentor asked me, \u2018Have you heard about our aliens?\u2019 That\u2019s when I thought, \u2018Whoa, what kind of special place did I land in?\u2019\u201d Szymanski said. His initial exposure to rumors of alien connections at WPAFB sparked a lifelong passion for uncovering the truth.\n\nOver his four decades at WPAFB, Szymanski honed his investigative skills and built a network of colleagues that granted him rare access to information related to UFO activity.\n\n\u201cYou gain a lot of confidence over years of working, and the network gives you an instant pass,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the information I had gleaned while working there, I started doing some serious field research. I didn\u2019t care if I found evidence for or against it\u2014I just wanted to find the truth.\u201d\n\nThis meticulous, logical approach laid the foundation for his books, including \u201cFifty Shades of Greys,\u201d \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret Truth,\u201d and \u201cSwamp Gas My Ass.\u201d\n\nThe Dexter UFO Incident of 1966\n\nSzymanski\u2019s upcoming talk at Taylor Community Library will focus on the Dexter UFO sightings of March 20, 1966, an event that left an indelible mark on southeastern Michigan. UFO sightings surged across the region during this period, and the Dexter-Hillsdale incidents were among the most widely reported. Police officers, residents, and even military personnel filed official reports describing flying saucers with capabilities far beyond earthly technology.\n\nSzymanski will explore these events in detail, offering new insights based on his research for his book Swamp Gas My Ass. One of the critical elements of this investigation involves first-hand accounts from witnesses like Connie Bell, who encountered a UFO near Peach Mountain. Szymanski recorded her testimony, where she described seeing a craft with flashing red and white lights\u2014an encounter that has only been shared once publicly. Szymanski will share the audio testimony during his library talk.\n\nHe said the Dexter case was particularly significant because of the credibility of the witnesses.\n\n\u201cBefore the night was over, 12 police officers were running through the property, chasing these lights,\u201d Szymanski said, adding that in a different sighting that night, a patrolman observed an object hovering over his car for 10 to 15 minutes, joined by three other objects before they all disappeared together. The consistency of these accounts adds weight to the mystery, and Szymanski aims to shed light on how authorities systematically minimized such reports at the time.\n\nWright-Patterson\u2019s alien lore\n\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base has long been rumored to be a focal point for alien research, particularly in connection with the 1947 Roswell crash.\n\n\u201cAliens who supposedly crashed near Roswell, along with their ship, have been said to be stored in a Wright-Patt hangar,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cOver the years, stories about secret projects like Project Blue Book, a government investigation into UFO sightings, have fueled speculation that WPAFB harbors the remains of extraterrestrial craft and even bodies.\u201d\n\nSzymanski\u2019s experience at WPAFB allowed him to conduct direct field research to investigate the truth behind these rumors.\n\nHe said the recent shift in governmental attitudes toward UFOs, marked by the June 2021 release of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s UAP report, has further validated his decades of research. Szymanski views this document as one of the most important developments in UFO history.\n\n\u201cIt confirmed three key things: these are real physical objects, they present a flight hazard, and they are potentially a national security issue,\u201d he said.\n\nA future of ongoing exploration\n\nAs UFO sightings continue to rise globally and the possibility of extraterrestrial life becomes more accepted, Szymanski remains at the forefront of UFO research. The UFO phenomenon, once relegated to the fringes of science, is now gaining mainstream recognition, with individuals from all walks of life eager to share their experiences.\n\n\u201cPeople want to tell their stories,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the stigma of reporting sightings lessens, non-stop, people are coming forward more and more, saying, \u2018I know I\u2019m not crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn addition to his UFO investigations, Szymanski is also working on other projects, including a book on metal detecting and possibly publishing hundreds of stories shared by everyday citizens about their UFO encounters. His presentation at Taylor Public Library offers a rare opportunity to hear directly from one of the most knowledgeable experts on UFO activity in the United States.\n\nEvent details\n\nRaymond Szymanski\u2019s presentation, titled Not Swamp Gas: The True Story of the 1966 Michigan UFOs, will take place on Oct.16 at 6 p.m. at the Taylor Community Library, located at 12303 Pardee Rd, Taylor. The event is free, but registration is required. Szymanski will also hold a book signing after the talk, offering autographed copies of his Alien Shades of Greys trilogy.

Their seats rise and fall as needed, so awkward \u2018did you leave the seat up?\u2019 arguments aren\u2019t necessary. Their water jets can clean you at incredibly precise angles and on cold days, your freezing body will relish the preheated seat\u2019s toasty-warm mode.\n\nThese designs are so hospitable and intelligent that whenever I\u2019m back in Japan, I immediately think: the toilets here are infinitely smarter than I am. I\u2019m not even downplaying my IQ levels \u2013 it\u2019s quite easy to be outwitted by their many functions. I once accidentally activated the alarm in a fancy tofu restaurant in Ginza, because the \u2018I\u2019m in trouble!\u2019 button looked like the flush.\n\nThe futuristic, glowing restroom at Ebusi Station by Kashiwa Sato, part of The Tokyo Toilet project. Credit: Satoshi Nagare/The Nippon Foundation\n\nI\u2019m not alone in worshipping these restroom designs either: during a ramen-eating bender in Japan (documented for Lucky Peach magazine), American chef David Chang threw up in the alley by choice because he had too much respect for Japanese toilets.\n\nCompared to Australia, where options merely run from \u2018half flush\u2019 to \u2018full flush\u2019, Japanese designs are impressive. Even a basic model is noteworthy. The toilet in my friend\u2019s tiny Tokyo apartment, for instance, was space-saving and eco-friendly: the sink replaced the top of the cistern, so each flush triggered a hand-washing gush of water that cleverly filled the tank below."

        "article_content": "If you\u2019re looking to pick up one of the best phones on the market for your next upgrade, and you\u2019ve settled on Android as the mobile operating system you want to go with. In that case, you\u2019ll probably want to get one or two Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy handsets on your shortlist.\n\nAlthough there are plenty of other fine Android phones\u2014made by OnePlus, Motorola, Nothing, and several others\u2014Google and Samsung are the most high-profile Android device makers outside of China. Of course, the Android you get on Pixels isn\u2019t quite the same as the Android you get on Galaxys, which is what we\u2019ll take a closer look at here.\n\nWe\u2019re going to compare the Pixel experience to the Samsung experience ahead of the rollout of Android 15 and One UI 7 (which won\u2019t change a huge amount). We\u2019re also going to ignore the hardware in this particular article\u2014which processor such-and-such handset has or how many cameras\u2014for a more straightforward head-to-head comparison.\n\nPixel vs Galaxy: Interface and customization\n\nThere\u2019s not much to choose between Pixels and Galaxys regarding the basics of home screens and app drawers: Android being Android, you can customize the home screens extensively with widgets and wallpapers (and even install a new launcher). Both phones let you tweak the home screen grid size, but only Samsung lets you remove the Google search bar from the home screen.\n\nBoth phones support gesture navigation or the old three-button navigation, and Google Discover is just one swipe to the left of the home screens. You can also organize apps into folders, rotate the home screen into landscape or portrait mode, display badges on notifications, and more.\n\nThere are a few differences. For example, Pixels have their own custom at-a-glance home screen widget showing the weather, calendar events, and more (you can sort of emulate this on a Galaxy, but not quite). They can also show a row of suggested apps on the home screen and the app drawer based on what you use most often.\n\nSamsung, meanwhile, has a few more built-in widget options than Google, including a date countdown for the calendar and a system widget showing memory and storage usage. It also offers the option of the Edge Panel, a pane that pops out from the side of the screen and holds your favorite apps for easy access.\n\nThe Edge Panel is an example of what Samsung Galaxy phones do really well: It gives you a ton of options and features to play around with. You get more choices when it comes to font styles and color modes on Galaxy phones, whereas Pixel phones tend to be a little simpler and more minimal across the interface and the settings screens.\n\nBoth Pixel phones and Galaxy phones give you a wide choice of built-in wallpapers, of course (as well as the option to use AI to create new ones), while both phones also let you set the color palette based on the wallpaper (or on any other color combination you like). Overall, you\u2019ll find a Pixel preferable if you prefer simplicity with some clever touches and a Galaxy preferable if you want as many options and features as possible.\n\nPixel vs Galaxy: Built-in apps and features\n\nGoogle has some of the best mobile apps in the business: Gmail, Google Keep, Google Chrome, Google Maps, Google Docs, YouTube, and the like. It\u2019s difficult to argue that the Samsung alternatives are better than these apps, but you get them all on Galaxy phones as well, and they all work in the same way.\n\nIf you\u2019re spending all your time inside Google apps, you could argue that Galaxy phones have too much in the way of bloatware on them\u2014but you can quickly uninstall apps like Samsung Health, Samsung Internet, Samsung Calendar, and Samsung Notes without too much trouble. There are some you can\u2019t install as well, though, such as the Galaxy Store, Samsung Contacts, and the Samsung Gallery.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with preferring the Samsung apps and going with them instead (and you can install some, like Samsung Internet, on any Android phone). If you\u2019ve got a Samsung laptop and a Samsung smartwatch, then you may want to stick with the Samsung options. If you\u2019re all in on the Google ecosystem, you\u2019ll probably want to go for the pure Pixel experience.\n\nPixels does have a few exclusive tricks: These include the Call Screen feature, which makes Google Assistant screen calls for you and helps you avoid scams and spam, and the new Pixel Screenshots app, which is exclusive to the Pixel 9 series and helps surface information from your screenshots. There\u2019s also the excellent Pixel Recorder app for turning spoken text into transcribed text, but Samsung has its version in the form of Voice Recorder.\n\nOn the Samsung side, Galaxy phones let you control the volume of individual apps separately\u2014something you can\u2019t do on a Pixel phone. They also have a Modes and Routines section built right into Settings, which means it\u2019s easier on a Samsung phone to set up helpful automation (like customizing the power-saving settings based on where you are or the time of day). Then there\u2019s Samsung DeX, which lets you use your phone as a desktop OS via a keyboard and monitor.\n\nWe should also mention Android updates: Google is in charge of the whole Android project, so it\u2019s no surprise that Pixels get major and minor updates before Galaxy phones do, as Samsung needs to get everything tweaked and aligned with its One UI code. If you want Android updates before anyone else, that\u2019s a reason to go for a Pixel.\n\nPixel vs Galaxy: On-board AI tricks and tools\n\nThere\u2019s now a pile of AI stuff on both Pixel phones and Galaxy phones\u2014and your mileage may vary as to how helpful it all is. Both these handset series support Circle to Search, for instance, and its ever-growing suite of capabilities (you may remember the feature launched on the Galaxy S24 before any Pixel phone, in fact).\n\nPixels have long impressed in terms of their photo and video processing, even with limited hardware. You could argue they\u2019re the best on the market in this respect: Night Sight for low light photography, Audio Magic Eraser for wiping out background sounds from video, Magic Eraser for removing objects from photos, Astrophotography for capturing the night sky, and so on.\n\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned some of the other Pixel AI features and tools above, but there\u2019s also Now Playing\u2014which identifies all the songs you come into earshot of automatically in the background\u2014and the ever-improving capabilities of the Gemini assistant (which is easy enough to install on Galaxy phones too).\n\nTop-end Galaxy phones have also been given a bunch of AI functionality recently: Tools for summarizing notes, webpages, and documents, translating between languages, turning sketches into works of art, and moving around (or erasing) objects and people in pictures. There\u2019s already a lot under the Galaxy AI umbrella, with more to come.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of overlap between AI and apps here, and indeed a lot of overlap between Pixels and Galaxys\u2014a lot of the AI tricks on Samsung phones are powered by the Gemini model that Google develops. Based on the most recent noise coming from Samsung, it won\u2019t forget about Bixby either, even if it\u2019s not really in the conversation as far as generative AI goes.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to read and take in, and we still haven\u2019t covered everything that makes Pixel phones and Galaxy phones different. If you\u2019ve got your reasons for preferring one over the other\u2014and if you\u2019ve settled on one of these options after trying both out extensively\u2014then let us know in the comments."

        "article_content": "San Diego is believed to be packed with paranormal prowlers all year round, from a ghostly ship crew whose love for their ship persists through death to a grizzly old beast that lurks in the woods.\n\nGrab a flashlight and creep into the spooky spirit by exploring the following reportedly haunted locations.\n\nBerkeley Steam Ferry Boat\n\nThe Berkeley Steam Ferry Boat first operated in the late 1800s on the San Francisco Bay, and played a large role in rescuing citizens in a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in 1906. Today it serves as a hub for the Maritime Museum of San Diego, housing offices, a research library and more. Multiple former passengers are believed to haunt the boat today, one of whom is miner John Norbom, who died in an onboard explosion in 1911. There have been reports of the bathroom stalls, where the explosion took place, locking themselves, and some visitors claim to have seen a ghostly figure dressed in a fedora and coat looming around the ship. Earthquake victims and others who were injured in the explosion are believed to roam the boat, evidenced by reports of mysterious slamming doors and disappearing objects. 1492 N. Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nCosmopolitan Hotel and restaurant\n\nOriginally designed as a home for cattle rancher Don Juan Bandini, the Cosmopolitan Hotel is said to have seen a few friendly apparitions. When Bandini\u2019s youngest daughter, Ysidora, leaned too far over the home\u2019s second-floor balcony railing and fell, it\u2019s believed that she was saved by Colonel Cave Johnson Couts, who caught her below. The two supposedly married soon after, but Ysidora\u2019s ghost is said to linger in room 11 of the hotel, where she once lived. There have also been sightings of an apparition of a cat roaming the hallways. Both are reported to be playful and friendly. 2660 Calhoun St., San Diego\n\nDavis-Horton House\n\nFormerly known as the William Heath Davis house, the Davis-Horton house was built in 1850, making it the oldest surviving structure in San Diego. It was once used as a makeshift hospital and much of its paranormal presence has been attributed to the fact that many died in the building. Among the numerous ghosts that have been spotted at the residence are a mysterious Victorian woman and a man wearing a World War II uniform. The home is on the National Registry of Historic Places and currently serves as the office for the Gaslamp Quarter Historical Foundation as well as the Gaslamp Museum. Tours are offered weekly. 410 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nDel Mar Fairgrounds\n\nRumors of paranormal activity at the fairgrounds have been circulating among employees for years. From magically moving furniture to strange sounds at night, many employees have reported supernatural experiences with the spirits of the fairgrounds. Former fairgrounds spokeswoman Linda Zweig decided to call on South Coast Paranormal to investigate in early 2011. The team uncovered what they believed to be \u201cvoices from the disembodied\u201d and spent five nights awake on the supposedly haunted fifth floor of the grandstand to investigate. 2260 Jimmy Durante Blvd., Del Mar\n\nEl Campo Santo Cemetery\n\nA few blocks from the Whaley House in Old Town San Diego, the El Campo Santo Cemetery has been continuously studied by paranormal experts due to the volume of supernatural reports from the area. When the city was becoming overcrowded in the 19th century, graves were relocated and many were paved over to make way for a road, disrespecting the spirits at rest below. Most paranormal reports from the cemetery include ghosts roaming the grounds, many dressed in period appropriate clothing, as well as car alarms going off and vehicles not starting when parked in front of the graveyard. 2410 San Diego Ave., San Diego\n\nElfin Forest\n\nThe Elfin Forest is home to a number of ghost stories, from the vengeful white witch who is believed to be searching for the murderer of her son and husband, to the 10-foot owl that hovers around the area. Nicole Strickland from the San Diego Paranormal Research Society said that many have reported feeling a sense of doom when passing through the area in the dark. 8833 Harmony Grove Road, Escondido\n\nHorton Grand Hotel\n\nRoom 309 of the Horton Grand Hotel has a haunting history. The room was once occupied by notorious gambler Roger Whitaker, known in the mid-1800s for his drinking and cheating habits. One night, his debts caught up with him when he was shot dead by creditors while hiding in the room\u2019s armoire. Today, the room has been reported as a site for paranormal activity, which many believe is caused by Whitaker\u2019s ghost. A female spirit belonging to Ida Bailey is also said to be present at the hotel. Bailey was the owner of a brothel that once operated right where the hotel was built, and has been reported to haunt the spot in the form of white mist or a cold chill. 311 Island Ave., San Diego\n\nHotel del Coronado\n\nThe ghost of 24-year-old \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d Kate Morgan is believed to haunt this lavish hotel. Morgan checked into the hotel on Thanksgiving Day in 1892. Five days later, she was reported to have been found dead, dressed in black with a lace shawl over her head and a gunshot wound in her right temple. Police found no sure way to identify her immediately, so Morgan was referred to as \u201cbeautiful stranger\u201d by many news outlets. Today, she is said to be the hotel\u2019s resident ghost, playful but harmless. Guests and staff have reported flickering lights, electricity issues and various other oddities in the room that Morgan stayed in, and paranormal experts have been able to document this activity using infrared cameras, radiation sensors and sound detectors. 1500 Orange Ave., Coronado\n\nHunter Steakhouse\n\nPerched on a hill above the Buena Vista Lagoon, Hunter Steakhouse was built atop the old Buena Vista cemetery which is believed to have held around 50 bodies. In 1970, some of those bodies were moved to a different cemetery to allow for commercial developments, and it is said that the developer covered up bodily remains to speed up construction. Customers of the steakhouse have reported experiencing power surges, cold spots and a ghostly figure lingering near the stairs of the bar. 1221 Vista Way, Oceanside\n\nJulian Pioneer Cemetery\n\nMany Gold Rush-era ore miners were put to rest in the Julian Pioneer Cemetery in the 1870s. The cemetery was declared a California historical landmark in 1948, and has drawn paranormal experts for decades due to reports of ghostly men in 19th-century mining clothes as well as an eerie woman in a nightgown. 2811 Washington St., Julian\n\nLake Morena\n\nNamed one of \u201cthe most haunted campgrounds in the U.S.\u201d by Outside Magazine, Lake Morena is said to have supernatural energy. A San Diego Union article from 1983 titled \u201cMore than Fish Haunt Morena\u201d recounts the horrifying stories of those who had experienced strange happenings at the park, from the sound of thundering footsteps to haunting men appearing to walk on air. Today the spooky encounters have continued, with campers hearing screaming and feeling an omnipotent presence. 2550 Lake Morena Drive, Campo\n\nMt. Woodson Castle\n\nThis 27-room, 12,000-square-foot castle is believed by some to be occupied by the ghost of former owner and designer of the home Amy Strong. The castle was completed in 1921 and was listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1978. Supposedly, the sound of Strong sewing on her machine fills the night, despite the fact that she died in 1950. Some say that a worker who lost his finger while working on the home can also be heard scratching the rocks outside trying to recover the finger. While the chief financial officer of Personal Touch Dining, which now manages the castle, claims she has never seen a ghost on-site, others aren\u2019t so convinced. Speculation surrounds the Zodiac room that Strong built in the home and her increasing interest in the spiritual realm in her older days. 16302 N. Woodson Drive, Ramona\n\nOld Point Loma lighthouse\n\nOver 150 years old, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse is a beacon for ghostly encounters. Visitors have reported hearing heavy footsteps, moaning and labored breathing while exploring the space in addition to sporadic cold spots. Some believe that the spirit of former Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who landed at San Diego Bay in 1542, occupies the space. Others believe that it is the spirit of Captain Robert Decatur Israel, the lighthouse\u2019s final lightkeeper, who remains to protect his precious lighthouse. The lighthouse was shut down in 1891 and now remains part of the Cabrillo National Monument. 1800 Cabrillo Memorial Drive\n\nProctor Valley\n\nStories of the gigantic hairy beast from the Proctor Valley area date back to more than a century ago, with stories of disembodied limbs frightening some and enticing others to go out monster hunting. The monster has become a sort of legend for the community, with a local playwright penning a musical comedy show titled \u201cThe Return of the Proctor Valley Monster\u201d which has been performed locally many times. The Bonita Museum keeps a footprint on display that is believed to belong to the Proctor Valley monster. Some blame the Proctor Valley\u2019s missing cattle on the monster, while others simply chuckle at the mention of it. Proctor Valley Rd., Chula Vista\n\nRancho Buena Vista Abobe\n\nThe Rancho Buena Vista Adobe was built in 1846 and is filled with historical artifacts and architecture. Over the years it has changed ownership several times. The city of Vista purchased the property in 1989 and now operates it as a historical museum. Experts believe the Adobe to serve as a portal to connect the living and spirit worlds, thankfully one that is believed to only accept peaceful ghosts. 640 Alta Vista Drive, Vista\n\nSan Diego Bay\n\nThere have been reports of San Diego\u2019s very own sea monster lurking in the bay since 1873. The initial sighting was reported by Captain George Charlesworth, who reported a 30-foot \u201cserpent-fish\u201d that he claims drew itself out of the water and onto the sand. Charlesworth\u2019s sighting led to an Academy of Sciences meeting and several expeditions in an attempt to sight the monster, but to no avail. All that was left were markings in the mud where the creature was believed to have slithered away.\n\nStar of India\n\nThe Star of India tall ship is the world\u2019s oldest active sailing ship, having been on the sea since 1863 and making a total of 21 voyages around the world before its retirement. The ship is believed to be haunted by the spirits of those who died aboard, including young stowaway John Campbell, who died falling 100 feet from the rigging, and Army Capt. McBarnet who slit his own throat and ultimately bled to death. All sorts of paranormal activity have been reported since. The ship is part of the Maritime Museum of San Diego and is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. 1492 N Harbor Drive, San Diego\n\nUSS Midway Museum\n\nThis decommissioned Navy aircraft carrier-turned-museum is said to be home to a number of ghosts. Back when the ship was still in service, many crew members believed there to be a crew of ghosts living among them, and to this day, visitors and staff have reported ghostly sightings all around the ship. The museum\u2019s curator and leader of San Diego\u2019s largest paranormal group, David Hanson, has deemed the ship as \u201cparanormally active\u201d rather than \u201chaunted\u201d due to the negative connotation that the latter holds. He believes that the crew members that linger on Midway have returned out of love for the ship and are not to be feared. 910 N Harbor Drive, San Diego midway.org\n\nVilla Montezuma Museum\n\nThis Sherman Heights mansion was named a historical site by the city of San Diego in 1970 due to its Victorian style architecture. Built in 1887, the mansion is believed to be haunted by former resident Jesse Shepard. Shepard was a writer, musician and spiritualist who only resided in Villa Montezuma for a few years, despite having the mansion specially built to include music rooms and hidden doorways. The story goes that Shepard used to host seances in the home, claiming to have communicated with the spirits of Mozart and Beethoven. He is believed to have died on a piano bench, eerily right as he finished playing a song. Witnesses say a bright and enchanting energy has been left in his wake. Today, tours of the mansion museum are available Fridays through Sundays. Chair of the friends of the Villa Montezuma Louis Torio describes the mansion as \u201cmagical\u201d and radiating a \u201cpositive energy.\u201d 1925 K St., San Diego\n\nWhaley House\n\nBuilt atop San Diego\u2019s old execution grounds, the Whaley House in Old Town was once home to an unlucky family of five. Despite being aware of the land\u2019s dark history, entrepreneur Thomas Whaley decided to proceed with the construction of his family\u2019s home in 1857, and even placed a large arch in the parlor room of the home to mark the exact spot where former Yankee thief Jim Robinson experienced a drawn out and grueling execution. The Whaley family experienced a total of five deaths during their time living in the home, including several children and Thomas\u2019 wife, Anna. The home has been said to be haunted by their spirits ever since. The home was deemed \u201cthe most haunted house in America\u201d by Life magazine. Today, the home is open to the public for self-guided daytime tours or haunted night tours. A tour guide at the home reported that a doll in the nursery room of the home is known to shift positions at night when the museum closes for the day. 2476 San Diego Ave., San Diego."

        "article_content": "WATERLOO \u2014 Old houses like the Rensselaer Russell House and Snowden House have long memories. There is an energy that recalls past lives lived inside their walls, permeating every creaking floorboard.\n\nAuthor and paranormal investigator Katie Hopkins will share her experiences and explorations into realms beyond the ordinary \u2013 including haunting occurrences at the Russell House, in special fundraising events Oct. 19.\n\n\u201cParanormal 101 Presentation and Book Signing\u201d is at 5 p.m. at the historic Snowden House, 306 Washington St., hosted by Friends of the Grout\u2019s Historic Houses. Hopkins will discuss history of the paranormal, why research is important to paranormal investigators and various types of investigation methods.\n\nHopkins, of Cedar Rapids, will also sign copies of her books, \u201cSeeing Spirits: Opening the Empathic Door\u201d and \u201cIowa Haunted Corridor.\u201d Copies will be available to purchase for $15.\n\nFollowing the presentation, guests will venture into shadowy corridors and spaces where spirits may linger in grand 1861 Rensselaer Russell House Museum, 520 W. Third St., and the historic Victorian-era Snowden House. Both homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hopkins and her husband Josh and Lollman Paranormal will lead the paranormal investigation at both houses using the latest paranormal investigation equipment.\n\nBoth events are fundraisers for the Friends of the Grout Historic Houses, benefiting the Russell House Museum and Snowden House. Pre-registration is required for both events. The presentation and book signing are $15 for members; $20 for non-members. The investigation is $50 for members; $55 for non-members. To register visit www.gmdistrict.org/calendar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for different ways to raise money to support preservation of our two houses. We thought something like this might attract a different and perhaps a younger audience,\u201d said Hawkeye Community College instructor Marcea Seible. She also serves on the Friends board.\n\n\u201cWe would love to sell out. We\u2019re hopeful that it will be a popular event, and we can do something similar in the coming years,\u201d Seible explained.\n\nHopkins was 10 when she saw her first spirit in the basement of a friend\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThat was the focus of my first book. I \u2018ve always been interested in the paranormal and supernatural. My first interest was in history \u2013 that\u2019s what drew me into the paranormal, too, exploring really cool historical places where ghost hunters get to go into,\u201d she said.\n\nShe earned a history degree at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls and a master\u2019s degree in higher education from Kaplan University. She worked as an intern at the Grout in 2008 and returned in 2012 as a museum assistant, which included managing the Rensselaer Russell House Museum.\n\nWhether or not the Rensselaer Russell House is haunted, it has had its share of tragedy and loss. In 1862, 5-year-old Genevieve Russell fell into a well on a neighboring property and drowned. Her funeral wake took place in the Russell home. Once, while in the master bedroom looking at a photograph of Genevieve, Hopkins felt a small hand grab her leg. She\u2019s convinced she was touched by the child\u2019s spirit.\n\n\u201cI was in the Russell House alone eight hours a day. I\u2019d see things move and hear things \u2013 footsteps on the stairs or glassware sitting on the dining table rattle, or find the photo of Genevieve moved, when I was the only one there,\u201d Hopkins recalled.\n\nOn one occasion, she closed the museum, and the next morning found every drawer and cabinet door open, although the house was still locked up tight. Hopkins once heard the doorbell signal someone entering and searched the house to find no one else there. Other people recount seeing a girl in an upper window of the house, and a light at night when the museum is closed.\n\nIn 2012, with Hopkins\u2019 encouragement, the Grout board allowed the Calhoun County Paranormal Investigators to set up video and recording equipment and electromagnetic field detectors and stayed overnight in the house.\n\n\u201cI really made a connection with that house and the spirits in it. I\u2019m so excited to be back to do these fundraisers,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many historical houses and buildings fall into disrepair. People lived in these houses and experienced love, loss and tragedy. These are so much more than just old buildings.\u201d\n\nThe need for funds is serious and ongoing, said Seible.\n\n\u201cAll money goes directly to upkeep and maintenance at the houses. Both houses need work, the Russell house, in particular. It really needs foundation work \u2013 limestone is crumbling in some places, so that\u2019s the most pressing issue.\u201d\n\nClose Nicholas Erickson, artifacts registrar at Grout Museum District, looks over the telegram sent to Henry Grout informing him his brother, Warren, had been shot and killed in Tombstone, Ariz., in 1883.

        "article_content": "CASPER \u2014 Who you gonna call in Wyoming when the door slams in an empty room and a mysterious disembodied voice whispers \u201cget out?\u201d\n\nCasper\u2019s Pete McDaniels.\n\nA longtime fan of the 1984 hit movie \u201cGhostbusters\u201d starring Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Harold Ramios McDaniels and his team of ragtag wranglers of all things supernatural are listed are on an official \u201cwhoyougonnacall.org\" website that lists paranormal investigators in each state.\n\nHe is one of 165 franchises nationwide, and the only listed in Wyoming.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole group of folks that use that movie to help people in their communities,\u201d McDaniels said.\n\nIn addition investigating potential hauntings, Casper\u2019s Ghostbusters do birthday parties, food drives, conventions, \u201ctrunk\u201d or treats and raises money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nLike the movies that feature iconic ghost-busting cars, McDaniels drives his own version of \u201cEcto-1,\u201d the famous converted ambulance with the unique whiney siren. It has similar paraphernalia on top and Ghostbusters stickers on the side.\n\nHe bought the 2009 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor from someone in Glenrock a few years ago. He renamed it the \u201cEcto Interceptor.\u201d\n\nA hospital security guard when not busting ghosts, McDaniels had his uniform on when he initially drove the unmodified car. Wyoming Highway Patrol pulled him over, thinking he might be trying to impersonate a police officer.\n\nGhostbuster Interceptor\n\n\u201cI thought I should probably make this car less cop like and more something fun. And I had always wanted to have a Ghostbusters car, so I started to put stickers on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell then I thought, now I\u2019ve got to build a top in it, it can\u2019t just be stickers right? So, I started piecing together bit by bit the roof rack and housing and built all that out. There is one piece of pipe up that\u2019s up there being held onto the roof by a toilet flange.\u201d\n\nOnce he had his wheels, as well as the \u201cECTOI\u201d license plate, the doors opened for him to use it for fundraisers and to market his ghost removal side gig.\n\nOctober becomes the busy season. There is a \u201cTouch a Truck\u201d event on Oct. 12 at the Excel Academy Private School that allows kids to get in the vehicle, turn on the sirens, read the special tag fastened on the dash that labels the machine as belonging to Wyoming Ghostbusters, and check out the glove compartment.\n\n\u201cThere is a ghostbuster\u2019s employee handbook and a little canister of ectoplasm slime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids like to play with all that stuff.\u201d\n\nHe also plans to be at a car show and food drive at the Izaak Walton Clubhouse in Casper on Oct. 18 and end the month on Oct. 25, 27 and 28 with actual ghostbusting demonstrations at the Casper Elks Lodge No. 1353 where he said the equipment used by paranormal investigators will be explained and a walk through of the lodge will be conducted.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m discussing a fundraiser for a lady that is trying to fight cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try and kind of use the car as a way to help people out.\u201d\n\nAs in the movie, McDaniels and some other members of the team have uniforms and he and a buddy have the proton packs used in the last version of the film series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the iconic part of Ghostbusters history, it gets people excited,\u201d he said.\n\nSupernatural Missions\n\nIn addition to the fundraising, and parties, McDaniels also has been on an estimated 15 missions to identify or remove potential paranormal spirits in places around the region and state.\n\nHe recently was called to a Casper home where the owners discovered a set of footprints on concrete that went from a pickup truck to the garage door and then just vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat it looked like was that somebody had walked through a puddle of grease, made about four or five steps to the garage door and then nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels pulled out his EMF meter that measures electro-magnetic energy and found it registered a few points over the footprints and faded when pulled away from them. He checked to see if there were any internet routers or other source of energy nearby that would trigger the meters. There were none.\n\nOther tools in his ghostbusting toolbox include REM-Pod devices that reflect electromagnetic field changes and air temperature changes and a specialized SLS (Structured Light Sensor) camera that uses infrared light. It can 3D map areas in front of it \u201cso we can see things the human eye might miss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also uses other cameras that can capture images in ultraviolet, infrared, and the normal spectrum of light.\n\nAt the garage, McDaniels set up some REM Pods around the area to see if anything would trigger them. Nothing happened. Photos with the infrared camera found nothing.\n\nBut it\u2019s not always that way. McDaniels tells the story of being called to a Casper home about five blocks from the cemetery with a man experiencing doors being slammed in his home for no reason.\n\n\u201cHe said he was sitting on the couch one day and he felt like his leg started to burn,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cHe looked down and it looked like a handprint had been slapped on his thigh. So, we got to go down and work with that.\u201d\n\nThe man requested that McDaniels and his team bless the house. McDaniels said he has studied different spiritual beliefs including druidism and another team member is a Norse shaman.\n\n\u201cPeter McDaniel turned a former police interceptor into his Ecto Interceptor.

(Courtesy Peter McDaniels) Arrow left Arrow right\n\nStubborn Spirit\n\nTheir attempts to get rid of the spirit by blessing the house did not work. He claims it was forced into a back room. McDaniels had read about a dybbuk box used in Jewish tradition that is supposed to be able to contain a spirit. So, he tried using one.\n\n\u201cWe kind of forced this thing into the dybbuk box and sealed it,\u201d he said. McDaniels said as he was talking to the man at the house, he placed the box by the front tire of his Ghostbuster car and the tire deflated. He had to pump it up to leave.\n\nThere was another hurdle as well. Weather at the time was cold and the ground hard, so he couldn\u2019t bury the box as would be his practice.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the Nobel for medicine for their discovery of microRNA.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded on Monday to two US scientists for discovering microRNA, a previously unknown type of genetic switch which is hoped can pave the way for new medical breakthroughs.\n\nBut while several treatments and tests are under development using microRNAs against cancer, heart disease, viruses and other illnesses, none have actually yet reached patients.\n\nAnd the world paid little attention when the new Nobel laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun revealed their discovery decades ago, thinking it was just \"something weird about worms\", Cambridge University geneticist Eric Miska told AFP.\n\nHere is an explainer about how exactly these tiny genetic switches work inside our bodies.\n\nWhat is microRNA?\n\nEach cell in the human body has the same set of instructions, called DNA. Some turn into brain cells, while others become muscles.\n\nSo how do the cells know what to become? The relevant part of the DNA's instructions is pointed to via a process called gene regulation.\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) normally serves as a messenger. It delivers the instructions from the DNA to proteins, which are the building blocks of life that turn cells into brains\u2014or muscles.\n\nMiska gave the example of the messenger RNA vaccines rolled out against COVID-19 during the pandemic, which insert a message with new instructions to build proteins that block viruses.\n\nBut the two new Nobel winners Ambros and Ruvkun discovered a whole new type of gene regulator that had previously been overlooked by science.\n\nRather than being the messenger which relays information, microRNA instead acts as a switch to turn other genes off and on.\n\n\"This was a whole new level of control that we had totally missed,\" said Miska, who has worked on microRNA for two decades, including with the new Nobel laureates.\n\n\"The discovery of microRNAs brought an additional level of complexity by revealing that regions that were thought to be non-coding play a role in gene regulation,\" French researcher Benoit Ballester told AFP.\n\nWhat did the Nobel winners do?\n\nBack in the 1980s, Ambros and Ruvkun had been working separately on how genes interact in one-millimeter-long roundworms called C.elegans.\n\nWhen they compared their work, it led to the discovery of microRNA. Ambros revealed the finding in a 1993 paper.\n\nNobel prize for medicine 2024.\n\n\"Nobody really paid much attention,\" Miska said, explaining that most scientists at the time thought it only applied to worms.\n\nThen in 2000, Ruvkun published research showing that microRNA is present right across the animal kingdom, including in humans and even some viruses.\n\n\"This was not just something weird that worms do, but in fact all animals and plants are totally dependent for development and normal function on them,\" Miska said.\n\nMore than a thousand genes that respond to microRNAs are now believed to be in the human body.\n\nHow could this help us?\n\nThere are numerous new treatments and tests using microRNA that are undergoing trials but none have been made widely available.\n\n\"Though there are no very clear applications available yet in microRNAs, understanding them, knowing that they exist, understanding their counter-regulatory networks, is always the first step,\" the Karolinska Institute's Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam told journalists in Stockholm.\n\nMicroRNAs are particularly promising for fighting cancer because some of these switches \"act as a tumor suppressor, so they put a brake on cells dividing inappropriately,\" Miska said.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, induce \"cells to divide, which can lead to cancer\", he added.\n\nBecause many viruses use microRNAs, several antiviral drugs are at varying stages of development, including for hepatitis C.\n\nOne complicating factor has been that microRNAs can be unstable.\n\nBut scientists also hope they can be used as a test called a \"biomarker\", which could reveal what type of cancer a patient could be suffering from, for example.\n\nWhat next?\n\nIt also appears probable that microRNAs could be involved in the evolution of our species, Miska said.\n\n\"It seems very likely that microRNAs have important roles in why the human brain is different from the brains of other primates,\" Miska said.\n\nWhile human brains are difficult to study, Miska hoped future research will discover more.\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP"

        "article_content": "STOCKHOLM \u2014 Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine on Monday for their discovery of microRNA, tiny bits of genetic material that serve as on and off switches inside cells that help control what the cells do and when they do it. If scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.\n\nThe work by Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun is \u201cproving to be fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function,\u201d according to a panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun were initially interested in genes that control the timing of different genetic developments, ensuring that cell types develop at the right time.\n\nTheir discovery ultimately \u201crevealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\u201d the panel said.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Prize for?\n\nRNA is best known for carrying instructions for how to make proteins from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to tiny cellular factories that actually build the proteins. MicroRNA does not make proteins, but helps to control what cells are doing, including switching on and off critical genes that make proteins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel for medicine went to scientists who discovered how to manipulate one of those types of RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA, now used to make vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nAmbros\u2019 and Ruvkun\u2019s revolutionary discovery was initially made in worms; they set out to identify why some kinds of cells didn\u2019t develop in two mutant strains of worms commonly used as a research model in science.\n\n\u201cTheir groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\u201d according to the citation explaining the importance of their work.\n\nThat mechanism has been at work for hundreds of millions of years and has enabled evolution of complex organisms, it said.\n\nAmbros, currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, performed the research at Harvard University. Ruvkun\u2019s research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he\u2019s a professor of genetics.\n\nWhy does microRNA matter?\n\nThe study of microRNA has opened up approaches to treating diseases like cancer because it helps regulate how genes work in our cells, said Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFletcher said there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as possible indicators of diseases, by tracking microRNA levels in the body.\n\n\u201cIf we take the example of cancer, we\u2019ll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,\u201d said Fletcher. She said scientists might one day be able to use microRNA to stop such effects.\n\nEric Miska, a geneticist at Cambridge University, said the discovery by Ambros and Ruvkun came as a complete surprise, overturning what scientists had long understood about how cells work.\n\nTheir discovery of microRNA shocked many scientists, Miska said, explaining that such small bits of genetic material had never been seen before. The tiny fragments of RNA \u2014 the human genome has at least 800 \u2014 were later found to play critical roles in how our bodies develop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiska said there is ongoing work on the role of microRNA in infectious diseases like hepatitis and that it might also be helpful in treating neurological diseases.\n\nFletcher said the most advanced studies to date are reviewing how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but no drugs have yet been approved. She predicted that might happen in the coming years, adding that most treatments at the moment target cell proteins.\n\n\u201cIf we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nHow did Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros react?\n\nThe phone call from the Nobel panel is often a surprise, but there are certain signs that recipients and their families pick up on.\n\n\u201cWell, when a phone rings at 4:30 in the morning. ... It never happens here,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNatasha actually answered it,\u201d Ruvkun added, referring to his wife. \u201cAnd she goes: \u2018He has a Swedish accent.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt took a little longer to rouse Ambros.\n\n\u201cSomebody called my son, who called my wife as my phone was downstairs,\u201d he said.\n\nRuvkun knew immediately the impact the award would have on his life.\n\n\u201cWell, I just kept repeating in my mind, this changes everything because you know, the Nobel is just mythic in how it transforms the life of people who are selected,\u201d Ruvkun said. \u201cThe Nobel Prize is a recognition that\u2019s sort of 100 times as much press and celebration as any other award. So, it\u2019s not part of a continuum. It\u2019s a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nGoing to pick up his award in December will be the third time he has been to a Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm after attending to watch his mentor Robert Horvitz receive the 2002 award and then his buddy Jack Szostak, who won in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trip coming up. It will be the third, possibly the best,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAmbros said he didn\u2019t expect the award as he felt that the Nobel committee has already singled out RNA in the 2006 prize that went to his friends Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.\n\n\u201cIt represents the recognition of how wonderful and unexpected discoveries come from a curiosity in basic science financed by taxpayer money. It\u2019s a vitally important, probably the most important message, that this investment really pays off,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that microRNA helps regulate gene activity, rather than carrying instructions for making proteins.\n\n___"

        "article_content": "Listen to this story\n\nWith tools like Cursor, Claude, and ChatGPT canvas are on the boom, allowing users to build software using natural language, it feels highly reminiscent of the times when LC/NC platforms also lowered the barrier to entry for app development and made it easier for companies to teach their developers the existing solutions within the companies.\n\nThe community is now questioning the relevance of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) platforms in the AI era. How do these platforms continue to stay relevant in a landscape dominated by artificial intelligence?\n\nWhile these tools were a great choice for prototyping an idea or starting a project, LC/NC platforms are a nightmare when considering scaling a project, which seems to be the same for modern AI coding tools. Not much has changed.\n\nAmidst the challenges and shift towards AI coding tools, is there still a role for low-code, no-code platforms, like Bubble and Webflow, in today\u2019s landscape, and are they able to coexist with emerging AI solutions?\n\nAccording to a Reddit user, even when he got help from AI to write a custom function for the no-code platform, it failed terribly. Two days later, he started writing the code himself and it worked out pretty well.\n\n\u201cWhen building an app you want to own with popular low-code/no-code platforms, even if they mention that you legally own an IP to your app, what meaning does it hold if you cannot run it on-premise?\u201d Andreas M\u00f8ller, the co-founder of toddle, told AIM. This seems to be a common reason why the adoption of low-code no-code platforms took some time.\n\nWe witness the same with AI tools, given the hallucinations and other privacy issues. But in certain cases, they are able to do the job a lot quicker than any no-code platforms that ever existed.\n\nFor example, Meghana Jagadeesh, the founder & CEO of GoCodeo, mentioned at Cypher 2024 that LC/NC tools will still be relevant and will grow in the future, but with an AI twist in them.\n\n\u201cWhen AI capabilities are added to LC/NC platforms, it gets easier for non-tech guys to build specific functions. These tools are a great choice to get started before scaling it for a large user base,\u201d she said, suggesting that we should not confuse LC/NC tools with traditional development as they cater to different user needs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have Git, a version-controlling system, I\u2019m obviously not going to build a big project on your platform. That is a deal breaker for every developer,\u201d said M\u00f8ller while explaining why it is necessary for every developer to have a version-control system to build a SaaS application.\n\nDue to these issues, we saw companies like Klarna drop solutions built on top of LC/NC platforms and create in-house solutions using AI for better scalability and profit.\n\nThis is the reason we are seeing tools like toddle and Apptile, which are a little different from the traditional LC/NC platforms. Samyam Annappa, founder and CTO at Apptile, told AIM that coding typically makes up less than 25% of the total project cost. Most of the time goes into setting up the infrastructure\u2014analytics pipelines, payment gateways, notifications, device testing, and managing both iOS and Android versions.\n\n\u201cThat is where tools like Apptile simplify this by taking care of the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Additionally, our architecture supports real-time content updates, unlike tools like Cursor, which necessitate code changes, App Store reviews, and App Store rejection handling for content updates,\u201d he added, further suggesting that to stay relevant in the AI era, LC/NC platforms must overcome traditional issues and offer streamlined solutions.\n\nSimilarly to Apptile, tools like toddle, which is not entirely an LC/NC platform but something in between LC/NC and traditional platforms, allows users to build specific functions and host your infrastructure, and has plans to go open source by the end of 2025, so you can actually own your software.\n\nWill LLMs replace LC/NC Platforms?\n\nLC/NC platforms have to adapt to the changes all developers are going through \u2013 the AI change. Jinen Dedhia, the founder of DronaHQ mentioned on HackerNews that he also believes that LLMs can remove the need for LC/NC platforms and the only way to stay relevant is to tightly integrate AI capabilities to LC/NC platforms.\n\n\u201cBut I do see the merit in this thinking that LLMs can eat LCNC platforms for breakfast. However, I am excited to see how with time near perfect applications can be churned out with about 80-90% work done and engineers can figure the last few miles and reach the finish line but 50x faster,\u201d he added further.\n\nIn fact, the LC/NC platforms produce very well-structured code behind the scenes and they can train LLMs to build apps following their well defined structure, which means their apps can still take advantage of the LLMs but will have less bugs than just letting the LLMs produce a stand-alone app.\n\nWhile LC/NC platforms may provide a simplified interface for creating applications, they do not eliminate the need for a foundational understanding of programming concepts, same as the AI tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot.\n\nOf course, the LLMs can produce more versatile apps than LC/NC platforms but considering LLMs as a competitor to LC/NC platforms might not be a correct idea."

        "article_content": "Welcome to the heartbeat of innovation\u2014Silicon Valley! This electrifying region isn\u2019t just a dot on the map; it\u2019s a bustling ecosystem where dreams take flight and groundbreaking ideas are born. From tech giants like Apple and Google to visionary startups, Silicon Valley is the nucleus of entrepreneurial spirit and creativity. But what exactly sets its startup culture apart from any other place in the world? In this blog post, we\u2019ll dive deep into the unique tapestry woven by collaboration, risk-taking, and an insatiable appetite for disruption that defines this iconic locale. Get ready to explore why Silicon Valley continues to be the gold standard for startups around the globe!\n\nIntroduction to Silicon Valley and its Reputation for Startups\n\nSilicon Valley, located in the southern region of San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California, is often referred to as the tech capital of the world. It is home to some of the biggest and most successful technology companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and Tesla. But what truly sets Silicon Valley apart is its reputation for being a hub of startups.\n\nFor decades now, Silicon Valley has been at the forefront of innovation and technological development. The term \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d was coined in the 1970s by journalist Don Hoefler to describe the high concentration of semiconductor companies in the area. Since then, it has evolved into a thriving ecosystem that fosters entrepreneurship and is known for giving birth to some of the most influential companies in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nOne of the defining features of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is its vibrant community filled with ambitious entrepreneurs, investors, and tech enthusiasts from around the world. The valley attracts top talent from prestigious institutions like Stanford University and Berkeley who come with fresh ideas and a hunger for success.\n\nMoreover, there are several networking opportunities available in Silicon Valley that allow startups to connect with potential investors, collaborators or mentors. The area hosts numerous events such as conferences, hackathons, pitch competitions providing valuable exposure to budding entrepreneurs looking to make their mark.\n\nAnother major factor contributing to Silicon Valley\u2019s reputation as a startup haven is access to funding. With venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), Andreesen Horowitz headquartered here; entrepreneurs have greater chances of securing funding than anywhere else in the world. These firms invest millions into innovative startups each year that have led many young companies on a path towards success.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about money; Silicon Valley has developed an infrastructure that facilitates growth and success for startups like no other place can provide. The region boasts a pool of skilled and experienced professionals in areas such as software development, marketing, finance, and more. This makes it easier for startups to find the right talent who can help turn their ideas into reality.\n\nFurthermore, the culture of risk-taking and failure is deeply ingrained in Silicon Valley\u2019s startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to take calculated risks, learn from their mistakes and keep pushing forward. This mindset fosters a supportive environment that celebrates failure as a learning experience rather than a setback.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s reputation for being at the forefront of innovation and its thriving startup culture make it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs looking to make their mark on the world. The area offers unparalleled access to resources, funding opportunities, networking events, and a community of like-minded individuals all united by one goal: to change the world through technology.\n\nThe origins of the startup culture in Silicon Valley\n\nThe origins of the startup culture in Silicon Valley can be traced back to the 1950s, when the area was primarily known as the \u201cValley of Hearts Delight\u201d due to its vast orchards and farms. However, with the arrival of large technology companies such as Hewlett-Packard and IBM in the 1960s, this region began its transformation into a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nOne of the key factors that contributed to the growth of the startup culture in Silicon Valley was the presence of top-tier universities such as Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. These institutions not only attracted highly skilled individuals but also fostered a culture of experimentation and interdisciplinary collaboration. Graduates from these universities often stayed in Silicon Valley, bringing their fresh ideas and knowledge to fuel new startups.\n\nAnother crucial element in shaping Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture was the formation of Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. This company not only produced groundbreaking technological advancements but also laid down a foundation for future entrepreneurs by allowing employees to have stock options \u2013 an innovative approach at that time. This practice became known as \u201cFairchildism\u201d and encouraged employees to take risks and pursue entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nIn addition to these internal factors, external events like World War II played a significant role in shaping Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture. The war effort focused on developing advanced technologies opened up opportunities for research and development which later led to spin-off companies such as Varian Associates.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until 1971 when Intel Corporation introduced its first microprocessor that Silicon Valley truly catapulted onto the global stage as an epicenter for innovation. The invention revolutionized computing and paved the way for smaller-scale startups specializing in software development rather than hardware production.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s geographic layout has also been instrumental in fostering its vibrant startup scene. With major technology companies headquartered close together, collaborations between different firms were common occurrences. This open-door policy has allowed startups to network, share knowledge, and resources, leading to new partnerships and advancements.\n\nThe startup culture in Silicon Valley has evolved over several decades, shaped by a combination of factors such as top universities, the presence of successful companies, wartime research efforts, and geographical layout. These elements have created an ecosystem that encourages risk-taking, fosters innovation and allows for continuous learning \u2013 making it a perfect breeding ground for startups.\n\nKey characteristics of the startup culture: innovation, risk-taking, and community support\n\nThe startup culture in Silicon Valley is renowned for its innovative and dynamic environment, characterized by a high level of risk-taking and strong community support.

From household names like Apple, Google, and Facebook to lesser-known but equally influential startups, Silicon Valley has become synonymous with success and disruption.\n\nOne of the most well-known success stories in Silicon Valley is that of Apple Inc. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in a garage in Los Altos, California, Apple started as a small personal computer company. It quickly rose to prominence with the launch of its revolutionary products such as the Macintosh computer, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.

It is no wonder that it continues to attract ambitious individuals and aspiring entrepreneurs from all over the world who dream of making it big in this dynamic ecosystem.\n\nHow the startup culture is evolving in Silicon Valley: diversity and inclusivity\n\nThe startup culture in Silicon Valley is constantly evolving, and one of the most notable changes in recent years has been a focus on diversity and inclusivity. With its reputation as the hub of innovation and technology, Silicon Valley has long been seen as a predominantly white and male-dominated industry. However, there has been a concerted effort to shift this narrative and create a more diverse and inclusive startup community.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this change is the recognition that diversity brings new perspectives and ideas to the table, ultimately leading to better products and services. Many startups have also recognized that having a diverse team can attract a wider customer base and open up new markets. As such, inclusivity is not just about creating a more equitable workplace; it\u2019s also good business sense.\n\nTo promote diversity in startups, many companies are implementing policies such as blind recruitment processes where names, gender, or other identifying details are removed from job applications. This helps to combat unconscious bias and ensure that candidates are selected based on their qualifications rather than personal characteristics.\n\nIn addition to hiring practices, many startups are also focused on creating an inclusive work environment by fostering a culture of belonging. This involves actively promoting an atmosphere where everyone feels valued regardless of their race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or ability. Companies are investing in programs such as implicit bias training for employees at all levels to help them recognize their own biases and create an inclusive workplace.\n\nAnother important aspect of improving diversity in Silicon Valley is representation in leadership positions. Startups are now making efforts towards increasing representation amongst executives with initiatives like diversity quotas for board seats or investing in leadership development programs targeted towards underrepresented groups.\n\nFurthermore, there has been increased investment in resources for underrepresented communities within the startup ecosystem. Programs such as mentorship opportunities for minority entrepreneurs or incubators specifically aimed at supporting women-led businesses have emerged with backing from influential investors.\n\nWhile there is still progress to be made, the startup culture in Silicon Valley is evolving towards a more diverse and inclusive community. With efforts being made to foster an environment of belonging, combat biases, increase representation, and provide resources for underrepresented groups, Silicon Valley is setting an example for other industries to follow suit. As diversity and inclusivity continue to be prioritized in startups, we can expect to see more innovative ideas and successful businesses thriving in this world-renowned hub of entrepreneurship.\n\nChallenges facing the startup culture in Silicon Valley\n\nThe startup culture in Silicon Valley is widely known for its innovative and fast-paced nature, making it a hub for entrepreneurs and investors alike. However, with great opportunities also come numerous challenges that startups in this region face. In this section, we will delve into some of the main obstacles that startups encounter in Silicon Valley.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the startup culture in Silicon Valley is the extremely high cost of living. The region has one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, which means that businesses have to spend a significant portion of their budget on office space and housing for their employees. This can be particularly difficult for early-stage startups with limited funding and resources. As a result, many startups struggle to attract top talent due to higher salaries needed to cover living expenses.\n\nIn addition to high costs, another major challenge faced by startups in Silicon Valley is fierce competition. With thousands of new businesses emerging every year and established companies constantly expanding their operations, it can be challenging for startups to stand out amongst their competitors. Not only do they have to compete for customers but also for talented employees who are often lured by bigger companies offering more attractive compensation packages.\n\nThe competitive nature of Silicon Valley can also lead to difficulties in securing funding. While there are abundant venture capitalists and angel investors in the area, they tend to be quite selective as they receive countless pitches from promising young companies every day. This makes it essential for startups to have a unique value proposition and a solid business plan before approaching potential investors.\n\nFurthermore, despite being renowned as an inclusive place where diverse ideas thrive, diversity remains a persistent issue within the startup community in Silicon Valley. The tech industry has long been criticized for its lack of diversity, especially when it comes to gender and race representation among founders and employees. This poses a challenge not only for addressing inequality but also hinders access to different perspectives and ideas necessary for innovation.\n\nMoreover, regulatory hurdles can also prove to be a significant challenge for startups in Silicon Valley. The region is known for its relaxed and flexible regulations, but with the rapid growth of new technologies and industries, government agencies are continuously updating their laws and policies. This can create legal complexities for businesses, especially those dealing with cutting-edge technologies.\n\nWhile the startup culture in Silicon Valley offers countless opportunities for companies to thrive, it is not without its challenges. High costs, intense competition, difficulty securing funding, lack of diversity, and regulatory hurdles all play a role in shaping the landscape of this unique entrepreneurial hub. Nevertheless, these obstacles have also fostered a community of resilient and determined individuals who constantly push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nLessons that can be learned from the unique aspects of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is known for its unparalleled success in fostering innovation and driving economic growth. This region has not only produced some of the most influential companies in the world, but it has also established a unique set of characteristics that sets it apart from any other place on earth. In this section, we will dive into the lessons that can be learned from the distinct aspects of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture.\n\n1.

This mindset allows entrepreneurs to continuously refine their ideas and come back stronger after each setback.\n\n2. Culture of Collaboration:\n\nAnother vital element of Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is its collaborative environment. Unlike competitive corporate cultures, startups in this region often work together, share resources and knowledge, and support one another\u2019s growth.

Focus on Disruptive Innovation:\n\nThe startups in Silicon Valley are built with an aim to disrupt existing markets by introducing new technologies or business models.

With top venture capitalists actively seeking out innovative ideas to invest in, startups have access to capital at every stage of their development \u2013 from seed funding to series A, B, C and beyond.\n\n5.Culture Diversity:\n\nSilicon Valley attracts talented individuals from all over the world due to its inclusive international environment. This rich mix of diverse cultures, ideas and perspectives fosters a culture of creativity and collaboration that enables startups to think globally from the very beginning.\n\nSilicon Valley\u2019s startup culture is unique in many ways, and there are several lessons that entrepreneurs can take away from it. These include embracing failure as a learning experience, promoting a collaborative mindset, focusing on disruptive innovation, having access to capital resources, and fostering diversity within the workplace. By incorporating these elements into their own startup cultures, entrepreneurs can strive towards achieving similar success in their respective industries.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the startup culture in Silicon Valley is truly one of a kind.

        "article_content": "Amazon is offering just about the cheapest way to get a recent Apple Watch on your wrist during its Prime Big Deals Days 2024 promotion, with a model you may have forgotten existed. You can buy a second-generation Apple Watch SE in various colors and with a choice of bands for $170 if you version or $200 if you . If you\u2019ve wondered what life with an Apple Watch is like, now is the time to find out.\n\nIt\u2019s not the latest Apple Watch Series 10 model, but it\u2019s about half its price, and although it doesn\u2019t have the same specifications, when that kind of saving is involved, there are some acceptable sacrifices. The second-generation Apple Watch SE was released in 2022, and with several more expensive models launched since then and no replacement from Apple, it has stopped being part of the conversation. However, that\u2019s unfair as the SE 2 has an aluminum case, Ion-X protective glass, a nylon composite case back, a heart rate sensor, an OLED screen, and a battery that should last at least a day with normal use.\n\nIt looks the same as the first Apple Watch SE and many other Apple Watch models, but is smaller and thicker than the current Series 10 model. It doesn\u2019t have an always-on screen, so it won\u2019t show the time until you raise your wrist to see the screen. The good news is this feature works so well that you won\u2019t ever be left staring at a blank screen. Don\u2019t expect recent features like the Double Tap gesture or some of the advanced health features like an electrocardiogram, blood oxygen monitoring, or a body temperature sensor, though.\n\nWhere the Apple Watch SE 2 wins is with the software. It runs Apple\u2019s watchOS 11, just like the most recent models, so it won\u2019t feel any different operationally. It has the same control system, basically the same workout tracking with GPS, and it\u2019ll show you all your health data and notifications, too. Apple\u2019s all-day battery life claim is on the conservative side, and if you don\u2019t track workouts, it\u2019s possible for the battery to last deep into a second day before it needs recharging.\n\nWhen I wore the Apple Watch SE 2 ahead of my review when it was released, the lack of an always-on screen bothered me, but mostly because I was coming from an Apple Watch that had the feature. Newcomers probably won\u2019t care, especially when the price is so competitive, and I did wonder at the time if we should be recommending it as the core Apple Watch to buy, as it did almost everything the more expensive model did. Two years on, and it lags further behind in headline features a design, but it\u2019s still a current model, meaning it\u2019ll be supported with new software for several years to come and remains a fantastic option for anyone wanting to try the best smartwatch you can buy without paying $350 or more.\n\nWhich color case you choose will be down to you, but I\u2019d recommend getting one of the models with a Sport Loop band if possible. It\u2019s more comfortable for all-day and night wear than the Sport Band, and its quick and easy adjustment makes it great for exercise. It may also be worth looking at the GPS and Cellular models, which are and , as they allow you to leave your phone at home and still stay connected, provided you add it to your regular phone plan. It\u2019s usually around $10 per month to do this.\n\nFew talk about the Apple Watch SE 2 these days, an oversight that probably needs correcting, but Amazon\u2019s low price makes this a brilliant smartwatch for anyone with an iPhone who wants to try life with an Apple Watch."
