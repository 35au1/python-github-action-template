            "article_content": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 Trent Dilfer was hopeful his second season as a college coach would be better.\n\nInstead, his team went 3-9 as the campaign turned into a nightmare on and off the field. It was the worst season of UAB football since 2013 when Garrick McGee went 2-10 and was promptly fired.\n\nThe season featured self-inflicted public relations blunders, a six-game losing streak and three losses by more than 30 points. In November, Dilfer, 52, was sidelined for a few days, though he did not miss a game, after undergoing a cervical fusion procedure, which required a surgeon to slice open Dilfer\u2019s throat to repair his spine and relieve debilitating, constant nerve pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was horrific. I was going crazy,\u201d Dilfer said in an interview with The Athletic. \u201cIt was like my bones were on fire. A spot in my left shoulder blade felt like a hot knife was being stuck in it.\u201d\n\nAs the losses mounted, crowds shrank at Protective Stadium, UAB\u2019s $175 million home stadium that opened in 2021.\n\nA column in the local paper called the program \u201cthe worst in college football\u201d and called for the university to clean house in the athletic department.\n\n\u201cThe football program, I believe, is in disarray,\u201d said Vincent Curtis, a 1997 UAB graduate who has supported the program for more than two decades. \u201cI\u2019m on social media. I speak to a lot of fans. We just do not have any confidence in the leadership in the athletic department or the football program.\u201d\n\nAt season\u2019s end, athletic director Mark Ingram announced plans to retain the former Super Bowl-winning quarterback, declining to make a change that would have cost the university $3.6 million.\n\nIt was a controversial decision but not a surprising one considering Ingram\u2019s consistent support of his unconventional hand-picked hire plucked from the high school ranks two years ago.\n\nGO DEEPER A Super Bowl champion QB is college football\u2019s most surprising hire. Will the risky move pay off?\n\nDilfer professed optimism because of players returning who \u201cdespite the circumstances, at the end of the year played their best football, played hard and showed grit,\u201d he said.\n\nDilfer\u2019s 2025 recruiting class has six signed prospects and ranks 133rd nationally in the 247Sports Composite, behind three FCS programs and every American Athletic Conference program but one: Army. The program lost 29 players to the transfer portal since it opened on Dec. 9, more than any team in the AAC. Nine signed with Power 4 programs.\n\nIt did welcome 21 transfers, highlighted by Kent State\u2019s leading tackler Josh Baka, an FCS All-American from Nicholls State in linebacker Eli Ennis and UTEP\u2019s leading rusher Jevon Jackson. Quarterback Jalen Kitna, who took over for injured starter Jacob Zeno early last season, returns.\n\n\u201cI had no say in the process of keeping me,\u201d Dilfer said. \u201cBut I\u2019m super fired up that I get a chance to fix this.\u201d\n\nThe Blazers have added 21 players through the transfer portal. Meet the entire transfer portal class: https://t.co/aGRT3jT9c2#WinAsOne pic.twitter.com/iEyW9IGUVm \u2014 UAB Football (@UAB_FB) January 16, 2025\n\nUAB football is a young but proud program that began play as a Division I program in 1996. It was shut down in 2014 in a cost-savings measure but rose from the dead six months later. After a hiatus that lasted two seasons, coach Bill Clark led the program to five bowl games in six seasons, the best run in school history. Back issues pushed Clark into a sudden retirement in June 2022, but his work set up a move in 2023 to the American, the most accomplished and most difficult non-power conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngram elected to hire Dilfer, rather than hand the program to interim coach Bryant Vincent, a trusted assistant under Clark, despite Vincent coaching the Blazers to a 7-6 season in 2022.\n\nIngram was steadfast in his belief in Dilfer, who won two state titles in four years at Lipscomb Academy in Nashville and served as lead coach at Elite 11 for high-level QB prospects. After his NFL career, including the 2000 championship with the Baltimore Ravens, ended in 2008, he\u2019d spent nearly a decade at ESPN.\n\nIngram said he didn\u2019t hear much criticism of the hire but scoffed at the idea of skepticism.\n\n\u201cCritics will always be there no matter who you hire,\u201d he said.\n\nDilfer was hired four days before Deion Sanders at Colorado, with both programs turning to familiar but inexperienced faces with NFL bona fides to lead their programs, though Sanders spent three seasons at Jackson State in the FCS before being hired to lead the Buffs.\n\nThis offseason, Norfolk State hired former NFL quarterback Michael Vick and Delaware State turned to former NFL receiver DeSean Jackson despite each having little or no coaching experience.\n\nIngram didn\u2019t set out to find Dilfer, but the two connected with a few conversations during the season after Clark\u2019s retirement, and Ingram found himself buying into Dilfer\u2019s vision for the program.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s high energy. He\u2019s engaging. He talks about life. \u2018If I can help you be a better person, I can help you be a better football player,\u2019\u201d Ingram said. \u201cHe just had a very different approach.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Dilfer won four games and avoided embarrassing losses but lost three conference games by more than 20 points in the far more difficult American, where UAB is taking on programs with better rosters and more well-funded teams and athletic departments.\n\nHe mostly avoided unflattering headlines, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis season, compounding the on-field struggles, was a different story.\n\nIn September, he granted his grandson\u2019s request to sit with him at the table for a sparsely attended news conference following a 41-18 loss to Navy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s like two (reporters),\u201d Dilfer said into the microphone. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is freakin\u2019 Alabama.\u201d\n\nFew were in the room, but thousands viewed the clip online. UAB has a somewhat fraught relationship with Alabama, which is also part of the University of Alabama System, and some fans were upset.\n\nDilfer\u2019s full thought, he relayed to others, was a reference that the media contingent wasn\u2019t like the crush of reporters that would be present at Alabama\u2019s game against Georgia, also played that night.\n\nIngram told The Athletic it was the kind of mistake that is magnified because UAB\u2019s program was struggling on the field.\n\nTwo days later, asked about the incident by UAB fan and podcast host John Duncan at a weekly news conference, Dilfer asked if Duncan had attended. He had not. Duncan asked if Dilfer knew the program\u2019s history and Dilfer said he was \u201cvery aware\u201d of it.\n\n\u201cA lot of UAB fans are still paranoid about the board of trustees after the 2014 shutdown and that it\u2019s out to get UAB. You just can\u2019t say something like that,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI gave him the chance to elaborate or say what he really meant. If he had said what he meant about Alabama and Georgia, the fan base might have cooled down.\n\n\u201cBut that was the moment the fan base directly turned on Trent Dilfer.\u201d\n\nA week later, on a podcast that the university produces weekly featuring Dilfer and Ingram, Dilfer made an impromptu recruiting pitch for Louisville volleyball, where his daughter played.\n\n\u201cIf you want to play big-time college volleyball go to Louisville,\u201d Dilfer said.\n\n\u201cOr UAB,\u201d Ingram interjected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. \u2026 I will say this, they\u2019re (recruiting) from different buckets, Mark.\u201d\n\nDilfer told The Athletic he was answering a question about a coach who had influenced him and he was pointing to Louisville coach Dani Busboom Kelly, who impressed Dilfer with how she built the program\u2019s culture while leading the Cardinals to national runner-up finishes twice in the past three seasons. UAB volleyball has gone 16-43 in the last two seasons.\n\n\u201cWhat I wish I would have said is Betsy Freeburg, the head volleyball coach at UAB, and I are very good friends and one of my daughters almost came down to play for her,\u201d Dilfer said. \u201cI wish I could go back in time and realize that when you\u2019re losing, as I always say, I don\u2019t like my kids, my food sucks and my wife\u2019s not as hot. Everybody else is experiencing that, too, and everything that isn\u2019t a positive will be interpreted as a hyper-negative, and that was never the intent.\u201d\n\nBoth incidents built upon a perception among some fans that Dilfer saw himself as above the program, something Dilfer said athletic department officials helped him understand in late November as criticism continued to mount.\n\n\u201cOf all the things I\u2019ve heard said about me, that has probably hurt the most,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I wish I could spend time with those people. I love this opportunity and love this city. I have no ambition of doing anything what others would perceive as \u2018bigger\u2019 than this. This is the big time.\u201d\n\nThe season\u2019s obvious struggles included ugly losses such as 72-10 to Tulane and 44-18 to Army in successive weeks in October. Dilfer called the home loss to the Green Wave \u201chumiliating,\u201d took the blame and said the city of Birmingham deserved better.\n\nThe team\u2019s wins came against FCS-level Alcorn State, Tulsa and Rice, but Dilfer found other positives in the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDilfer said coaches from each of the Blazers\u2019 final five opponents approached him on the field before the game and said his team was playing its best football, and they were \u201cso close\u201d and impressed by his team\u2019s physical approach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better to me than an opposing coach complimenting a team\u2019s effort,\u201d Dilfer said.\n\nA week after the loss to Army, UAB led bowl-bound USF 9-7 at the half before losing 35-25. It led Tulsa 45-7 at halftime in a 59-21 rout. It led nine-win UConn 20-3 at halftime before giving up 21 fourth-quarter points in a 31-23 loss. It trailed conference power Memphis 18-8 at halftime before a 53-18 loss. Rice didn\u2019t score in the final three quarters of UAB\u2019s 40-14 win.\n\nUAB suffered a loss against Army and running back Kanye Udoh during its six-game losing streak. (Danny Wild / Imagn Images)\n\nUAB closed its season on Nov. 30 with a 29-27 loss to Charlotte after Jonah Delange, one of the nation\u2019s most accurate kickers, hooked the 27-yard game-winning field goal attempt left, and Charlotte players spilled onto the field in celebration.\n\nUAB finished 2-6 in league play. UTSA in 2023 remains the only one of the six programs that moved from Conference USA to the AAC in 2023 to have a season above .500 in conference play.\n\nDilfer said he didn\u2019t want it to be an excuse, but his initial plan for success at UAB has shifted as the sport\u2019s rosters have grown more transient with the advent of immediate eligibility for transfers and NIL\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bigger challenge than I had anticipated because of the lack of time under tension with the same people,\u201d Dilfer said. \u201cAnything great is built through time under tension with the same people.\u201d\n\nHowever, all the roster upheaval in college sports is not a uniquely UAB problem.\n\nDilfer said he looks back and sees \u201c30 decisions\u201d he wishes he could have back, but said that would probably still be the case if he was presiding over a winning program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the culture of his program was compromised by external factors, \u201cconflicting agendas\u201d and \u201cnon-winning things\u201d seeping into the facility. He didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, you have to be able to recognize mistakes in real time and fix them faster than I\u2019ve fixed them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWinning is about inches and I\u2019ve allowed us to lose too many of those inches,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that from here on out, the people in this building will have the same agenda.\u201d\n\nThe offense ranked 79th in yards per play last year, down from 28th in 2023. The defense improved to 79th in yards per play from 112th a season ago.\n\nSaid Terell McDonald, a fifth-year tight end who stuck around through the coaching transitions: \u201cHe\u2019s the definition of a players\u2019 coach. Him being at the highest level and knowing what he knows, he gives us little insights and things. I\u2019ve learned a lot from him from a different perspective. He\u2019s a different, more hands-on type of coach. He\u2019ll get out there and show you what he\u2019s trying to teach you.\u201d\n\nIngram and Dilfer both pointed to a plan when it was announced that Dilfer would be back.\n\nDilfer fired defensive coordinator Sione Ta\u2019ufo\u2019ou, who came with him from Lipscomb Academy, and three more position coaches won\u2019t return. Ta\u2019ufo\u2019o had never coached in college football before Dilfer brought him in. He was one of seven of Dilfer\u2019s on-field staffers who had never been a coordinator or position coach at an FBS program before Dilfer hired them.\n\nFor many fans who initially questioned the hires, Curtis said, Dilfer making a change two years later feels like an admission the criticism was correct.\n\nLast month, Dilfer brought Steve Russ to UAB as defensive coordinator from Air Force, where he was working as special assistant to head coach Troy Calhoun. Before that, he coached linebackers with the Washington Commanders for four seasons and had been defensive coordinator at Air Force and Syracuse earlier in his career.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d \u2013 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfcf \ud83d\udd25 Get to know new @UAB_FB Defensive Coordinator Steve Russ as he and Coach Dilfer share the stage for Episode 21! \ud83d\udd17: https://t.co/8nIDLz3Zak#WinAsOne | @DilfersDimes | @CoachRuss58 pic.twitter.com/d8Tqmap96H \u2014 Inferno_Pod (@Infernopod_UAB) January 17, 2025\n\nAfter the season was complete, Dilfer spent a few days meeting one-on-one with players. He opened the floor and let them know nothing they said would be held against them. The biggest criticism they had for him, Dilfer said, was they needed him to be fiercer.\n\n\u201cWhich shocks me,\u201d Dilfer said. \u201cThat I\u2019ve done a 180 and overcorrected. When we recognize a flaw in ourselves and are willing to grow as humans, we overcorrect that because we don\u2019t like it about ourselves. I didn\u2019t like that I would lose my cool. I would lose my poise at times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2021, a video of him shoving and yelling at a player during a Lipscomb win went viral. He later apologized. In 2023, he called an outburst at a staffer during a loss to Tulane \u201cregretful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my players have said no, \u2018You\u2019re the juice man. You\u2019re the energy. You\u2019re the passion. We feed off you.\u2019 And it\u2019s not just game day. It\u2019s Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Bring it. Part of that has been freeing. But now the challenge for me is finding the balance in what used to be a fault and the overcorrection and find that God-given piece in the middle that\u2019s my best.\u201d\n\nIn this era of college football, though, teams\u2019 year-to-year fates are largely decided by which players they keep and which they lose. There are always surprises when mining the portal, but UAB\u2019s roster appears to have lost more than it gained. There is a September trip to Tennessee. And UAB is still playing in a new conference with deeper pockets and deeper rosters.\n\nWill 2025 be different? Or will the number of people around Birmingham who are with Dilfer continue to dwindle? Dilfer\u2019s contract extends through 2027. After next season, the buyout drops to $2.4 million.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gotten my best effort. But effort isn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re going to get my best humility because I\u2019ve been humbled. \u2026 This setback has reset me in a good way, and now they\u2019re gonna get my best fix.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Wesley Hitt / Getty Images)"

            "article_content": "The emergence of DeepSeek sent some tech stocks tumbling.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek? The AI chatbot is topping app store charts\n\nChina-based AI app DeepSeek, which sits atop the app store charts, made its presence widely known Monday by triggering a sharp drop in share prices for some tech giants.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the top AI chipmaker, plunged more than 17% in early trading on Monday, losing nearly $590 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3.5%.\n\nThe DeepSeek chatbot, known as R1, responds to user queries just like its U.S.-based counterparts. Early testing released by DeepSeek suggests that its quality rivals that of other AI products, while the company says it costs less and uses far fewer specialized chips than do its competitors.\n\nThe product could upend the AI industry, putting pressure on other firms to lower their costs while intensifying competition between U.S. and Chinese companies, analysts told ABC News.\n\nConcerns about data security and censorship also may expose DeepSeek to the type of scrutiny endured by social media platform TikTok, the experts added.\n\n\"This is a big moment,\" Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, who specializes in AI, told ABC News.\n\nDeepSeek did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nHere's what to know about DeepSeek, and its implications for the future of AI.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is a chatbot fueled by an algorithm that selects words based on lessons learned from scanning billions of pieces of text across the internet.\n\nWhile made in China, the app is available in multiple languages, including English. DeepSeek soared to the top of Apple's App Store chart over the weekend and remained there as of Monday.\n\nThe company said it experienced some outages on Monday affecting user signups. \"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" DeepSeek said in a statement.\n\nDeepSeek is fully available to users free of charge. By contrast, ChatGPT retains a version available for free, but offers paid monthly tiers of $20 and $200 to access additional capabilities.\n\nDevelopers of the system powering the DeepSeek AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published a research paper indicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors do.\n\nDeepSeek also says that it developed the chatbot for only $5.6 million, which if true is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by U.S. companies in the sector.\n\n\"The lower cost to train DeepSeek means it can be offered at a lower cost,\" Oren Etzioni, founder of the nonprofit TrueMedia.org and a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Washington, told ABC News. \"That puts pressure on other companies to lower their prices.\"\n\nDeepSeek's developers opted to release it as an open-source product, meaning the code that underlies the AI system is publicly available for other companies to adapt and build upon.\n\nLlama, the AI model released by Meta in 2017, is also open source. By contrast, ChatGPT as well as Alphabet's Gemini are closed-source models.\n\nProponents of open source say that publicly available code allows a wide community of AI engineers to identify and fix flaws in a system, or tailor it for a purpose separate from its originally intended function.\n\nSupporters of closed source argue that the best way to safeguard AI is to keep the computer code private so it stays out of the hands of bad actors who might repurpose it for malicious ends.\n\nIn a June 5, 2023 file photo, Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT creator takes part in a talk at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel. Amir Cohen/Reuters\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek flexes the strength of the Chinese tech sector in an industry previously viewed by many analysts as one dominated by U.S. firms, experts said.\n\nFor some, the sudden arrival of a top China-based competitor raises concerns about data security and content manipulation similar to those leveled at TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.\n\nRegarding the former users on social media have posted numerous examples of DeepSeek choosing to forego answers on topics potentially sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of anti-government protestors.\n\n\"It's clear that there's some censorship built into the system,\" Marcus said. \"We don't want governments in control of what people can say.\"\n\nBoth foreign-owned and U.S.-based AI chatbots pose data concerns, however, since users sometimes enter personal or intimate information, which in turn could be used for commercial purposes, Marcus added.\n\n\"You have to assume that anything you type into a large language model could be seen by someone else,\" Marcus said.\n\nStill, DeepSeek's low-cost technological advance using outdated chips marks a major new entry into the AI market, Sosnick said, in turn forcing people to \"rethink assumptions that they had.\"\n\nThe emergence of a relatively cost-efficient alternative to other AI chatbots helps explain Monday's dip in the share value of Nvidia, which premises future growth on increased demand for new, expensive chips, Etzioni said.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Nvidia described DeepSeek as \"an excellent AI advancement,\" noting how the firm leveraged \"widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant\" \u2013 the latter apparently referring to controls put in place by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China.\n\nEtzioni said the open-source nature of DeepSeek also could challenge the profitability of other AI firms aiming to charge third parties for access to their products.\n\n\"We're soon going to see many models built on DeepSeek,\" Etzioni said."

            "article_content": "The groundbreaking aspect of the otherwise copycat chatbot was that DeepSeek was created without access to the most advanced semiconductors and at a claimed cost of around $5 million, a tiny fraction of the expense of developing rival AI models. In the stock market, shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of AI chips, dropped 17 percent , while other tech stocks also took a hit.\n\nThe free-of-charge app, launched last week, showed off conversational chops close to the level of ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI offerings from US companies. (Just don\u2019t ask it questions about Chinese politics .) Over the weekend, DeepSeek rocketed to the most downloaded position in the app stores of Apple and Google.\n\nBy some measures, Boston\u2019s startup ecosystem has been left far behind Silicon Valley in the race to develop artificial intelligence. But the shocking emergence of Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek could actually help Boston catch up.\n\nAs Globe tech columnist Hiawatha Bray noted, DeepSeek published a white paper revealing how it developed the model inexpensively, which should help AI researchers all over the world make advancements more quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is the next piece in the AI arms race,\u201d said computer science professor Elke Rundensteiner at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. \u201cNew AI models like DeepSeek are fuel for launching new startups and accelerating existing ones in New England and beyond.\u201d\n\nSo far, California has dominated Boston and other regions in raising venture capital backing for AI startups. Out west, most of the money has gone to companies developing underlying tech like ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Boston\u2019s ecosystem has focused on building applications that use AI, or in the case of MIT spinoff Liquid AI, creating its own version of much cheaper AI models.\n\nVenture capitalist Jeff Bussgang at Flybridge Capital Partners sees the plummeting cost of AI as a boon for local startups. \u201cWe saw it with cloud computing and we are seeing it now with AI,\u201d Bussgang said. \u201cAs a result, we will see an explosion of demand and AI-based apps will benefit tremendously.\u201d\n\nCheaper AI could also benefit public companies in the area that have been adding AI features. Shares of HubSpot and Klaviyo have gained about 11 percent each so far this week, as the companies have been incorporating AI services into their marketing and customer service software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI tech may not be quite so beneficial for the stock market at large, where seven tech giants each valued at more than $1 trillion dominate market indexes. The fallout could be more severe, and some have drawn parallels to the end of the internet bubble.\n\nFrom the start of 1995 to March 2000, the Nasdaq Composite Index increased almost 600 percent. Then over the weekend of March 18, 2000, Barrons magazine published a cover story headlined \u201cBurning Up,\u201d which provided evidence that hundreds of dot-com companies would run out of money by year-end.\n\nWithin a year, the index had fallen more than 60 percent and didn\u2019t reach 5,000 again for 14 years.\n\nThe leaders of the current tech big seven, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Apple chief executive Tim Cook, all will address Wall Street analysts in the coming weeks as they report fourth-quarter results. Their responses to the DeepSeek shockwave could make or break the internet bubble analogy.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to act as an overhang on the technology and energy sectors until a broad array of company management teams provide their own insight/perspectives during the Q4\u201924 earnings season,\u201d a team of analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote on Monday.\n\nAaron Pressman can be reached at aaron.pressman@globe.com.

            "article_content": "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking\n\n20 hours ago Kelly Ng, Brandon Drenon, Tom Gerken and Marc Cieslak BBC News\n\nGetty Images DeepSeek has stunned the world - what do we know about it?\n\nA Chinese-made artificial intelligence (AI) model called DeepSeek has shot to the top of Apple Store's downloads, stunning investors and sinking some tech stocks. Its latest version was released on 20 January, quickly impressing AI experts before it got the attention of the entire tech industry - and the world. US President Donald Trump said it was a \"wake-up call\" for US companies who must focus on \"competing to win\". What makes DeepSeek so special is the company's claim that it was built at a fraction of the cost of industry-leading models like OpenAI - because it uses fewer advanced chips. That possibility caused chip-making giant Nvidia to shed almost $600bn (\u00a3482bn) of its market value on Monday - the biggest one-day loss in US history. DeepSeek also raises questions about Washington's efforts to contain Beijing's push for tech supremacy, given that one of its key restrictions has been a ban on the export of advanced chips to China. Beijing, however, has doubled down, with President Xi Jinping declaring AI a top priority. And start-ups like DeepSeek are crucial as China pivots from traditional manufacturing such as clothes and furniture to advanced tech - chips, electric vehicles and AI. So what do we know about DeepSeek?\n\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\n\nAI can, at times, make a computer seem like a person. A machine uses the technology to learn and solve problems, typically by being trained on massive amounts of information and recognising patterns. The end result is software that can have conversations like a person or predict people's shopping habits. In recent years, it has become best known as the tech behind chatbots such as ChatGPT - and DeepSeek - also known as generative AI. These programs again learn from huge swathes of data, including online text and images, to be able to make new content. But these tools can create falsehoods and often repeat the biases contained within their training data. Millions of people use tools such as ChatGPT to help them with everyday tasks like writing emails, summarising text, and answering questions - and others even use them to help with basic coding and studying.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek is the name of a free AI-powered chatbot, which looks, feels and works very much like ChatGPT. That means it's used for many of the same tasks, though exactly how well it works compared to its rivals is up for debate. It is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI's o1 model - released at the end of last year - in tasks including mathematics and coding. Like o1, R1 is a \"reasoning\" model. These models produce responses incrementally, simulating a process similar to how humans reason through problems or ideas. It uses less memory than its rivals, ultimately reducing the cost to perform tasks. Like many other Chinese AI models - Baidu's Ernie or Doubao by ByteDance - DeepSeek is trained to avoid politically sensitive questions. When the BBC asked the app what happened at Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, DeepSeek did not give any details about the massacre, a taboo topic in China. It replied: \"I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.\" Chinese government censorship is a huge challenge for its AI aspirations internationally. But DeepSeek's base model appears to have been trained via accurate sources while introducing a layer of censorship or withholding certain information via an additional safeguarding layer. Deepseek says it has been able to do this cheaply - researchers behind it claim it cost $6m (\u00a34.8m) to train, a fraction of the \"over $100m\" alluded to by OpenAI boss Sam Altman when discussing GPT-4. DeepSeek's founder reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, which have been banned from export to China since September 2022. Some experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to build such a powerful AI model, by pairing these chips with cheaper, less sophisticated ones. The same day DeepSeek's AI assistant became the most-downloaded free app on Apple's App Store in the US, it was hit with \"large-scale malicious attacks\", the company said, causing the company to temporary limit registrations. It was also hit by outages on its website on Monday.\n\nWatch: What is DeepSeek? The BBC's AI correspondent explains\n\nWho is behind DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek was founded in December 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, and released its first AI large language model the following year. Not much is known about Liang, who graduated from Zhejiang University with degrees in electronic information engineering and computer science. But he now finds himself in the international spotlight. He was recently seen at a meeting hosted by China's premier Li Qiang, reflecting DeepSeek's growing prominence in the AI industry. Unlike many American AI entrepreneurs who are from Silicon Valley, Mr Liang also has a background in finance. He is the CEO of a hedge fund called High-Flyer, which uses AI to analyse financial data to make investment decisons - what is called quantitative trading. In 2019 High-Flyer became the first quant hedge fund in China to raise over 100 billion yuan ($13m). In a speech he gave that year, Liang said, \"If the US can develop its quantitative trading sector, why not China?\" In a rare interview last year, he said China's AI sector \"cannot remain a follower forever\". He went on: \"Often, we say there's a one or two-year gap between Chinese and American AI, but the real gap is between originality and imitation. If this doesn't change, China will always be a follower.\" Asked why DeepSeek's model surprised so many in Silicon Valley, he said: \"Their surprise stems from seeing a Chinese company join their game as an innovator, not just a follower - which is what most Chinese firms are accustomed to.\" Australia's science minister has raised some doubts over the security of the app. \"There are a lot of questions that will need to be answered in time on quality, consumer preferences, data and privacy management,\" Ed Husic told ABC. \"I would be very careful about that. These type of issues need to be weighed up carefully.\"\n\nHow are US companies like Nvidia hit?\n\nDeepSeek's achievements undercut the belief that bigger budgets and top-tier chips are the only ways of advancing AI, a prospect which has created uncertainty about the future of high-performance chips. \"DeepSeek has proven that cutting-edge AI models can be developed with limited compute resources,\" says Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research. \"In contrast, OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, faces scrutiny over its ability to maintain a dominant edge in innovation or justify its massive valuation and expenditures without delivering significant returns.\" The company's possibly lower costs roiled financial markets on 27 January, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall more than 3% in a broad sell-off that included chip makers and data centres around the world. Nvidia appears to have been hit the worst as its stock price plunged 17% on Monday before slowly beginning to recover on Tuesday, roughly 4% by midday. The chip maker had been the most valuable company in the world, when measured by market capitalisation, but fell to third place after Apple and Microsoft on Monday, when its market value shrank to $2.9tn from $3.5tn, Forbes reported. DeepSeek is a privately owned company, which means investors cannot buy shares of stock on any of the major exchanges.\n\nWatch: DeepSeek AI bot responds to BBC question about Tiananmen Square\n\nChina is celebrating DeepSeek's impact"

Yet another hotline thriller focusing on a person answering a phone - this night he receives an odd, paranormal call. There have been a few of these recently - including The Guilty with Jake Gyllenhaal or Tessa Thompson's The Listener. In Lifeline, a suicide hotline operator gets a late-night call from someone who claims to be him, knowing private details only he would know, and threatening to end his life in an hour. The operator must race against time to stop \"himself\" from suicide. Josh Stewart stars as Steven Thomas, along with August Maturo, Charlene Amoia, Jocelyn Ayanna, Nicole Santiago, Jill Awbrey, & Brecken Merrill. This also reminds me of the film Frequency (2000) about a father and son connecting across time through the phone. Lifeline looks much better than it sounds.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Feras Alfuqaha's film Lifeline, direct from YouTube:\n\nA late-night suicide hotline operator named Steven Thomas (starring Josh Stewart) receives a disturbing call from someone claiming to be him, knowing personal details only he would know. The caller threatens to end his life within the hour, forcing the operator into a tense, emotional race against time. As the clock ticks down, he must confront his deepest fears and uncover the truth before it's too late to save \"himself.\" Lifeline is directed by the indie producer / filmmaker Feras Alfuqaha, now making his feature directorial debut after producing a number of other projects as well. The screenplay is written by Brady Morell and Brian Price. Produced by Feras Alfuqaha and Leal Naim. Dark Sky Films will debut Alfuqaha's Lifeline film in select US theaters + on VOD starting on February 21st, 2025 coming soon. Who wants to watch this?"

The new planet, with a mass six times that of Earth's, orbits a star similar to our Sun. It has been named HD 20794 d and confirmed by an international team of scientists. It was originally found two years ago by Dr Michael Cretignier from Oxford University's physics department and is located in the Eridanus constellation. Dr Cretignier explained: \"With its location in a habitable zone and relatively close proximity to Earth, this planet could play a pivotal role in future missions that will characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for biosignatures indicating potential life.\" He first identified the potential exoplanet signal in 2022 while studying archive data recorded by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Such data analyses light absorbed and emitted by objects.\n\nREAD MORE NASA breakthrough as experts discover there may be life on Uranus moons\n\nThe new planet has a mass six times that of Earth\n\nThe expert spotted periodic shifts in the spectrum of light emitted by the host star, which Oxford University said could have been caused by a nearby planet's gravitational pull. At the time of Dr Cretignier's initial discovery, it was unclear if the signal was caused by a planet, the star or if it was just a technical glitch. Members from the international team of scientists studied \"highly-precise\" measurements taken over 20 years by HARPS and the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO). The two instruments are among the most advanced in the world for measuring tiny variations in light. Detailed in a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the discovery also relied on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Dr Cretignier said scientists worked on the data for years, analysing and eliminating possible sources of contamination to pinpoint the planet's signal. The discovery was confirmed after the results from HARPS and ESPRESSO were combined.\n\nThe new planet was originally found two years ago (file image)\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence has often been criticized for its tendency to hallucinate - producing plausible yet inaccurate or unrelated outputs. However, in an unconventional twist to artificial intelligence research, the study \"Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery\" by Shuzhou Yuan and Michael F\u00e4rber, from the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI) in Germany, challenges conventional AI concerns about hallucinations.\n\nSubmitted on arXiv, the research posits that hallucinations - commonly seen as an AI drawback - could instead unlock creative potential, particularly in the complex realm of drug discovery. This groundbreaking work provides evidence that incorporating hallucinated text into prompts can significantly improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying molecular properties, fostering innovative approaches to pharmaceutical research.\n\nHallucinations: A problem turned opportunity\n\nHallucinations in LLMs refer to instances where models generate plausible yet incorrect or unrelated information. Traditionally regarded as a flaw that undermines AI reliability, hallucinations have raised significant concerns across applications. However, in domains like drug discovery, where creativity and abstraction are vital, these seemingly erroneous outputs can serve as unexpected assets. By expanding on existing knowledge and introducing novel associations, hallucinated descriptions align closely with the creative demands of exploring uncharted chemical spaces.\n\nIn drug discovery, the process of identifying and testing potential therapeutic compounds is both time-intensive and costly. This study explores whether the integration of hallucinated molecular descriptions into LLM prompts can facilitate tasks such as toxicity prediction, property classification, and antiviral efficacy assessment. Surprisingly, the results reveal that hallucinations enhance model performance across these tasks.\n\nThe researchers evaluated the effects of hallucinated text on seven LLMs, including Llama-3.1-8B, Ministral-8B, Falcon3-Mamba-7B, ChemLLM-7B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4o. The methodology involved generating textual descriptions of molecules from SMILES strings\u2014a standardized molecular representation\u2014and incorporating these hallucinated descriptions into prompts. The LLMs were tasked with predicting specific properties, such as HIV replication inhibition or blood-brain barrier penetration.\n\nKey Results:\n\nImproved Performance : LLMs using hallucinated descriptions outperformed those relying solely on SMILES strings or reference descriptions generated by domain-specific models like MolT5. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieved an 18.35% improvement in ROC-AUC compared to the SMILES baseline.\n\n: LLMs using hallucinated descriptions outperformed those relying solely on SMILES strings or reference descriptions generated by domain-specific models like MolT5. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieved an 18.35% improvement in ROC-AUC compared to the SMILES baseline. GPT-4o's Consistency : Among all models, GPT-4o provided the most consistent enhancements, contributing to significant performance gains across tasks.\n\n: Among all models, GPT-4o provided the most consistent enhancements, contributing to significant performance gains across tasks. Model Size and Hallucination Utility: Larger models demonstrated a stronger capacity to leverage hallucinated text, with performance gains plateauing at around 8 billion parameters.\n\nInsights and implications\n\nThe research highlights that hallucinations are not merely random noise but often contain \"faithful\" yet unrelated information. These creative elements - such as suggestions for molecular applications - prompt LLMs to make connections that enhance their predictive capabilities. For example, hallucinated descriptions often include imaginative interpretations of molecular functions or properties, which can indirectly guide the models toward more accurate classifications.\n\nKey findings:\n\nLanguage Matters : Hallucinations in different languages produced varied effects, with Chinese hallucinations leading to the highest improvements, despite Chinese not being a pre-trained language for certain models.\n\n: Hallucinations in different languages produced varied effects, with Chinese hallucinations leading to the highest improvements, despite Chinese not being a pre-trained language for certain models. Temperature Tuning : The randomness parameter, known as temperature, minimally impacted hallucination quality, suggesting that performance gains stem primarily from the content itself rather than generation variability.\n\n: The randomness parameter, known as temperature, minimally impacted hallucination quality, suggesting that performance gains stem primarily from the content itself rather than generation variability. Enhanced Attention: Case studies revealed that hallucinated phrases like \u201cpotential applications in drug discovery\u201d received disproportionately high attention scores, bolstering model confidence in predictions.\n\nImplications for drug discovery and beyond\n\nThis novel perspective on hallucinations opens new avenues for AI applications in scientific research. By leveraging hallucinations, researchers can explore vast chemical spaces more effectively, accelerating pharmaceutical innovation. Hallucinated descriptions allow AI systems to identify novel therapeutic candidates with reduced trial-and-error cycles, ultimately saving time and resources in drug discovery. Beyond pharmaceuticals, hallucinations could drive creativity in materials science, biology, and other domains where solving complex problems requires imaginative approaches and innovative thinking.\n\nMoreover, the study challenges traditional metrics for evaluating AI reliability, encouraging a shift from solely assessing factual accuracy to considering contextual value. In certain applications, the ability of AI to generate creative and abstract insights may outweigh the necessity for precise factual alignment. This perspective paves the way for redefining how AI contributions are assessed and integrated into scientific workflows, promoting the use of imaginative outputs in contexts where creativity complements analytical rigor.\n\nFuture directions\n\nThis study provides a foundation for exploring how hallucinations and uncertainty calibration can be systematically harnessed in other scientific and creative fields. Future research could focus on refining Large Language Models (LLMs) to better balance factual accuracy with creative exploration. For example, in domains like drug discovery, materials science, and creative content generation, controlled hallucinations - imaginative yet structured outputs - could help uncover novel solutions, enhance hypothesis generation, or inspire innovative designs.\n\nEthical and practical considerations should guide this exploration. Fine-tuning LLMs to generate \"productive\" hallucinations while minimizing misleading or harmful outputs is a critical challenge. Researchers must develop tools to measure and categorize hallucinations, distinguishing between creative and detrimental ones. Additionally, feedback loops between human experts and AI systems could enhance model performance, ensuring hallucinations align with domain-specific objectives.\n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration will also play a vital role. Engaging domain experts, ethicists, and AI developers in co-designing systems will help ensure that AI applications remain transparent, reliable, and user-centered. By integrating these perspectives, future LLMs could become invaluable partners in solving complex global challenges while upholding ethical standards.\n\nLastly, advancements in multimodal AI - combining text, image, and data inputs - offer opportunities to contextualize and validate hallucinated outputs. For instance, in medical diagnostics, pairing text-based insights with visual data (e.g., imaging scans) could enhance decision-making accuracy. Similarly, integrating structured and unstructured data in fields like climate science or economics could provide more nuanced and actionable insights.\n\nBy fostering creativity, enhancing transparency, and aligning outputs with human goals, LLMs could redefine the boundaries of innovation across industries."

            "article_content": "Chinese startup DeepSeek stunned the world with its sophisticated DeepSeek R1 reasoning model, which is as good as ChatGPT o1. That\u2019s not a surprising achievement; it\u2019s only a matter of time before other AI models can replicate what OpenAI has done in terms of AI reasoning. Also, OpenAI will soon make o3 available, the successor to o1.\n\nWhat really shocked the markets was DeepSeek\u2019s research, which showed that the company was able to train R1 to achieve the same capabilities at a fraction of the cost of training o1.\n\nBecause of US sanctions, DeepSeek didn\u2019t have access to the latest NVIDIA GPUs that AI firms like OpenAI use to train high-end AI models. It turned to software optimizations to compensate for what it lacked in hardware to create an AI model that could match ChatGPT o1.\n\nBut it turns out software optimization isn\u2019t everything DeepSeek might have done to train its AI. OpenAI claims it has evidence that DeepSeek distilled ChatGPT to train the DeepSeek AI models.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, the practice violates OpenAI\u2019s terms of service for ChatGPT. Ironically, if OpenAI\u2019s claim is true, it\u2019ll make the company experience what many creators felt when they discovered OpenAI may have trained its ChatGPT models using copyrighted materials without consent.\n\nOpenAI told The Financial Times it found evidence that DeepSeek used the US models to train DeepSeek AI.\n\nOpenAI found evidence of \u201cdistillation,\u201d which it believes came from DeepSeek. Distillation is a process where AI firms use an already trained large AI model to train smaller models. The \u201cstudent\u201d models will match similar results to the \u201cteacher\u201d AI in specific tasks.\n\nSome early DeepSeek testers were surprised to see the AI identify itself as ChatGPT in early responses, which prompted speculation that DeepSeek AI might have been trained with ChatGPT chats.\n\nOpenAI claims that DeepSeek might have distilled ChatGPT make sense, but it\u2019s unclear whether the US AI firm can prove the IP theft beyond doubt. Even if it can provide conclusive evidence that DeepSeek used ChatGPT to train its AIs, there\u2019s probably little OpenAI can do. After all, DeepSeek R1 is already out in the wild.\n\nDeepSeek made its models available open-source, which means anyone can install them on computers. The DeepSeek app is topping the App Store, and it\u2019s available in the Google Play store. Unless DeepSeek is banned in the US, the app won\u2019t go away anytime soon.\n\nThe FT says that OpenAI and Microsoft investigated accounts believed to belong to DeepSeeka last year. They were using OpenAI\u2019s API for ChatGPT access. OpenAI blocked access, suspecting they may rely on distillation to train other models.\n\nDeepSeek has not commented on these allegations. The company is seen as a hero in China after the release of DeepSeek R1, which wiped nearly $1 billion from the US market.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s not just Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek that might rely on the distillation of ChatGPT and other frontier AIs to train better AI models. The FT notes that it\u2019s common practice for AI labs in China and the US to use outputs from bigger companies.\n\nOpenAI and others have already trained AI using humans to teach the models how to produce responses that sound more conversational. This is an expensive process, so smaller firms will distill established models to train smaller ones. In such a case, a company like DeepSeek would have gotten the human feedback step for free.\n\nI said earlier that DeepSeek\u2019s use of distillation to train R1 is something others could benefit from, Apple included. I wasn\u2019t referring to stealing AI work done by others but to using advanced, proprietary models to train smaller models that Apple might need for its on-device Apple Intelligence approach.\n\nIf OpenAI has strong evidence that DeepSeek used ChatGPT to train its AI models, we could be looking at the second good reason to ban DeepSeek in the US and elsewhere. The first is that DeepSeek collects plenty of user data and sends it all to China.\n\nA ban is a process that will take time. And, again, even if all of this is successful, DeepSeek will still have strong AI models on its hands, which it can use to create next-gen AI of its own.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI still has to deal with allegations that it used copyrighted content without consent to create ChatGPT."

            "article_content": "82% of companies are fed up with Oracle pricing\n\nJava turns 30 years old in 2025. What better time to release the 2025 State of Java Survey and Report? Our second annual survey serves as a guide to understanding Java adoption and trends, and confirms Java\u2019s impact on application performance, developer productivity, and AI development. More than ever before, Java continues to lead in innovation, adaptability, and performance.\n\nWelcome to Azul\u2019s 2025 State of Java Survey & Report, a study of more than 2,000 Java professionals worldwide. The report uncovers how enterprises are tackling Oracle Java pricing and licensing challenges, strategies for addressing cloud costs, factors impacting DevOps productivity, and the role of Java in AI development.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the important results and trends from the 2025 State of Java Survey & Report.\n\nJava\u2019s continuing influence in the enterprise\n\nJava remains a cornerstone for enterprise application development. Only 1% of those contacted to participate in the survey were disqualified because they don\u2019t use Java. In addition, nearly 70% of respondents say that more than half of their applications are built with Java or run on a JVM.\n\n19% of participants use Java 6 or 7, two of the oldest versions still in production (remember Java 6 was originally released in 2006!), and 49% use Java 17 or 21, the two newest Long-Term Support (LTS) versions. The results underscore Java\u2019s role for both maintaining legacy applications and systems and for running modern, scalable applications and architectures.\n\nMore than just a programming language and a force for technical stability, Java is a critical enabler of enterprise innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence (more on that later).\n\nThe Great Oracle Java Migration gains momentum\n\nTwo years after Oracle introduced its employee-based pricing for Oracle Java SE in January 2023, organizations continue to grapple with Oracle\u2019s employee-based pricing model. 82% of Oracle Java users express concern over its cost structure \u2014 a figure unchanged since Azul\u2019s 2023 survey. Oracle Java users are turning their displeasure into action and joining The Great Oracle Java Migration. 88% of Oracle Java users are considering a switch to another Java provider. Nearly half of these companies plan to migrate to an OpenJDK distribution with paid support, preferring a cost-effective yet reliable solution.\n\n88% of Oracle Java users are considering a switch to another Java provider.\n\nAs organizations recognize the value of paid support, they are considering switching Java providers for two main reasons \u2013 cost and experience.\n\nOverall, 79% of Oracle Java users who are considering migrating to another distribution cited Oracle as a reason. In fact, seven of the top eight responses were about Oracle, and four of them were about Oracle\u2019s behavior and the experience of being a customer (including sales tactics, pricing uncertainty, and audits). These responses underscore that organizations increasingly seek cost-effective, flexible, and transparent alternatives to Oracle Java to mitigate financial and operational risks.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n7 of the top 8 reasons for migrating from Oracle Java to an OpenJDK distribution were about Oracle pricing or support, or the experience of being an Oracle Java customer.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAzul Platform Core customers typically pay 70% less than Oracle for licensing fees and support. They also have commercial support available for Java 6 and 7, which they can\u2019t get from any other distribution, and Azul is the only Java provider besides Oracle that delivers stabilized security builds. Azul also delivers full updates every quarter that combine bug fixes, new features, and security patches.\n\nOrganizations tackle cloud costs, but overages are still high\n\nAs organizations increase their public cloud footprint, they are dedicating more than half of their cloud capacity to Java workloads. In a clear sign of inefficient resource allocation, most participants in this survey have more than 20% of their cloud compute capacity sitting idle. Overprovisioning not only inflates operating costs but also diverts funds that they could invest in innovation or growth initiatives.\n\nOptimizing Java in the cloud presents a substantial opportunity to reduce costs without compromising performance. Organizations are taking steps to better align their cloud investments with actual usage. They are making behavioral changes like implementing internal rules and establishing DevOps functions. They are also using more efficient processors and autoscaling their workloads. In addition, a quarter of participants are using a high-performance Java runtime to improve application performance, optimize cloud compute costs, and improve customer experiences.\n\nOrganizations are leveraging many different approaches to curb cloud spend, including utilizing a high-performance JDK.\n\nAzul Platform Prime is an enhanced build of OpenJDK, with additional features for faster and more consistent steady-state performance, faster startup and warmup, and more efficient use of resources. Azul Prime customers enjoy better performance and lower cloud and infrastructure costs.\n\nCode management and security impact DevOps productivity\n\nThe survey reveals significant challenges to application development productivity. Organizations must remove efficiency barriers to development if they are to bring new features to their customers faster. Dead or unused code is a major challenge, and 62% of survey participants report that it affects their DevOps teams\u2019 effectiveness.\n\nA third of participants say their DevOps teams waste more than half their time addressing false positives from Java-related security vulnerabilities. 41% report that they encounter critical production security issues within their Java ecosystem on a weekly or daily basis. The high frequency of false positives can become overwhelming, leading to alert fatigue and reducing employees\u2019 attentiveness to genuine security threats.\n\nFalse positives prevent efficient vulnerability triage.\n\nWhen DevOps can\u2019t separate the real vulnerabilities from the plethora of alerts, notifications, and sometimes even spam, they have to siphon resources away from development and other priorities. But they must remain vigilant. Half of companies still report finding vulnerable versions of the Log4j library in production, more than two years after a patch was made available.\n\nAzul Intelligence Cloud has two unique capabilities to help with DevOps productivity. Azul Code Inventory catalogs what code runs in production across an enterprise\u2019s Java workloads. It slashes the time and burden of identifying dead and unused code, allowing developers to focus on the code that actually matters (and over time prune the code that doesn\u2019t). Azul Vulnerability Detection detects vulnerable code that is actually run in production (versus simply present in the jar or container), eliminating false positives to enable rapid and efficient vulnerability triage.\n\nJava powers enterprise AI development\n\nTypically, when the topic of developing AI or ML functionality arises, people think of Python. Perhaps surprisingly, the survey found that Java was used more often than either Python or other languages. In fact, 50% of organizations use Java to code AI functionality.\n\n50% of companies that build AI functionality build it with Java.\n\nAI impacts the way organizations strategize, build code, and maintain applications and infrastructure. As you might expect, this AI adoption comes with infrastructure implications, and 72% of survey participants say their compute capacity will have to grow for them to support Java applications with AI functionality.\n\nState of Java Survey & Report is available now\n\nThis report shows organizations are actively seeking ways to optimize their Java deployments to drive operational efficiency and cost predictability. As Java continues to be the backbone for business-critical applications in the enterprise, we\u2019re seeing important trends \u2014 from the growing interest in Oracle Java alternatives to cloud optimization strategies, improvements in DevOps productivity, and innovation with AI.

Consumer awareness of environmental concerns has never been higher, and businesses are responding with packaging innovations that reduce waste, lower carbon emissions, and enhance recyclability.\n\nOne of the most notable trends is the rise of bio-based materials. Plant-based plastics, algae-derived films, and mushroom-based packaging are gaining traction as viable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based plastics.\n\nThese materials not only decompose naturally but also reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nRecycled materials are also playing a crucial role in the sustainable packaging movement. Brands are increasingly using post-consumer recycled (PCR) content in their packaging, reducing the demand for virgin materials.\n\nPaper and cardboard packaging, often sourced from sustainably managed forests, continue to be popular due to their recyclability and consumer-friendly appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, biodegradable and compostable packaging options are evolving to meet both environmental and functional demands. Companies are investing in materials that break down efficiently under industrial composting conditions while maintaining durability for product protection.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

In the UK and EU, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies are becoming more stringent, making producers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their packaging.\n\nThe upcoming Plastic Packaging Tax revisions are expected to place further financial pressure on businesses that fail to incorporate recycled content.\n\nAs regulations become more rigorous, businesses are investing in innovation to stay ahead. Smart packaging solutions, such as QR codes that guide consumers on proper disposal methods, are becoming increasingly common.\n\nThese digital integrations not only improve sustainability efforts but also enhance customer engagement by offering transparency about packaging materials and their environmental impact.\n\nMoreover, refillable and reusable packaging systems are gaining popularity. Major brands are exploring circular packaging models where consumers can return containers for reuse.\n\nSupermarkets are introducing refill stations for products like detergents, personal care items, and dry foods, reducing reliance on single-use plastics. Such initiatives align with both regulatory requirements and consumer demand for waste reduction.\n\nConsumer demand shapes packaging strategies\n\nConsumer preferences are significantly influencing the direction of eco-friendly packaging trends in 2025. Shoppers are actively seeking brands that prioritise sustainability, and companies that fail to adapt risk losing market share.\n\nA growing number of consumers are scrutinising packaging labels, looking for certifications such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and plastic-free seals.\n\nMinimalist packaging is another rising trend, driven by the preference for less material usage and a cleaner aesthetic. Excessive packaging is increasingly seen as wasteful, prompting brands to adopt streamlined designs with fewer layers.\n\nPackaging that serves multiple functions, such as being repurposed for storage or converted into another useful item, is also gaining traction.\n\nTransparency is now a key factor in packaging design. Brands are openly communicating their sustainability commitments, providing clear information on materials used and their environmental impact.\n\nDigital packaging innovations, such as augmented reality (AR), allow consumers to scan packaging for deeper insights into sourcing, production, and disposal methods.\n\nLooking ahead, eco-friendly packaging will continue to evolve as businesses refine their strategies to meet environmental targets and consumer expectations.\n\nThe industry is on the cusp of transformative change, and those embracing sustainable innovations will not only enhance their brand reputation but also contribute to a more circular economy.\n\nAs 2025 approaches, the message is clear\u2014eco-packaging is not just a trend but a fundamental shift shaping the future of the industry."

The new planet, with a mass six times that of Earth's, orbits a star similar to our Sun. It has been named HD 20794 d and confirmed by an international team of scientists. It was originally found two years ago by Dr Michael Cretignier from Oxford University's physics department and is located in the Eridanus constellation. Dr Cretignier explained: \"With its location in a habitable zone and relatively close proximity to Earth, this planet could play a pivotal role in future missions that will characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for biosignatures indicating potential life.\" He first identified the potential exoplanet signal in 2022 while studying archive data recorded by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Such data analyses light absorbed and emitted by objects.\n\nREAD MORE NASA breakthrough as experts discover there may be life on Uranus moons\n\nThe new planet has a mass six times that of Earth\n\nThe expert spotted periodic shifts in the spectrum of light emitted by the host star, which Oxford University said could have been caused by a nearby planet's gravitational pull. At the time of Dr Cretignier's initial discovery, it was unclear if the signal was caused by a planet, the star or if it was just a technical glitch. Members from the international team of scientists studied \"highly-precise\" measurements taken over 20 years by HARPS and the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO). The two instruments are among the most advanced in the world for measuring tiny variations in light. Detailed in a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the discovery also relied on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Dr Cretignier said scientists worked on the data for years, analysing and eliminating possible sources of contamination to pinpoint the planet's signal. The discovery was confirmed after the results from HARPS and ESPRESSO were combined.\n\nThe new planet was originally found two years ago (file image)\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence has often been criticized for its tendency to hallucinate - producing plausible yet inaccurate or unrelated outputs. However, in an unconventional twist to artificial intelligence research, the study \"Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery\" by Shuzhou Yuan and Michael F\u00e4rber, from the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI) in Germany, challenges conventional AI concerns about hallucinations.\n\nSubmitted on arXiv, the research posits that hallucinations - commonly seen as an AI drawback - could instead unlock creative potential, particularly in the complex realm of drug discovery. This groundbreaking work provides evidence that incorporating hallucinated text into prompts can significantly improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying molecular properties, fostering innovative approaches to pharmaceutical research.\n\nHallucinations: A problem turned opportunity\n\nHallucinations in LLMs refer to instances where models generate plausible yet incorrect or unrelated information. Traditionally regarded as a flaw that undermines AI reliability, hallucinations have raised significant concerns across applications. However, in domains like drug discovery, where creativity and abstraction are vital, these seemingly erroneous outputs can serve as unexpected assets. By expanding on existing knowledge and introducing novel associations, hallucinated descriptions align closely with the creative demands of exploring uncharted chemical spaces.\n\nIn drug discovery, the process of identifying and testing potential therapeutic compounds is both time-intensive and costly. This study explores whether the integration of hallucinated molecular descriptions into LLM prompts can facilitate tasks such as toxicity prediction, property classification, and antiviral efficacy assessment. Surprisingly, the results reveal that hallucinations enhance model performance across these tasks.\n\nThe researchers evaluated the effects of hallucinated text on seven LLMs, including Llama-3.1-8B, Ministral-8B, Falcon3-Mamba-7B, ChemLLM-7B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4o. The methodology involved generating textual descriptions of molecules from SMILES strings\u2014a standardized molecular representation\u2014and incorporating these hallucinated descriptions into prompts. The LLMs were tasked with predicting specific properties, such as HIV replication inhibition or blood-brain barrier penetration.\n\nKey Results:\n\nImproved Performance : LLMs using hallucinated descriptions outperformed those relying solely on SMILES strings or reference descriptions generated by domain-specific models like MolT5. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieved an 18.35% improvement in ROC-AUC compared to the SMILES baseline.\n\n: LLMs using hallucinated descriptions outperformed those relying solely on SMILES strings or reference descriptions generated by domain-specific models like MolT5.

GPT-4o's Consistency : Among all models, GPT-4o provided the most consistent enhancements, contributing to significant performance gains across tasks.\n\n: Among all models, GPT-4o provided the most consistent enhancements, contributing to significant performance gains across tasks. Model Size and Hallucination Utility: Larger models demonstrated a stronger capacity to leverage hallucinated text, with performance gains plateauing at around 8 billion parameters.\n\nInsights and implications\n\nThe research highlights that hallucinations are not merely random noise but often contain \"faithful\" yet unrelated information. These creative elements - such as suggestions for molecular applications - prompt LLMs to make connections that enhance their predictive capabilities. For example, hallucinated descriptions often include imaginative interpretations of molecular functions or properties, which can indirectly guide the models toward more accurate classifications.\n\nKey findings:\n\nLanguage Matters : Hallucinations in different languages produced varied effects, with Chinese hallucinations leading to the highest improvements, despite Chinese not being a pre-trained language for certain models.\n\n: Hallucinations in different languages produced varied effects, with Chinese hallucinations leading to the highest improvements, despite Chinese not being a pre-trained language for certain models. Temperature Tuning : The randomness parameter, known as temperature, minimally impacted hallucination quality, suggesting that performance gains stem primarily from the content itself rather than generation variability.\n\n: The randomness parameter, known as temperature, minimally impacted hallucination quality, suggesting that performance gains stem primarily from the content itself rather than generation variability. Enhanced Attention: Case studies revealed that hallucinated phrases like \u201cpotential applications in drug discovery\u201d received disproportionately high attention scores, bolstering model confidence in predictions.\n\nImplications for drug discovery and beyond\n\nThis novel perspective on hallucinations opens new avenues for AI applications in scientific research. By leveraging hallucinations, researchers can explore vast chemical spaces more effectively, accelerating pharmaceutical innovation. Hallucinated descriptions allow AI systems to identify novel therapeutic candidates with reduced trial-and-error cycles, ultimately saving time and resources in drug discovery. Beyond pharmaceuticals, hallucinations could drive creativity in materials science, biology, and other domains where solving complex problems requires imaginative approaches and innovative thinking.\n\nMoreover, the study challenges traditional metrics for evaluating AI reliability, encouraging a shift from solely assessing factual accuracy to considering contextual value. In certain applications, the ability of AI to generate creative and abstract insights may outweigh the necessity for precise factual alignment. This perspective paves the way for redefining how AI contributions are assessed and integrated into scientific workflows, promoting the use of imaginative outputs in contexts where creativity complements analytical rigor.\n\nFuture directions\n\nThis study provides a foundation for exploring how hallucinations and uncertainty calibration can be systematically harnessed in other scientific and creative fields. Future research could focus on refining Large Language Models (LLMs) to better balance factual accuracy with creative exploration. For example, in domains like drug discovery, materials science, and creative content generation, controlled hallucinations - imaginative yet structured outputs - could help uncover novel solutions, enhance hypothesis generation, or inspire innovative designs.\n\nEthical and practical considerations should guide this exploration. Fine-tuning LLMs to generate \"productive\" hallucinations while minimizing misleading or harmful outputs is a critical challenge. Researchers must develop tools to measure and categorize hallucinations, distinguishing between creative and detrimental ones. Additionally, feedback loops between human experts and AI systems could enhance model performance, ensuring hallucinations align with domain-specific objectives.\n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration will also play a vital role. Engaging domain experts, ethicists, and AI developers in co-designing systems will help ensure that AI applications remain transparent, reliable, and user-centered. By integrating these perspectives, future LLMs could become invaluable partners in solving complex global challenges while upholding ethical standards.\n\nLastly, advancements in multimodal AI - combining text, image, and data inputs - offer opportunities to contextualize and validate hallucinated outputs. For instance, in medical diagnostics, pairing text-based insights with visual data (e.g., imaging scans) could enhance decision-making accuracy. Similarly, integrating structured and unstructured data in fields like climate science or economics could provide more nuanced and actionable insights.\n\nBy fostering creativity, enhancing transparency, and aligning outputs with human goals, LLMs could redefine the boundaries of innovation across industries."

But like the space race, it holds the power to advance science and technology, redefine industries, transform a generation, and unlock human potential \u2014 if today\u2019s leaders meet the challenge.\n\nThis moment demands a new kind of CIO. Gone are the days of the IT gatekeeper-in-chief. The organizations that rise to the occasion will be led by an innovative class of CIOs who embrace bold thinking, stay ahead of the market, and build a visionary future. A traditional CIO keeps the lights on. The new CIO lights the way forward with eight critical leadership shifts that will define the success of the AI era."

            "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein is due back in court Wednesday as a judge is set to decide when the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s #MeToo retrial will start and whether it will include an allegation involving a woman who wasn\u2019t in the original case.\n\nWeinstein, 72, wants the extra charge thrown out, arguing through lawyers that Manhattan prosecutors only brought it to bolster their case with a third accuser after New York\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction on rape and sexual assault charges involving two women.\n\nJudge Curtis Farber is expected to rule on that and other matters, including the trial date \u2014 a task that\u2019s been complicated by an increasingly crowded court calendar.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, is representing conservative strategist Steve Bannon in a border wall fraud trial that\u2019s set to start March 4 before a different Manhattan judge. Meanwhile, Farber has a murder trial in March.\n\nBefore Bannon\u2019s trial date was set last week, Aidala had suggested that Weinstein\u2019s trial go first in \u201cthe interest of humanity,\u201d citing the ex-studio boss\u2019 declining health.\n\nWeinstein is being treated for numerous medical conditions, including chronic myeloid leukemia and diabetes.\n\n\u201cThey know that Mr. Weinstein is dying of cancer and is an innocent man right now in the state of New York,\u201d Aidala argued in court last week. He pleaded to prosecutors: \u201cCan I try this dying man\u2019s case first?\u201d\n\nWeinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to prosecutors just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case.\n\nProsecutors said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after the state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out his conviction last April.\n\nFarber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.\n\nProsecutors called that thinking \u201cabsurd,\u201d countering that Weinstein\u2019s lawyers would have also been outraged if he had been charged based on the third woman\u2019s allegation either during his first trial or immediately after his conviction.\n\nWeinstein \u201cwould likely have characterized that timing as a vindictive and gratuitous pile-on,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing last month.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office said the previously uncharged allegation \u201crequired a sensitive investigation\u201d and serious contemplation before seeking an indictment, in part because there are no eyewitnesses to the alleged assault and no scientific or other physical evidence.\n\nWeinstein co-founded the film and television production companies Miramax and The Weinstein Company and was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cThe Crying Game.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, he became the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement, which erupted when women began going public with accounts of his behavior.\n\nHe has long maintained that any sexual activity was consensual.\n\nIn vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench.\n\nWeinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.\n\nWeinstein has remained in custody in New York\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, with occasional trips to a hospital for medical treatment, while awaiting the retrial.\n\nThe Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named."

            "article_content": "The Navy\u2019s surface fleet has spent the past 15 months taking down hundreds of missiles and drones fired by Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels at U.S. and allied Navies\u2019 ships, as well as commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea. While it has become the most intense sustained combat the sea service\u2019s warships have seen since World War II, the Navy continues to prioritize preparing for a conflict in the Pacific. This begs the question: What lessons does the Red Sea fight offer the Navy when it comes to preparing for conflict with its top pacing threat, China?\n\nTWZ reached out to a range of active-duty and retired military officers to answer this question. They said the Red Sea was a prime stress test for a fleet preparing for war with China, even as it drained finite munitions and further exposed shortfalls in the defense industrial base.\n\n\u201cA lot of these lessons and everything that we are taking from the Red Sea are an incredibly valuable warm-up for us in the high-end fight,\u201d an active-duty surface warfare officer (SWO) who spoke with TWZ on the condition of anonymity said.\n\nThe Navy destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) launches a SM-2 missile during an exercise in 2020. (U.S. Navy)\n\nAnalysts acknowledged the obvious \u2014 that China would be an entirely different adversary to take on compared to the Houthis, and that war with Beijing would be far more fearsome and intense than the Houthi campaign. But while the theater, geography and capability of the adversary would differ, the Red Sea has nonetheless been a major experience generator and proving ground on several fronts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven without the China preparation angle, the Navy has earned some undeniable wins in the Red Sea. No American warships have been hit, and crews have countered Houthi attacks that have, at times, come dangerously close to putting a hole in a gray hull. Navy brass says they are now able to tune ship radars, provide feedback and update tactics far more rapidly than when the hostilities started. Just analyzing engagement data has gone from 40 days or more to just a day or two, a massive gain that could prove critical in a Pacific fight. A year ago, TWZ detailed how the potential implications of this unprecedented amount of real-world experience and its resulting data flowing out of so many engagements, and how lessons learned from it could be used to the advantage of not only the U.S. Navy but China as well.\n\nThe destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) launches Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) in the Red Sea in January 2024. (U.S. Navy)\n\nDespite Red Sea success so far, the surface fleet must remain humble, according to a retired warship captain who spoke to TWZ on condition of anonymity to share his thoughts.\n\n\u201cI think it is important that we not be lulled into a sense of complacency by our own success,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are fighting a high-end fight against a low-end adversary. The weapons, tactics, and strategic implications of a Pacific war could be quite different and more challenging.\u201d\n\nThe lessons the Navy has learned for fighting in a littoral environment like the Red Sea would be applicable to potential littoral conflict in the South China Sea or Luzon Strait, weapons engagement zones that would be far more saturated than an open ocean war. But even within a blue water fight over the expanses of the Pacific, key lessons apply, the active-duty SWO said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen you are in the littorals, your timelines are shorter\u201d for tracking and intercepting incoming fire, he said. \u201cIf you can execute on a littoral timeline, then you can execute on a blue water timeline.\u201d\n\nWorking through environmental frictions and the fog of war in the Red Sea is also a good dry run ahead of conflict with China, he said.\n\n\u201cThe geography, the way the Houthis have evolved, is giving us some great insight, and it directly translates into us getting ready for that high-end fight against China,\u201d the active-duty SWO said.\n\nAnd while Beijing may employ more advanced drones, anti-ship missiles and other ordnance, and in different ways, the Red Sea experience in taking out those threats still carries over, the active-duty SWO said.\n\n\u201cA missile, no matter what the origin is, is still going to be targeted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be targeting you, and a lot of those kinetic aspects still transfer over to even a higher-end type of missile.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the Red Sea has been a closed-in, littoral fight, drones would still be seen in a blue-water war with China, the active-duty SWO said, noting Chinese amphibious ships that are being built to carry and launch advanced unmanned systems. TWZ reported last fall on China\u2019s Type 076 amphib and its electromagnetic catapult for launching drones. Smaller drones don\u2019t even need this infrastructure and can be launched in large numbers from nearly any vessel.\n\nChina\u2019s Type 076 amphibious assault ship. (Chinese Internet capture via X)\n\nThe math of wartime missile expenditure is another prime Red Sea takeaway that is applicable to a China war, according to Jan van Tol, a retired forward-deployed warship captain and current senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments think tank.\n\nExpensive surface-to-air (SAM) missiles that take a long time to procure and build have regularly been used to shoot down relatively cheap Houthi aerial attack drones, he said. Go here to read TWZ\u2019s reporting about precisely which Navy munitions have been fired in the Red Sea, and how many times.\n\nBut expenditure rates of guided munitions will be \u201cfar worse in a China fight,\u201d van Tol said. Exacerbating that reality is the fact that the PLA\u2019s weapons are more sophisticated than the Iranian-derived munitions that the Houthis rely on, which will likely increase the number of American SAMs expended per engagement with the Chinese.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChina has far more anti-ship missiles than the Houthis, in a variety of iterations. It has developed short, medium, and intermediate-range anti-ship ballistic missiles to help exert authority over its broad territorial claims and deny opponents access to vast areas during conflicts. If Beijing attempts to invade Taiwan, it will rely on a variety of munitions to keep U.S. surface combatants and aircraft carriers far from the East China Sea and South China Sea. This is all part of the PLA\u2019s overreaching anti-access/area-denial strategy that is currently heavily dictating what a war would look like in the Pacific.\n\nA very general look at some of the breadth of conventionally-armed long-range missile options China has, and the ranges they can reach. (DOD)\n\n\u201cPLA raid density will be far higher than the relative dribbles of Houthi attacks, so Navy ships will quickly run out of SAMs,\u201d van Told said, adding that some U.S. Vertical Launching System (VLS) missile cells are loaded with non-SAM weapons, and that U.S. warships will have to retire to rearming locations far from the fight.\n\nThe Navy is trying to mitigate having ships leave the battle for days or even weeks at a time for reloading via an at-sea VLS reloading capability known as the Transferrable Reloading At-sea Method (TRAM) that was demonstrated for the first time last fall. Go here to read TWZ coverage of that effort.\n\nSailors aboard the Navy cruiser USS Chosin (CG-65) use the Transferrable Reload At-sea Method (TRAM) to grasp a missile canister over the ship\u2019s MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) in October. (U.S. Navy)\n\nIn a high-intensity war with China, SAMs and other weapons would be exhausted quickly, and the American defense industrial base \u201chas relatively little surge production capacity relative to need,\u201d van Tol said.\n\nThe Red Sea has hammered home the need to increase production of Navy munitions, van Tol said. A peacetime effort to increase precision-guided munition production of all kinds would help to identify component subcontractor chokepoints and other hiccups that would metastasize into a major problem when a surge in demand happens during a war with China. Military leaders have warned of how missiles fired in the Red Sea and elsewhere are eating into stocks that could be used for a war with China too.\n\n\u201cIt would be important to identify those and make [defense industrial base] investments to ease those chokepoints,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was analogous to the difficult production problems the U.S. initially faced in 1939-1941 during the pre-Pearl Harbor industrial mobilization, which really was spurred by huge French and British demands for arms starting in the late 1930s \u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for the \u2018head start\u2019 working out the problems while supplying those allies, the vast production of 1943-1944 would have never been possible.\u201d\n\nWhile concerns about supply remain, the Red Sea is offering invaluable, real-world proof that a Navy warship\u2019s air defense weapons actually work in combat, according to the active-duty SWO.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be facing an even higher-end fight against China,\u201d he said. \u201cConfidence in the system is extremely important for us, for those sailors and operators and Marines and others that are going to be pushing out forward for that fight \u2026 whether it is a five-inch round, or whatever ordnance, a missile coming off a rail from an aircraft.\u201d\n\nMilitary history is full of examples of weapon systems that appeared to be good to go, only to fail in the heat of battle, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told TWZ. He pointed to the Navy\u2019s defective Mk 14 torpedoes during World War II as a prime example.\n\nA Mk 14 torpedo is balanced during World War II. (U.S. Navy)\n\n\u201cReal world operations always enhance warfighting readiness because nothing is simulated,\u201d he noted. \u201cEverything must be done, and there is a concrete result in the end. Even the best training doesn\u2019t replicate these conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Navy would also face a multi-domain attack from China. Unlike the Houthis, who have largely launched airborne weapons and sometimes surface drones at warships, the PLA would come at the service in the undersea, space and cyber domains as well, van Tol said.\n\n\u201cShips will not have the \u2018luxury\u2019 of concentrating on only one domain,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile short on specifics, the active-duty SWO noted that the Navy\u2019s electronic warfare (EW) capabilities have also benefited from real-world experience in the Red Sea.\n\n\u201cThe exploitation of the RF spectrum to try and stay to the left of kinetic engagements is always something that we would like to take advantage of,\u201d he said. \u201cElectrons are free, and I can read and I can produce those as long as I\u2019m making electricity \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of lessons learned on that aspect that we were able to put forth, from a detection to an engagement, in that whole kill chain aspect.\u201d\n\nWhile the Red Sea campaign doesn\u2019t come close to matching the intensity of operations should a war with China break out, it nonetheless provides the Navy with invaluable real-world insight into how systems work and what planning, training and procedures need to be tightened up, according to Bradley Martin, a retired surface warfare officer (SWO) who spent two-thirds of his 30-year Navy career at sea.\n\nAmong the lessons the Navy can take out of the Red Sea are the stark realities of cyclic carrier air wing operations near an enemy\u2019s weapons engagement zone, said Martin, now a senior policy analyst with the RAND think tank. The perils of such operations came into focus last month, when the cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) accidentally shot down a F/A-18 Super Hornet during a sustained Houthi attack on the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75). The Navy has released few details on the encounter, but at least three investigations are underway to determine what transpired.\n\nFlight operations aboard the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) in December. (U.S. Navy)\n\n\u201cDealing with attacks from an enemy with a substantial shore-based arsenal is an important experience\u201d as well, Martin added.\n\nThe Houthi arsenal is provided via Iran, and past TWZ reporting revealed that the Navy has taken out more than 400 of the group\u2019s anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM) and aerial attack drones since October 2023.\n\nSome of the arsenal fielded by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. (IISS) \u00a92023, The International Institute for Strategic Studies, originally published on https://iiss.org/online-analysis/military-balance/2024/01/houthi-anti-ship-missile-systems-getting-better-all-the-time/ (reproduced with permission)\n\nBut while the Red Sea is providing the Navy with valuable lessons, \u201creadiness is without question being drained,\u201d Martin said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s part in defending Israel from Iranian and Houthi ballistic missile attacks, and the tying in with Israeli defense infrastructure to accomplish that, has direct relevance to Taiwan\u2019s defense in a future fight as well, the active-duty SWO said.\n\nCulturally, the Red Sea fight is nudging the surface fleet out of its \u201cpeacetime\u201d footing and giving it a taste of what war with China would entail, van Tol said. With the exception of Navy SEALs and some aviators, the fleet has not faced a serious threat of being attacked for decades, which has inhibited \u201ctough, realistic training.\u201d A \u201csafety first\u201d culture is fine and necessary for a peacetime Navy, but it is not helpful for preparing in earnest for a real conflict, he said.\n\n\u201cThis has now seemingly changed to some extent \u2026 when ships deploy to the Red Sea, the crews know that they may come under attack,\u201d van Tol said. \u201cThe real chance of having to no-kidding defend the ship helps concentrate the mind wonderfully. This change in mindset and mentality is really important and seems to be happening.\u201d\n\nSailors stand watch in the combat information center of the Navy destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) in October 2023. (U.S. Navy)\n\nThe Red Sea has further reinforced the importance of maintaining a high level of tactical training and proficiency among a ship\u2019s watch teams during war, he added. Such training can\u2019t be limited to pre-deployment work-ups, because a war with China will come with relatively little notice.\n\n\u201cDitto with regard to damage control training and material readiness,\u201d van Tol said. \u201cThe ships that have operated in the Red Sea to date have done a great job defensively so far, no hits. But even the Houthis may get lucky on an attack. Against the PLA\u2019s much more potent threats, the odds of ships being hit would be far higher.\u201d\n\nThe current conflict is teaching the surface fleet vital lessons for the next war when it comes to crew stress under the threat of constant engagement, while instilling in sailors that all the training that they do really matters in the real world, according to the active-duty SWO. The surface fleet has increased how it monitors sailor wellbeing and ensures that those who need help get it as soon as possible as a result, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important aspect that we can\u2019t just gloss over,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the sailor\u2019s investment in the combat situation. We\u2019ve seen a lot of initiatives pay off, and we\u2019re getting better data on that.\u201d\n\nThe Red Sea has also helped to demystify certain munitions fired by the Houthis \u2013 variants of which China would use in a future fight \u2013 and proved that a U.S. warship can defeat them, according to James Holmes, a maritime strategy professor at the Naval War College. The Houthis are the first entity to ever fire an anti-ship ballistic missile in anger, and the Navy has now shown that such weapons can be taken out.\n\n\u201cThe same goes for \u2018kamikaze drones,\u2019 which essentially serve the same purpose, as ship killers,\u201d Holmes told TWZ in an email. \u201cDemystifying the next big and bad thing is a major contribution. We should not be cowed.\u201d\n\nA Boatswain\u2019s Mate walks the flight deck as an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter takes off from the Navy destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) in March during the warship\u2019s deployment to the Red Sea. (U.S. Navy) Petty Officer 1st Class Jonathan Word\n\nAt the same time, the Navy shouldn\u2019t \u201cget cocky\u201d about its performance in the Red Sea, he said.\n\n\u201cCarl von Clausewitz, probably the best strategic thinker of them all, implies that success in warfare is about a 60-40 proposition at best,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWe can lose, and in fact I think the odds are in China\u2019s favor. When a fraction of one force faces off against the entirety of another, who wins? We are the fraction, China\u2019s PLA has the entirety. That is not the case in the Red Sea.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, the Red Sea has provided the surface fleet a taste of what they might meet should war erupt with China.\n\n\u201cWe are expending munitions we sorely need, so there is a material dimension to correct,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cBut at the same time, warfare is a human contest. We are getting our people ready to do what they may have to do before long. If we give them the tools, the tool wielders can do the work.\u201d\n\nThe Navy\u2019s preparations for a potential battle against Chinese forces is accelerating, and the sea service has undoubtedly benefited from taking on a real-life adversary, even one far weaker than the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The at-times daily Red Sea conflict may be drawing to a close, with the Houthis announcing they would halt such attacks following a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. However it ends, the surface fleet has seen sustained combat for the first time in decades and shaken off the peacetime cobwebs in the process, a process that has provided great experience, a tsunami of data, and a sobering look at how prepared the surface fleet is to face-down a far more powerful foe.\n\nContact the author: geoff@twz.com"

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nAlibaba Cloud unveiled its Qwen2.5-Max model today, marking the second major artificial intelligence breakthrough from China in less than a week that has rattled U.S. technology markets and intensified concerns about America\u2019s eroding AI leadership.\n\nThe new model outperforms DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model, which sent Nvidia\u2019s stock plunging 17% on Monday, in several key benchmarks including Arena-Hard, LiveBench, and LiveCodeBench. Qwen2.5-Max also demonstrates competitive results against industry leaders like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet in tests of advanced reasoning and knowledge.\n\n\u201cWe have been building Qwen2.5-Max, a large MoE LLM pretrained on massive data and post-trained with curated SFT and RLHF recipes,\u201d Alibaba Cloud announced in a blog post. The company emphasized its model\u2019s efficiency, having been trained on over 20 trillion tokens while using a mixture-of-experts architecture that requires significantly fewer computational resources than traditional approaches.\n\nThe timing of these back-to-back Chinese AI releases has deepened Wall Street\u2019s anxiety about U.S. technological supremacy. Both announcements came during President Trump\u2019s first week back in office, prompting questions about the effectiveness of U.S. chip export controls meant to slow China\u2019s AI advancement.\n\nQwen2.5-Max outperforms major AI models across key benchmarks, including a significant lead in Arena-Hard testing, where it scored 89.4%. (Source: Alibaba Cloud)\n\n\n\nHow Qwen2.5-Max could reshape enterprise AI strategies\n\nFor CIOs and technical leaders, Qwen2.5-Max\u2019s architecture represents a potential shift in enterprise AI deployment strategies. Its mixture-of-experts approach demonstrates that competitive AI performance can be achieved without massive GPU clusters, potentially reducing infrastructure costs by 40-60% compared to traditional large language model deployments.\n\nThe technical specifications show sophisticated engineering choices that matter for enterprise adoption. The model activates only specific neural network components for each task, allowing organizations to run advanced AI capabilities on more modest hardware configurations.\n\nThis efficiency-first approach could reshape enterprise AI roadmaps. Rather than investing heavily in data center expansions and GPU clusters, technical leaders might prioritize architectural optimization and efficient model deployment. The model\u2019s strong performance in code generation (LiveCodeBench: 38.7%) and reasoning tasks (Arena-Hard: 89.4%) suggests it could handle many enterprise use cases while requiring significantly less computational overhead.\n\nHowever, technical decision makers should carefully consider factors beyond raw performance metrics. Questions about data sovereignty, API reliability, and long-term support will likely influence adoption decisions, especially given the complex regulatory landscape surrounding Chinese AI technologies.\n\nQwen2.5-Max achieves top scores across key AI benchmarks, including 94.5% accuracy in mathematical reasoning tests, outperforming major competitors. (Source: Alibaba Cloud)\n\nChina\u2019s AI Leap: How Efficiency Is Driving Innovation\n\nQwen2.5-Max\u2019s architecture reveals how Chinese companies are adapting to U.S. restrictions. The model uses a mixture-of-experts approach that allows it to achieve high performance with fewer computational resources. This efficiency-focused innovation suggests China may have found a sustainable path to AI advancement despite limited access to cutting-edge chips.\n\nThe technical achievement here cannot be overstated. While U.S. companies have focused on scaling up through brute computational force \u2014 exemplified by OpenAI\u2019s estimated use of over 32,000 high-end GPUs for its latest models \u2014 Chinese companies are finding success through architectural innovation and efficient resource use.\n\nU.S. Export Controls: Catalysts for China\u2019s AI Renaissance?\n\nThese developments force a fundamental reassessment of how technological advantage can be maintained in an interconnected world. U.S. export controls, designed to preserve American leadership in AI, may have inadvertently accelerated Chinese innovation in efficiency and architecture.\n\n\u201cThe scaling of data and model size not only showcases advancements in model intelligence but also reflects our unwavering commitment to pioneering research,\u201d Alibaba Cloud stated in its announcement. The company emphasized its focus on \u201cenhancing the thinking and reasoning capabilities of large language models through the innovative application of scaled reinforcement learning.\u201d\n\nWhat Qwen2.5-Max Means for Enterprise AI Adoption\n\nFor enterprise customers, these developments could herald a more accessible AI future. Qwen2.5-Max is already available through Alibaba Cloud\u2019s API services, offering capabilities similar to leading U.S. models at potentially lower costs. This accessibility could accelerate AI adoption across industries, particularly in markets where cost has been a barrier.\n\nHowever, security concerns persist. The U.S. Commerce Department has launched a review of both DeepSeek and Qwen2.5-Max to assess potential national security implications. The ability of Chinese companies to develop advanced AI capabilities despite export controls raises questions about the effectiveness of current regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe Future of AI: Efficiency Over Power?\n\nThe global AI landscape is shifting rapidly. The assumption that advanced AI development requires massive computational resources and cutting-edge hardware is being challenged. As Chinese companies demonstrate the possibility of achieving similar results through efficient innovation, the industry may be forced to reconsider its approach to AI advancement.\n\nFor U.S. technology leaders, the challenge is now twofold: responding to immediate market pressures while developing sustainable strategies for long-term competition in an environment where hardware advantages may no longer guarantee leadership.\n\nThe next few months will be crucial as the industry adjusts to this new reality. With both Chinese and U.S. companies promising further advances, the global race for AI supremacy enters a new phase \u2014 one where efficiency and innovation may prove more important than raw computational power."

            "article_content": "A major UK sports channel is set to be removed from the television schedule after 35 years on-air.\n\nThe Eurosport channel, which has been on-air since 1989, was originally created as a joint venture between the European Broadcasting Union and Sky - hence the name.\n\nIt was then acquired by the TF1 group before Discovery Communications completed a full buyout of the channel in 2015 and merged it with its Discovery+ platform.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe channel is still available on Sky and Virgin platforms, and showcases a wide range of sports - some of which are normally not available to watch anywhere else in the UK.\n\nOver the years, it has acquired the rights to show snooker, cycling events such as the Tour de France, tennis and winter sports such as snowboarding and skiing. It also has rights to selected football competitions for a limited number of European countries.\n\nEurosport regularly provided coverage of ATP and WTA tennis events (Image: Getty)\n\nIt also provides live coverage of the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance event, and formerly held the rights to Formula E and GP2 (now Formula 2) coverage.\n\nAdvert\n\nThrough its own channel and the discovery+ streaming platform, Eurosport also broadcasts significant Olympics coverage after Discovery won joint rights along with the BBC ahead of Tokyo 2020.\n\nHowever, Eurosport as a standalone channel is set to be no more.\n\nIt has been announced that both Eurosport 1 and Eurosport 2 will merge with TNT Sports on February 28, meaning that both channels will be off-air from that date. The merger will only apply in the UK and Ireland.\n\nSVP Content, Production and Business Operations of WBD Sports Europe, Scott Young, said: \"Combining Eurosport and TNT Sports content in the UK and Ireland will enable us to offer a single, premium viewing experience for sports fans.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"This move will also continue to best deliver value for our leagues and federation partners, as we continue our 35 years plus commitment to investment and championing of sport on our screens.\"\n\nThe channel has been one of two main rights holders for the Olympics and Winter Olympics in the UK since 2021 (Image: Getty)\n\nThere has been no announcement over what sort of pricing structures viewers can expect following the merger, but fans are furious over, as it stands, having to pay significantly more to subscribe to TNT Sports in order to continue watching Eurosport programmes.\n\nA Standard Monthly Pass to watch Eurosport currently comes in at \u00a33.99 per month, but there is a major price hike to \u00a330.99 per month to watch TNT Sports on a contract-free basis.\n\nAdvert\n\nOne wrote: \"Getting rid of Eurosport UK is a crazy decision. Why should snooker fans pay \u00a330 a month to subscribe to TNT to watch it?\"\n\nA second said: \"\u00a3370 a year now to watch cycling in the UK and Ireland. It used to be \u00a340 a year (and was actually \u00a320 with an early bird offer).\"\n\nA third claimed: \"Greed, pure and simple. Fans of every sport treated as cash cows.\"\n\nA fourth stated: \"Shafting fans once again.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd a fifth fumed: \"First they force us Eurosport subscribers to use the same app as their reality TV. Now they shove TNT Sports down our throats for what used to be the yearly price for ES.\""

Then years after she was accused of being a 22-year-old, Michael sat down with Natalia to have a very awkward conversation. Watch below:\n\nJust months after Natalia was adopted, the Barnett family claimed she was an 'adult sociopath masquerading as a child' who allegedly tried to kill them.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"She tried to poison and kill my wife,\" Michael claimed, \"One night, I opened my eyes and Natalia is standing at the foot of the bed with a knife in her hand.\"\n\nNatalia has continuously denied all of the allegations made against her. In 2024 documentary Natalia Speaks, health testing company TruDiagnostic estimated that she was then about 22 years old, meaning she was between six and nine years old when she was adopted by the Barnetts.\n\nIn a clip which was released by Investigation Discovery last year, Natalia is seen reuniting with Michael and asking him: \"Why are we here?\"\n\n\"Why are we here?\" responded Michael, \"If you're talking philosophically.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe confrontation between Natalia Grace and her former adoptive father was very awkward (Investigation Discovery)\n\n\"No, I want to know, why did you adopt me in the first place?\" she then asked.\n\n\"Many of these questions there's not going to be a single answer to,\" he told her, whilst alleging he was manipulated and mistreated by Kristine, his now ex-wife.\n\nIn the documentary, Natalia alleges that she was abused by Kristine, claiming that she pepper-sprayed her multiple times and hit her with a belt.\n\nAdvert\n\nKristine has denied the accusations from both Natalia and Michael.\n\n\"What do you mean by you were a victim?\" Natalia asked, to which Michael replied: \"This is not easy. I had the same monster you did.\"\n\n\"I was exceptionally controlled and put down and threatened, was minimalised, anything that was who I was was ripped from me and I was guided and instructed to be exactly what she wanted me to be,\" he went on.\n\nHe stormed off set (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nMichael seemed to be getting nowhere with his former adopted daughter and stormed out of the interview following a confrontation with people behind the camera.\n\n\"I tried, I tried,\" he repeated as he walked off set.\n\nHaving made headlines a couple of years ago, Natalia has provided a fresh update in season three of her docuseries, titled The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: The Final Chapter.\n\nNatalia has now settled in with Nicole DePaul, 49, and her husband Vince, 51 - who also have dwarfism - in upstate New York. The couple tried to adopt her in 2009, but were turned down."

            "article_content": "Mart\u00ed Perarnau Llobet, 36, is researching the extravagant and hidden world that hides the answers to what reality is, beyond what we perceive and to which we apply the classical laws of physics to manage the world. Winner of the Young Researcher Award in Theoretical Physics, awarded by the BBVA Foundation and the Royal Spanish Society of Physics, he works with the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal program at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, unraveling the behavior of open quantum systems, those that are not isolated from their environment. This field will facilitate computing with lower energy consumption and the manufacture of extremely precise sensors, a great hope for personalized medicine, among other fields.\n\nQuestion. Multinationals such as Microsoft, Google and IBM have announced significant advances in quantum computing. Is the hype around this technology justified?\n\nAnswer. There are great expectations surrounding quantum computing due to its immense potential. A quantum computer can be more powerful at performing certain calculations than all the computers on the planet working at the same time. But they are still very imperfect and this means that, although it may seem like you have a very powerful machine, the reality is that it is not that powerful. But the path to getting one is already interesting in itself, because it allows us to improve the control of quantum systems and, at the same time, provides new ideas to improve conventional computers. What is undeniable is that it is leading to great scientific and technological progress.\n\nQ. What is an open quantum system?\n\nA. It is a system that is in contact with an environment, which is not isolated. This is a condition of almost all systems. If you have an atom in a vacuum, you could say that there is no environment, but there is; when you put energy into it, it interacts with the vacuum and the energy is lost in the form of a photon. The environment is there and quantum systems are susceptible to its presence. This is very important because it allows us to understand, for example, decoherence, why we go from a quantum world where there are superpositions to our reality, where things do not exist in two places at the same time. Open systems are very important for our understanding of the transition from the quantum world to the classical world. And also in practice because, if we want to improve quantum computers, we have to understand the interaction with the environment very well.\n\nP. Is your research a bridge between the quantum and classical worlds, between the laboratory and the everyday environment?\n\nA. We understand the quantum world well and we have laws to describe it that work wonderfully, but it is true that it is very un-intuitive and, conceptually, really shocking and disruptive. What we do is relevant to exploit quantum phenomena that occur under very ideal conditions, understand them in more realistic situations and describe that transition.\n\nQ. Can quantum phenomena be controlled in open environments?\n\nA. What we can do is understand them and look for efficient ways to describe the environment to use it to our advantage. There are some quantum states with a strong interaction with the environment and they lose energy very quickly, but there are others that practically do not do so, that are like protected, and this, for example, can be very relevant for quantum computing. Understanding the physics of open systems helps us find ways to use it to our advantage.\n\nQ. In practice, what can we achieve by understanding an open quantum system?\n\nA. An important example is found in quantum metrology, which seeks to use quantum phenomena to improve the precision of measurements. In this field, quantum sensors are being developed that, even though they are open to the environment, can be very useful for measuring very small variations in physical magnitudes, such as a magnetic field or temperature. Today, atomic magnetometers can already be used to measure, in a very non-invasive way, magnetic fields that occur in the brain. Another possible application would be in cells, to measure temperature and its variations inside them.\n\nQ. What is the main challenge?\n\nA. Apart from quantum metrology, I also work on quantum thermodynamics, which seeks to understand the origin of irreversibility, of dissipation, why energy degrades into heat. A challenge in this field, which has so far been very theoretical, would be to find applications, to use these theoretical ideas about our understanding of thermodynamics at this quantum scale to, for example, develop new ways of computing with much lower energy consumption.\n\nQ. How do you do research? What is a quantum laboratory like?\n\nA. A quantum lab can be a really impressive thing, however, as a theoretical physicist my office is much more down to earth. Most of my work can be done with pen and paper, also through computer simulations. We also use the whiteboard a lot, to discuss possible ideas or calculations and projects \u2013 science is a very collaborative thing.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

It is slightly irresistible, isn\u2019t it, to see and hear it ticking again? But that\u2019s a prize for someone else rather than me, I think.\u201d\n\nBesides, just getting the Marie Antoinette to London proved to be difficult.\n\nEven after the art museum\u2019s board agreed to the loan, Mr. Levian had what he described as \u201cone big problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael is at war,\u201d he said, \u201cand when you are at war, you can\u2019t have insurance against war and terror. So we had an emergency meeting, and decided that the watch will go without it. We couriered it on a flight to London and took all measures possible to keep it safe.\u201d\n\nThe Science Museum had a big problem, too. While a government-supported indemnity program covers all great treasures on loan for display in Britain, \u201cyou have to work out a valuation,\u201d Sir Ian said. \u201cTrying to agree a valuation for the Breguet 160 is much more difficult than for an old master painting, where the market prices are pretty obvious.\u201d\n\nIn promoting the exhibition before its opening on Dec. 12, Sir Ian said, he was reluctant to put the spotlight on the watch\u2019s financial value, preferring to highlight its historical significance. But previous estimates have ranged from $30 million to $100 million. \u201cIf it went to auction, which it never will,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s almost no limit to what it would be worth. One starts breaking out in a sweat just thinking about it.\u201d Eventually, a figure was agreed upon, but one that he declined to disclose."
