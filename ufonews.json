        "article_content": "Efforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right, UFO 50 is, for lack of a better term, a \u201cfictional\u201d game compilation, though the games are very real. Here, in their entirety, are 50 games\u2013not minigames, mind you, not little playable demos, but full-length, complete gaming experiences\u2013from a company that never existed. Developers Derek Yu (Spelunky), Jon Perry (Air Land & Sea), and musician Eirik Suhrke (Hotline Miami) spearheaded the project, but they and the other devs actually responsible for the games here are fully committed to the bit. If you beat a game here, it\u2019s the fictional devs of UFO Soft whose names you\u2019ll see on the staff roll. Instead, Yu and the others responsible are listed in the compilation\u2019s opening as \u201cthe UFO 50 Recovery Team.\u201d In this sequence, we see them digging an old gaming computer out of someone\u2019s storage unit and beginning the process of recovering these games for preservation in this collection. \u201cWhenever possible,\u201d we are told, \u201cthe integrity of the original software was preserved.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about.\n\nThe 50 games here present a picture of a company that, in 1982, took its tentative first step into game development with the challenging and mysterious adventure game Barbuta (\u201cDeveloped secretly on company time, it almost got Thorson Petter fired,\u201d an in-game factoid tells us), and that, by 1989, was producing games like the vibrant, multi-genre Cyber Owls, \u201claunched alongside an original comic book series.\u201d At every step, UFO Soft was both responding to current gaming trends and establishing its own identity, producing games that tried to capitalize on popular new genres and tendencies in game design while also bearing their own distinctive authorship.\n\n\n\nAnd this, in my view, is essential to what makes UFO 50 so fascinating. Often, modern retro games wear their references a little too proudly, containing winking references to games of the past as if to say to you, \u201cWe know you like Classic Game X! We like Classic Game X, too! See, we\u2019re doing that thing you liked back when that game did it!\u201d There\u2019s none of that here in UFO 50. This game believably creates a kind of pocket dimension in which UFO Soft actually existed, creating games that capitalize on the rapidly improving game hardware of the 1980s but that aren\u2019t beholden to what everyone else was doing.\n\n\n\nBarbuta, for instance, feels roughly on par with something you might see on the MSX in the early 80s, while Cyber Owls feels akin to an elaborate blockbuster that might have arrived on the NES in 1989, when developers were figuring out how to make the most of that console\u2019s power. (Similarly, it doesn\u2019t cheat with trends or genres, either. UFO Soft makes a beat-em-up, for instance, but not before beat-em-ups exist.) But this isn\u2019t, thank goodness, a compilation in which you\u2019ll find one-to-one clones of the era\u2019s hits. There isn\u2019t UFO Soft\u2019s take on Super Mario Bros. here, though you\u2019ll certainly see elements from games you know and love, which makes it feel as if UFO Soft was around at that time and in conversation with what the rest of the game development landscape was doing. Sometimes I\u2019d dive into a game and say, \u201cOh, cool, this feels like it\u2019s riffing on Blaster Master,\u201d or \u201cOkay, I can definitely see elements of Space Taxi here,\u201d but these games also always felt distinctive, as if made by people with their own ideas, who wanted to make their own contribution to the medium.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo give you a quick sense of the breadth of what\u2019s on offer here, I\u2019m going to highlight five of the games that have stood out to me most in my time with UFO 50. (Remember, there are 50 games here. I\u2019ve played about ten hours of UFO 50 in all, so to say that I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what\u2019s available here is an understatement.) The one that\u2019s grabbed me the most right out of the gate is Valbrace, a tough action-RPG released, the game\u2019s fiction would have it, in 1988. I haven\u2019t made it very far yet, but its fusion of twitchy combat and first-person dungeon crawling is immediately appealing, and I\u2019m determined to level up my intrepid adventurer and find out what awaits in the dungeon\u2019s lower levels. It also reminded me of how, in the 1980s, it was always exciting if I equipped some new weapon or armor on a game character and their sprite changed. It\u2019s a little thing but it went a long way toward making the visuals feel more immersive and responsive to me as a player. Valbrace has that, and I felt that same little thrill I felt as a kid when I spotted it for the first time.\n\n\n\nNext, there\u2019s Rail Heist, a fascinating hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay with destructible environments in which each stage is a kind of puzzle. Playing as a member of a train-robbing crew in the Old West, you must figure out how to get the money on the locomotive out from under the noses of the lawmen guarding it. It\u2019s simultaneously strategic and kinetic, a real blast.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttactics is a fast-paced real-time tactics game for people like me who often avoid tactics games. Units from two opposing castles march toward each other automatically, but you can frantically grab your own units and slide them into advantageous formations to better withstand and conquer the enemy onslaught.\n\n\n\nPorgy is a gorgeous undersea adventure in which you pilot an adorable little submarine (with eyes!) to find upgrades and solve a mystery. The world is filled with both dangers (giant shark attacks!) and secrets just waiting to be discovered.\n\nFinally, the aforementioned Cyber Owls is a fitting game to close out UFO 50\u2019s chronology. Ostensibly released in 1989 and the \u201cfinal\u201d game in this compilation, Cyber Owls shows the developers at UFO Soft pulling out all the stops to make an elaborate multi-genre hit. The rogue commando group H.A.W.K. has acquired a doomsday weapon, putting the whole world in danger, and naturally, the president calls upon the only heroes who are up to the task of thwarting their deadly plans: the Cyber Owls. Each of the four missions your cadre of elite avian agents must undertake is wholly distinct: one\u2019s a beat-em-up, one\u2019s a Cabal-style shooter, one\u2019s a Metal Gear-esque stealth mission, and one\u2019s a side-scrolling vehicular shmup. What really makes it all work for me, though, is the way that it actually feels like it\u2019s based on a Saturday morning cartoon or comic book. As you progress, you encounter an assortment of villains who easily could have belonged to the rogue\u2019s gallery on a show that fused Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with G.I. Joe, and it feels like the devs gave some real thought to fleshing out this fictional late-80s IP.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, that very brief overview of five of the included games here\u2013just one tenth of the entire library\u2013is wholly inadequate at trying to convey the experience of actually playing UFO 50. For one, there are so many other types of experiences here. There\u2019s a game with Smash T.V.-style arena shooting. There\u2019s a first-person horror adventure game that plays similarly to Shadowgate or Deja Vu. There\u2019s a Japanese-style RPG set in a Wild West world. There\u2019s a strategic deckbuilder of sorts in which you try to have the right assortment of people in your Rolodex to ensure your parties are a rousing success. There\u2019s a wonderfully strange puzzle platformer in which you deliberately sacrifice your character\u2019s lives to create a path for the lives that follow. And so much more. The real point of UFO 50, if it can be said to have one, lies not in any individual game, as great as some of them are, but in the variety and richness of what they offer when collected here.\n\n\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about. You\u2019re probably not going to love all of them, but that\u2019s actually good, I would argue. UFO 50 would probably be a much safer and more limited collection if it felt calibrated for maximum mainstream appeal; part of what makes it so great is that, while a number of games here may not quite click with you, they will all probably really click with someone, in a way games only can when they take chances and feel like the work of individuals rather than a committee. There\u2019s joy and excitement in the act of exploration and discovery, in encountering something inscrutable and pushing up against it until it starts to click for you. (Pro tip: If you find a game particularly hard to penetrate, just let it sit on the title screen for a minute. There\u2019s a chance that, like many actual games of the era, it will start a demo sequence that at least offers some clue as to how to approach it.)\n\n\n\nAnd while some of these games might have been minor hits today on Steam if they were released independently, UFO 50 is so much more than the sum of its parts. Hopping around from game to game here, playing them alongside each other and in the context of each other, what emerges is not just a collection of fun, inventive, and incredibly varied games that could have been made in the 1980s, but weren\u2019t. This is an ode to innovation and game design itself, a celebration of those visionaries who, in gaming\u2019s early days, had fresh, original ideas and pushed a burgeoning art form to its limits in order to realize them. This is a tribute to the people behind one of the most exciting eras in game history, a time when new genres and new concepts were appearing all the time. And, in that way, it also feels to me like a statement about what matters most in game design. It\u2019s not the biggest budgets or the most polish. It\u2019s creativity and experimentation, a willingness to try new things and keep pushing a young medium forward. With any luck, we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n\n\n."

        "article_content": "UFO 50 review\n\nThe 1980s reimagined as a collection of 50 \"small\" games, ranging from arcade racers to full-blown RPGs. Developer: Derek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer\n\nDerek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer Publisher: Mossmouth\n\nMossmouth Release: Sept 18th 2024\n\nSept 18th 2024 On: Windows\n\nWindows From: Epic Games, Steam\n\nEpic Games, Steam Price: \u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA\n\n\u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA Reviewed on: Intel Core-i7-11700F, 16GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, Windows 10\n\nYou can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.\n\nIt's also a funny collection, full of jokes and pranks at the player's expense. In one adventure game, tiles may fall on you without warning within seconds of your first movements. In a puzzle game about a chameleon, birds will slurp you up from inside logs just when you thought you understood the rules of camouflage. One medieval strategy game sees your units advance steadily and automatically forward, desperate to charge, unable to even think of defending. This game is called \"Attactics\"; the title alone a good gag.\n\nThere's also comedy (and satisfaction) in discovering exactly what each of these things is. Barbuta, the \"oldest\" game in the collection, is an unassuming and ancient homebrew Metroidvania that houses glitchy secrets and requires the patience and dedication of a child indoors on a rainy day to make progress. Rail Heist looks like a Sunset Riders-style shooter, but then invites you to play it as an Atari-era Hotline Miami, before you finally realise: \"Hang on, is this... an immersive sim!?\"\n\nVery few of the games give you any instructions, electing instead to just drop you in. It's a common complaint that modern games hold your hand too much, that they over-tutorialise, and fail to trust the player's perseverance or intelligence. So it's refreshing to get 50 games (albeit of varying depth) which implicitly trust the player to \"figure it out\". If your patience or brainpower does run out (and mine did a few times) you can simply eject the cartridge and play something else.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nTo take an example of one of the more compelling oddities, Mooncat is an comically obtuse platformer with some of the most counter-intuitive controls you will encounter this side of 1985. But if you stop and \"zoom out\" of your preconceived notions of what a controller's inputs ought to do, the idea behind it sort of makes sense. All the direction buttons move you left, and all the face buttons move right. Hey, why not? These are games diegetically invented four decades ago, and it's fun to read Mooncat as the product of a time long before each genre's control schemes developed any sense of orthodoxy.\n\nThe whole collection exists in this realm of tension, stretched out like a 40-year-long rubber band. If you squint, you can recognise the games of today between the pixels. Zoldath is a randomly generated explore 'em up set on an alien world where your tools are fuelled by mineral and plant pickups. In other words, it's No Man's Sky but in 1984. Meanwhile, the grid-based laser zappin' of Bug Hunter feels like an NES demake of Into The Breach (and is surprisingly moreish as a result). Velgress is a popcorn platformer that propels you ever higher through fear of decaying platforms. It is like Downwell but going up. That checks out. After all, the designer of Downwell is on the team of (real) developers who made the collection.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\n\"Our goal,\" say this gang, \"is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.\" In this I'd say they succeed. Many of the games are built on design principles or novel gimmicks that simply wouldn't appear in the shooters and platformers of yore, and it's interesting to see where the creators draw a line in terms of what constitutes modern and \"classic\" game design. (They also inadvertantly make a compilation of games that fit the aesthetics of the \"indie darlings\" era of the 2010s, but probably because, uh, they are those darlings).\n\nThe modern twists are noticeable. Take the concept of \"lives\" for example. Mortol is a platformer in which you are given a generous 20 lives. But then you are expected to spend those lives turning yourself to stone blocks, or repeatedly launching yourself at the wall to create a step-ladder out of your rigid corpses, thus helping your next \"life\" get further into the level. Other modern ideas trickle into the games. You can hold down a button to skip long cinematics, for instance. And at least one game ranks you on a three-star scale at the end of every level, adapting the contemporary practice of mobile games.\n\nAgainst the aesthetics of a pixelated era, such features feel alien, yet weirdly compelling. Imagine watching Humphrey Bogart send a telegram in a 1950s noir, and then text starts appearing on-screen in a WhatsApp speech bubble. Imagine you are enjoying an Akira Kurosawa flick, and suddenly: an unmistakable drone shot. That's what playing UFO 50 is like. It's a compilation of double-takes, a comic provoker of \"huh\"s, an anachronism bonanza.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nIt works well mostly because it is so committed to the framing narrative: that this collection exists as a restoration project. There is a meta story (or maybe a \"meta-history\") to unravel, if you look closely. Each game has its own short developer note. And there's a terminal to enter cheat codes that I suspect will reveal some fun secrets (I didn't crack a single code). Taking it all in at once, the compilation is the story of a hobby's slow professionalisation. Even the menu screens of each game, when taken in chronological order and analysed like individual layers of polar ice, track the changes of their creative pioneers.\n\nEarly games are credited in plain text, made by a trio called \"Petter, Chun & Smolski\". Later games see personal names replaced by a business, \"LX Systems\", and then \"UFO Soft\". Eventually the games start sporting a professionally animated logo, complete with a pretty jingle. All personal calling cards are smoothed away. The enigmatic figure of a developer called Thorson Petter appears in early works, creator of games that are often painful or confounding to play, yet strangely sincere in their own user-agnostic way (guess who made Barbuta and Mooncat). Later, his name seems to disappear.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nOf course, you don't need to engage in any of this. You can just find the 25 games that include local multiplayer and go ballistic with a pal. There is built-in curation too, letting you filter the games broadly by genre. \"Quick play\" and \"reflex play\" cover some arcadey bops, while \"thinky games\" offers up all the puzzles. And even within these filters there exists a little surprise, a special screen for collectors and obsessives. Perhaps this is the time to say that if you subscribe to Retro Gamer and find yourself watching endless YouTube documentaries about the good old days of pixel platforming, then this will undoubtedly tickle you. It also feels purpose-built for students of game design. Any day now UFO 50 will appear in a video by Mark Brown, and people will wonder why they haven't heard of it (it's because you don't read RPS, you rubes!). Ahem.\n\nIf you're not that kind of person - not a retro freak or a game designer yourself - then it's a harder sell. There are games with deceptive depth, engaging enough to grab you by the \"one more turn\" glands. But you'll have to go in knowing that part of the fun is sifting through the pile to find those. I would flip through three or four games about angry football or samurai tennis with lazy channel-surfing curiosity, only for an hour to vanish like Batman on a nerdy dinosaur-worshipping worker placement game (it's called Avianos, it rules). This is part of the schtick. UFO 50 is not just about playing a bunch of small, tightly made games, it's also about chasing the buzz of discovering something that stands out.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nAs someone who has spent years curating games to an audience, I'm conflicted about that. It feels a bit like work. I used to trawl through itch.io every week for a free games column on this very site. I understand both the satisfaction and disinterest that comes from panning for gold dust, even in today's overwhelming gamepocalypse. It's definitely gratifying to rummage through UFO 50 and find an Avianos, a Velgress, a Mortol in the pile. But I also didn't get through all 50 of the games in the collection. I barely scratched half. I don't think I could face mining the entire bundle. (Fun side note: this isn't the first time we've been at the coal face with 50 short games, or even 300 in a pirate kart).\n\nMaybe an unfinished pile is to be expected, though. The internet is a capable devourer, and I look forward to reading user reviews about UFO 50 in a way I don't for many other recent releases. Players will be able to evangelize their favourites, list their unmissables, and get into role-playing flame wars about which game in the Campanella Trilogy was best. Perhaps someone out there will explain why you should not give up on the opaque works of Thorson Petter. That would be swell. I don't want to complete Mooncat, that baffling platformer, but I do want to watch the 20-minute retrospective from the bearded 50-year-old who has."

        "article_content": "If you don\u2019t like Valbrace there\u2019s another 49 other games to try (Mossmouth)\n\nOne of the best indie titles of the year is also one of the best value video games of all time, with 50 excellent retro style games in one.\n\nThe fact that modern triple-A video games take too long to make, grossly inflating their budget and reducing the risks that publishers can afford to take, is by now a well-known phenomenon \u2013 one that has put the whole future of console gaming at risk. But long development times are not necessarily limited to big budget games, in fact they\u2019re relatively common for indie titles where there\u2019s only a handful of people working on them in their spare time.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite how UFO 50 has been made but it\u2019s still managed to take nine years to go from conception to final release, which is almost as long as the wait from GTA 5 to 6. The reason for the long gestation period is also a familiar problem for triple-A games: bloat. What originally started as a few experimental prototypes slowly evolved into a compilation of 8-bit style games, and eventually the 50-game monster which is this final release.\n\nInitially the work of just two friends, Derek Yu and Jon Perry, they eventually roped in a number of other developers to help, including the creators of Spelunky and Downwell, and, pausing only to help with the release of Spelunky 2 in 2020, finally finished work on UFO 50 this month. And yet, perhaps surprisingly, the wait has been worth it.\n\nMany modern indie games have started to move beyond the idea of emulating old 8-bit titles and graphics but given UFO 50 has been in development for almost a decade it\u2019s no surprise to find its approach is somewhat old fashioned.\n\nThe conceit of this compilation is that it\u2019s a collection of 50 games from a pretend video game company from the 80s. Apart from a few of them being sequels, there\u2019s nothing connecting any of the games and they\u2019re presented in a simple grid that you can pick from in any order and at any time.\n\nAlthough the game is not, officially, trying to emulate any particular console the NES is clearly the main influence here, in terms of graphics and the types of games on offer. The important point to make though is that these are not mini-games. This is not WarioWare or anything like it. These are 50 fully formed games, as long, if not longer, as professional titles would\u2019ve been back in the day, including a full-length Japanese role-player and a number of complex action adventures.\n\nCaramel Caramel is a neat little 2D shooter (Mossmouth)\n\nHow does UFO 50 work?\n\nWhen you view the totality of what\u2019s been created it\u2019s a wonder it only took nine years to make and, frankly, the developer is crazy for even attempting it. The end result is something that feels like one of those knock-off pirate consoles, that are filled with 50 random ROMs stolen from various big name companies and where you end up being almost paralysed by choice. Except all the games here are brand new.\n\nWe are not, as you might imagine, going to describe all 50 games and neither can we pretend to have finished all of them, on account of we\u2019d like to sleep and eat at some point this month. The only problem with this embarrassment of riches is that whichever game you alight on first is going to colour your opinion of the compilation for some time.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the one in the top left-hand corner, which seemed an obvious first pick to us, is a rather dry flip screen action adventure called Barbuta, that works a bit like Shovel Knight without the gimmicks. Like all of the games, the controls are very simple \u2013 just jump and stab in this case \u2013 and you\u2019re given no hint as to what the game is or what you\u2019re meant to be doing (one of the few flaws in UFO 50 is it would\u2019ve been nice to have some faux instruction manuals, with appropriately garish illustrations).\n\nWhat are the best games in UFO 50?\n\nA more inspiring choice is a game called Mini & Max, which technically takes place in a single room but where the two main characters can shrink and grow to discover a whole microscopic world full of action platform intrigue. Perhaps it\u2019s because we enjoyed the mouse power-up levels in Astro Bot so much, but we loved the concept and how the 8-bit technology forces the developer to rely on clever design rather than flashy visuals \u2013 although it also happens to be one of the best-looking of the games.\n\nOther highlights include a Wizadry style first person role-playing game called Valbrace and a clever side-scrolling shooter named Caramel Caramel where you\u2019re encouraged to take a polaroid of the action and gain extra points for shooting enemies caught in the photo. Meanwhile, Party House is a pseudo-card game where you\u2019re trying to organise the optimum mix of guests according to state-based indications of their vivaciousness.\n\nFirst person survival horror Night Manor is another good one. Influenced by SNES classic Clock Tower, it\u2019s surprisingly creepy and its content warning at the beginning is not a joke. Golfaria is another great one, and essentially a golf-themed Metroidvania, that makes even the likes of Golf Story seem staid and uninventive in comparison.\n\nAt time of writing, we don\u2019t know how much UFO 50 is going to cost but unless it\u2019s priced in triple figures there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not worth it. Although even if it somehow is, it\u2019d still probably be good value for money.\n\nNot every game is a winner, but the vast majority are and the only real problem with the game is that there\u2019s so much on offer it\u2019s very easy to dismiss something quickly, just as an excuse to try something else out. This is essentially the same reason subscription services like Game Pass haven\u2019t worked out as well as expected and the structure, or rather lack of it, in UFO 50 can work against.\n\nThe lack of instructions or explanation can also be frustrating and there\u2019s a lingering question of whether some of these game ideas would\u2019ve been better off released on their own, or with more modern presentation, so they didn\u2019t risk being passed over. Arguing something is too generous doesn\u2019t really seem fair though and so we\u2019ve no choice to name this one of the best game(s) of the year.\n\nUFO 50 review summary In Short: A staggering achievement in indie gaming that offers almost too much value for its own good, with 50 superb indie games \u2013 many of which could be standalone games in their own right. Pros: The range of games and the consistent quality is incredible, with some being surprisingly long and complex. Great retro stylings and a lot of clever ideas that deserve further exploration. Cons: Many of the games don\u2019t make a good first impression, at least in the first few minutes, with the game doing little to explain what they are before you start.

Some believe that it was just one of the many sky lanterns that are seen floating across the country\n\nA flying object that reportedly resembled a UFO was spotted flying over El Naranjo and Manzanillos, two neighborhoods located in the western city of Zit\u00e1cuaro\n\nFollowing the videos, some users took to X, formerly Twitter, to share their belief that aliens had made their way to Mexico.\n\n'That's that eye diamond UFO shape,' one person commented. '(Must) be some kind of organic ship.'\n\n'Spectacular video, contact between humans and alien races is getting closer and closer,' another X user chimed in. 'Anyone who continues to believe that it is a balloon, a drone, a hologram or something else is either blind or does not want to see reality.'\n\nHowever, others were quick to dispel the claims, pointing out that it was most likely just one of the many sky lanterns that float across the Mexican skies during the Globos de Cantoya festival.\n\nA large sky lantern floats towards a mountain outside of Paracho, a city in the western Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n, during the annual Globos de Cantoya festival\n\n'It may have been a test of a hot air balloon, as these balloons are very common in central Mexico and from a distance they can be confused with other objects,' another user explained.\n\nOne X user questioned the quality of the video but conceded that life probably exists outside our solar system.\n\n'So much technology, cell phones with too many mega pixels and images like that,' they said. 'I do believe that there is life on other planets, but some tests like this don't help much.'\n\nSome found humor in the alleged UFO sighting.\n\n'They went searching for atoles,' another X user said, referring to the traditional Mexican beverage that is made with water, masa (corn flour), piloncillo, (unrefined cane sugar), cinnamon and vanilla.\n\n'We will see more and more UFOs. And the government will make contact with them,' another person joked. 'We will obey in fear as always. But we will never see them.'"

Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s (D-N.Y.) office confirmed to The Hill.\n\nThe hearing announcement follows an increase in sightings of what\u2019s officially known as unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, including one purportedly near Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It would also come more than a year after an explosive House hearing in July 2023, when three former Pentagon officials testified about their experience with or sightings of UAP, warning that a lack of information on the phenomena could pose national security risks.\n\nNow Gillibrand, who in 2022 helped start the Pentagon\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) \u2014 created to assess reports of UAP \u2014 wants a progress update on the office\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a priority for me.

Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) requested the inspector general of the intelligence community to investigate the claims further.\n\nBut lawmakers have been frustrated with any progress since then, with Burchett suggesting in April that he believes the U.S. government was involved in a \u201ccover-up\u201d of information on UAP.\n\nA Pentagon report on UAP, released in March, concluded that there is no evidence the U.S. has reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology, pushing back on claims that it\u2019s hiding off-world spacecraft.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Read preview\n\nThe talent-management agency Dulcedo Group acquired the influencer-marketing app Node in a July deal that valued the company at around $13 million, Node's cofounders told Business Insider.\n\nNode is a mobile app that matches small businesses with micro and nano influencers for sponsored content opportunities. The company has worked with around 2,000 businesses across a roster of around 10,000 creators who post promotional content in exchange for gifted products, free in-person experiences, or cash. Cofounders Armin Faraji and Mackenzie D\u00e9rival launched the app in 2019. Node raised around a million dollars from angel investors and firms like Techstars and startup accelerator Alchemist, Faraji said.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe deal shows how important tech products, including artificial-intelligence tools, have become in the talent and marketing industries. M&A deals in the category have been bustling over the past 12 months as traditional ad agencies like Publicis Groupe and Stagwell have similarly added influencer startups to their company portfolios. Stagwell specifically called out Leaders' AI tech in its announcement around the deal.\n\nFounded in 2008 as an agency for more traditional media talent, Montreal-based Dulcedo Group has recently been on a buying spree, announcing in November it acquired creator talent agency Influence+All and PR firm Sundae Creative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNode began looking for a buyer in 2023 after it needed cash and ran into a challenging fundraising environment. It shrunk its company headcount to four staffers and hoped that joining a larger agency could help it win deals with bigger brands.\n\n\"We realized that agencies are the gatekeepers,\" D\u00e9rival said. \"We would rather join them and help them with technology and that would help us with monetization and provide value for our investors.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe cofounders ultimately connected with Dulcedo Group, which put in an offer to acquire Node. Dulcedo Group was drawn to the company's technological expertise and roster of micro influencers, Faraji told BI.\n\n\"A lot of agencies are actually acquiring technology from a defensive position,\" Faraji said. \"They're doing it because they are either losing customers to an influencer platform that's a tech startup, or their customers are coming to them and saying, 'Hey, do you guys have any technology? The way you're collecting data or the way that you're running these campaigns is inefficient,'\" he said. \"What drew us towards Dulcedo is that they're actually making acquisitions so that they can be offensive, not defensive. It's not just about protecting market share with them, it's about expanding market share and also addressing new customer segments within the creator economy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne area of focus for Node post-acquisition is AI. The company said it's developing AI tools to improve social listening and data analysis, and streamlining the process of identifying new talent to work with.\n\n\"AI automates the manual labor when it comes to influencer marketing,\" Faraji said. \"At the end of the day, relationships still rule the industry. Agencies will work with creators that they have relationships with, and creators will make compromises to work with agencies and brands that they love.\""

        "article_content": "At its annual Snap Partner Summit on Tuesday, the Snapchat maker announced a series of new AI features coming to its app. Most notably, the app\u2019s My AI chatbot is being updated to work more like Google Lens, as it can now respond to more complex Snaps.\n\nYou can now snap a picture of a menu in a foreign language and send it to My AI to get an English translation, for instance. Plus, you can take a picture of a plant and send it to the chatbot to find out what it\u2019s called.\n\nYou will also be able to snap a picture of a parking sign and send it to the chatbot to quickly understand whether you can park at a specific location.\n\nSimilar features were first made available to mobile consumers by Google Lens.\n\nImage Credits: Snap\n\nThe launch is another indication that Snapchat is looking to make My AI more of a useful tool, as opposed to just an entertainment feature. A few months ago, Snapchat rolled out the ability for users to set in-app reminders and countdowns through My AI. The new features announced today add more useful functionality to the chatbot, as Snap is trying to get users to open up its social app when they have certain search queries.\n\nIn addition to the updates to My AI, Snap announced that its \u201cMy Selfie\u201d feature will enable AI-powered edits in Memories (saved Snaps) for Snapchat+ premium subscribers. This feature will be used to spruce up your existing Snaps by adding captions and Lenses to Snaps that you have stored in your Memories archive. For instance, if you saved a picture of yourself in your Memories, Snapchat may add a Lens on top of it to reimagine yourself as a Renaissance painting.\n\nImage Credits: Snap\n\nPlus, you can now opt in to appear in AI-generated images alongside your friends. For instance, the app may create an AI-generated Snap of you and your friend as lawyers or Olympic swimmers.\n\nSnapchat also announced that it\u2019s going to launch an AI-powered Lens that will allow users to see what they will look like in the future. The launch appears to be Snapchat\u2019s response to TikTok\u2019s popular old-age filter.\n\nElsewhere on the app, Snapchat revealed that it\u2019s rolling out improved HD video calls and Snap Mail, which lets you leave your friend a Snap if they don\u2019t answer your call. The app is also going to start showing local time zones in chats to make it easier for people to know when to connect with friends around the world."

However, climate change has been causing severe disruptions in the region. In 2023, about 94% of the ocean's surface experienced at least one marine heatwave. Such heat stresses coral reefs, driving out the algae they rely on, causing bleaching and increased vulnerability to disease.\n\nOcean acidification, driven by the absorption of carbon dioxide, also causes coral structures and other calcium-based organisms to dissolve. Coral reefs themselves are made up of thousands of small creatures called polyps, which create hard calcium carbonate exoskeletons.\n\nThe Red Sea has suffered from significant coral bleaching and death in recent years. Although other factors, like pollution and low tides, can also cause bleaching, the discovery of the Grumpy Dwarfgoby highlights the importance of ongoing conservation efforts.\n\nRead Also: Mysterious deep-space radio signal reaches Earth after 8 billion years, leaving scientists puzzled\n\nUrgent Call for Conservation as Marine Biodiversity Faces Extinction\n\nViktor Nunes Peinemann, the lead scientist on the discovery, stated, \"Finding species like the Grumpy Dwarfgoby shows how much biodiversity remains hidden in the Red Sea. But the changing environment is worrying. We could lose some species before we even identify them.\" Peinemann discovered the fish during a dive, aiming to explore reef diversity.\n\nAs climate change threatens coral reefs, the urgent need for continued research and conservation efforts is clear."

        "article_content": "For most people, an extinct species is an abstraction, a set of bones they might have seen on display in a museum. For Gennady Boeskorov, they are things he has interacted with directly, studying their fur, their skin, their internal organs\u2014experiencing these animals much as they existed thousands of years ago. Some of the well-preserved Pleistocene animals he has worked with include the mummified remains of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), an extinct form of rabbit (Lepus tanaiticus), and cave lion cubs (Panthera spelaea).\n\nHis latest paper also makes it clear that woolly rhinoceroses belong on this list. Boeskorov is a senior researcher at the Diamond and Precious Metals Geology Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as a professor at the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk. This July, he and his colleagues described the relatively recent discovery of three woolly rhinoceros mummies, one of which is new to science, in a paper published in the journal Doklady Earth Sciences.\n\nWoolly rhinos (Coelodonta antiquitatis) were stocky, long-haired, two-horned denizens that inhabited Eurasia during the Pleistocene, a period that includes the most recent glacial expansion. They coexisted with woolly mammoths, placing second on the list of largest animals in this ecosystem (behind their tusked proboscidean coevals), and shared a similar dense coat of hair to protect against the cold.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a great deal from their bones; we\u2019re learning even more thanks to their mummies. Being able to directly observe their hair and skin, for example, offers more evidence regarding just how well-adapted these animals were to their harsh environment. And the preservation of soft tissue has allowed us to test a hypothesis that was based on a combination of the organization of their skeletons and depictions in cave art.\n\nWoolly rhino fossils are abundant, but their mummies are exceedingly rare. To date, there have only been a handful of nearly complete woolly rhinos (although news of another has been recently announced). The three mummies in this paper all hail from Yakutia\u2014also known as the Sakha Republic\u2014in northeastern Russia, but they are vastly different in age and preservation.\n\nA trio of finds\n\nSasha is the first complete baby woolly rhino ever discovered. Although missing about half of its body, it is arguably the most well-preserved of the three, maintaining its fluffy little strawberry-blonde head, a couple of legs, and much of its fluffy torso. The loss of its lower half prevents determination of its sex, but Sasha was between 12 and 18 months old when it died, based on its teeth and the sutures within its skull as seen through CT scans.\n\nSo Sasha might have still been nursing at the time of death. Wear on its frontal horn\u2014the second horn following the one above its nose\u2014may have been caused by \u201crubbing against its mother\u2019s belly\u201d as it nursed, scientists suggested in 2015. The mummy was found in 2014 along the banks of a river, and although the cause of death has yet to be determined, sediment in its nasal passages indicate drowning in mud.\n\nBy contrast, the newest mummy is missing much of one side of its body, including most of the intestines\u2014the result of predation, according to the authors. The other side, however, preserves skin, some hair, and soft tissues. Nicknamed the \u201cAbyisky rhinoceros\u201d for its discovery in Yakutia\u2019s Abyisky District in 2020, it is estimated to be a juvenile of about 4 to 4.5 years. This mummy was also found along the banks of a river and, just like Sasha, its sex hasn\u2019t been determined.\n\nClues to its age, however, were found among the animal\u2019s overall height, its skull bones, and the length and characteristics of its nasal horn (the horn that grows right above its nostrils). Like tree rings or the rings found in mammoth tusks, the number of transverse stripes on the outside of nasal horns indicates the animal\u2019s age. The Abyisky mummy has little surviving hair; tufts of it appear in bits and pieces. The manner of death remains a mystery, but arthropod remnants in its hair indicate that its carcass spent time in a small body of fresh water.\n\nBoth the oldest at the time of her death and the oldest in terms of discovery, the Kolyma mummy was uncovered in 2007 in a Kolyma gold mine. The position in which her body was found\u2014her legs pressed to her torso and her head stretched upward\u2014indicates she fell into and was trapped within a confined space. Like the Abyisky mummy, she is well-preserved on one side of her body, but she was not preserved whole. Her horns and legs were found nearby. Her skeletonized head\u2014once joined to the body\u2014was separated when she was excavated from the sediment. Her hair is preserved in tufts.\n\nAn udder and nipples are among the anatomical evidence that this is a female. The transverse stripes on her horn, along with teeth, skull, and height, confirm her age at death was approximately 20 years. Spores and pollen within her preserved stomach confirm what was deduced by previous studies of woolly rhino teeth: They enjoyed an herbivorous diet of grasses, shrubs, and numerous other plants."

First, the technology will allow businesses to create their own apps and workflows. \"As we say, English is the future coding language, and we see that AI is going to be a bigger revolution on the market than even internet was many years ago,\" she explains.\n\nThe second way she believes AI will change the market is by \"raising the productivity and efficiency of knowledge workers who use this software for case resolution service management, call center management, marketing, sales automation, you name it.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend.\n\nThis post was written by Melanie Riehl"
