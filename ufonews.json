        "article_content": "BELLEVILLE \u2014 Back in 1987, a strange set of lights shone in the skies over Belleville. Every year since, residents have carried out 5K runs, craft markets and parades under the title UFO Days, perhaps hoping to tempt extraterrestrial visitors to come back.\n\nSaturday\u2019s UFO Parade marked 38 years of the alien-centric festivities \u2014 and 100 years of lifelong Belleville resident Art Fahey, the parade\u2019s grand marshal who lives in the same farmhouse he was born in.\n\nHaving lived through the Great Depression, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and multiple wars, Fahey isn\u2019t much fazed what he sees on on a day-to-day basis \u2014 even when dozens of little green martians follow him down Main Street toting huge bags of candy. (Little known fact: If you throw a peanut butter cup hard enough, it briefly becomes an unidentified flying object.)\n\n\u201cThey asked me if I would be (grand marshal) because I\u2019m 100 years old and I live on the farm I was born in, so I said, \u2018Well, yeah I guess I could do it,\u2019\u201d Fahey said Saturday.\n\nHometown Olympian Lauren O\u2019Connor was originally named grand marshal. But the rower was out of town during the festivities, and Fahey graciously agreed to take her convertible seat and wave to the town he\u2019s loved his whole life.\n\nA colorful array of creatures waved back at Fahey, children breaking in their costumes in the days leading up to Halloween and little fairies dancing in the grass, their wiry wings struggling against the bulk of coats and sweatshirts. Dinosaurs and vampires chased each other, vying for those coveted sour gummies and string cheese sticks. Elvis even made an appearance. He isn\u2019t dead \u2014 he\u2019s just shorter now, wears Nike sneakers and carries a Halloween candy tote.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve led a good life\u2019\n\nIn the hours before he was due to lead the parade, Fahey recalled his own childhood, when his house had no electricity and an ice cream bar cost a nickel. He obliged the Wisconsin State Journal\u2019s many questions about life at 100, surrounded by family in the Lingonberry Llama, a Main Street coffee shop. He may not have been to the Olympics, but his is a story worth hearing nonetheless.\n\nHe\u2019s a lifelong farmer. He loves his beer. He\u2019s been to Hawaii twice. The highlight of his life, apart from his wedding day and the birth of his four children, of course, was getting electricity in his home in 1942.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain it, but I\u2019ve led a good life,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday nights, Fahey and his brother could go to free movies in a nearby park. Their father would send them out with a dime each, enough for a bag of popcorn or an ice cream bar, each of which, Fahey said, cost a nickel.\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019d bring home a nickel,\u201d he said. \u201cA nickel was a nickel.\u201d\n\nFun in those days looked like a battery-powered radio, a local party or a dance. Fahey dated on and off, but back then, he said, he wasn\u2019t in much of a hurry to get to the altar.\n\n\u201cSome of these farm girls, they want to get married,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to go out with the boys for a couple of years, that was kind of a fun time with the boys.\u201d\n\nFahey and friends learned that if they carried around a pencil and looked at the marks on the hands of people who\u2019d already paid, they could copy the marks and get in for free. Now that he\u2019s out of the woods of criminal liability for those petty crimes, Fahey said the trick worked about 90% of the time.\n\nA close family\n\nFahey met his late wife dancing and continued dancing with her until her death. They had four children, John, Art, Connie and Nancy, all of whom are exceptionally proud of their father.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen a lot in his life so he\u2019s very generous, ya know,\u201d Art said. \u201cI think it\u2019s faith, family and friends, and not necessarily in that order.\u201d\n\nFahey is equally as proud of his kids, though he contends that he isn\u2019t quite sure how he managed to do such a good job raising them.\n\n\u201cWe got a close family. I can think of a couple families right now where brothers and sisters don\u2019t even talk to each other, but we are close,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cI guess I did a pretty good job. I didn\u2019t really know I was doing it.\u201d\n\nThe reason Fahey has stayed in Belleville is simple \u2014 he sees no reason to move anyplace else.\n\n\u201cBelleville\u2019s got everything. They got church, they got the store, they got the bank, that\u2019s all I need,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s even allowed to drive still \u2014 though not farther than 10 miles. Given his affinity for his hometown, though, that isn\u2019t much of a problem for Fahey. If he needs to go farther, he gets a ride from family or friends.\n\nHe\u2019s kept up his health, although he doesn\u2019t see much use for his occasional doctor appointments.\n\n\u201cYou know, I get into the doctor, he\u2019ll tell me exactly what I already know. Why should I go at 100 years old?\u201d Fahey said. \u201cThe splendid thing is, I don\u2019t have to use a cane or a walker. My balance isn\u2019t that great, but I got to have something wrong with me at 100 years.\u201d\n\n50 best alien movies #50. The Vast of Night (2019) #49. Starman (1984) #48. Gandahar (1987) #47.

        "article_content": "Good microphone quality is crucial for accurate AI voice recognition on apps like ChatGPT.\n\nMic proximity and polar pattern impact audio quality and recognition accuracy.\n\nConsider using conference mics or clip-on lapel mics for improved vocal pickup with AI assistants.\n\nI've been playing around with apps like ChatGPT's advanced voice modes, and although the tech is incredibly impressive, I do find that the software mishears me. Most of the time, it does a good job, but when I hook up one of my good mics, things definitely improve. So, if you like using the voice function of an AI assistant, you might want to consider using a better microphone than the one built into your computer or headset.\n\nYour AI Needs to Hear You\n\nIf you've ever listened to someone over a phone or laptop microphone, you know that they don't sound great. Even with our brains tuned by evolution to pick out speech, it's easy to mishear what someone says over a low-quality microphone. So, honestly, I'm amazed at how accurate things are when using an app like ChatGPT to converse with software.\n\nDibakar Ghosh / How-To Geek\n\nNow, if you listen to someone speaking using a proper podcast or vocal microphone, you can hear every detail of what they say. There's no mistaking an \"m\" for an \"n\", for example. While there are great algorithms working in the background to cut out noise and compensate for the relatively poor quality of these tiny microphones, there's no substitute for a quality mic in the first place.\n\nIt's not just the new wave of AI chatbots that this matters either. I've pointed out in the past that a good quality mic can make all the difference when you're trying to write by using dictation software. The same principle applies.\n\nPick a Mic That Matches Your Direction\n\nSydney Louw Butler / How-To Geek\n\nA lot of people underestimate how close a mic needs to be to your mouth in order to get a good, clean audio signal from it. If you've ever had to record your voice, you know that in most cases you need to get that mic pretty close to your mouth. If you can't, you need to use a microphone that's better suited to picking up voices at a distance.\n\nWhat plays a crucial role here is the mic's \"polar pattern\", which is simply the pattern of its sensitivity to sound. For my YouTube channel, I use a special shotgun mic attachment for my offboard recorder, but that's not really practical for a desktop setup, though it is excellent for recording my voice from outside the video frame and will only pick up sound within a narrow \"beam.\" It's an example of a hypercardioid microphone. On the opposite side of the spectrum, an omnidirectional mic will pick up sound all around it, so it's good for recording ambient sound, but not optimized for someone who's always speaking from the same position.\n\nI think a good cardioid podcast condenser microphone will likely improve the performance of voice recognition for most people in most situations.\n\nConsider Wearing a Clip-On Mic\n\nSydney Louw Butler / How-To Geek\n\nWhile it's cool to poke fun at all those AI gadgets that are basically a mic pin, they are on to something with the position of the microphone. If you make use of a cheap wired lapel (aka lavolier) mic that should improve your vocal pickup significantly. If you really want to be fancy, you can use a clip-on Bluetooth lapel mic, which gives you the clarity of a headset, without the inconvenience of wearing one. Personally, I use the Rode Wireless GO II for all my wireless mic applications, but that's probably a little too expensive to justify for AI specifically.\n\nConference Mics Might Be a Good Idea\n\nThough I haven't tried this yet for AI chatbots in particular, it occurs to me that omnidirectional conference mics and speakerphones could be a great solution for this. After all, they were designed to let a group of people sitting around a conference table all talk from any distance and direction in the room. This isn't dissimilar to the microphone arrays you'll find in smart speakers. It would actually be pretty great if existing smart speakers could work with apps like ChatGPT, and that might be something that happens in the future.\n\nThis only really makes sense if you're going to be having a chat with your synthetic friends while moving around the room, but I can imagine many cases where that's exactly what you want to do, and barring a clip-on wireless mic or Bluetooth headset, a conference mic could be a great choice."

        "article_content": "Rita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR A leak from Google\u2019s gChips division has revealed new AI tricks and software-based camera features for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 11.\n\nPotential camera improvements include support for 4K 60fps HDR video, 100x zoom, an upgrade to the Cinematic Blur feature, and a new \u201cUltra Low Light\u201d video mode for capturing quality footage in very dim lighting.\n\nThe upcoming Pixel devices may also introduce ML-based always-on features related to health monitoring and activity tracking.\n\nThe thing that usually leaks last about Pixel devices is the software features. While every detail of the hardware typically leaks months in advance, we usually only learn about the new software right before the launch.\n\nThis is not the case today, as thanks to a massive leak from Google\u2019s gChips division, Android Authority has viewed credible documents that hint at a few new features we can expect from the Pixel 10 and Pixel 11.\n\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\n\nEven more AI\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nThe big thing Google phones currently focus on is AI features, and it\u2019s no different in the case of the upcoming Pixel phones.\n\nThanks to its improved TPU, Tensor G5 (expected to make its debut in the Pixel 10 series and newer), will be getting \u201cVideo Generative ML\u201d features. While that\u2019s a pretty vague name, learning the intended use case explains what the feature will do a bit better: \u201cPost-capture Generative AI-based Intuitive Video Editing for the Photos app.\u201d We can only guess what this means exactly, but it sounds like Google will let users edit their videos more easily by using AI that actually understands the video. The feature might also be available in the YouTube app, specifically for YouTube Shorts.\n\nPixel 11 may also offer 100x zoom capabilities\n\nGoogle is also exploring several AI features for photo editing, including \u201cSpeak-to-Tweak,\u201d which seems to be an LLM-based editing tool, and \u201cSketch-to-Image,\u201d which is self-explanatory and resembles a similar feature offered by Samsung\u2019s Galaxy AI. Additionally, there is prior evidence indicating that Google is developing a Sketch-to-Image feature for its Gemini project.\n\nGoogle is also working on a \u201cMagic Mirror\u201d feature, but unfortunately, no extra context could be gathered from the leaked documents. Additionally, the Tensor G5 should also be capable of running Stable Diffusion-based models locally, which could be used in the Pixel Studio app, instead of the current server-based solution.\n\nPromising camera improvements\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nGoogle focuses heavily on the cameras of its phones, so it\u2019s not surprising that many of the new features are related to this area. Firstly, Tensor G5 finally supports 4K 60fps HDR video, whereas previous models only allowed up to 4K 30fps video.\n\nThe Pixel 11 may also offer 100x zoom capabilities through Machine Learning for both photos and videos. However, we anticipate that the algorithms used for each will differ, so don\u2019t expect identical quality across formats. Additionally, the documents reference a \u201cnext-gen\u201d telephoto camera designed to enhance this feature, suggesting that significant hardware upgrades could be on the way as well.\n\nThe most exciting feature potentially coming to the Pixel 11 is Ultra Low Light video.\n\nCinematic Blur is getting an upgrade on the Pixel 11, too, with support for 4K 30fps and a new \u201cvideo relight\u201d feature that seems to change lighting conditions in videos. Both of these new features are made possible by a \u201cCinematic Rendering Engine\u201d in the chip\u2019s image signal processor. The inclusion of the new hardware block also reduces the power draw of video recording with blur by almost 40%.\n\nLast, and perhaps the most exciting feature potentially coming to the Pixel 11 is \u201cUltra Low Light video,\u201d also referred to as \u201cNight Sight video.\u201d A feature of this name already exists, but it relies on processing in the cloud, whereas this one is fully on-device. Google specifically mentioned 5-10 lux are the intended lighting conditions for the feature. This is considered very low light, similar to the illumination provided by a dimly lit room or the light from a cloudy sky at dusk; for example, it\u2019s comparable to the brightness of a candle placed about one meter away. The new feature will also rely on new camera hardware to achieve the intended results.\n\nNew ambient features Thanks to the inclusion of a new \u201cnanoTPU\u201d in the low-power part of the Tensor G6, Google is planning on adding a few ML-based always-on features to the Pixel phones. A good chunk of these are health-related features, such as detection of \u201cagonal breathing, cough, snore, sneeze, and sleep apnea, fall detection, gait analysis, and sleep stages monitoring.\u201d There\u2019s also emergency sound event detection.\n\nSome of the features are also for activity tracking, like \u201cRunning ML,\u201d which is a collection of tools for runners, such as \u201ccoachable pace\u201d and \u201cbalance & oscillation\u201d analysis.\n\nPixel 11 might also bring support for more Quick phrases, but unfortunately, no list was given.\n\nWhich Pixel 10 and 11 software feature are you most excited about? 62 votes AI features like \"Speak-to-Tweak\" and \"Sketch-to-Image\" 2 % Video Generative ML 5 % 4K 60fps HDR video 19 % 100x zoom 24 % Cinematic Blur upgrade 3 % Ultra Low Light video 40 % Health-related features 6 %\n\nWhich potential new features are you most excited about?

The research used the number of reported paranormal incidents in each location to determine the spookiest places, and also revealed the most common types of hauntings, along with some eerie case studies featuring real-life examples.\n\nDespite Bath's high ranking, it was dwarfed by London, which emerged as the UK's most haunted city, boasting almost five times more paranormal activity than the second city on the list, with a staggering 719 reported incidents. Brighton followed with 146 spooky happenings. Edinburgh, York, Bristol and Nottingham rounded off the top five scariest locations.\n\nIf you're looking to avoid a fright this Halloween, Cardiff is your best bet. The Welsh capital has only 26 reported instances of paranormal activity on record, giving you all the more reason to visit 'The City of Castles' in the coming weeks.\n\nSo, what are the most common types of ghostly goings-on?\n\nHaunting manifestations top the list, with 2,372 incidents reported so far. These manifestations typically involve unexplained footsteps, items moving unexpectedly, and spirits being seen or felt.\n\nFrequent activities reported include encounters with poltergeists and legendary figures from the past, sightings of ghosts and mythical beings.\n\nThe most prevalent paranormal occurrence is hearing footsteps with no discernible source, closely followed by sightings of spectral ladies in white and grey."

        "article_content": "Standing below the hay loft, Julie Bukovich listened to the heavy grunts and creaks of the old barn as the sun set outside and the evening grew colder. She\u2019d been living with her boyfriend on the 19-acre Chesapeake farm for long enough that the sounds were familiar. But the feeling she\u2019d recently been getting \u2014 a sense, like an invisible presence, something hovering, something watching her \u2014 was new. On this March evening, she watched the expert she\u2019d called to investigate go to work.\n\nThe lanky, blue-eyed teenager strode through the barn, past rows of hanging tools and between stacks of horse feed. He held a bundle of smoldering sage above his head like an Olympic torch and left a trail of scented smoke.\n\n\u201cThank you. Thank you for being here,\u201d Bukovich said, opening a side door and pointing into a hallway, fumbling to find a light switch. \u201cIn there is where there\u2019s been a lot of activity.\u201d\n\nGhost hunter William Abbitt, 18, took a deep breath, pulled out a bottle of holy water that had been blessed by a Catholic priest in Virginia Beach, and stepped into the darkness.\n\nAbbitt isn\u2019t a devout follower of any one religion but knows items such as holy water and crucifixes calm the nerves of those who do or believe. He often suspects a haunting has more to do with faulty wiring, chemical-induced hallucinations or anxiety.\n\nHe walked into the dim hallway that led to a storage area, sprinkled the holy water on the far door and recited a Catholic prayer.\n\n\u201cSt. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection \u2026\u201d\n\nAbbitt started investigating suspected paranormal activities as a sophomore at Grassfield High School in Chesapeake. His reputation has grown among his peers as he\u2019s outlined cases on his website and in videos on a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploits of his team: WTCW Paranormal.\n\nHe has led WTCW Paranormal on 35 investigations into local lore and claims of the supernatural in Hampton Roads, at historical sites, businesses and homes. The group\u2019s mission is to research and remain skeptical. He isn\u2019t sure how much he believes in the supernatural. Which is why he got into the whole ghost thing in the first place.\n\n___\n\nWhen Abbitt was around 7, he, his mom and his two big sisters moved into a Virginia Beach house where doors opened and closed inexplicably and it felt like he was living with an angry spirit. \u201cClassic poltergeist activity,\u201d he now says.\n\nAfter the family moved to Chesapeake, he wanted to disbelieve what he remembered. Except he couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn high school, he started by reading the Bible and the Torah.\n\nHe moved to theology and dabbled in demonological literature with texts including Frank and Ida Mae Hammond\u2019s \u201cPigs in the Parlor: The Practical Guide to Deliverance\u201d and dove into mysticism with texts such as the anonymously authored grimoire \u201cThe Lesser Key of Solomon.\u201d He combed through online parapsychological studies and developed a disdain for TV shows that depicted paranormal investigations lacking the scientific method.\n\nToo many people, he thought, took the subject too lightly. Plus, he was having fun.\n\nAbbitt started saving money he made after school at Wendy\u2019s and during the winter break selling Christmas trees to buy equipment that he\u2019d read was essential for paranormal investigations: A camcorder with night vision; a digital audio recorder; flashlights and headlamps; six motion sensors; an infrared laser temperature reader in case ghosts prompt drops in temperature; an ambient temperature deviation device that doubles as a spirit box which cycles through radio frequencies and may be a useful tool for the dead to speak through; an EMF reader, based on hypotheses that ghosts cause shifts in electromagnetic field strengths; frankincense; myrrh; holy water; and walkie-talkies, all of which he stores in a traveling case.\n\nWTCW stands for the founders\u2019 first names: William, Tate, Chris and William. Abbitt is the only founder remaining. Two left the group to pursue other interests and one died this year. But on July 14, 2022, they were all together when they set out to conduct their first \u201cbig\u201d investigation.\n\nThe four of them spent part of the night at the Ferry Plantation House, which dates back to about 1830 and is said to have multiple spirits. Abbitt\u2019s camcorder caught a creaking sound like someone walking up the stairs.\n\nAt her farm in March, Bukovich found nothing funny about what she had experienced in and around her barn. She\u2019d been scared by an icky presence in the barn and showed Abbitt a recording on her security cameras which showed a bright orb of light floating in her driveway. She felt more at ease after his visit and liked the seriousness with which he performed the cleansing ritual in her barn. She felt heard.\n\n___\n\nAbbitt frequently posts online notices for new team members, and responses come in from teens to people older than 50. They want to be investigators, camera operators, psychics or demonologists for the team, which has fluctuated between two and eight people.\n\nRecently he got his first post-high school job working construction and uses it to fund WTCW Paranormal. In May, he investigated the Wells Theatre in downtown Norfolk with his then-newest team member. Sammi Cocuzzo, 25, a psychic from Chesapeake, was excited. According to the Wells, the theater is home to three ghosts, including Ned the Stagehand, who haunts the backstage fly rail where he used to raise and lower stage backdrops.\n\nOn a Friday morning, theater staff led the team backstage. The performance space was dark, and Abbitt handed out headlamps. Two team members stayed on the first floor, and he and Cocuzzo climbed a staircase toward a balcony overlooking the stage and Ned\u2019s favorite stomping grounds.\n\nStanding the dark, Cocuzzo lifted her hands to about chest height, one palm facing out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m picking up on a woman,\u201d she said, and spoke into Abbitt\u2019s nearby spirit box, hoping for a reply.\n\n\u201cNed, if you\u2019re here can you give us a sign? Can you manipulate this energy?\u201d she later asked.\n\nShe continued to ask questions. Abbitt stared at the EMF meter. Then, suddenly, they heard a bang from the staircase. It sounded like the thud of a heavy object after a fall, and Abbitt\u2019s walkie-talkie lit up.\n\nYes, Abbitt said. But no one had seen anything.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really active,\u201d Cocuzzo said, standing close to Abbitt. \u201cBut they are kind of chilling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, they aren\u2019t really messing with us right now,\u201d Abbitt said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good thing.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d brought his skepticism to the investigation, but in the moment he sounded like a believer.\n\nCocuzzo looked over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cI get the feeling that they like it here.\u201d\n\nColin Warren-Hicks, 919-818-8138, colin.warrenhicks@virginiamedia.com"

        "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2013 including the Nobel committees \u2013 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI\u2019s potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \u201cone of the most transformative technologies in human history\u201d. But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2013 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \u201cillusion of explanatory depth\u201d. Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \u201cillusion of exploratory breadth\u201d. Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nFinally, the \u201cillusion of objectivity\u201d. Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI\u2019s increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \u201cAI Scientist\u201d machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company\u2019s vision is to develop a \u201cfully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\u201d, where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2013 though critics said the system produced \u201cendless scientific slop\u201d.\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \u201caccelerate\u201d the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value, further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high, but we can\u2019t take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, calls to \u201ctrust the science\u201d can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritises the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2013 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalise the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \u201coutsourcing\u201d that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI? And how can researchers remain aligned with society\u2019s expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt\u2019s time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2013 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly.\n\nEhsan Nabavi is senior lecturer in technology and society, Responsible Innovation Lab, Australian National University.

In short Scientists have discovered a group of neurons in the brainstem that could be the control center for REM sleep, a stage often disrupted in sleep disorders.\n\nBy manipulating these neurons, they were able to alter sleep patterns in mice, suggesting potential new treatments for conditions like sleep apnea and narcolepsy.\n\nThis breakthrough could pave the way for better understanding and treatment of sleep disorders. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe discovery was made through experiments on mice\n\nBreakthrough discovery could lead to new treatments for sleep disorders\n\nBy Akash Pandey 04:58 pm Oct 27, 202404:58 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a major breakthrough in sleep research, a team of scientists has identified the neural control center for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The discovery, made through experiments on mice, saw researchers inducing REM sleep by stimulating a specific circuit at the top of the brainstem. The findings could potentially deepen our understanding of human sleep biology and its disorders.\n\nTherapeutic implications\n\nPotential applications in treating sleep disorders\n\nThe team's findings could have major implications in treating sleep disorders like sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and REM disorders. These conditions often involve distressing nightmares or physical manifestations of dreams through movement or vocalizations. The newfound knowledge about the brain's control center for REM sleep, could potentially be used to manipulate this stage of sleep in patients suffering from these disorders.\n\nResearch challenges\n\nUnraveling the mysteries of REM sleep\n\nThe precise location and role of the brain's REM sleep control center have long been debated among scientists. Some researchers have proposed that neurons in the mammalian brainstem are key to triggering REM sleep. This theory stems from observations in cats, where removal or damage to the brainstem prevents proper REM sleep and leads to dream enactment behaviors.\n\nNeurological insights\n\nBrainstem's role in REM sleep and related disorders\n\nSimilar dream enactment behaviors have been seen in humans with known brainstem degeneration (like in Parkinson's disease). This further supports the theory of the brainstem's role in REM sleep. The pons, at the top of the brainstem, has been identified as a potential 'control center' for muscle relaxation during REM sleep through rodent studies. However, identifying specific pathways responsible for this crucial phase has proved challenging due to intermingling neurons promoting wakefulness and sleep.\n\nNeuronal discovery\n\nDiscovery of REM-related neurons in the brainstem\n\nNeuroscientist Mitsuaki Kashiwagi and his team have pinpointed a cluster of REM-related neurons in the dorsal region of the pons. These neurons, called Crhbp+ neurons due to their expression of a corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein, project from the pons to Nos1+ neurons in the medulla oblongata. This loop could potentially act as a core circuit for REM sleep, Kashiwagi and his colleagues said.\n\nExperimental results\n\nManipulation of pons neurons affects REM sleep\n\nThe team's experiments revealed that when pons neurons were taken out of the loop, mice had less sleep and impaired muscle relaxation during REM sleep. On the other hand, activating these neurons increased the number and duration of REM episodes at the cost of wakefulness. This indicates that manipulating these neurons could potentially be used as a therapeutic strategy for sleep disorders."

As of October 20, 2024, Rexas Finance's presale had raised over $4 million and sold over 80 million RXS tokens. After rising over 1,900% to the current price of $0.06, early investors will find a significant upside from the $0.20 IPO price. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is now a major competitor for fast growth in the upcoming bull cycle since its recent listing on CoinMarketCap has also enhanced openness and generated investor trust. The Rexas Team also recently announced a $1 million giveaway, which will see 20 lucky winners earn $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. Among Rexas Finance's distinctive offerings are yield optimization, DeFi tools, and a no-code token-creating service. These creative features in the Rexas Finance ecosystem and presale benchmarks show how likely the project is to turn a meager $10 investment into $1,000 in the next bull cycle as more investors swarm to it.\n\nNeiro (NEIRO) Eyes New High\n\nWith a 4,608% rise in value in just one month, Neiro Coin (NEIRO) has sprung into the market. In just 30 days, the memecoin soared from $0.000039 to $0.002, a 48x return. Even with a 15% retracing from its peak, Neiro still offers great potential for investors wishing to profit from its volatility. Forecasts from CoinCodex indicate that Neiro might see even another significant rise, maybe reaching $0.019284 by November 2024. Many traders expect a rebound because of the present price decline, finding support at important Fibonacci levels. Neiro's stochastic RSI likewise points to an oversold situation, implying a 20% short-term potential gain. Come the next cycle, NEIRO remains a potential candidate ready to turn a $10 investment into $1000.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) Burn Rate Surges Over 340%\n\nSupported by a strong community and strategic vision, Shiba Inu (SHIB) still dominates the memecoin market. Thanks to fresh hope about its long-term viability, SHIB's price has recently surged by over 2%. Shiba Inu ecosystem advocates worldwide acceptance to become a household name like Coca-Cola. Fueled by the community-driven burn rate, Shiba Inu's deflationary mechanism has been crucial in helping to steady its price. With over 8.4 million tokens burned, the SHIB burn rate rose by 345.97% in the past 24 hours alone. Together with a favorable market attitude from the Shib Army, this deflationary pressure has helped SHIB stay a fierce competitor in the crypto scene. Shiba Inu's emphasis on long-term utility and product diversity sets it for a notable increase in the next bull cycle, even if it is now trading at $0.00001921.\n\nConclusion\n\nThree coins that might increase a $10 investment into $1,000 once the next bull cycle starts are Rexas Finance, Neiro, and Shiba Inu. Thanks to Rexas Finance's successful presale, Neiro's exponential development, and Shiba Inu's great community support, these cryptocurrencies present significant prospects for investors wishing to ride the next market spike. Don't miss it; think about including these currencies in your portfolio right now!\n\nAbout Rexas Finance :-\n\nWebsite: https://rexas.com\n\nDisclaimer:The information provided on the Website does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other form of advice, and you should not interpret any of the Website's content as such.

The 49ers won 36-24.AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson\n\nA classic NFL rivalry will be renewed on Sunday Night Football when the Dallas Cowboys visit the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nNew users registering with today\u2019s DraftKings promo code (no code required) can claim a $200 guaranteed bonus for this NFL Week 8 matchup and more football action.\n\nDraftKings promo code at a glance\n\n\ud83c\udf81 DraftKings promo code No code required \ud83d\udcb0 DraftKings promo code bonus Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets instantly \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum deposit $5 \ud83d\udcdd DraftKings promo code terms and conditions Get $200 in bonus bets instantly after your first $5+ wager.\n\n\n\nBonus received as eight $25 bonus bets.\n\n\n\nBonus bets are single-use, non-withdrawable and expire seven days after receipt. \u2705 Last verified Oct. 27, 2024\n\nDraftKings promo code: How to claim your $200 guaranteed bonus\n\nDraftKings is not messing around with this week\u2019s new user bonus. The online sports betting giant gives newcomers a guaranteed $200 bonus for signing up and placing a wager.\n\nSounds incredible, right? Follow these steps to grab the offer:\n\nUse our DraftKings promo code link to access the registration page and click \u201cSign Up.\u201d Fill in the required fields. If you register using our link, you will not need a code. Complete your registration and establish a banking method. Deposit a minimum of $5 into your new account. Place a wager of at least $5 using your cash balance on Cowboys vs. 49ers or any other sporting event.\n\nWhen you make that $5 wager, DraftKings will award your $200 bonus as eight $25 bonus bets. These bonus bets can be used on any game but must be used within seven days. After that, they will expire.\n\nDraftKings promos for existing users\n\nEven after you use all your bonus bets, there are goodies to grab at DraftKings. All DK Sportsbook users can take advantage of these ongoing promotions to enhance their sports betting experience:\n\nNo Sweat Bets: If your wager loses, you\u2019ll receive a bonus bet to try again on another game.\n\nOdds boosts : Get enhanced odds on select betting markets.\n\nJackpot pools: Make your picks for free and play for jackpots that increase daily.\n\nCowboys vs. 49ers odds to use with your DraftKings promo code\n\nDallas and San Francisco envisioned their seasons going differently than they have, so you can count on both teams to play with desperation on Sunday Night Football.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook has San Francisco (3-4 SU, 3-4 ATS) favored by 5.5 points over Dallas (3-3 SU, 2-4 ATS). The over/under is 48 points \u2013 the second-highest total on the board for NFL Week 8.\n\nThe 49ers can\u2019t get any momentum going, as they have alternated losses and wins each of the last five weeks. If that trend continues, it\u2019s good news this week because they are coming off a loss to Kansas City in last week\u2019s Super Bowl rematch.\n\nThe return of All-Pro RB Christian McCaffrey doesn\u2019t seem likely for Sunday Night Football.\n\nDallas should be in better health since it has not played since Oct. 13, when it got embarrassed by the Lions, 47-9, on its home turf. The good news for the Cowboys on SNF is they are 3-0 on the road this season.\n\nThe bad news is that San Francisco owns Dallas over the last few seasons. The 49ers have won the last three meetings, including 42-10 last October in San Francisco."

The last census was conducted in 2011, and the exercise was scheduled to be held in 2021 but was delayed due to the Covid\n\n-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Census may start from next year. The census will start from 2025 and continue till 2026,\" sources told ABP News.\n\nAs per the sources privy to the development, the cycle of the census will also change now. Till now, the exercise which was held at the beginning of every decade, will now be held in the mid-decade. \"Census which is held every 10 years, used to be held at the start of the decade like in 2001, 2011. Now, after 2025, it will be held in 2035, 2045, 2055 and so on,\" they said.\n\nOn the delimitation of Lok Sabha seats, sources said it will start after the census is completed. The delimitation process is likely to be complete by 2028, they said.\n\nMoreover, while the religion and class of the people would be taken into account in the census, the government is yet to decide whether a caste census would be undertaken as demanded by many opposition parties. However, according to sources, this time around people might also be asked which sect they follow.\n\n\"General, Scheduled Caste and Tribe are counted in the census. But, this time people can also be asked which sect they follow. For example, in Karnataka, Lingayats who come under the general category consider themselves to be a separate sect. Similarly, there are different sects like Valmiki and Ravidasi among others in the Scheduled Castes. Because of this, the government is considering the demand for a census on the basis of sect along with religion and class,\" they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the central deputation of Mritunjay Kumar Narayan, who is currently serving as the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, has been extended till August 2026, hinting that the commencement of the much-delayed census process will be started soon."
