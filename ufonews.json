            "date": "Windows Latest22h",
            "source": "Windows Latest",
            "article_content": "In a previous post, we covered Microsoft\u2019s plans to rebrand the Microsoft 365 app to Microsoft 365 Copilot. It\u2019s obvious that Copilot will take center stage in the upcoming version, and a recent Microsoft 365 roadmap seen by Windows Latest gives a brief idea of what\u2019s coming.\n\nFirstly, the Copilot page will automatically launch when clicking the Copilot keyboard key in the Microsoft 365 app. The next big change is retiring the top header to give a more clean look to the UI. It is a big change because the right part of the bar contains profile and account-related options.\n\nAll these options will now migrate to the bottom of the left-side menu. So, you\u2019ll need to expand the Settings and more section to access profile, feedback, and app settings.\n\nMicrosoft is also retiring the organization name header, which appeared in the top header. A valid reason for removing this is that Copilot is a tool to get the job done but not a crucial app like Word or Excel, which the organization uses most of the time.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019ll move the AI features like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages to the left sidebar in hopes of drawing more eyeballs than usual. To make space for Copilot, it\u2019s removing the My Day and Help me Create buttons, which have no need since Copilot is a polished version for queries, summarization, and generation tasks.\n\nYou\u2019ll also not see the Back button because Microsoft believes the tabbed interface is enough to switch between multiple apps or app pages.\n\nAlso, what about the search bar? It\u2019s now set to appear on the homepage so you can look for content across different sections, but there are no other changes to the search bar. Only the position is changing.\n\nAll these app changes apply to both the web and desktop versions of the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. You can expect these changes to be reflected in the service from the third week of January 2025.\n\nBut are these changes helpful for the end user?\n\nCopilot is omnipresent\n\nRebranding an already confusing name like Microsoft 365 to Microsoft 365 Copilot makes little sense. With all the hype this AI assistant has received for the last year or so, rarely users or organizations don\u2019t know about it.\n\nEven worse is renaming the simple Copilot service to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat for enterprise users. That\u2019s a too-long name and based on the little help that it offers, it\u2019ll find very less adoption in the enterprise scenario. The URLs have also changed to reflect the name change, so users don\u2019t get confused.\n\nWe hope that Microsoft sticks to the Copilot name until the service is discontinued (less likely as AI is omnipresent now)."

Naturally, we\u2019ve put together a handy list of some of our favorites we think you might get a kick out of.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nIt sounded like Warner Bros. and DC were having a laugh when they started referring to The Penguin\u2019s central mobster as \u201cOz Cobb,\u201d as if that has ever been that character\u2019s name. It also seemed odd that the studios were bullish about airing a series spun off from Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman when all signs have suggested that those characters won\u2019t make it into James Gunn\u2019s new universe of DC films. Somehow, though, The Penguin proved to be a surprisingly compelling return to Gotham as it explored the inner workings of Oz Cobb\u2019s (Colin Farrell) mind and reframed him as a twisted underdog fighting to keep up with fellow crimelord Sofia Gigante (Cristin Milioti).\n\nBy largely removing Batman from the equation, The Penguin was able to present its murderous gangsters as people (rather than costumed weirdos) who were really just trying to get by in a city that was all too ready to throw them away. And by the show\u2019s season 1 finale, The Penguin establishes itself as one of the better Batman stories that DC has produced in recent years \u2014 one that definitely deserves a second chapter.\n\nInvincible Fight Girl\n\nThere\u2019s nothing fun about getting punched in the face, but in Invincible Fight Girl\u2019s world, where everyone is a superpowered professional wrestler, it\u2019s the kind of thing that lights a fire within young brawler Andy \u200b\u200b(Sydney Mikayla). Even though her parents would rather she live a quiet life of accounting, Andy knows in her heart that she\u2019s a born wrestler who just needs a trainer who can bring out her inner greatness. And while Quesa Poblana (Rolonda Watts) is none too pleased about the idea of taking on a newbie mentee, she, too, can see that Andy has what it takes to become a legend.\n\nThe way Invincible Fight Girl borrows elements of classic shonen shows like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Pok\u00e9mon, and Hajime no Ippo feels like it could almost be too much at first. But the show blends its influences together brilliantly to tell its own unique story and create fight sequences that are cool as hell.\n\nLike Water for Chocolate\n\nBy easing up on the magical realism of Laura Esquivel\u2019s novel, Francisco Javier Royo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s new adaptation of Like Water for Chocolate makes it somewhat easier to appreciate the depth of its central love story set during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nThere is still something otherworldly about Tita de la Garza\u2019s (Azul Guaita) ability to channel her emotions into the food she cooks. Tita\u2019s sisters Rosaura (Ana Valeria Becerril) and Gertrudis (Andrea Chaparro) and her forbidden love Pedro Muzquiz (Andr\u00e9s Baida) can attest to the way her culinary creations leave people overwhelmed as they experience whatever feelings were roiling inside of her. But that detail is really just one small ingredient the new Like Water for Chocolate adaptation uses to enhance its rumination on the ways that class conflict and war have shaped the arc of Tita\u2019s life.\n\nDune: Prophecy\n\nIn Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune films, the Bene Gesserit order is so shrouded in mystery that it\u2019s hard to tell whether their strange abilities are rooted in the supernatural. But Dune: Prophecy dives into the Sisterhood\u2019s ancient history to unpack the many ways in which secret science rather than sorcery is what turned them into one of the most influential forces in the entire spice-addicted Imperium.\n\nThe show\u2019s exploration of how Valya (Emily Watson / Jessica Barden) and Tula (Olivia Williams / Emma Canning) Harkonnen reestablished their family as one of the galaxy\u2019s Great Houses adds new depth to the Dune franchise\u2019s larger story about the rise of a long-awaited messiah. Through the Harkonnen sisters, Prophecy demystifies some of the legend of the Kwisatz Haderach and reveals how ruthless the fight to control spice has always been. And it makes for an excellent way to get your sandworm fix while we wait for the next Dune feature to premiere.\n\nCreature Commandos\n\nThough James Gunn and Peter Safran are mostly starting over fresh for Warner Bros.\u2019 new cinematic universe of DC films, a tiny portion of the old DCEU is being reborn through the animated Creature Commandos series. After the events of The Suicide Squad and season 1 of Peacemaker, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) can no longer force teams of superhumans to covertly do her bidding under threat of death. But there are no laws forbidding her from recruiting a squad of supernatural monsters like Nina Mazursky (Zo\u00eb Chao), Eric Frankenstein (David Harbour), the Bride (Indira Varma), and Circe (Anya Chalotra) to go on suicidal missions that Waller would rather the public not know about.\n\nPart of what\u2019s intriguing about the show is the way characters like Waller, Weasel (Sean Gunn, who will also voice G.I. Robot), and Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) will establish a narrative continuity between DC\u2019s old films and many of its upcoming live-action projects. And with Gunn going all in on actors reprising their roles across different mediums, Creature Commandos seems like it might be the start of an era worth tuning in to.\n\nCivil War\n\nThough there\u2019s a certain degree of absurdity to the political details of Alex Garland\u2019s Civil War, its depiction of the United States descending into chaos after a tyrannical president refuses to leave office feels like a haunting vision of a future that isn\u2019t as improbable as we\u2019d hope. As a respected war reporter, Lee Smith (Kirsten Dunst) feels she has a duty to document the reality of what has become of her country in the time since the president (Nick Offerman) came into power.\n\nLee\u2019s years of reporting from the front lines of conflicts all over the world have taught her how important it is for people to be able to see how war ruins lives and pushes societies to (if not over) the brink of collapse. But as Lee sets out to secure the interview of a lifetime, she quickly realizes that no amount of reporting has prepared her to see war unfolding in the place she calls home. And with rookie journalist Jessie (Cailee Spaeny) by her side, the only thing that keeps Lee grounded is her hope that she can pass her skills on to the next generation.\n\nI Saw the TV Glow\n\nOne doesn\u2019t need to be queer or a Buffy fan to appreciate the neon-drenched strangeness of Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s I Saw the TV Glow. But the movie\u2019s story about two lonely teens bonding over a cheesy sci-fi show might hit differently for anyone who grew up in the \u201990s feeling like they would be more at home in Sunnydale than living their own humdrum lives.\n\nEven though young outcasts Owen (Justice Smith / Ian Foreman) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) don\u2019t initially have the words to articulate what it is that makes them different from other kids, there\u2019s something about The Pink Opaque that speaks to them both. The teens don\u2019t understand why they feel such a powerful, instinctive kinship to the TV show\u2019s monster-fighting heroines or how the program is influencing the way they see the world. But by the time they\u2019ve both grown up a bit, they can\u2019t shake the feeling that The Pink Opaque has changed something within them \u2014 something that might mean everything they\u2019ve been raised to believe is a lie.\n\nTrap\n\nIn any other M. Night Shyamalan movie, you would expect the big twist to come closer toward the end in order to leave audiences reeling, but Trap does something much more intriguing with its story about the cops tracking down a famous serial killer. Family man Cooper (Josh Hartnett) prides himself on the way he\u2019s able to keep his double life secret from his loved ones. His daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) and wife Rachel (Alison Pill) have no idea that he has other houses than the one they live in. And they would never guess that he spends much of his free time watching a livestream feed of a man he has tied up in a secret basement.\n\nCooper seems like exactly the sort of Good Guy\u2122 who would surprise his daughter with a trip to see her favorite singer Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) in concert because that\u2019s what he wants people to see. But what Cooper doesn\u2019t realize is that the concert is an elaborate trap and the centerpiece of one of Shyamalan\u2019s most fun thrillers yet.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nThere are only a few choice scenes in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice that achieve the kind of horror-comedy brilliance that made Tim Burton\u2019s original 1988 film such a batshit revelation. Those fleeting moments and a pitch-perfect performance from Michael Keaton just manage to make the sequel feel like a film that has something to offer fans beyond nostalgia for the Deetz family and their favorite incorporeal dirtbag.\n\nYears after Lydia Deetz\u2019s (Winona Ryder) first encounter with Beetlejuice (Keaton), she has become the host of a paranormal television show and mother to a sullen teenager of her own. Though Astrid (Jenna Ortega) is certain her mom can\u2019t actually see ghosts, Lydia knows that her eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on her when she spots Beetlejuice during one of her tapings. And when Lydia\u2019s overbearing boyfriend Rory (Justin Theroux) tries to prove that she\u2019s just imagining things, his thrice-over utterance of Beetlejuice\u2019s name sends them all straight to the afterlife for an unhinged reunion of sorts that none of them are prepared for.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\n\nIn the grand scheme of Warner Bros.\u2019 decision to greenlight a gritty, Batman-free Joker film that had nothing to do with its core cinematic universe of DC films, there\u2019s a certain kind of poetry to the way things played out with Todd Phillips\u2019 Folie \u00e0 Deux. At first blush, the idea of a jukebox musical about the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) falling in love with Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) while they\u2019re both doing time in Arkham Asylum sounded inspired. And you could see how, with the right story, a song-filled take on the iconic criminals might make for an enjoyable change of pace from WB\u2019s previous forays into Gotham."

            "article_content": "On Friday, Conservation International published the discovery of 27 new animal species in Peru's Amazon rainforest, including an 'amphibious mouse' and a spiny mouse. The expedition, conducted over 38 days in 2022 in the Alto Mayo region, documented more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants.\n\nThe team of 13 scientists, local technicians, and members of Indigenous groups, including the Awaj\u00fan people, ventured into the Alto Mayo landscape, which spans the Andes mountains to the Amazon River and includes the Alto Mayo Protected Forest. They uncovered four new mammals, eight fish species, three amphibians, and ten butterfly species that were previously unknown to science.\n\nAmong the extraordinary new species discovered is an amphibious mouse with partially webbed feet that feeds on aquatic insects. Trond Larsen, Senior Director at Conservation International, described finding the mouse as \"shocking and exciting,\" noting that it was found only in a unique piece of forest threatened by agriculture, suggesting it may not live anywhere else. \"Amphibious rodents are almost mythical to mammal experts,\" Larsen said, according to Clar\u00edn.\n\nAnother remarkable find was a spiny mouse with stiff guard hairs that function similarly to hedgehog spines. The expedition also uncovered a blob-headed fish, a type of armored catfish with an enlarged, blob-like head. Scientists are still uncertain about the function of this peculiar feature. \"The blob-headed fish has an incredibly bizarre head that looks almost like a giant swollen nose,\" Larsen told CNN.\n\nThe team discovered a dwarf squirrel measuring just 14 centimeters long, around half the length of an average gray squirrel. Larsen described the squirrel as \"adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast.\" He added, \"It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.\"\n\nA new species of tree-climbing salamander was also found, abundant but only in a small patch of unique white sand. The researchers documented 955 different plant species and recorded more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants during the expedition. This included 536 bird species, with 26 classified as threatened, such as the speckle-chested piculet and the long-whiskered owlet.\n\nDespite significant human influence, the Alto Mayo region revealed unexpected high levels of biodiversity. \"We were very surprised to find such high biodiversity in a landscape with so much human influence,\" Larsen stated, according to The Straits Times. The Alto Mayo landscape is a densely populated area, home to 280,000 people, facing pressures from deforestation and agricultural expansion.\n\nThe expedition highlighted the urgent need for conservation efforts in the region. \"Unless steps are taken now to safeguard these sites and help restore parts of the landscape, there's a strong chance they won't persist in the long term,\" Larsen said, emphasizing the threats posed by habitat loss and human activity.\n\nThe involvement of the Awaj\u00fan people was integral to the success of the expedition. \"It was really fantastic to work so closely with the Awaj\u00fan people,\" Larsen expressed, as reported by GreekReporter.com. \"They have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with.\" The Indigenous communities provided valuable insights that helped researchers identify and understand the species they discovered.\n\nAmong the recorded species, at least 49 are considered at risk of extinction, including the yellow-tailed woolly monkey and the tree monkey. The findings underscore the importance of protecting areas like Alto Mayo to preserve the rich biodiversity that exists there. Stay updated with the latest news!

Naming these new species will require further research, as many are extremely rare and difficult to collect.\n\nThe article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system."

            "article_content": "(ID 328527023 \u00a9 Dmitry Buksha | Dreamstime.com)\n\nStudy reveals extraordinary self-healing potential in advanced heart failure patients\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 For decades, medical science has insisted that the human heart cannot repair itself in any meaningful way. This dogma, as fundamental to cardiology as a heartbeat itself, is now being challenged by game-changing research that reveals our hearts may possess an extraordinary power of regeneration\u2014provided they\u2019re given the right conditions to heal.\n\nThe study, published in Circulation, offers potential new directions for treating heart failure, a condition that affects nearly 7 million U.S. adults and accounts for 14% of deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTraditionally, the medical community has viewed the human heart as having minimal regenerative capabilities. Unlike skeletal muscles that can heal after injury, cardiac muscle tissue has been thought to have very limited repair capacity.\n\n\u201cWhen a heart muscle is injured, it doesn\u2019t grow back. We have nothing to reverse heart muscle loss,\u201d says Dr. Hesham Sadek, director of the Sarver Heart Center at the University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson, in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s long believed that human heart muscle cells weren\u2019t capable of regeneration, but a new study shows the \u201cstrongest evidence\u201d yet, researchers say. (\u00a9 appledesign \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nHowever, this new research, conducted by an international team of scientists, demonstrates that hearts supported by mechanical assist devices can achieve cellular renewal rates significantly higher than previously observed. The study examined tissue samples from 52 patients with advanced heart failure, including 28 who received left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) \u2013 mechanical pumps surgically implanted to help weakened hearts pump blood more effectively.\n\nThe research methodology centered on an innovative approach to tracking cell renewal. Using a technique that measures carbon-14 levels in cellular DNA \u2013 taking advantage of elevated atmospheric levels from Cold War nuclear testing \u2013 researchers could effectively date when cardiac cells were created. This method provided unprecedented insight into the heart\u2019s regenerative processes.\n\nThe findings revealed a stark contrast between different patient groups. In healthy hearts, cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) naturally renew at approximately 0.5% per year. However, in failing hearts, this renewal rate drops dramatically \u2013 to 0.03% in cases of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (heart failure not caused by blocked arteries) and 0.01% in ischemic cardiomyopathy (heart failure from blocked arteries).\n\nCardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocyte, under a microscope. (Credit: Trevor Atkeson and Madhavi Pandya, Garvan Institute)\n\nThe most significant finding emerged from patients who responded positively to LVAD support. These \u201cresponders,\u201d who showed improved cardiac function, demonstrated cardiomyocyte renewal rates more than six times higher than those seen in healthy hearts. This observation provides what Dr. Sadek calls \u201cthe strongest evidence we have, so far, that human heart muscle cells can actually regenerate.\u201d\n\nThe study builds upon previous research, including Dr. Sadek\u2019s 2011 publication in Science showing that heart muscle cells actively divide during fetal development but cease shortly after birth to focus solely on pumping blood. His 2014 research provided initial evidence of cell division in artificial heart patients, laying the groundwork for the current study.\n\nThe mechanism behind this increased regeneration may be linked to the unique way LVADs support heart function. These devices effectively provide cardiac muscle with periods of reduced workload by assisting with blood pumping, potentially creating conditions that enable regeneration. This observation aligns with established knowledge about how other tissues in the body heal and regenerate when given adequate rest.\n\nScientists now hope to figure out why some patients are capable of having the advanced regenerative response and others aren\u2019t. (\u00a9 LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nThe research team found that in failing hearts, most cellular DNA synthesis is directed toward making existing cells larger or more complex through processes called polyploidization and multinucleation, rather than creating new cells. However, in LVAD patients who showed improvement, a significant portion of DNA synthesis was dedicated to generating entirely new cardiac muscle cells \u2013 a more beneficial form of cardiac adaptation.\n\nApproximately 25% of LVAD patients demonstrate this enhanced regenerative response, raising important questions about why some patients respond while others do not. Understanding these differences could be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches. \u201cThe exciting part now is to determine how we can make everyone a responder,\u201d says Sadek.\n\nThe implications of this research are particularly promising because LVADs are already an established treatment option. As Dr. Sadek points out, \u201cThe beauty of this is that a mechanical heart is not a therapy we hope to deliver to our patients in the future \u2013 these devices are tried and true, and we\u2019ve been using them for years.\u201d"

This could reignite acquisition activity by strategic buyers, which would allow funds to distribute proceeds from those deals to their own investors, or limited partners, and raise new funds to invest in the next generation of startups, said Brian Garrett, managing director at Crosscut Ventures.\n\nIn recent years, startups weren't the only ones facing a cash crunch. Established funds raised the lion's share of funding dollars, while many newish and boutique funds struggled to raise. A torrent of dealmaking, combined with Trump's return to the White House and an end to the political uncertainty, could mobilize investors in these funds who had been sitting on the sidelines to whip out their checkbooks, said Ivan Nikkhoo, a managing partner at Navigate Ventures.\n\n\"Uncertainty breeds defense, optimism breeds offense,\" said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures and early Anthropic investor. \"We're going into a cycle where acquirers are feeling they need to play offense and startups feel like it's time to invest in leadership. And the IPO market is open for best-in-class assets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom IPOs to robotaxis, these are the tech trends to watch in 2025, according to venture capitalists."

            "article_content": "On Friday, Conservation International published the discovery of 27 new animal species in Peru's Amazon rainforest, including an 'amphibious mouse' and a spiny mouse. The expedition, conducted over 38 days in 2022 in the Alto Mayo region, documented more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants.\n\nThe team of 13 scientists, local technicians, and members of Indigenous groups, including the Awaj\u00fan people, ventured into the Alto Mayo landscape, which spans the Andes mountains to the Amazon River and includes the Alto Mayo Protected Forest. They uncovered four new mammals, eight fish species, three amphibians, and ten butterfly species that were previously unknown to science.\n\nAmong the extraordinary new species discovered is an amphibious mouse with partially webbed feet that feeds on aquatic insects. Trond Larsen, Senior Director at Conservation International, described finding the mouse as \"shocking and exciting,\" noting that it was found only in a unique piece of forest threatened by agriculture, suggesting it may not live anywhere else. \"Amphibious rodents are almost mythical to mammal experts,\" Larsen said, according to Clar\u00edn.\n\nAnother remarkable find was a spiny mouse with stiff guard hairs that function similarly to hedgehog spines. The expedition also uncovered a blob-headed fish, a type of armored catfish with an enlarged, blob-like head. Scientists are still uncertain about the function of this peculiar feature. \"The blob-headed fish has an incredibly bizarre head that looks almost like a giant swollen nose,\" Larsen told CNN.\n\nThe team discovered a dwarf squirrel measuring just 14 centimeters long, around half the length of an average gray squirrel. Larsen described the squirrel as \"adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast.\" He added, \"It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.\"\n\nA new species of tree-climbing salamander was also found, abundant but only in a small patch of unique white sand. The researchers documented 955 different plant species and recorded more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants during the expedition. This included 536 bird species, with 26 classified as threatened, such as the speckle-chested piculet and the long-whiskered owlet.\n\nDespite significant human influence, the Alto Mayo region revealed unexpected high levels of biodiversity. \"We were very surprised to find such high biodiversity in a landscape with so much human influence,\" Larsen stated, according to The Straits Times. The Alto Mayo landscape is a densely populated area, home to 280,000 people, facing pressures from deforestation and agricultural expansion.\n\nThe expedition highlighted the urgent need for conservation efforts in the region. \"Unless steps are taken now to safeguard these sites and help restore parts of the landscape, there's a strong chance they won't persist in the long term,\" Larsen said, emphasizing the threats posed by habitat loss and human activity.\n\nThe involvement of the Awaj\u00fan people was integral to the success of the expedition. \"It was really fantastic to work so closely with the Awaj\u00fan people,\" Larsen expressed, as reported by GreekReporter.com. \"They have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with.\" The Indigenous communities provided valuable insights that helped researchers identify and understand the species they discovered.\n\nAmong the recorded species, at least 49 are considered at risk of extinction, including the yellow-tailed woolly monkey and the tree monkey. The findings underscore the importance of protecting areas like Alto Mayo to preserve the rich biodiversity that exists there. Stay updated with the latest news!

Naming these new species will require further research, as many are extremely rare and difficult to collect.\n\nThe article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system."

            "article_content": "Camels laden with spices, gold and precious stones accompanied the Queen of Sheba on her biblical journey to Jerusalem in the 10th century B.C. A thousand years later, Flavius Josephus, the Jewish Roman historian, wrote that the haul had included the balm of Gilead, a fragrant, highly prized resin also known as Judean balsam, which served as the basis for perfumes, incense and medicinal remedies.\n\nThe balsam was said to have been harvested from a plant cultivated in oases around the Dead Sea basin; the plant vanished from the region by the ninth century A.D., setting off a longstanding debate about its scientific identity. \u201cIn ancient accounts, descriptions vary,\u201d said Sarah Sallon, director of natural medicine research at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. \u201cBefore the Common Era, the plant is said to be the size of a tree. But in the first century, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder described it as a shrub that resembled a grapevine.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Sallon obtained a mysterious seed from the archaeological archives of Hebrew University, hoping that it could germinate. The seed had been discovered in a cave during a 1980s excavation at Wadi el-Makkuk, a winter water channel in the northern Judean desert, and was languishing in storage. After determining that the seed was still viable, Dr. Sallon\u2019s research team planted, sprouted and carefully tended it. When the husk was carbon-dated to between A.D. 993 and A.D. 1202, a thought occurred to Dr. Sallon. \u201cI wondered if what germinated could be the source of the balm of Gilead,\u201d she said. On the hunch that it was, she named the specimen Sheba.\n\nSince then, the 1,000-year-old seedling has grown into a sturdy 12-foot-tall tree with no modern counterpart. Sheba\u2019s painstaking revival \u2014 kept secret from the public for 14 years \u2014 is detailed in a study that was published in September in the journal Communications Biology. \u201cWhy the time lag between the seed\u2019s germination and the publication of the research?\u201d Dr. Sallon said. \u201cThe reason is I wanted to make sure that Sheba wasn\u2019t the Judean balsam, which is something that I would only definitively know by smell.\u201d"

This could reignite acquisition activity by strategic buyers, which would allow funds to distribute proceeds from those deals to their own investors, or limited partners, and raise new funds to invest in the next generation of startups, said Brian Garrett, managing director at Crosscut Ventures.\n\nIn recent years, startups weren't the only ones facing a cash crunch. Established funds raised the lion's share of funding dollars, while many newish and boutique funds struggled to raise. A torrent of dealmaking, combined with Trump's return to the White House and an end to the political uncertainty, could mobilize investors in these funds who had been sitting on the sidelines to whip out their checkbooks, said Ivan Nikkhoo, a managing partner at Navigate Ventures.\n\n\"Uncertainty breeds defense, optimism breeds offense,\" said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures and early Anthropic investor. \"We're going into a cycle where acquirers are feeling they need to play offense and startups feel like it's time to invest in leadership. And the IPO market is open for best-in-class assets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom IPOs to robotaxis, these are the tech trends to watch in 2025, according to venture capitalists."

            "article_content": "Flavor Discovery\n\nThe company behind Oreo cookies has, by its own admission, been quietly creating new flavors using machine learning.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reports, Mondelez \u2014 the processed food behemoth that manufactures Oreos, Chips Ahoy, Clif Bars, and other popular snacks \u2014 has developed a new AI tool to dream up new flavors for its brands.\n\nUsed in more than 70 of the company's products, the company says the machine learning tool is different from generative AI tools like ChatGPT and more akin to the drug discovery algorithms used by pharmaceutical companies to find and test new medications rapidly. Thus far the tool, created with the help of the software consultant Fourkind, has created products like the \"Gluten Free Golden Oreo\" and updated Chips Ahoy's classic recipe, per the WSJ.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMondelez's research and development AI was, it seems, trained to optimize certain sensory factors. The tool was told to dial up scent characteristics like \"burnt,\" \"egg-flavored,\" and \"oily,\" as well as flavor factors like \"buttery,\u201d \"in-mouth saltiness,\" and \"vanilla intensity,\" among others.\n\nIt's unclear how nuanced the AI's perception of these flavors really is, since machines lack taste buds or noses, though the company does employ human taste testers to check it all out \u2014 and as \"biscuit modeling\" research and development manager Kevin Wallenstein indicated to the paper, Mondelez is very thorough with that aspect of its flavor creation process.\n\n\"The number of tastings we have is not fun,\" the biscuit baron told the WSJ. \"I used to work in Sour Patch Kids, and if you did a tasting every day for a week, it was a nightmare.\"\n\nHistory Matters\n\nThough the company didn't indicate how long it had been using the flavor discovery tool, it told the WSJ that the machine learning algorithm had been in development since 2019, a timeline that jibes with a 2023 interview in which Mondelez R&D exec Joe Manton teased the tool's existence to the magazine Just Food.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Manton suggested when speaking to the industry magazine, Mondelez's R&D team used historical recipe and ingredient data when creating the AI. In that same interview, he added that new flavors \"go through a series of internal and external consumer testing\" as well.\n\nIn the more recent WSJ article about the tool, Wallenstein admitted that in its earlier days, the AI would offer unhinged suggestions.\n\n\"Because [baking soda is] a very low-cost ingredient,\" he said, \"it would try to just make cookies that were very high in baking soda, which doesn\u2019t taste good at all.\"\n\nBy bringing in human \"brand stewards\" to oversee the process, Mondelez seems to have fine-tuned its machine-learning tool. Much like pharmaceutical drug discovery, it's an undeniably fascinating \u2014 if not admittedly bizarre \u2014 use of AI.\n\nMore on AI and food: Someone Made a Deranged Version of Coke's AI Holiday Ad and It's Way Better"

Israel was involved in four conflicts in the region, including with Hamas in Gaza and Iran. Peace remained elusive in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine that began over two years back read more\n\nA displaced Palestinian woman, Makram Hamdouna, carries a water container outside her shelter, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip December 19, 2024. Reuters\n\n2024 was a year of war. The wider conflict in West Asia and Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine made headlines throughout the year. Data by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) shows that an estimated 233,000 people were killed in conflicts this year.\n\nIsrael\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed a year in October. The Jewish state reached a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah in Lebanon to end 13 months of fighting. Israeli strikes are pounding against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTensions mounted between Iran and Israel, with both sides launching tit-for-tat attacks. The shadow war between the two countries has burst into the open since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel last October.\n\nAfter 13 years of civil war, Syria saw the fall of its dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Since his ouster, Israel has launched a bombing campaign on the West Asian country.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine entered its 1,000th day on November 24 this year. Even after over two years, there is no end in sight to the conflict.\n\nIn our yearly wrap, here is a look at the conflicts around the world.\n\n1. Israel was engaged in four wars in West Asia this year. On October 7, 2024, Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed one year. It was on this day last year that the Palestinian militant group\u2019s surprise attack on the Jewish nation changed West Asia and the world. We explain how Hamas\u2019 attack was a turning point in the region.\n\nThousands have died in Israel and Gaza since the war began last year. Many hostages taken by Hamas fighters last October remain captive in Gaza. Israel\u2019s relentless strikes on the narrow enclave have taken a mental toll on innocent civilians, especially children. We take a look at how the conflict has affected children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael achieved its biggest victory in the war by killing its enemy no 1, Yahya Sinwar. Israel had accused Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 attack. Here\u2019s what we know about the man dubbed \u201cbutcher of Khan Younis\u201d.\n\n2. West Asia inched closer to a wider war in the region as Israel and Iran carried out tit-for-tat missile strikes. In October, Israel launched three waves of overnight strikes on Iran in retaliation to Tehran launching at least 180 missiles into Israel earlier that month.\n\nIran had said its attack against Israel was in response to the assassination of the Lebanese group Hezbollah\u2019s leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut, and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there is a lull in tensions now, we explore who has the bigger and better military.\n\n3. Israel intensified attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon, with the group blaming the West Asian country for exploding pager and walkie-talkie attacks that killed or wounded thousands of its members.\n\nSmoke rises following an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in Beirut, Lebanon, November 26, 2024. File Photo/AP\n\nIn November, the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement, ending monthslong conflict that has taken the lives of over 3,700 people. The deal brokered by the United States calls for a 60-day halt in fighting. However, within a week of the fragile truce, there were mutual accusations of violations. Will the ceasefire hold? We explain in this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, a part of Iran\u2019s so-called Axis of Resistance, have been targeting commercial and military ships linked to Israel and its allies in the Red Sea since Israel launched its war against Hamas last October.\n\nThis year, Israel escalated attacks against the rebel group, with the Houthis claiming to target the Jewish country with drones and ballistic missiles. Find out about this rebel group in Yemen in this report.\n\n5. After 13 years of civil war, Syrian rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in just a matter of a few days. With Assad fleeing to Russia, the horrors of his regime are coming to light. Since his ouster, families have been desperately searching for their loved ones who went missing after being detained by the secret police. His regime is believed to have killed and buried more than 100,000 people in mass graves. The horrors have just begun to unravel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile insurgents have taken control of Damascus, Israel has carried out a volley of airstrikes in the country. Targets have included air defence systems, fighter jets, missile depots, weapons production sites and so on.\n\nIt is also planning to expand its settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, citing threats from Syria. We take a look at why Israel is eyeing the strategic plateau and why it is targeting the West Asian country.\n\n6. It has been over two years since Russia invaded Ukraine. Death and devastation followed after Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed his nation, announcing a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine on February 24, 2022. World powers, including incoming US President Donald Trump, have called for a ceasefire. However, peace has so far remained elusive.\n\nTensions could further escalate after Ukraine claimed responsibility for killing a top Russian general in a bomb blast in Moscow. Here\u2019s who he was.\n\nThis is all we have for you in our yearly roundup. If you like the way we explain hot topics from around the globe, you can bookmark this page."

            "article_content": "As 2024 ends, the world faces significant challenges. Ongoing wars, shifting alliances, and Donald Trump's return as U.S. President mark this period. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, Middle East turmoil, and new power dynamics raise questions about the future. Is World War III inevitable, or can diplomacy prevent it?\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war continues with no end in sight. Now in its third year, the conflict shows no signs of slowing down. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia's goals in Ukraine are far from complete. This suggests no rush to end the war.\n\nThe human cost is high, with both sides fighting for territory. The United Nations reports 39,081 civilian casualties from February 2022 to October 2024. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismisses peace talks from Putin as fantasies.\n\nWestern support for Ukraine remains strong, while Russia stands firm. This suggests the conflict will continue into 2025 without a clear resolution. Meanwhile, the Middle East is also in turmoil. Israel has military victories against Hamas but faces tension with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe death of Hezbollah's leader has worsened the situation. Reports say 44,554 people died from violence involving Israeli forces last year. Despite Israel's dominance, a fragile peace might emerge. Iran's influence is weakening as its alliances crumble.\n\nThe collapse of Syria's regime has shifted power in the Middle East. Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis face setbacks. Iran's role as a regional power is diminishing. In Yemen, the Houthis have increased attacks on Israel with drones and missiles.\n\nThese cross-border assaults threaten regional stability and global shipping routes. Israel's retaliatory airstrikes have escalated tensions further. In the U.S., Donald Trump's election as president marks a major political shift.\n\nHis victory has affected global markets, causing stock indices to fall. Trump's return could change U.S. foreign policy significantly. His unpredictable nature raises concerns about relations with China and Russia.\n\nWhile his economic policies may appeal to his supporters, it's unclear if tensions with adversaries will rise or if a more isolated approach will be taken. Regardless, his victory is pivotal in global politics.\n\nWith conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and instability elsewhere, many wonder if World War III is near. While the situation is tense, a global war seems unlikely for now.\n\nGlobal powers are still engaged in diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation. However, regional conflicts could spill over into a global war if not contained.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia continue their proxy battle in Ukraine while the U.S. remains involved in the Middle East with military assets there.\n\nChina's growing presence in Asia adds complexity to the geopolitical landscape. The world stands on edge, and future choices by leaders will determine whether chaos ensues or peace prevails.\n\nAs 2024 ends and we look to a new year, one thing is clear: the political landscape is changing, and power balances are shifting.\n\nVideo Published On: Saturday, Dec 21, 2024, 08:24 [IST]"

Well, have a look at the leading Indian companies by market capitalization that have been the driving force behind the nation's progress.\n\nMarket capitalization, calculated as the total market value of a company's outstanding shares, serves as a prime indicator of a company's size and investor confidence. Companies are typically categorized based on their market cap; companies with market caps over Rs. 1000 crore come under large cap, while those between Rs. 200 crore and Rs. 1000 crore fall in the midcap category; lastly, those with market caps under Rs. 200 crore are considered small cap.\n\nHere is the list of the top 10 Indian companies with the largest market capitalization as of December 22nd, 2024, as per data on BSE:\n\nReliance Industries Limited (RIL)\n\nReliance Industries, led by Mukesh Ambani, leads the pack with a market capitalization standing of approximately Rs. 16.32 lakh crore.

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nUnix workstations were powerful computers for science and 3D animation, popular in the '80s and '90s.\n\nWorkstations had advanced features like high-res monitors, faster processors, and RISC processors.\n\nWorkstations merged with PCs over time, but you can still find high-performance workstations.\n\nIn the '80s and early '90s, powerful Unix workstations dominated technical tasks like science and 3D animation. Let's find out where they went and where you can still find them today.\n\nWhat Were Unix Workstations?\n\nUnix workstations were powerful computers that ran some variant of Unix. As the name implies, they were meant for serious work such as software development, CAD, or graphics. They were widely used by scientists, engineers, researchers, and computer animators in academia and industry.\n\nSun Microsystems, HP, and Silicon Graphics were some of the biggest manufacturers of workstations in that era. Unix was popular on these systems because it was easier than writing a system from scratch and the source code was available, even if it was at a steep price. Developers were also familiar with Unix from their college days.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis clip from 1987 shows how workstations were heavily used for 3D graphics back then:\n\nWow, a whole four megabytes!\n\nWorkstations had larger monitors with higher resolutions than PCs at the time, which was important for the graphically intensive work they were used for. They also had more memory and faster processors. Workstations were early adopters of RISC processors for higher performance, like the SPARC or MIPS architectures.\n\nWorkstation History\n\nBefore workstations arrived on the scene, it was minicomputers that served most computer users. Minicomputers (not to be confused with mini PCs), were computers that were smaller than mainframes but still typically shared with mutiple users, popular for things like smaller scientific computations, software development, and factory automation. While minicomputers were occasionally dedicated to a single user, this was rare, as minis were generally considered too expensive to do so.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA precursor to the workstation as a standalone computer intended for one user at a time was the Xerox Alto, a prototype from the 1970s that pioneered the graphical user interface. While it was never offered for sale, it also inspired the development of the Apple Macintosh.\n\nThe Three Rivers PERQ was the first modern workstation, a single-user computer with the power of a minicomputer in a personal form factor intended for scientific and engineering work.\n\nThe first Unix workstation was the SUN board created by Andy Bechtolsheim at Stanford. Sun Microsystems later commercialized it. Other workstations came on the market, such as the famous Silicon Graphics line of systems. These systems were used for technical tasks such as software development, CAD/CAM, and 3D animation, including movies like \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Toy Story.\"\n\nWorkstations and PCs Merge\n\nAs early as 1989, observers in the computer industry were noticing that with the increasing power of personal computers, the workstation and PC markets were starting to blur, according to Byte magazine.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Intel 386 chip made multitasking PC operating systems viable in the PC market, but the software base, still rooted in MS-DOS, was trying to catch up to the hardware. Unix was multitasking and could be ported easily to new hardware, so observers in the computer world thought that Unix could unseat MS-DOS as an OS of choice for a new range of \"personal workstations.\"\n\nSearch results for \"workstation\" showing Precision workstations on the Dell website.\n\nWhile workstations were aimed at engineers and scientists, they still needed to run business applications alongside technical software. An engineer might need to write a report in a word processor or budget a project in a spreadsheet, and these applications were hard to find on Unix workstations. Or a user might need to exchange documents with someone on a PC.\n\nIf a workstation user had enough desk space or a large enough budget, you might have found a PC sitting next to the workstation for office tasks. The cheaper alternative for this problem was a software compatibility layer, similar to WINE on modern systems. VP/IX and MERGE were popular programs for running DOS on PC Unix systems. Other solutions involved PC boards that plugged into a slot on the system.\n\nCan You Still Buy a Workstation Today?\n\nAs PCs got even more powerful during the '90s, the workstation and PC markets have merged even further, where it's hard to tell the two apart. Windows NT came on the scene and allowed technical users to run technical and business apps together, and Linux on PCs took over from commercial Unix workstations for many scientific users at the same time. Gamers adopted large displays and 3D accelerators that had been the domain of workstations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStill, it's possible to buy a workstation if you know where to look. Today, they run the same processors and use the same cards and peripherals that ordinary PCs do, but are often engineered for high performance and reliability. Popular options include the Dell Precision, Hp Z series, and Apple Mac Pro. macOS and Linux aren't wholly descended from the original Unix, but are instead influenced enough to be \"Unix-like.\"\n\nManufacturers and OS makers are keeping the flame of '80s and '90s Unix workstations alive."

A thousand years later, Flavius Josephus, the Jewish Roman historian, wrote that the haul had included the balm of Gilead, a fragrant, highly prized resin also known as Judean balsam, which served as the basis for perfumes, incense and medicinal remedies.\n\nThe balsam was said to have been harvested from a plant cultivated in oases around the Dead Sea basin; the plant vanished from the region by the ninth century A.D., setting off a longstanding debate about its scientific identity. \u201cIn ancient accounts, descriptions vary,\u201d said Sarah Sallon, director of natural medicine research at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. \u201cBefore the Common Era, the plant is said to be the size of a tree. But in the first century, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder described it as a shrub that resembled a grapevine.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Sallon obtained a mysterious seed from the archaeological archives of Hebrew University, hoping that it could germinate. The seed had been discovered in a cave during a 1980s excavation at Wadi el-Makkuk, a winter water channel in the northern Judean desert, and was languishing in storage. After determining that the seed was still viable, Dr. Sallon\u2019s research team planted, sprouted and carefully tended it. When the husk was carbon-dated to between A.D. 993 and A.D. 1202, a thought occurred to Dr. Sallon. \u201cI wondered if what germinated could be the source of the balm of Gilead,\u201d she said. On the hunch that it was, she named the specimen Sheba.\n\nSince then, the 1,000-year-old seedling has grown into a sturdy 12-foot-tall tree with no modern counterpart. Sheba\u2019s painstaking revival \u2014 kept secret from the public for 14 years \u2014 is detailed in a study that was published in September in the journal Communications Biology. \u201cWhy the time lag between the seed\u2019s germination and the publication of the research?\u201d Dr. Sallon said. \u201cThe reason is I wanted to make sure that Sheba wasn\u2019t the Judean balsam, which is something that I would only definitively know by smell.\u201d"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nExperimental physicist Daniela Angulo poses with an apparatus in the physics lab at the University of Toronto.\n\nScientists have long known that light can sometimes appear to exit a material before entering it\u2014an effect dismissed as an illusion caused by how waves are distorted by matter.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Toronto, through innovative quantum experiments, say they have demonstrated that \"negative time\" isn't just a theoretical idea\u2014it exists in a tangible, physical sense, deserving closer scrutiny.\n\nThe findings, posted on the preprint server arXiv but not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, have attracted both global attention and skepticism.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these perplexing results highlight a peculiar quirk of quantum mechanics rather than a radical shift in our understanding of time.\n\n\"This is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor specializing in experimental quantum physics.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp channel! Stay up-to-date on the latest science news from Science X.\n\nWhile the term \"negative time\" might sound like a concept lifted from science fiction, Steinberg defends its use, hoping it will spark deeper discussions about the mysteries of quantum physics.\n\nLaser experiments\n\nYears ago, the team began exploring interactions between light and matter.\n\nWhen light particles, or photons, pass through atoms, some are absorbed by the atoms and later re-emitted. This interaction changes the atoms, temporarily putting them in a higher-energy or \"excited\" state before they return to normal.\n\nIn research led by Daniela Angulo, the team set out to measure how long these atoms stayed in their excited state. \"That time turned out to be negative,\" Steinberg explained\u2014meaning a duration less than zero.\n\nTo visualize this concept, imagine cars entering a tunnel: before the experiment, physicists recognized that while the average entry time for a thousand cars might be, for example, noon, the first cars could exit a little sooner, say 11:59 am. This result was previously dismissed as meaningless.\n\nWhat Angulo and colleagues demonstrated was akin to measuring carbon monoxide levels in the tunnel after the first few cars emerged and finding that the readings had a minus sign in front of them.\n\nRelativity intact\n\nThe experiments, conducted in a cluttered basement laboratory bristling with wires and aluminum-wrapped devices, took over two years to optimize. The lasers used had to be carefully calibrated to avoid distorting the results.\n\nStill, Steinberg and Angulo are quick to clarify: no one is claiming time travel is a possibility. \"We don't want to say anything traveled backward in time,\" Steinberg said. \"That's a misinterpretation.\"\n\nThe explanation lies in quantum mechanics, where particles like photons behave in fuzzy, probabilistic ways rather than following strict rules.\n\nInstead of adhering to a fixed timeline for absorption and re-emission, these interactions occur across a spectrum of possible durations\u2014some of which defy everyday intuition.\n\nCritically, the researchers say, this doesn't violate Einstein's theory of special relativity, which dictates that nothing can travel faster than light.

            "article_content": "The Great Mystification.\n\nTwo concepts call for socialist meditation, because they imply problems of permanent urgency: utopia and revolution. Rarely have these two problems been examined in their relationship of reciprocal affirmation and negation, i.e., in their dialectical relationship, except to reject them wholesale or accept only one term: whoever posits revolution seems to exclude or reject utopia; and conversely, whoever posits utopia seems to reject revolution. Such, at least, was the attitude of nineteenth-century socialist thinkers. In the twentieth century, the debate had found some scope for confrontation up until the First World War, without going beyond the ideological quarrels periodically renewed between Marxists and non-Marxists, or between anarchists and Marxists. Since then, there has been silence: the tumult of contemporary history has rendered inaudible any voice urging renewed discussion. And yet, if ever the idea of a socialist humanism required reflection, it is today, when under the name of socialism, or even humanism, regimes are developing that reproduce and amplify the defects of capitalism, while trampling underfoot the democratic conquests of bourgeois revolutions, long considered the condition for socialism. It took an incredible perversion of language and logic to succumb, often with total good faith, to the most vulgar propaganda, and to believe that today's world is really divided into two camps, the \u201csocialist\u201d camp and the \u201ccapitalist\u201d camp. All regimes, no matter how acute their conflicts of interest, propagate this alleged division as an article of faith. Western regimes eagerly acknowledge the socialist character displayed by their Eastern rivals, for they thereby gain a considerable propaganda benefit: they discredit socialism, by showing that so-called socialist regimes deceive the masses in their aspirations for a dignified and free life. In turn, these regimes spare no effort to make their people believe that the material and moral conditions in which they live are (or soon will be) superior to those of the masses under the yoke of capital. If religious consolation is much less the opium of Western peoples than it once was, the new narcotic offered to the peoples of Eastern Europe is called Marxism. Words neither live nor die like human beings; their meaning is transformed according to the intentions and interests of those who manipulate them. By a harmful and strange alteration of their meaning, words can mean the opposite of what they originally meant. Such is the case with the word socialism. Created at a time when industrial mechanization was ushering in the era of mass misery, it denoted the hope of a new society, the desire for a better way of life: utopia as tomorrow's reality. The nascent socialist and communist schools discussed and refined its content, and in February 1848, an anonymous pamphlet printed in London predicted, along with the fatal ruin of class society, the coming of the communist city defined in these terms: \u201cAn association where the free development of each is the condition of the free development of all.\u201d (The Communist Manifesto.) Nothing resembles this definition less than the contemporary world. Yet we manage to make people believe that part of our globe is now communist or moving towards communism. And, in a supreme perversion, regimes where people are relatively less free and where the police state has more rights over the individual than in capitalist countries are called socialist. In this way, Utopia is desecrated and the values of socialism are scorned.\n\nIt is said and believed that, since the Russian Revolution of October 1917, the world has entered a new era: the era of socialism; that since the Second World War, a third of the world has become socialist, and that the two wars made this revolutionary transformation possible. Those who say or think this generally choose a single criterion to justify this thesis: the abolition of private property, known as the socialization of the means of production. This thesis is opposed by another: there is no socialism in today's world. What we call socialism, by misuse of language, is in reality nothing more than a new form of exploitation and oppression of man by man: state property, which is just as murderous as private property; we should call it state capitalism.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that the legal regulation of property rights by state power is either the means or the end of a socialist order. If we disregard the legal forms that appear to regulate human relations, and stick to these relations themselves, what do we find? Simply that the human status of so-called socialist countries is fundamentally, essentially the same as that of capitalist countries.\n\nIf things have turned into a dialogue of the deaf, if this perversion of language has been able to take place so easily, it's because another word has suffered a similar fate: revolution. Revolutions have taken place; social structures have been violently overturned, but the character of these upheavals is obvious: in reality, they are nothing more than economic revolutions, which constitute an aggravation of the phenomena that the pioneers of socialism denounced as \u201cthe exploitation of man by man\u201d. If the debate between the \u201cfree world\u201d and the \u201csocialist world\u201d were merely a matter of words, it wouldn't be worth our attention. But behind this verbal quarrel lies a vital issue of our time. Can humanity survive without the disappearance of the social institutions that currently burden and regiment it? In other words, is human life still possible under the domination of the state and capital? This question, it seems to us, should be at the heart of any debate on socialist humanism.\n\nBack to Basics.\n\nMarxism is not the entire ideology of socialism. Nor is it all its thought. Both in its ethical aspects and in its theoretical claims, socialist thought can be traced back to the industrial revolution that began in England in the last third of the 18th century. From the outset, it had all the hallmarks of a new gospel, a message of earthly liberation and salvation, in a word, a new ethic. However, however visionary the first socialists or communists of the industrial age may have seemed, they had a fairly clear conception of the means that could lead to the realization of their dream goal. Thus, for William Godwin, social metamorphosis could only result from a revolution of reason, whereas for Gracchus Babeuf, reason could only be imposed by violence, and therefore folly: proclaimed at first as a legal action, the revolution, because of the closure of the Pantheon club, became the business of a \u201csecret directoire\u201d, charged with acting \u201cby and for the people\u201d. Babeuf's plan was to seize power \u201cin order to hand it over to the people\u201d. But steps had to be taken, as the people, called to the polls, were capable of bringing back tyranny. It was therefore necessary to make them capable of exercising sovereignty.\n\nIrresistibly, once on this slope of impatience and \u201cprovisional\u201d authority, Babouvism thinks of revolution as organized warfare, conducted according to the rules of the art: hierarchy, discipline, obedience, command, specialist strategy and so on. It's a revolution directed from above, by a general staff or a group of experts, in the expectation that it will be remade from below, or at least that those below will take over once the enemy has been defeated and power conquered. Such is the ambition of Babouvism, and it will reappear with Auguste Blanqui and his followers: honesty and good intentions are given as pledges to the still ignorant people, reduced to the state of inert matter or, more precisely, a mass of maneuver in the battle to defeat the enemy. Violence organized and directed from above is the essence of the Babouvist credo. Its humanism is in the intention, the goal, the utopia; it's not in the means, unless you consider the acts of vengeance perpetrated by the revolting masses as manifestations of a will to liberate: it's the purpose of violence that humanizes violence, since it aims to establish a society without violence.\n\nThe danger and weakness of this conception lies in the impossibility of foreseeing and judging, of choosing and evaluating methods and attitudes from a humanist perspective. From Babouvism to Bolshevik Marxism, the lineage is direct and sometimes openly acknowledged. Utopian socialism returns to the tradition of humanist rationalism that predates the French Revolution. For Saint-Simon, the spiritual heir of the Encyclopedists, political power, capable of reason and reform, plays only a secondary role. The \u201cNew Christianity\u201d is the ethics of power, which will no longer be political, but administrative (stewardship). This economic-social Christianity, the science of production, is, in short, industrialism for the benefit of mankind, the guarantee of bread, politics replaced by industrial organization, whose sole aim is to \u201censure the freest development of the faculties of all men\u201d. This is Saint-Simon's spiritual testament.\n\nUtopians claim to reform society in the name of reason and science. Robert Owen has a sense of reality, and his socialism is experimental: cooperation is the beginning and the end of the solution to social problems. Owen lacked the sumptuous delirium of Charles Fourier; he was unimaginative and his doctrine was reduced to a few elementary ideas, one of which was essential: man is what his environment makes him. Yet this pioneer of cooperative socialism was always in the breach, calling for spontaneous effort, distrust and even hostility towards the powerful, the rich and the rulers. If socialism means cooperation, then Owen was the first socialist. And if Marx's socialism is ultimately the cooperative system or mode of production, it's because he was Owen's disciple.\n\nKarl Marx.\n\nMarx did not abolish utopia; on the contrary, he renewed its meaning, broadening its sphere of application. For him, utopia becomes a single, two-stage process: revolution-creation. Before him, utopians had imagined and thought about creation independently of the men by whom the new city was to be built; at most, they had counted on an elite. Marx saw men first: \u201cWe know that to do useful work, the new forces of society need to be mastered by new men: such are the workers.\u201d (Address to a Chartist meeting, April 1856).\n\nInitially a disciple of Fourier and Owen, and soon deeply involved in the political struggle, Marx never broke the spiritual ties that bound him to the socialist utopia. In this respect, it's enough to read the clarification he was about to provide, two years before his death, to the Russian populists who asked him for his opinion on the chances and prospects of the peasant commune in the face of the threat of capitalism's penetration of Russia. At no point in this long and painful reflection does Marx tackle properly political problems, such as class constitution or party organization. Instead, he concentrates on the original characteristics of the archaic institution of the rural commune, and its importance as a \u201cregenerative element of Russian society\u201d and as an \u201celement of superiority over the countries enslaved by the capitalist regime\u201d. It's easy to recognize, in this apology for the \u201clocalized microcosm\u201d that for Marx is the Russian commune, the final tribute he pays to Robert Owen, pioneer of cooperative and communitarian socialism. Marx, like his utopian predecessor, puts all his trust in the creative spontaneity of those who produce society's wealth without really enjoying it. He attributes to the primitive commune the virtues of a social microcosm. In this idealization of a still little-known institution, we recognize the projection into the future of a desire-image. It's no coincidence, then, that Marx embraced the Owenian utopia. The cooperative commune he imagined responds to the problem we posed above, that of the opposition between the Jacobin (political) conception and the conception we now call, for greater clarity, communalist of the workers' movement. In the former, the initiative for awareness and action is attributed to' political avant-gardes placed at the head of easily-maneuverable crowds; in the latter, any political elite is deemed superfluous, as the reduced dimensions of the action group allow it to dispense with any stable, and therefore \u201cprofessional\u201d, representation. The delegation of power is not the abandonment of a right, but the handing over of a temporary and imperative mandate for well-defined representative tasks.\n\nIn a sense, Marx is the most utopian of utopians: unconcerned about future society, he is solely concerned with the destruction of present society. But he elevates revolution to the level of a total requirement.\n\nIt is the mechanism of this imaginary or imagined revolution that is utopian: it presupposes men capable of thinking the whole of social criticism, the whole of socialism, men aware of their \u201cgolden\u201d misery.\n\nFor Marx establishes the economic law of pauperization, which is harder to grasp than naked, unphrased misery. He implants the utopia of the future in the struggle of the present, and proposes a dialectic of workers' revolution: if the proletariat is capable of wanting and making its revolution, socialism will be given to it by surcro\u00eet, in other words: by becoming aware of their state of alienation (in the profound sense that Marx gave to this Hegelian term), workers are both capable of destroying capitalist society and building utopia: a society without state, without classes, without money. From then on, Marx's conception of revolution contained a strange paradox: it was at the height of misery that workers were supposed to become aware of the need for total revolution, for a regenerated society. Strange \u201cmaterialism\u201d that conceives of such a spiritual metamorphosis of the slave broken by a pitiless machine, reduced himself to the state of a cog in the great industrial mechanism operating with a single aim: profit.\n\nIt was from these masses of disinherited people, and not from an intellectual elite, that \u201ccommunist consciousness\u201d was supposed to \u201cemanate\u201d (The German Ideology). The psychological process is thus reversed: bourgeois intellectuals can only become communists by rising to the level of the revolutionary consciousness of slave-workers.\n\nSuch is the paradox of the workers' movement. Yet the theory remains coherent: Marx distinguishes between socialist consciousness and socialist science. This science (theory) is only possible and necessary as a function of the real movement of the working class, which is a two-faceted process: awareness and political action.\n\nBy giving itself political representatives, the proletariat proclaims its determination to overturn the existing established order, by recourse to the force of law or the laws of force, depending on the circumstances: \u201cThe proletariat constitutes itself as a class and therefore as a political party\u201d, declares the Communist Manifesto, clearly showing that this is a spontaneous act of creation and awareness by the proletarians, in no way an adhesion to constituted parties outside their ranks. The bourgeoisie is a constituted class whose unity is cemented by the profit motive. The proletariat constitutes itself as a class by forging its unity and cohesion through the struggle to defend its immediate interests and its awareness of a revolutionary goal. This is what Marx formulated in a single sentence that is the implicit postulate of all true socialist thought, enunciated as early as 1844 by Flora Tristan: \u201cThe emancipation of the workers will be the work of the workers themselves.\u201d\n\nUnions, parties and councils are all forms of working-class organization, which only exist as spontaneous, conscious creations of the working class. The proletariat constitutes itself by organizing its struggle, but the workers who make it up must not abandon themselves to elite bodies (or parties) that claim to guide them and prescribe their political and social objectives.\n\nThis is the idea frequently taken up by Marx and Engels in their criticism of party men who, coming from the bourgeois intelligentsia, set themselves up as political guides for the workers. Certainly, intellectuals have a role to play in the workers' movement, but they can only fulfill it effectively by bringing to the movement \u201celements of culture\u201d, and by no means a ready-made theory or philosophy, an esoteric doctrine of the march and ends of history, a dialectic of revolutionary action. This was Marx's deepest thought, even if his attitudes as a man and as a \u201cparty leader\u201d did not always conform strictly to the principle of workers' self-emancipation, even if, through the use of certain political means, he sometimes betrayed this principle.\n\nMarxism judged by Marx.\n\nThe real problem lies not in antinomies such as anarchism and Marxism, Marxism and reformism or Marxism and revisionism; it lies in the opposition of Jacobinism and self-emancipation. It lies in the following question: can social classes retain the autonomy of their action and consciousness by relying on representative organizations, chosen and appointed to express and defend their interests?\n\nThis question contains a dangerous equivocation: can a social class have a conscience, a will, an action? In other words, can it think, will and act in any way other than through \u201cdemocratically\u201d elected representatives, commonly appointed to represent, i.e. express, the will and thoughts of a collectivity? If so, isn't formal or tacit approval of the delegates' decisions and actions the only proof that the group's will and the behavior of its representatives are in accord?\n\nTo ask the question in this way is to answer it. But this answer does not provide the whole solution. Indeed, it implies the answer to another question, a corollary of the first: under what conditions of effectiveness can the delegation of a mandate result in a real \u201crepresentation of interests\u201d?\n\nPre-Marx socialist thought focused primarily on resolving this question. Its solution was the description and definition of the \u201cideal\u201d society. Marx accepted this legacy, and enriched it. His protest was not directed at the substance, but at certain aberrant aspects of so-called utopian socialism. The producers' commune, the cooperative enterprise, the unity of work and culture - in a word, the city liberated from the state and money - represents, in Marx's eyes, the resurrection, at the level of modern technology, of the archaic rural commune, the basis of primitive communism.\n\nAs for the Jacobin conception of the workers' movement, in both its reformist and revolutionary forms, the historical experience of the first half of our century has confirmed its definitive bankruptcy. When Lenin broke the ties he had maintained with Karl Kautsky's ideas until the First World War, he invoked the impotence of the workers' movement in the industrially advanced countries, where the proletariat had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by an aristocracy drawn from its own ranks. The material and moral conditions for a revolutionary movement, on the other hand, were given in an industrially backward, mainly peasant country like Tsarist Russia. It was here, as in countries under colonial yoke, that the process of socialist revolution could be triggered, if not completed: the misery of the masses was a sufficient guarantee against the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of ambitious, comfort-hungry workers' avant-gardes. To theoretically justify this recourse to classical conceptions of the role and vocation of the social elites, the concept of \u201cpermanent revolution\u201d was borrowed from Marx's terminological arsenal. This concept, reinforced by Lenin's idea of the \u201claw of uneven development\u201d, became the key to the new ideology with its Marxist flavour.\n\nIn truth, Lenin's and his party's theoretical and practical approach was simply the artificial grafting of a revolutionary-minded elite of bourgeois intellectuals onto a convulsing social mass. Its genuinely revolutionary aspirations could easily be exploited by an apparatus of professional revolutionaries for whom Jacobin methods of government held few secrets. The result was not long in coming: having established the presence of a state of \u201cdyarchy\u201d in Russian society liberated from tsarism, and having won the confidence of the soviets, which had spontaneously formed in opposition to the official government, the Bolshevik party succeeded in establishing itself as a monolithic state power. As in countries with an old capitalist tradition, a political \u201caristocracy\u201d aware of its interests and objectives had succeeded in replacing the \u201csocial microcosms\u201d which, according to Marx's theory and utopia, arise spontaneously from the soil of any society in a state of evolution and historical transformation.\n\nMarx may often have overestimated the political factor in the workers' movement, but he never thought for a moment that the working class should surrender to the dialectical wisdom of a party or an elite of political professionals. As we have seen, for Marx, the utopia of revolution is an ethic of revolutionary behavior. The economic and spiritual alienation of the workers is the fundamental cause of the revolutionary act, as well as the central motive for the creative action of the new social order. The proletariat is the direct subject of this transformation, but it is also its object, since it abolishes itself as a wage-earner.\n\nToday, \u201cMarxist empires\u201d are founded on the exploitation of proletarianized masses, forced to perform economic tasks dictated by state plans which, as in liberal capitalist regimes, maintain and reinforce the hierarchy of functions and incomes.\n\nEvery line of Marx, as of his precursors and masters, belies the so-called socialist regimes of our twentieth century.\n\nConclusion.\n\nUtopia and revolution are the two historical coordinates of the workers' movement, the two modes of intuition of socialist thought: utopia is the dimension of space; revolution is the dimension of time. In other words, to become a reality, the socialist movement must think of itself as utopia and revolution, one inseparable from the other. It also means that socialist man must assert himself simultaneously as utopian and revolutionary. Revolution and utopia appear as the normative foundations of the socialist ethic, inseparable from each other. To be a socialist, you have to want revolution and utopia; you have to want the abolition of existing types of society and desire the creation of the new city. Implicit in most socialist doctrines, this ethic has marked and continues to mark many thinkers who claim to be socialists, communists or anarchists. To varying degrees, it has enriched the thinking of Owen and Fourier, Marx and Engels, Proudhon and Bakunin, Sorel and Kropotkin, Oscar Wilde and Gustav Landauer.\n\nBut it must not be confused with the thought \u2014 explicit or implicit \u2014 of a single mind, however brilliant. Socialist ethics is the spirit of the entire workers' movement, of the socialist movement as a whole. To confuse it with the work or thought of a single individual is to betray the impersonal spirit of the ethic of the workers' movement.\n\nSocialist humanism is the ethic of revolution and utopia. Socialism is a historical necessity only insofar as it is thought of and willed as an ethical necessity. This is what Marx meant when he posed the dilemma: \u201cThe proletariat is revolutionary or it is nothing!\u201d And we add, to give socialist ethics its full meaning: socialism is utopian consciousness or it is nothing."
