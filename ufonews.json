            "article_content": "A former Air Force Special Operations airman told NewsNation that he worked for a secret unit that retrieved debris that he believes was from crashed unidentified flying objects.\n\n\u201cJust visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous,\u201d Jacob Barber, who said he had worked in both official and unofficial capacities for the U.S. government, told the network. \u201cIt was not human.\u201d\n\nBarber told NewsNation\u2019s Ross Coulthart that the object looked like a large white egg and was about the size of an SUV. The UFO \u2015 which the U.S. government now calls UAPs, or unidentified aerial phenomena \u2015 had no engine and no thermal signature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBarber said it was later confirmed to him that the object was from a \u201cnonhuman intelligence,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t know what it was.\n\nHe said he also picked up what he called an \u201ceightgon,\u201d which he described as \u201ca flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections.\u201d Barber described feeling \u201codd\u201d and growing more emotional as he got closer to the \u201ceightgon\u201d object.\n\n\u201cI felt like something connected with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.\u201d\n\nNewsNation also said it independently obtained footage of an egg-shaped object being moved by helicopter:\n\nWhile few details can be seen, the object isn\u2019t dissimilar to some of those seen in flight in prior videos from other whistleblowers, footage later confirmed by the Pentagon as authentic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne, called the \u201cTic Tac\u201d because of its similarity to the mint candies, shows a white object with no visible wings or engines moving rapidly through the sky as pilots react in awe.\n\nThere has been no clear answer as to what the objects are, but some observers have noted that there are more down-to-earth explanations for them, such as drones or balloons, in some cases of potentially foreign origin and with advanced \u2015 but not alien \u2015 technology.\n\nSee NewsNation\u2019s full interview with Barber below:"

Would we expect anything different from the state that was used as the setting in the \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d broadcast?\n\nUFOs (or UAPs if you want to go with the latest terminology which hasn\u2019t fully caught on yet, unidentified aerial phenomena) have been reported in New Jersey for generations. One of the first notable sightings came in 1966 when a mysterious glowing object was seen over Wanaque.\n\nIt started on Jan. 11 when people from many other towns were among callers to police that they saw the strange object over the Wanaque reservoir. Calls came from Ringwood, Totowa, Paterson, Oakland, and even Butler. It was described as between 2 to 9 feet with a light brighter than any star changing from white to red to green and it was reported the object moved in a manner no man-made aircraft could.\n\nWhat made this sighting so credible is the huge number of people reporting it. Even the mayor of Wanaque saw this.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon was terribly strange,\u201d Mayor Harry T. Wolfe explained. He described it as an oval object.\n\nWitness calls came in from a 20-mile radius. The closest reported seeing this thing burn a hole in the reservoir\u2019s ice, a brilliant light beam shooting down from the object.\n\nCanva / TSM Illustration Canva / TSM Illustration loading...\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there. The next day, Jan. 12, a police officer, Jack Wardlaw, reported he witnessed a brilliant white disc floating near his home in the Wanaque\u2019s Stonetown section.\n\nWardlaw described it as \u201cdefinitely disc-shaped and at certain angles, egg-shaped.\u201d\n\nStacker compiled a list of New Jersey towns with the most UFO sightings in the last 30 years.

However, these waves can be present beyond the clouds and may exist even when no clouds are formed.\n\nThe clouds can result in very strong gusty winds in one place, with still air only a few hundred metres away.\n\nPilots of powered aircraft tend to avoid flying near lenticular clouds because of the turbulence associated with them. Skilled glider pilots like them because they can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising."

The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

Recently, Redditor u/Darren793 asked Reddit community members to share the paranormal encounters they've had, and the stories are bone-chilling:\n\n1.\"I was at the hospital when I bumped into my grandma in the elevator. I asked her why she was there alone and where she was going, but she just smiled. We walked to her hospital room together. When I opened the door, I saw my parents crying. My grandma had already passed away. At that moment, I didn't know how to feel. It was a mix of sadness and fear.\"\n\n\u2014OhMyEgoh Marco_piunti / Getty Images\n\n2.\"Years ago, I was working in my office with a young client. At one point, she jumped up suddenly and announced the presence of my deceased parent by his (rather antiquated) name. It was his birthday that day. I'm not one for believing in the paranormal, but I wasted a couple of hours that day trying to find some explanation. I found nothing.\"\n\n\u2014Science_Matters_100\n\n3.\"I don't believe in paranormal activity, but my grandparents' house is considered by many to be extremely haunted (it's even part of a haunted houses tour in the Los Angeles area). There are many stories, but the one I experienced myself was when I was living there as a child. I was about six; my sister was 12, and we shared a room. My mom had decorated our bedside table with an antique telephone that didn\u2019t work and was not plugged in. One night, my sister and I were asleep, and for some reason, we both woke up at the same time and turned to face each other.\"\n\n\"I remember feeling an extreme feeling of dread. Then the phone rang. We locked eyes and hid under our blankets until it stopped ringing. We both thought it was a dream because we hadn\u2019t said anything for years about it. Then, one day, she was talking about it, and we realized we had had the exact same experience. There are so many more stories, but that\u2019s the only one I have experienced directly.\" \u2014SirennBeautys Princessdlaf / Getty Images\n\n4.\"One day, I was just about to drive out of my apartment parking when I got a call from an unknown number. I answered, but no one was on the line. Then, an accident happened in the street I was just about to go on. Divine intervention? Or maybe just blind luck.\"\n\n\u2014More-Lifeguard7371\n\n5.\"My family lived in a house built before 1865 in Western Massachusetts. My bedroom had a door that led into another sibling's room. One night, I woke up to go to the bathroom. When I sat up, I saw a figure standing at the end of my sister's bed. My first thought was that I was seeing things \u2014 that there was crap in my eyes, or it was all in my head. I calmly closed my eyes and rubbed them, thinking, I'll open my eyes and look up, and whatever I thought I saw will be gone. So, I finished rubbing my eyes...and there it was, still there. I stood up and said, 'Hey.'\"\n\n\"Whatever was there turned around, and I swear its expression was surprised. It moved out of view toward the upstairs hallway. I went into my sister's room, and it was gone. I went out into the hallway, and there was our dog. It was looking down the hallway, tilting its head the way confused dogs do. I never saw the figure again.\" \u2014Rodgertheshrubber David Wall / Getty Images\n\n6.\"Not sure if this is considered paranormal, but when I got fevers as a child, I would always, in my fugue and pain-infused state, hear a man counting in a very deep voice. He would count from one and up. As the numbers got larger, the voice got louder and more intense. It started to get less frequent as I grew older, and now I do not experience it anymore. I\u2019ve brushed it aside as a recurring nightmare until only recently when I learned that my sister experienced the exact same thing when she was younger as well. It\u2019s not the scariest thing, but it does send shivers down my spine.\"\n\n\u2014Sunny_hottie\n\n7.\"A few paranormal things have happened to me throughout my life, but the one that's talked about in the family still is when I saw this little boy as a kid. When I was really little, when I was five or something, we visited my grandparents for a huge dinner with family and friends. I was the only kid there. My grandparents had this walk-in pantry in their apartment with a window. I kept getting shooed out of the kitchen by my grandmother, so I decided to stay in the pantry and try and look out the window. I liked leaning out of it so I could see more. In the complex of apartments my grandparents stayed in, there was a sandbox for the kids to play in. While leaning out the window, I saw this kid playing in the sandbox with a wooden truck. Apparently, I kept staring at this kid enough that my mom asked me what I was doing. I pointed at the kid and said I wanted to play with him.\"\n\n\"According to my mom, I got everyone's attention by saying that. She asked a few more questions, which I answered like she couldn't see him from where she stood. She asked me questions about what he was wearing and then sent me to the living room. My mom returned later and told me I could play with him tomorrow, and I agreed, but I never saw the kid again. Years later, my mom told me that the kid I saw was the deceased child of one of the family friends at that dinner who died in a car accident a few years before I was born.\" \u2014UncomfortableAvocado Dejan / Getty Images/fStop\n\n8.\"One time, I was camping in the woods with my friends. It was already dark, and we were sitting around the fire, telling scary stories. Out of nowhere, we heard this strange whispering coming from deeper in the forest. It sounded like multiple voices speaking at once, but we couldn\u2019t make out any words. At first, we thought it was someone messing with us, but the more we listened, the creepier it felt \u2014 like it wasn\u2019t... human. When we shined our flashlights toward the sound, everything went dead silent. And then, one of my friends, who was sitting closest to the trees, swore he saw something \u2014 a tall figure with unnaturally long arms moving between the trees. We didn\u2019t stick around to find out what it was; we packed up and went straight to our cars. Haven\u2019t been back to that spot since.\"\n\n\u2014Wonderful-Car8693\n\n9.\"This actually happened a few weeks ago. My wife was out of town for work, and I was in bed. Around 1 a.m., my son came down to bed; I barely woke up. Later on in the night, I heard the bedroom door open and close. I woke up and saw a young girl wearing a red sweater with shoulder-length brown hair walk across the end of my bed. I specifically remember seeing her reflection in the mirror. I thought my daughter was also coming down to get in our bed. She sometimes sleepwalks, too. I looked at the clock; it was about 3 a.m. I watched the girl walk across the end of my bed and start walking to our bathroom. She then stood in the doorway. I called out my daughter's name \u2014 no response. The girl then started slowly lifting her arms up from her side until they were sticking straight out to the sides. I said my daughter's name again because, at this point, I figured she was sleepwalking.\"\n\n\"But the girl just stood there motionless with her arms out to her sides. So I yelled my daughter's name again, loud enough that my son woke up. He jumped up and saw the girl as well. I got up, flicked on the light, and there was nothing there. I walked upstairs and saw my daughter was still in her bed. I came back downstairs to look around and stood where the girl I saw was standing, and the floor was noticeably warm. I got back in bed and laid there for a good 45 minutes before I fell back asleep. The next morning, I asked my son about what happened last night to see if he remembered or if it was all a dream. He said he remembered waking up and seeing his sister standing in the doorway wearing a red sweater. It was super weird and freaked me out; I have goosebumps just thinking about it again.\" \u2014DanceSex Motortion / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n10.\"I heard someone whisper in my ears as I was sleeping in a hospital bed. I could feel the breath in my ear; it felt so real. I jolted awake. My mother, who was dozing in a chair nearby, also woke up and said she felt someone step over her legs to get to my bed. No one was there. I hope it was just me hallucinating, but I've never liked hospitals since.\"\n\n\u2014SignorWinter\n\n11.\"I lived in a haunted house for eight years. The number of events we had three was astounding. Most spectacular were the times of hearing glass and dishes break from the kitchen, yet nothing would be out of place. That was especially fun when we had guests over. I once saw a small boy and a cat in one room. Another person later saw the boy, and another later saw the cat. Mind you, I hadn't told ANYONE what I'd seen because I didn't fully believe I'd seen it. As much as we experienced stuff in that house, it wasn't scary.\"\n\n\u2014No_Tailor_787 Rosieriveter / Getty Images\n\n12.\"I saw one of my friends standing outside my front door. The thing was, they were supposed to be out-of-state at the time. I called over my sister, and she saw him before he turned around and bolted down the street before disappearing entirely. I texted my friend, and he confirmed he was out-of-state. I would've chalked it up to hallucination if my sister hadn't seen him, too.\"\n\n\u2014Exciting_Question344\n\n13.\"I had bunk beds at one point growing up. I made a fort by putting a blanket under the top mattress and pulling it down. I used to lie at the foot of the bed because it was closer to the hallways, which allowed me to read with the ambient light while still in my little fort. One day, I looked up to the foot of the top bunk, and I saw feet kicking \u2014 like someone was lying on their stomach on the top bunk. I told my parents, and they dismantled the bunk beds.\"\n\n\"Whatever was there turned around, and I swear its expression was surprised. It moved out of view toward the upstairs hallway. I went into my sister's room, and it was gone. I went out into the hallway, and there was our dog. It was looking down the hallway, tilting its head the way confused dogs do. I never saw the figure again.\" \u2014livinglitch Photography By Bert.design / Getty Images\n\n14.\"I got back from the hospital after being told to say goodbye to my grandfather. I went to my room and made a joint, put a DVD in, and opened my window to smoke. Then the power cut. I looked out my window and saw we were the only house without electricity. I checked, and nothing had tripped out in the fuse box. Two minutes later, everything turned back on. At that exact moment, the landline rang. It was my nan, telling me that my granddad had passed. He was an electrician.\"\n\n\u2014TheFlaccidChode\n\n15.\"We used to live in a very old house where my dad's great-grandparents had raised their kids. Out of nine children, only four lived to adulthood. The others, including my dad's great-grandfather, died in the house. Needless to say, the place was creepy as hell. My grandma said that her dad would always look out the window facing east with his coffee in the morning, so one day, my mom and I were alone in the house and decided to do an experiment.\"\n\n\"We closed all the curtains in the upstairs rooms and went outside to look at them. All the curtains were closed EXCEPT for the ones in the east window. It was open about six inches in the middle \u2014 enough for someone to look out of. I'm not saying that the house was haunted, but that thing was TOTALLY haunted.\" \u2014AnxietyInternal1965 Kevin Cooley / Getty Images\n\n16.Lastly: \"During high school, I spent summer vacation with my best friend and his grandparents, who live in the countryside in Japan. I stayed in his mom\u2019s old room, which has a small wall closet. Just above this closet was a smaller closet door (a foot-and-a-half tall and about three feet wide). It was a weird design, but their house is old. I was pretty jet lagged the first couple of weeks, and Japan is hot and humid, so I didn\u2019t really sleep at night. If my light was off at night, though, I always felt uneasy about that small closet space. Something about it just felt darker than the rest of the room. Toward the end of the second week, I started to adjust to the time difference. One morning, I woke up, and that small door was open. It was unsettling, but I closed it, thinking it might have come loose. A couple of nights later, I woke up feeling uneasy. It was dark, but I could kinda see, and I saw that the small door was open. It was pitch black in there.\"\n\n\"This was the first and only time I experienced 'paralysis.' I was too scared to move, say, or do anything. I just felt this darkness coming from there. I don\u2019t remember sleeping that night, but I must\u2019ve because I remember waking up the next morning. I told my friend about it, and he said his mom told him about something like that, too. When we got back home, I talked to his parents about it, and his mom said, 'So, I heard you met the ghost.'\"\n\n\u2014PretttyLonely\n\nUm, yeah, I will NOT be getting any sleep tonight.

The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

Instead of providing developers with a kind of supercharged autocomplete, this next generation can prototype, test, and debug code for you. The upshot is that developers could essentially turn into managers, who may spend more time reviewing and correcting code written by a model than writing it from scratch themselves.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Many of the people building generative coding assistants think that they could be a fast track to artificial general intelligence, the hypothetical superhuman technology that a number of top firms claim to have in their sights.Read the full story.\n\n\n\n\u2014Will Douglas Heaven\n\nOpenAI has created an AI model for longevity science\n\nWhen you think of AI\u2019s contributions to science, you probably think of AlphaFold, the Google DeepMind protein-folding program that earned its creator a Nobel Prize last year. Now OpenAI says it\u2019s getting into the science game too\u2014with a model for engineering proteins.\n\nThe company says it has developed a language model that dreams up proteins capable of turning regular cells into stem cells\u2014and that it has handily beat humans at the task.\n\nThe work represents OpenAI\u2019s first model focused on biological data and its first public claim that its models can deliver unexpected scientific results.

Again.\n\n\"Twitter hype is out of control again,\" Altman posted on X Monday, pulling back from weeks of cryptic teasers and bold predictions about the company's latest AI model, o3. \"We are not gonna deploy AGI next month, nor have we built it.\"\n\ntwitter hype is out of control again. we are not gonna deploy AGI next month, nor have we built it. we have some very cool stuff for you but pls chill and cut your expectations 100x! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) January 20, 2025\n\n\u201c[Please] chill and cut your expectations 100x!\u201d he wrote.\n\nSuch statements seem like a sharp U-turn from Altman's recent blog post where he claimed OpenAI knew how to build AGI and predicted people would be working hand in hand with AI agents this year. He even suggested superintelligence could emerge \"in a few thousand days.\"\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\" Altman wrote on Jan. 5. \"We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies.\u201d\n\nThat kind of talk sent the AI community into a frenzy. But while Altman even theorized about the advent of superintelligent tools, other experts were more skeptical about the hype of using vague terms or grasping for mushy, imprecise definitions rather than standards.\n\n\u201cWhen considering what Altman said about AGI-level AI agents, it's important to focus on how the definition of AGI has been evolving,\" Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai and Chairman of the ASI Alliance, told Decrypt. \"AGI has not yet reached a level of true sentience, and I don\u2019t believe it will for quite some time.\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time Altman has had to walk back his own hype. After hyping up GPT-4o's capabilities, he later dismissed his own claims and called ChatGPT \u201cmildly embarrassing at best.\u201d\n\nDo you see a pattern? Some people do:\n\nsam: singularity is here\n\nsam two weeks later: jesus christ chill the singularity isn't herehttps://t.co/3LlRAxnVkB \u2014 AI Notkilleveryoneism Memes \u23f8\ufe0f (@AISafetyMemes) January 20, 2025\n\nAltman himself has reflected on how people debate the potential impact of new AI models, only to end up demanding more capabilities as models fail to meet their expectations.\n\nprediction: the o3 arc will go something like: 1. \"oh damn it's smarter than me, this changes everything ahhhh\" <ten minutes pass> 2. \"so what's for dinner, anyway?\" <ten minutes pass> 3. \"can you believe how bad o3 is? and slow? they need to hurry up and ship o4.\" \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) January 10, 2025\n\nAs usual, Altman sprinkled in some scintillating promises to adorn his otherwise disappointing tweet. The OpenAI CEO said his company has some \"cool stuff\" in the pipeline, just don't expect it to pass the Turing test anytime soon. He did confirm in an earlier X post that OpenAI o3 mini, a weaker version of the full o3 reasoning model, is just a few weeks away.\n\nOpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about specific capabilities of the o3 model or timelines for its release."

            "article_content": "Revelations that OpenAI secretly funded and had access to the FrontierMath benchmarking dataset are raising concerns about whether it was used to train its reasoning o3 AI reasoning model, and the validity of the model\u2019s high scores.\n\nIn addition to accessing the benchmarking dataset, OpenAI funded its creation, a fact that was withheld from the mathematicians who contributed to developing FrontierMath. Epoch AI belatedly disclosed OpenAI\u2019s funding only in the final paper published on Arxiv.org, which announced the benchmark. Earlier versions of the paper omitted any mention of OpenAI\u2019s involvement.\n\nScreenshot Of FrontierMath Paper\n\nCloseup Of Acknowledgement\n\nPrevious Version Of Paper That Lacked Acknowledgement\n\nOpenAI 03 Model Scored Highly On FrontierMath Benchmark\n\nThe news of OpenAI\u2019s secret involvement are raising questions about the high scores achieved by the o3 reasoning AI model and causing disappointment with the FrontierMath project. Epoch AI responded with transparency about what happened and what they\u2019re doing to check if the o3 model was trained with the FrontierMath dataset.\n\nGiving OpenAI access to the dataset was unexpected because the whole point of it is to test AI models but that can\u2019t be done if the models know the questions and answers beforehand.\n\nA post in the r/singularity subreddit expressed this disappointment and cited a document that claimed that the mathematicians didn\u2019t know about OpenAI\u2019s involvement:\n\n\u201cFrontier Math, the recent cutting-edge math benchmark, is funded by OpenAI. OpenAI allegedly has access to the problems and solutions. This is disappointing because the benchmark was sold to the public as a means to evaluate frontier models, with support from renowned mathematicians. In reality, Epoch AI is building datasets for OpenAI. They never disclosed any ties with OpenAI before.\u201d\n\nThe Reddit discussion cited a publication that revealed OpenAI\u2019s deeper involvement:\n\n\u201cThe mathematicians creating the problems for FrontierMath were not (actively)[2] communicated to about funding from OpenAI. \u2026Now Epoch AI or OpenAI don\u2019t say publicly that OpenAI has access to the exercises or answers or solutions. I have heard second-hand that OpenAI does have access to exercises and answers and that they use them for validation.\u201d\n\nTamay Besiroglu (LinkedIn Profile), associated director at Epoch AI, acknowledged that OpenAI had access to the datasets but also asserted that there was a \u201choldout\u201d dataset that OpenAI didn\u2019t have access to.\n\nHe wrote in the cited document:\n\n\u201cTamay from Epoch AI here. We made a mistake in not being more transparent about OpenAI\u2019s involvement. We were restricted from disclosing the partnership until around the time o3 launched, and in hindsight we should have negotiated harder for the ability to be transparent to the benchmark contributors as soon as possible. Our contract specifically prevented us from disclosing information about the funding source and the fact that OpenAI has data access to much but not all of the dataset. We own this error and are committed to doing better in the future. Regarding training usage: We acknowledge that OpenAI does have access to a large fraction of FrontierMath problems and solutions, with the exception of a unseen-by-OpenAI hold-out set that enables us to independently verify model capabilities. However, we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training. OpenAI has also been fully supportive of our decision to maintain a separate, unseen holdout set\u2014an extra safeguard to prevent overfitting and ensure accurate progress measurement. From day one, FrontierMath was conceived and presented as an evaluation tool, and we believe these arrangements reflect that purpose. \u201c\n\nMore Facts About OpenAI & FrontierMath Revealed\n\nElliot Glazer (LinkedIn profile/Reddit profile), the lead mathematician at Epoch AI confirmed that OpenAI has the dataset and that they were allowed to use it to evaluate OpenAI\u2019s o3 large language model, which is their next state of the art AI that\u2019s referred to as a reasoning AI model. He offered his opinion that the high scores obtained by the o3 model are \u201clegit\u201d and that Epoch AI is conducting an independent evaluation to determine whether or not o3 had access to the FrontierMath dataset for training, which could cast the model\u2019s high scores in a different light.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cEpoch\u2019s lead mathematician here. Yes, OAI funded this and has the dataset, which allowed them to evaluate o3 in-house. We haven\u2019t yet independently verified their 25% claim. To do so, we\u2019re currently developing a hold-out dataset and will be able to test their model without them having any prior exposure to these problems. My personal opinion is that OAI\u2019s score is legit (i.e., they didn\u2019t train on the dataset), and that they have no incentive to lie about internal benchmarking performances. However, we can\u2019t vouch for them until our independent evaluation is complete.\u201d\n\nGlazer had also shared that Epoch AI was going to test o3 using a \u201choldout\u201d dataset that OpenAI didn\u2019t have access to, saying:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate o3 with OAI having zero prior exposure to the holdout problems. This will be airtight.\u201d\n\nAnother post on Reddit by Glazer described how the \u201choldout set\u201d was created:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll describe the process more clearly when the holdout set eval is actually done, but we\u2019re choosing the holdout problems at random from a larger set which will be added to FrontierMath. The production process is otherwise identical to how it\u2019s always been.\u201d\n\nWaiting For Answers\n\nThat\u2019s where the drama stands until the Epoch AI evaluation is completed which will indicate whether or not OpenAI had trained their AI reasoning model with the dataset or only used it for benchmarking it.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Antonello Marangi"

From new delivery methods for adaptive re-use and mass timber structures to digital fabrication, new research aims to provide guidance on emerging construction methods and technologies.. Image Courtesy of Perkins&Will\n\nInnovation comes in many shapes and forms. 2025 is poised to witness continued advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence, sustainability, and biotechnology. These breakthroughs often arise from experimentation in industries like technology and healthcare, where companies have strong research and development teams and significant budgets. This enables them to produce new products and services that address society's evolving needs.\n\nIn a world confronting complex challenges, innovation in architecture plays a distinctive role. Unlike industries driven by rapid innovation cycles, architecture must balance creativity with practical solutions that are deeply rooted in human experience. What will it take for the architecture industry to fully harness its potential in shaping the future of our built environment?\n\n+ 2\n\nInterrogating this question, ArchDaily's editor Ankitha Gattupalli spoke to Leigh Christy and Yehia Madkour, architects and co-directors of Research and Innovation at Perkins&Will. Based in the Los Angeles studio, Leigh leads regional projects while also guiding firm-wide research efforts. Vancouver-based Yehia, whose work explores the intersection of design and technology, brings his expertise to the firm's research initiatives, driving innovation across 32 studios. Together, they shape the firm's research direction, advancing new approaches to design and technology.\n\nRelated Article What are Innovation Districts?\n\nArchDaily (Ankitha Gattupalli): How do you define innovation, and how do you believe it is understood when you discuss it?\n\nLeigh Christy (LC): The definition of innovation is not fixed; it evolves over time. Innovation is best understood as the combination of ideation and implementation. While ideation is central to many programs, the focus on research and application is critical for scaling and successful implementation.\n\nYehia Madkour (YM): Innovation goes beyond just generating a novel idea; it is about the execution of that idea. The true value of innovation lies in the process that follows the initial concept. There are three key steps to innovation:\n\nThe generation of a novel idea. The advancement of that idea in a meaningful direction. The creation of value, which may be societal, industrial, or personal, rather than strictly financial.\n\nAD: How do you see the architecture industry responding to the concept of innovation?\n\nYM: Architects are in a unique position to connect various elements\u2014working with clients to understand their evolving needs, collaborating with industry partners to adapt to changes, and considering economic, technological, and human factors. This central role allows us to generate innovative ideas. However, the industry, particularly in architecture and construction, tends to lag behind other sectors in terms of technological adoption.\n\nOne reason for this is the bespoke nature of design in our field, which presents challenges when attempting to apply standardized innovations. Each project often requires tailored solutions, making it difficult to implement broad, systematic changes like automation. While architects are positioned to generate many ideas, the industry as a whole still faces barriers to embracing innovation at scale.\n\nLC: I believe the approach to problem-solving through design thinking positions architects well to propose innovative solutions. We address challenges at the scale of every project, but what is particularly interesting is how we extend innovation beyond individual projects. We learn from past projects to drive future innovation, developing new tools when needed and remaining open to change when approaches prove ineffective.\n\nWhile the industry generates novel ideas, implementing systematic change and sharing progress remains inconsistent. Addressing issues like housing and climate change requires a multidisciplinary approach, with architects playing a key collaborative role alongside clients and professionals.\n\nAD: How do you decide which research areas are worth exploring?\n\nYM: Our research areas emerge from a combination of factors, including our understanding of global shifts and client-driven inquiries. Some areas are more focused on immediate applications, while others are more strategic and long-term in nature.\n\nFor instance, human experience remains central to our work and will continue to be a major research focus. Another key area is digital layering, as new technologies are continuously emerging, and understanding their integration is critical. We also prioritize urgent issues, such as environmental crises and climate change, which will remain pressing challenges for the foreseeable future.\n\nLC: An example of this approach can be seen in our mass timber research, which began over 10 years ago. It started with exploring its broader application after gaining attention in Vancouver. Initially, challenges like local availability, testing codes, and fire resistance were barriers. By partnering with structural engineers and fire consultants, we advanced the industry, and mass timber is now widely used across North America and Europe. We are now investigating its role in circularity and design for disassembly. While our mass timber research may eventually conclude, it will lead to new inquiries on alternative materials and structural systems.\n\nAD: How do you balance the potential of technology and research with the market's readiness for it?\n\nLC: This challenge ties into how we structure our research agenda. We focus on understanding both current industry needs and emerging questions from our client base. By recognizing patterns, we aim to create solutions that not only address immediate issues but also position us to address future challenges. It's about striking a balance between vision and practicality, ensuring we remain grounded in the current landscape while also preparing for the future.\n\nYM: While we concentrate on solving current needs, we also allocate time for strategic thinking. Some ideas may not be market-ready today, but they help us anticipate trends for the next 5 to 10 years. These long-term considerations may seem speculative now, but they are vital for positioning ourselves for future opportunities. Innovation involves accepting failure as part of the process, but it's essential to plan ahead, not just focus on immediate needs.\n\nAD: How do you integrate different disciplines to drive innovation and manage subject matter expertise on complex issues?\n\nLC: Collaboration is a two-way street. While our external partners bring valuable insights, we provide the projects necessary to test those ideas. This mutual exchange of expertise benefits both parties. Peer review is another critical aspect of our process\u2014before presenting our research as foundational, we seek feedback from others to refine our findings.\n\nCollaborating with specialists has been crucial in our research, such as when exploring toxins in materials or in our work on habitable materials where we learned about carbon footprint and human health. By identifying our specific questions, we can select the most suitable partners to help answer them.\n\nInnovation often requires human connection to move forward - Yehia Madkour\n\nAD: What do you see as the key barriers to innovation in architecture, and how can the industry overcome them?\n\nYM: The primary barrier to innovation in architecture is designing for one solution at a time. While this approach fuels creativity, each project's unique specifics often prevent the scalability necessary for widespread impact. In technology, scalability drives innovation by reaching millions, but in architecture, we often lack the scale to extend the impact of each idea.\n\nThe industry would benefit from a systems-thinking approach, where solutions are designed to be scalable and adaptable across different contexts. Without this systemic approach, innovation in architecture struggles to progress at the same pace as other industries. While this may seem like an unsolvable problem, I believe shifting our mindset could unlock a great deal of innovation.\n\nLC: While architecture can certainly adopt more systematic approaches, I've come to realize the importance of having a visionary role as well. Innovation in architecture isn't just about technology; it's about envisioning improvements to the built environment. This involves understanding the process that leads to a successful project, not just the final product.\n\nWhile it's tempting to look to the tech industry as the benchmark for innovation, there are other equally impactful forms of innovation, such as community engagement. Simple tools, like administering surveys, can make a significant difference in the design process.\n\nWhile we may not be as advanced in innovation as the tech industry, I believe there is immense potential in architecture to lead in innovation\u2014especially if we embrace a more comprehensive, systems-oriented mindset."

            "article_content": "This is a guest post for the Computer Weekly Developer Network written by Gordon Robinson in his capacity as senior director of data management at SAS.\n\nRobinson writes in full as follows\u2026\n\nOver the past couple of decades, the role of the \u201cdata engineer\u201d emerged as businesses have become increasingly data-driven, catapulting the need for specialised skills to manage the large volumes of data being processed.\n\nGoogle popularised the title itself around 2010, underscoring the necessity for experts to design, build and maintain scalable data systems. The advent of technologies like Hadoop and Spark further emphasised the importance of these roles, which bridge raw data and actionable insights, aiding data scientists and analysts.\n\nDemand for data engineers In recent years, substantial advancements in AI, increased AI accessibility and rapid growth of data-driven decision-making have led to greater \u2013 and mounting \u2013 demands on data engineering teams. In fact, job postings for AI-related roles have surged by 119% over the past two years and, mirroring that change, data engineering positions have seen a 98% increase, says LinkedIn. Many businesses are facing challenges in meeting the demand for data engineers and filling these critical positions. Skilled data engineers are hard to find in the job market due to the demand outpacing the supply and the most talented often cost enterprises a premium to hire too. As a result, other employees, such as software developers and data scientists, often take on responsibilities typically managed by data engineers. These tasks include managing data pipelines, ensuring data quality and building infrastructure for data processing. The term \u201ccitizen data engineer\u201d refers to these non-specialist professionals, typically from roles such as business analysts, operations staff or software developers, who develop the necessary skills to perform basic data engineering tasks. Businesses are increasingly relying on these often self-trained individuals to alleviate some of the workload of their data engineering teams (if they have one).\n\nTools & training Given the lack of formal training for citizen data engineers, the onus falls on companies to ensure that these employees have the appropriate tools they need to simplify their tasks and bolster their knowledge. Some key requirements for these tools are: Low-code /no-code : A LC/NC interface is crucial for a citizen data engineer as it enables them to efficiently perform data-related tasks without requiring extensive programming knowledge, thereby bridging the gap between technical and non-technical professionals.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI : It is essential for data engineering tools to offer generative AI functionalities to support citizen engineers. This should encompass features such as natural language queries for locating relevant data sets, automatic suggestions for transformations and the generation of data flows.\n\n\n\nCollaboration : Collaboration capabilities are vital for data engineering tools, enabling cooperation among data engineers, data scientists, business analysts and end users.\n\n\n\nData governance : Integrated data governance and lineage are essential for organisations to understand their data, its quality and usage. Tools for citizen data engineers should simplify this management and help the organisation ensure compliance with regulations they may need to adhere to. Given the above, organisations will need to look beyond some of the traditional coding-only interfaces that the data engineers may use if they want to enable citizen data engineers."

Additionally, the Price-to-Sales Ratio is 0.73, reflecting the market\u2019s valuation of the company\u2019s sales, while the Price-to-Book Ratio is 1.56, comparing the market value to the company\u2019s book value.\n\nUnderstanding Insider Trading\n\nInvestors often prefer to invest in shares held by company insiders, as management is typically more aligned with the company\u2019s success and shareholder interests. Currently, insiders own just 4.48% of Werner Enterprises Inc (WERN)\u2019s shares, while financial institutions hold 94.32%."

Only 245.4 million desktop PCs and notebooks with Windows, macOS and Chrome OS were sold in 2024. This is according to a preliminary estimate by market observer Gartner.\n\nAnzeige\n\nCompared to 2023, the PC market grew by 1.3%. There was no significant upward trend towards the end of the year either: in the fourth quarter, manufacturers sold 64.4 million devices \u2013 1.4 percent more than at the end of 2023. Gartner does not look at the distribution between desktop PCs and notebooks; the ratio is typically around 1:3.\n\nBefore 2023, more than 250 million computers were sold each year. In 2020 and 2021, the level was particularly high at more than 300 million units due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGartner always publishes preliminary figures on the PC market at the beginning of the year. As a rule, these estimates are already accurate. (Image: heise online)\n\nMany incentives do not help\n\nMicrosoft and all major notebook manufacturers have been focusing their marketing efforts on AI computers with Copilot+ since 2024. So far, however, only a few seem to be interested. Intel's announcement that it will have delivered a good 1.5 million Lunar Lake processors (Core Ultra 200V) with an AI unit in 2024 fits in with this. Qualcomm's ARM processors from the Snapdragon X series are expected to be even lower. The market share of Copilot+ PCs is therefore around one percent.\n\nThe approaching end of support for Windows 10 this coming October is also not encouraging new purchases. Microsoft only supports Windows 11 from Intel's Core i-8000 and AMD's Ryzen 2000. Windows 11 can only be installed with tricks on all systems with older CPUs. Without Windows 11, however, private users will no longer receive any important security updates.\n\nAnzeige\n\nMeanwhile, the figures for the second half of 2024 are glossed over by subsidies in China. Among other things, the government is promoting new purchases of desktop PCs and notebooks through trade-in bonuses: Since August, anyone handing in an old device has received a 15 percent refund on the new computer. China is planning further such programs for 2025.\n\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt Mit Ihrer Zustimmung wird hier ein externer Preisvergleich (heise Preisvergleich) geladen.

Would we expect anything different from the state that was used as the setting in the \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d broadcast?\n\nUFOs (or UAPs if you want to go with the latest terminology which hasn\u2019t fully caught on yet, unidentified aerial phenomena) have been reported in New Jersey for generations. One of the first notable sightings came in 1966 when a mysterious glowing object was seen over Wanaque.\n\nIt started on Jan. 11 when people from many other towns were among callers to police that they saw the strange object over the Wanaque reservoir. Calls came from Ringwood, Totowa, Paterson, Oakland, and even Butler. It was described as between 2 to 9 feet with a light brighter than any star changing from white to red to green and it was reported the object moved in a manner no man-made aircraft could.\n\nWhat made this sighting so credible is the huge number of people reporting it. Even the mayor of Wanaque saw this.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon was terribly strange,\u201d Mayor Harry T. Wolfe explained. He described it as an oval object.\n\nWitness calls came in from a 20-mile radius. The closest reported seeing this thing burn a hole in the reservoir\u2019s ice, a brilliant light beam shooting down from the object.\n\nCanva / TSM Illustration Canva / TSM Illustration loading...\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there. The next day, Jan. 12, a police officer, Jack Wardlaw, reported he witnessed a brilliant white disc floating near his home in the Wanaque\u2019s Stonetown section.\n\nWardlaw described it as \u201cdefinitely disc-shaped and at certain angles, egg-shaped.\u201d\n\nStacker compiled a list of New Jersey towns with the most UFO sightings in the last 30 years.

The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

            "article_content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nFor children today, artificial intelligence (AI) won't be a marvel or a menace\u2014it will simply be there. As unremarkable as Wi-Fi or running water. It's not a question of whether they'll adapt to AI; they're already growing up with it.\n\nAlexa's voice mingles with bedtime stories. ChatGPT drafts homework outlines. Google Home turns on the lights and plays morning playlists.\n\nAI is settling into family homes, classrooms, and even cribs, not as an anomaly but as a quiet companion.\n\nMy daughter is growing up with humans and AI. Literally. She just turned one and already recognises her mom, her dad, and her AI assistant. We have the Amazon Alexa at home, and my partner and I use Siri on our iPhones all the time. As a result, she sees AI as a natural part of her life. Alexa and Siri are two names she is familiar with, just like 'Mama' and 'Papaa.'\n\nWhen she cries, we say, \"Alexa, tell Raaha to stop crying,\" Alexa blinks blue and green, luring her to think it's her friend. And she stops crying.\n\nWhen tears roll down her cheeks, Alexa's soothing lullabies often succeed where parenting hacks fail. A simple command transforms chaos into calm. This isn't the splashy tech revolution futurists warned about.\n\nDon't forget the foundation. AI here is not forced. It didn't announce itself. It's here to weave itself into the fabric of daily life. Like a flawless merger.\n\nA decade ago, Skype calls felt like science fiction; toddlers swipe through virtual classrooms today without batting an eye.\n\nSimilarly, today's AI-powered toys, chatbots, and voice assistants will become as banal as microwaves by the time Generation Alpha enters middle school. The shift is happening in the mundane moments.\n\nAlgorithms suggest learning apps tailored to individual needs. Toys respond to emotional cues, fostering a strange form of companionship. And yet, these tools are less about transforming life and more about streamlining it. For today's kids, there's no awe or fear. It's just life.\n\nAI's creeping omnipresence creates a paradox.\n\nOn one hand, it's a miracle of modernity. Need a quick science lesson? AI tutors have you covered. Want to track developmental milestones? Machine learning apps will cheerfully send reminders. But this efficiency comes at a cost. If Alexa answers every curious \"why,\" will children still learn the joy of discovery? If empathy is simulated, will they grasp the depth of real human connection?\n\nAlso Read: AI in the real world\n\nI wrestle with these questions daily. I marvel at AI's ability to ease daily burdens. As a sceptic, I wonder: Are we outsourcing too much? AI may smooth the edges of chaos, but it also raises a nagging fear\u2014what happens when the lines between human and machine blur too much?\n\nOutside the home, the AI ecosystem is reshaping every facet of society. Schools are piloting AI tutors that promise personalised education, a far cry from one-size-fits-all classrooms. In healthcare, AI tools detect patterns in patient data, offering diagnostics faster than human doctors. Even our social interactions are subtly guided by recommendation algorithms dictating what we see, read, and share.\n\nBut with ubiquity comes complacency. Who ensures these systems remain ethical while children grow up surrounded by invisible, algorithmic hands? Bias in AI is no theoretical issue. A 2019 study found that facial recognition software misidentified Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more frequently than white ones. When these systems shape our children's realities, vigilance isn't optional\u2014it's imperative.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe next frontier for AI isn't innovation\u2014it's normalisation. Systems will become more personalised, more humanlike, and more integrated into the spaces we inhabit. Picture this: smart homes seamlessly adapting to moods, smart cities optimising every resource, and AI tools that learn not just how we think but how we feel. Our children will inherit this reality\u2014a world where AI doesn't stand out; it blends in.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will be part of their lives. It's whether it will shape them more than they shape it.\n\nA Quiet Revolution, Carefully Tended\n\nIt's to make life a little smoother, a little easier quietly. As parents, educators, professionals and citizens, our responsibility is to ensure this transition is thoughtful and deliberate. AI shouldn't raise our children. It should support us in raising them.\n\nIn business, think of AI as a dependable assistant. It simplifies tasks, spots problems, and lets leaders focus on big-picture decisions. It's not the boss; the behind-the-scenes helper keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nIn education, AI works like a helpful tutor. It finds where students struggle and offers the right tools to support them. But the teacher inspires creativity, critical thinking, and emotional growth\u2014skills no machine can truly replace.\n\nAlso Read: Human intelligence must guide artificial intelligence\n\nFor now, I'll keep asking Alexa to play lullabies when the chaos peaks. But I'll also keep asking myself harder questions. Will this ecosystem of AI enhance our humanity\u2014or dilute it? The answer, perhaps, lies in how we choose to nurture this strange, quiet revolution. Maybe it's not as scary as it's portrayed in the movies, as it's quietly evolving into our regular ecosystem anyway.\n\nPersonally, I'm okay with AI if it can help my baby stop crying. More okay with it helping me automate the most boring task in my profession."
