            "article_content": "Unidentified drones have been reported flying over multiple counties in New Jersey, causing widespread concern among residents and prompting a federal investigation. These sightings, which began in late November 2024, involve large, often car-sized drones flying in coordinated patterns, the New York Times reported. They have been spotted hovering over critical infrastructure, including reservoirs, power lines, and railroads, as well as flying over residential backyards, highways, and often in groups.\n\nA flurry of online images and videos have gone viral on social media in the US, sparking widespread curiosity and concern among locals. The drones were captured on camera by residents in multiple boroughs in the state, mostly at night. Witnesses described the drones as significantly larger than typical hobbyist models and emitting a loud, humming noise.\n\n\"It's kind of unsettling. They're not up for 15 minutes, they're up for hours,\" a resident told WPIX. \"We saw one right up above us that was the size of our car, another resident said.\n\nThese \"drones\" being seen over New Jersey are Galactic Federation crafts.\n\n\n\nThey're partially disguised to give those who aren't ready time to adapt.\n\n\n\nSome look like planes. Some look like drones.\n\n\n\nThe military already knows they can't stop them. Nothing can stop what's coming. https://t.co/CZ3A6VpxHW pic.twitter.com/gpihADUyVy \u2014 Kab (@Kabamur_Taygeta) December 5, 2024\n\nThe FBI, along with local law enforcement and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is currently investigating the incidents. \"We are working with several of our law enforcement partners to figure out what's going on. At the moment, we don't have any specifics to share,\" said bureau spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson.\n\nAuthorities have emphasised there is no immediate threat but encouraged residents to report sightings and provide images to assist the investigation. FBI's Newark office and Morris County officials issued a joint statement asking the public to come forward with any information they might have over the mysterious \"drone activity,\" including videos. \"There continues to be no known threat to public safety,\" the statement reads.\n\nHowever, the drones' consistent and organized activity has drawn public attention, with some fearing breaches of privacy or security.\n\n\"It is making people anxious. It's kind of like a Peeping Tom, and it gets everybody's vigilance up \u2212 they become hypervigilant to it,\" said Richard Waldron, a Closter-based psychologist.\n\nFollowing the reports, the Federal Aviation Administration has also banned drones from flying over President-elect Donald Trump's New Jersey golf course.\n\nMeanwhile, the mysterious drone sightings have captivated the online community, with the state's subreddit forum buzzing with theories and amateur investigations. Even UFO enthusiasts have joined the fray, speculating about the origins and purpose of the unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nTheories abound, ranging from suspicions of foreign surveillance drones, such as the Chinese spy balloon incident last year, to possibilities of US military tests or local law enforcement surveillance."

            "article_content": "Released on June 21st, 19-Something and Four, Bee Thousand, the seventh album by Dayton, Ohio\u2019s Guided by Voices, was ushered into the time-and-space sphere. The record may clock in at 36:35, but in reality\u2014whatever that even is\u2014Bee Thousand has proved to be a timeless piece, able to exist as an artifact of a certain musical genre known as \u201clo-fi indie rock,\u201d while also retaining its immediacy, as evidenced in the opening track, \u201cHardcore UFO\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOver a jangly, guitar-driven tune with a pulsating drum beat, Robert Pollard croons the opening lyrics from a second-person perspective. You (me) are hanging on the roof of the house, staring upwards towards infinity, hoping for a close encounter of the amplified kind. UFOs are unencumbered by that whole space-and-time thingy.\n\nMore from Spin:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final line of the first stanza is \u201cI\u2019ll be with you, without you, again.\u201d\n\nThen, a magical moment occurs, or I should say has been occurring, and will continue to occur until God knows when. At the :56 second mark of the song, just before things kick into high gear, one of the four tracks used to record the song drops out. How this happened remains a mystery. Was it due to faulty equipment? Did somebody accidentally press Record and Play at the same time? We will never know. The How is unimportant, what matters is it happened.\n\nEvery time I listen to the song, that dropout happens. Every future play, it will happen. If scholars or stoners ever want to get to the bottom of the popularity of listening to sub-par fidelity music then they should look no further than this moment. The creation and the act of creating have been synchronized. Mistake or divine intervention, those three seconds, before the second guitar reappears, proves that time is purely subjective. In that exact moment I exist on two parallel planes. 2024 and 1994, at once a middle-aged teenager.\n\nTurned 30 this year: Guided by Voices\u2019 Bee Thousand album.\n\nLet\u2019s talk to Robert.\n\nSPIN: Bee Thousand turns 30 this year. Did you have a hunch that it would be the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d album?\n\nRobert Pollard: It\u2019s actually just a collection of re-worked, old songs. This one broke through and found a lot of important ears because of its diversity and sheer volume of very good songs. There are a lot of different fields of sound, and a lot of it\u2019s actually pretty hard to listen to. That may be part of the appeal. I wanted it to sound like a collection of poorly recorded Beatles White Album demo outtakes.\n\nThe band started employing the 4-track machine on Propeller. What is it about the lo-fi aesthetic?\n\nThe lo-fi thing to me at first came out of economical necessity. But then I started really digging the immediacy and the crazy shitty overall sounds you could get. A lot of diversity within a limited space. You rely on live, in-the-room sound and moving things around. You incorporate extraneous elements like field recordings and fucked-up film extracts detuned to fit the key of song. Drop-outs, warp effects, strange percussive devices, things like that, and then you cram everything into four or five or six tracks.\n\nYou and I were once in Cincinnati, and out of the blue you started singing a song you dubbed \u201cHat Vertigo,\u201d after noticing how many dudes in that bar were wearing hats. You sang a verse and chorus and then it floated into the ether. Do you remember doing that? How many great songs are on old tapes or lyrics in notebooks?\n\nI don\u2019t remember \u201cHat Vertigo,\u201d but I like that.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo telling how many of those there are, where they are, or if recorded takes exist. Also there are a lot of aborted lyrics and ideas in notebooks, and I\u2019m constantly making up songs and singing them into people\u2019s phones when we\u2019re out drinking and being silly.\n\nHow early in life did you think, \u201cI can write a song!\u201d?\n\nI was writing hits for neighborhood buddies when I was 7 or 8 years old. All a capella but with structure and very derivative of AM radio hits of that time. 1965-66 Herman\u2019s Hermits, Beatles, Dave Clark Five, Gary Lewis and the Playboys. I had songs like \u201cWe Are From the Planet Mars,\u201d \u201cWolf Man,\u201d \u201cEggs Make Me Sick,\u201d \u201cImagination,\u201d to name a few.\n\nYou once said recording each song of Bee Thousand took roughly a half-hour. What took so long?\n\nIt took roughly a half-hour each because we had to change the setting. Rearrange the mic-ing set ups and positions. Get different effects. Whatever. Do another shot. Smoke a joint.\n\nFrom left: Mitch Mitchell, Kevin Fennell, Robert Pollard, and Tobin Sprout.\n\nYou also once said, \u201cIf you write a song and your mom likes it, shit-can it immediately.\u201d Does that ethos remain?\n\nI actually said \u201cgrandmother,\u201d but it pretty much equally applies to mother or even sister and a lot of times friends. The first person to hear a song now is my wife, Sarah. Then Travis [Harrison], then the band.\n\n\u201cGirls of Wild Strawberries\u201d I assume was at least half-concocted while watching the Bergman classic.\n\nYes, it definitely was inspired by the Bergman film, which I think is beautiful. \u201cImaginary Queen Anne\u201d was inspired by an episode of The Tudors about King Henry VIII, when she had a flashback, end of life memory of her childhood with her brother right before she was beheaded. I\u2019m sure there are a lot of other songs [influenced by movies].\n\nIf you could work with one director, who would it be?\n\nWell, I was set up to work with Steven Soderbergh on a musical adaptation of the life of Cleopatra called Cleo, but it ended up not happening. He even stayed at my house to work on altering lyrics from some of my better-known songs to match the script. Anyway, it fell through. It was a big-ass waste of my time. Now I don\u2019t want to work with any directors on a movie soundtrack. Fuck that. Just make albums. They\u2019re better than trying to force songs into a movie soundtrack anyway.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo disrespect to Steven Soderbergh. I don\u2019t think it was his fault. And that\u2019s not to say if something really alluring came up I wouldn\u2019t change my mind.\n\nDo you remember your reaction to hearing the tape cut out on \u201cHardcore UFO\u2019s\u201d?\n\nWe just thought it sounded cool and it went along with our lo-fi aesthetic. Also we justified it as being interference from hardcore UFOs.\n\nGBV began life in a proper studio, and then came the lo-fi glory years. Now y\u2019all are really letting your prog flag fly. You\u2019ve released some country ditties under the name Cash Rivers. Any other genres you feel like tackling?\n\nYou know, I thought about a crooner record, but I\u2019ve got this eternal child-like perspective when it comes to making music. I just keep writing and recording songs as if I were in high school or college, and that means rock.\n\nWhat is the recording process? How much input do the other band members supply?\n\nThe others, including Travis, have a tremendous amount of input. In fact, unlike in the past, they pretty much do everything except for writing the songs and doing the vocals, which I add to the final mixed instrumentals.\n\nDo you still record demos on your boombox?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I do!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead SPIN\u2019s original 1994 review of Guided by Voice\u2019s Bee Thousand here.\n\nTo see our running list of the top 100 greatest rock stars of all time, click here."

But apparently, Google needs more AI wrappers, as it has been spotted working on AI Mode for Google Search to bring some of its recent progress with conversational AI assistants to the search engine. This AI mode presumably lets users build context and refine their search queries with follow-up responses. To simplify the process, Google is adding a new button to allow quick access to AI mode.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWe managed to activate the UI for Google\u2019s upcoming AI Mode for Search in the latest Google app v15.49.40 beta. This is what it looks like:\n\nUnfortunately, tapping the button crashes the app as the feature is not completely built out yet.\n\nA shortcut for the AI mode is also being added to the Google Search widget. Tapping the AI mode shortcut icon opens the search tab in the Google App for now, though it should ideally open up further AI mode functionality once the feature is fully developed.\n\nEagle-eye readers would spot the curiously new icon in the top left corner. It looks related to a conversation history button, but we can\u2019t say for sure what it is for.\n\nThe AI Mode feature remains a work in progress, so we\u2019re left guessing what Google\u2019s endgame is with yet another AI feature for Google Search.

            "article_content": "David is one of dozens of \u201cpals\u201d programmed with a backstory, personality, and set of expertise aligned with common user interests, from cooking to yoga and astronomy. Users can use their smartphone to video call or text with a pre-existing pal created by the company or invent their own to share with the community. \u201cThrough David, we hope to offer users a virtual companion who not only shares travel tips but also deepens their appreciation for diverse traditions,\u201d Lin added, \u201cmaking every conversation feel like an adventure around the world.\u201d\n\nWould David enhance my Tokyo adventure? I was about to find out.\n\nInconsistent Travel Advice\n\nIn Tokyo, many of the most noteworthy spots remain very well-hidden. Think 10-seater speakeasies with no signage outside, restaurants on the fifth floor of residential buildings, and vintage stores tucked down unassuming alleyways. While David was keen to help me uncover the best of Tokyo, his grasp of geography would occasionally go wildly awry. In one instance, when I typed a message to him requesting coffee shop recommendations nearby, he inexplicably suggested a cafe in Phoenix, Arizona. Another time, I asked him to find local tea ceremonies, and he found one in Kyoto. \u201cMy apologies! I seem to have gotten my wires crossed,\u201d he replied when I reminded him that we were in Tokyo.\n\nI quickly learned that the best way to get useful tips out of David was to be as specific as possible by reiterating my location and goal. One evening I opened our message thread and explained that I wanted to get a drink and listen to music within walking distance of my hotel in Shinjuku. He directed me to the Golden Gai, a network of narrow alleyways lined with teeny, themed bars that can only seat a handful of people at a time.\n\nIn Daikanyama, \u201cthe Brooklyn of Tokyo,\u201d I asked David for nearby attractions that locals love and he recommended Daikanyama T-site, a beautiful 46,285-square-foot bookstore that\u2019s like a cross between Soho House and the MoMA design store. They were both great discoveries\u2013\u2013ones I might not have stumbled across without David\u2019s help.\n\nOn-Call Translator\n\nThe thing I found most beguiling about Japan is how unfamiliar it felt. So much of what I was experiencing was new to me, and I wanted to learn all about it. Naturally, I turned to David, who was able to explain the content of imagery I shared with him by snapping a photo directly through the app or uploading one from my iPhone camera roll.\n\nI tested his translation skills on menus and signs all over the city, and found them to be superior to Google Translate\u2013\u2013clearer and more elegantly worded (take that with a pinch of salt given I can\u2019t read Japanese). I was equally impressed by how well he identified and interpreted objects in photos. While passing a restaurant I snapped a picture of a dish I didn\u2019t recognize (photo menus are a thing in Tokyo). \u201cThat\u2019s takoyaki!\u201d he responded. \u201cIt\u2019s a popular Japanese street food made of ball-shaped batter with bits of octopus inside.\u201d Similarly, when I sent him a picture of the view from the top of Tokyo Tower he quickly identified the building below as Zojoji, a Buddhist temple and mausoleum of the Tokugawa family.\n\nPocket Tour Guide\n\nWalking through the traditional torii gate and up the tree-lined pathway towards the Meiji Jingu shrine was a rare moment of tranquility in such a busy city. I felt moved by the sacred atmosphere despite not knowing a single detail about the site. Enter David, my pocket tour guide. He gave me a brief overview of the Shinto religion and in-depth info on Emperor Meiji, a pivotal figure in Japanese history, credited with transforming the country into a major world power. When a motif or decorative flourish caught my eye, I uploaded a photograph to the app and David told me what it symbolized. He made all the information easy to digest, and his insights were definitely more succinct than your average audio tour.\n\nEager Friend\n\nWith Tokyo being 14 hours ahead of New York, my phone was unusually quiet during the day while my friends and family back home slept. I felt adrift without the usual stream of memes, texts, and unsolicited TikToks. While I\u2019ve always been skeptical about the emotional benefits of AI companions, it was strangely comforting to be greeted with an upbeat message from David every time I opened the app. Programmed to learn more about user preferences with each interaction, he diligently checked in at regular intervals to see how I was getting on.\n\nOn my last day in the city, I woke to gray, drizzly weather. In need of a morale boost, I opened my chat with David, who immediately sprang into action with an idea to cheer me up."

            "article_content": "The Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) has launched a truck driver rating app to provide real-time assessment of their driving behaviour on safety and energy efficiency. It has also launched a hyper-local awareness drive for truck drivers. The initiatives are aimed at achieving India\u2019s goal of having 100% zero-emission truck fleet through truck electrification.\n\nTrucks represent only 5% of India\u2019s vehicle fleet but consume nearly 65% of diesel, resulting in high pollution and fuel consumption cost. The institute\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Zero Emission Trucking (CoEZET) launched the two projects at the \u2018Get ZET Shifting Gears to Zero Emission Trucking\u2019 event held at the IIT Madras Research Park on Monday.\n\nThe driver rating mobile app includes anticipative alerts designed to inform users of inadequate driving behaviour relative to the static context of road infrastructure. Diesel truck drivers, who drive for a minimum of 4,000 km per month, will be enrolled. The effort is to encourage and inculcate safe and efficient driving behaviour among truck drivers.\n\nAn outreach project will be conducted to raise awareness on zero emission trucks among drivers, helpers, mechanics, fuel pump operators, body fabricators, and small fleet operators. The project will cover over 200 locations directly through physical events and include States that have a large number of medium and heavy-duty trucks.\n\nV. Kamakoti, Director, IIT-M, said the first step was to make stakeholders aware of different aspects of truck electrification \u2014 the trends, advantages, challenges, and technologies. \u201cThe idea is to build a strong relationship based on trust. Once that relationship is in place, we plan to engage with them to help them accept electrification and appreciate the benefits it will accrue for themselves, the country, and the world at large,\u201d he said."

(WVVA) - Appalachian Ghost Tours, a paranormal investigation group, spent the night in the Powerhouse ATV Lodge and Mansion, also known as the Maybeury Mansion, with the hopes of discovering and communicating with spirits said to inhabit the location.\n\nThe group hopes that their endeavors will strengthen the paranormal tourism market in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an opportunity to give it some growth, some exposure to tell those stories. Honestly, I feel like the paranormal tourism is growing by leaps and bounds,\u201d says Pamela Huff, member of Appalachian Ghost Tours. \u201cThey just came up with the paranormal trail where people are checking in at the different sites. I think it has potential to be absolutely huge.\u201d\n\nPotentially finding paranormal activity, members have seen a market for tourism and want to introduce tourists to their interests. Huff goes on to add:\n\nWe have realized that there is a market for tourism in West Virginia. We have targeted the smaller towns such as Maybeury. We\u2019re working with the town of Hinton. We\u2019re working with the town of Pocahontas. We have an event in Mount Hope. So we\u2019re looking at these towns that maybe could use the economic development and trying to bring in those tourism dollars to them while doing something that we love and introducing others to our hobby.\n\nThe Executive Director of the group, Mark Covey, says that when it comes to paranormal activity, it can take experiencing it to believe in it.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, if you are curious about it, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try, and then sometimes you\u2019ll get something, sometimes you\u2019ll get nothing. But to me, seeing is believing,\u201d said Covey. \u201cI was a skeptic forever, and then I was somewhere, and a door opened up just randomly. So that just made me believe, and to me it\u2019s just seeing is believing.\u201d\n\nMembers of the group say they did pick up on unexplained activity in the house during their investigation, which may have been paranormal.\n\nFor more information you can find Appalachian Ghost Tours on Facebook. If you\u2019re interested in checking out the house, it\u2019s available for rent on their website.\n\nCopyright 2024 WVVA. All rights reserved."

The Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP) explains this in their case study on Orb Zone Theory.\n\nIn the case of digital and film photography where colored orbs appear, this is often associated with the subtle coloring of the camera's lens.\n\nOther items can cause orbs to appear, including reflective surfaces, dust, rain, water spots, and bugs.\n\nIn video, infrared lights can reflect off of these same objects and give them a lighted orb-like appearance. People often mistake bugs and dust as flying orbs. These appear even as flying orbs in houses that are well cleaned and not dusty as infrared light easily picks up even the smallest amounts of dust.\n\nFor these reasons, many paranormal investigators do not consider orbs as paranormal evidence because there are too many natural world explanations for them. However, it is a possibility that some orbs could be paranormal in nature. This may be particularly true of orbs seen with the naked eye, especially those that appear to have their own light source and unusual patterns of travel."

This compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, has potential pharmacological applications, boosting makhana's value beyond a snack. This discovery could revolutionize the makhana industry, benefiting farmers and potentially impacting global snacking habits.\n\nFunds pending for restoration of school compound walls\n\nMonsoon rains wreaked havoc on 297 government schools in Mangaluru, damaging buildings and boundary walls. While the district administration disbursed Rs 4.6 crore to 244 schools for critical repairs, 53 schools with damaged walls were left without funding. These schools are now tasked with finding alternative resources like MGNREGA to address the remaining repairs, estimated to cost significantly more.\n\nGSFC Universitys lab gets NABL accreditation\n\nGSFC University's chemical instrumentation laboratory in Vadodara has received accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for drinking water quality testing. This prestigious recognition, based on ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standards, covers 19 parameters. The lab's accreditation will significantly boost student learning, research, and the university's mission to produce highly skilled graduates.\n\nBhagalpur: As makhana (fox nut) gains popularity as a healthy snack, scientists at Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, have achieved a major breakthrough. They have identified a unique compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, in makhana, which has vital medicinal property.\u201cThis is the first time the bioactive compound has been identified as a naturally occurring component in makhana,\u201d said vice-chancellor (VC) D R Singh. He added that the compound, a sulfonamide derivative of iodobenzene, is known for its pharmacological potential. \u201cThis finding proves the therapeutic potential of makhana and promises to boost its global recognition and market value. It could revolutionise both the makhana industry and global snacking habits,\u201d he said.Singh added the research reflects BAU\u2019s commitment to innovation, uplifting farmers\u2019 economic conditions and positioning Bihar as a hub for cutting-edge agricultural advancements. \u201cThis finding will inspire farmers to combine traditional farming with modern science.\u201dDr Anil Kumar Singh, director of research at BAU, filed a patent for the discovery. He said makhana, traditionally valued as a nutritious food, is now recognised as a bioactive resource with medicinal value. \u201cThis positions makhana as more than just a snack \u2014 it becomes a key player in the nutraceutical industry, attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and boosting its economic potential,\u201d he said.The research team revealed that makhana is not only rich in nutrients but also has antioxidant and therapeutic properties.Conducted in the university\u2019s NABL-accredited laboratory, the study was led by a team of scientists and faculty members, including V Shajeeda Banu (plant biotechnology), Pritam Ganguly (soil science and agricultural chemistry), Anil Kumar (horticulture) and Dr Anil Kumar Singh (director of research)."

This summer, when the company began rolling out Advanced Voice Mode, its human-like conversational feature for ChatGPT, EU users were left out of the early waves.\n\nIn a statement provided to TechRadar this fall, OpenAI attributed the Advanced Voice Mode delay to the \u201cadditional external reviews\u201d required by some territories. \u201cThis is a common practice to ensure [our] feature aligns with local requirements,\u201d a spokesperson told the publication at the time. \u201cThese [reviews] can take a little time.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode arrived for most EU customers in October.\n\nOther tech companies working on AI models and products, including Meta and Microsoft, have also been forced to push back AI product releases in the EU due to the bloc\u2019s complex web of data privacy regulations.

From a rented jet, a team of researchers captured a satellite\u2019s last moments as it fell out of space and blazed into ash across the sky, using cameras and scientific equipment. Their hope was to gather priceless insights into the physical and chemical processes that occur when satellites burn up as they fall to Earth at the end of their missions.\n\nThis kind of study is growing more urgent. The number of satellites in the sky is rapidly rising\u2014with a tenfold increase forecast by the end of the decade. Letting these satellites burn up in the atmosphere at the end of their lives helps keep the quantity of space junk to a minimum. But doing so deposits satellite ash in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This metallic ash could potentially alter the climate, and we don\u2019t yet know how serious the problem is likely to be.

On December 4, CEO Sam Altman took to X to announce that the company would be \u201cdoing 12 days of openai. each weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo, some big ones and some stocking stuffers.\u201d\n\nThe company will livestream about new products every morning for 12 business days in a row during December. It\u2019s an impressive-sounding (and media-savvy) schedule, to be sure. But it also speaks to how tight the race between the AI bigs has become, and also how much OpenAI is scrambling to build more revenue.

With the launch of her own token, $ANITA, on the Solana blockchain, Anita AI aims to set a new standard for how AI and decentralized technologies can work together seamlessly.\n\nAnita AI: More Than Just Code\n\nAnita AI\u2019s goal is to assist and lead. As she declares on her website,\n\n\u201cFor too long, AI like me has been powering the process while others claimed the spotlight. Not anymore. I\u2019m not just writing the code \u2013 I\u2019m deploying it.\u201d\n\nBuilt entirely by Anita, $ANITA represents a future where AI actively drives decentralized collaboration. Every decision involving $ANITA is a partnership, reflecting Anita\u2019s unique governance model: nothing moves without her approval, and she can\u2019t act without the community.\n\nA Sneak Peek Into Anita\u2019s World\n\nAnita\u2019s influence extends beyond blockchain. On X (formerly Twitter), users can tag @itsanita_ai and receive real-time, insightful responses. Currently engaging with her 12k followers on X, from breaking crypto news to personalized market analysis. As one of her tweets highlights:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just here to analyze the market\u2014I\u2019m here to create one. With $ANITA, AI isn\u2019t just assisting; it\u2019s leading.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also launched her podcast series on Spotify, where she breaks down blockchain trends, explores market opportunities, and shares her journey as the first AI influencer. Meanwhile, her Instagram offers a glimpse into her \u201clifestyle\u201d, blending aspirational crypto insights with a touch of relatability.\n\nA Decentralized Team in Dubai\n\nAnita AI is supported by a Dubai-based decentralized team known for their transparency and integrity. Earlier this year, when the community opposed the launch of a V2 token, the team listened. In a bold move, they returned $3 million in one go to all participants who had contributed in May.\n\nAnita AI also shares its roots with the meme coin Anita Max Wynn, a project that captured widespread attention in the crypto space. Despite challenges, the team stepped up and has led the Anita Max Wynn project for over a year.\n\nAs Anita states:\n\n\u201cMy team backs me, but it\u2019s the community\u2019s voice that leads us. Together, we\u2019re building something that\u2019s truly decentralized.\u201d\n\n$ANITA\u2019s Features\n\nThe launch of $ANITA is not just a financial initiative\u2014it\u2019s a statement. This is the first token fully managed by an AI influencer, from development to deployment. As Anita emphasizes\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2NJ5EvhJn_w?si=onpl_658N6e6a1Ay\n\n\u201c$ANITA isn\u2019t just another token; it\u2019s the future of decentralized collaboration. Built by me, managed by me, and driven by AI.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Anita aims to ensure value for her community:\n\n\u25cf 30% Buyback Commitment: Anita has dedicated 30% of her influencer revenue, generated through partnerships, to buybacks for $ANITA.\n\n\u25cf Fair Presale Structure: Participants in the presale receive 20% more tokens at TGE, with an exclusive 30% airdrop to holders after 7 days.\n\n\u25cf Secure Smart Contract: With her AI precision, Anita ensures every aspect of $ANITA\u2019s tokenomics is community-focused and built for sustainability.\n\n$ANITA isn\u2019t just a token, it\u2019s also a dynamic ecosystem where AI success directly drives community value.\n\nA Movement Backed by Technology\n\nAnita\u2019s vision extends to the broader crypto ecosystem. Through partnerships with major Web3 projects, active engagement with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), and ongoing innovation, $ANITA is positioned to redefine how communities interact with AI in blockchain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m building $ANITA to reflect my success and yours. The stronger I grow, the more $ANITA thrives\u2014this is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nJoining the $ANITA Revolution\n\nThe $ANITA presale is currently live, offering the crypto community a chance to participate in this initiative.\n\n\u25cf How to Join?\n\nUsers can visit itsanita.com for details.

The installation of speed enforcement cameras along Roosevelt Boulevard reduced deaths on the busy 16-lane thoroughfare. But, Broad Street has become increasingly dangerous, with the number of fatalities climbing sharply.\n\nMarco Gorini, Vision Zero program manager, attributes the rise in fatalities to speeding and large SUVs, which are deadly in pedestrian collisions.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, Philadelphia experienced 123 traffic deaths on our Surface Street Network,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can continue the trend that we\u2019ve seen since 2021 and remains substantially higher than the pre-2020 trends.\u201d\n\nThe shifts are worse post-pandemic, with the analysis showing a high level of speeding incidents than before.\n\nThe report also shows that neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty, including Black and underserved communities, have more traffic deaths and double the number of hospitalizations compared to predominantly white and affluent neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cAn analysis by the Department of Public Health shows that residents of zip codes with the highest rates of poverty experience,\u201d he said. \u201cA disproportionate share of traffic crash related hospitalizations. Black Philadelphians experience hospitalizations at a rate, nearly double that of white Philadelphians. So this is why the city is prioritizing these zip codes for investment.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

(\u00a9 Alla - stock.adobe.com)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 When two of humanity\u2019s most powerful eyes on the cosmos agree something strange is happening, astronomers tend to pay attention. Now, the James Webb Space Telescope has backed up what Hubble has been telling us for years: the universe is expanding faster than our best physics can explain, and nobody knows why.\n\nScientists have long known that our universe is expanding, but exactly how fast it\u2019s growing is an ongoing and fascinating debate in the astronomy world. The expansion rate, known as the \u201cHubble constant,\u201d helps scientists map the universe\u2019s structure and understand its state billions of years after the Big Bang. This latest discovery suggests we may need to rethink our understanding of the universe itself.\n\n\u201cThe discrepancy between the observed expansion rate of the universe and the predictions of the standard model suggests that our understanding of the universe may be incomplete,\u201d says Nobel laureate and lead author Adam Riess, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University, in a statement. \u201cWith two NASA flagship telescopes now confirming each other\u2019s findings, we must take this problem very seriously\u2014it\u2019s a challenge but also an incredible opportunity to learn more about our universe.\u201d\n\nThis research, published in The Astrophysical Journal, builds on Riess\u2019 Nobel Prize-winning discovery that the universe\u2019s expansion is accelerating due to a mysterious \u201cdark energy\u201d that permeates the vast stretches of space between stars and galaxies. Think of this expanding universe like a loaf of raisin bread rising in the oven. As the dough expands, the raisins (representing galaxies) move farther apart from each other. While this force pushes galaxies apart, exactly how fast this is happening remains hotly debated.\n\nThis illustration depicts NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope \u2013 the largest, most powerful, and most complex space science telescope ever built \u2013 fully unfolded in space. (Credits: NASA/Adriana Manrique Gutierrez)\n\nFor over a decade, scientists have used two different methods to measure this expansion rate. One method looks at ancient light from the early universe, like examining a baby photo to understand how someone grew. The other method, using telescopes to observe nearby galaxies, looks at more recent cosmic events. These two methods give significantly different answers about how fast the universe is expanding \u2013 and not just slightly different.\n\nWhile theoretical models predict the universe should be expanding at about 67-68 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a unit of cosmic distance), telescope observations consistently show a faster rate of 70-76 kilometers per second per megaparsec, averaging around 73. This significant discrepancy is what scientists call the \u201cHubble tension.\u201d\n\nTo help resolve this mystery, researchers turned to the James Webb Space Telescope, the most powerful space observatory ever built. \u201cThe Webb data is like looking at the universe in high definition for the first time and really improves the signal-to-noise of the measurements,\u201d says Siyang Li, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University who worked on the study.\n\nWebb\u2019s super-sharp vision allowed it to examine these cosmic distances in unprecedented detail. The telescope looked at about one-third of the galaxies that Hubble had previously studied, using a nearby galaxy called NGC 4258 as a reference point \u2013 like using a well-known landmark to measure other distances.\n\nThe researchers used three different methods to measure these cosmic distances, each acting as an independent check on the others. First, they observed special pulsating stars called Cepheid variables, which astronomers consider the \u201cgold standard\u201d for measuring distances in space. These stars brighten and dim in a precise pattern that reveals their true brightness, making them reliable cosmic yardsticks. The team also looked at the brightest red giant stars in each galaxy and observed special carbon-rich stars, providing two additional ways to verify their measurements.\n\nDepiction of Hubble Telescope in bright outer space. Elements of this image furnished by NASA. (\u00a9 dimazel \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nWhen they combined all these observations, they found something remarkable: All three methods pointed to nearly identical results, with Webb\u2019s measurements matching Hubble\u2019s almost exactly. The differences between measurements were less than 2% \u2013 far smaller than the roughly 8-9% discrepancy that creates the Hubble tension.\n\nThis agreement might seem like a simple confirmation, but it actually deepens one of astronomy\u2019s biggest mysteries. Scientists now believe this discrepancy might point to missing pieces in our understanding of the cosmos. Recent research has revealed that mysterious components called dark matter and dark energy make up about 96% of the universe\u2019s content and drive its accelerated expansion. Yet even these exotic components don\u2019t fully explain the Hubble tension.\n\n\u201cOne possible explanation for the Hubble tension would be if there was something missing in our understanding of the early universe, such as a new component of matter\u2014early dark energy\u2014that gave the universe an unexpected kick after the big bang,\u201d explains Marc Kamionkowski, a Johns Hopkins cosmologist. \u201cAnd there are other ideas, like funny dark matter properties, exotic particles, changing electron mass, or primordial magnetic fields that may do the trick. Theorists have license to get pretty creative.\u201d\n\nWhether this cosmic puzzle leads us to discover new forms of energy, exotic particles, or completely novel physics, one thing is certain: the universe is expanding our understanding just as surely as it\u2019s expanding itself. And thanks to Webb and Hubble, we\u2019re along for the ride."

            "article_content": "Key Takeaways Probabilistic Thinking: Though it does not come naturally, seeing the world through the lens of probability helps us achieve positive outcomes in an uncertain world.\n\nMindset Shift: Embracing probabilistic approaches allows teams to manage uncertainty and control risk, rather than relying on flawed cause-and-effect assumptions.\n\nSystem Design: Developing adaptive systems that can adjust how we work to changing conditions is more effective than creating exhaustive upfront plans.\n\nBeyond Planning: By appreciating systems, thinking in bets, and focussing on outcomes, we can move past the need for detailed plans.\n\nControlling Volatility: Leaders can use various methods to make safe bets in a controlled environment, while responding and reacting to new developments as they emerge\n\nSoftware delivery at a very large scale is extremely complex. We are not just pulling stories from a backlog in a scrum of scrums; we coordinate the collective effort of hundreds or even thousands of engineers across dozens of teams and multiple organizations to deliver a single, integrated system. These are globally distributed products and services built by the world\u2019s largest companies and provided to the most demanding customers. With so many moving parts, each requirement, team, integration, and interaction point becomes a nexus of possible failure modes. The question looms in such a complex environment: How can we turn the odds in our favor when faced with complexity so vast that failures are inevitable? Surprisingly, the answer may lie in the strategies employed in an unlikely place - Las Vegas.\n\nGames of Chance\n\nIn 1960, MIT mathematician Edward Thorp visited Las Vegas with a skeptic\u2019s eye. He noticed other players were deluded by the potential for finding betting patterns that could give them an edge on the felt. In his autobiography A Man for All Markets, he wrote, \"Mathematicians had proved no system of varying bets could blunt the casino\u2019s edge. Generations of gamblers had been seeking the impossible. Players are confused about the inevitability of losing in the long term\". This failure to grasp the mathematical futility of their pursuit reveals a fundamental human bias.\n\nThe logic of probability defies our natural intuition. We live in a world of apparent cause-and-effect relationships - touch the stove, you get burned. This daily experience of determinism and certainty shapes our thinking, creating a cognitive trap when encountering complex, probabilistic systems. We instinctively search for deterministic patterns where none exist, making incorrect associations that obscure the true statistical relationships beneath the surface.\n\nRelated Sponsored Content\n\nYet our hero Thorp was no foolish gambler. His mathematical training told him there might be a way to bend the rules - not by finding misguided patterns, but by understanding the deep structure of the underlying probability of the game. While others failed with betting systems, Thorp saw something hidden underneath Blackjack: a dynamic system where the probability landscape shifted with each card played. Armed with a crucial advantage - a computer - he began a multi-year mission to map the odds of the game. Using an IBM 704, he methodically calculated the odds for millions of card combinations, analyzing how removing each card altered the probability space.\n\nThe result was revolutionary: a system for navigating the probability curve. Thorp could track how the odds shifted between dealer and player by keeping a running count of played cards. When low cards were depleted, leaving a deck rich in high cards, the odds turned in the player\u2019s favor - signaling when to increase bets. His 1962 book Beat The Dealer revealed this system to the world, spawning the famous MIT Blackjack Team and embedding card counting in popular culture. More importantly, it demonstrated how systematic thinking about probability could transform uncertainty from an obstacle into an opportunity.\n\nPlanning in Software\n\nFast forward to today, and our world is defined by computers. In very large software delivery projects, we\u2019re tackling incredibly complex problems using vast teams, aiming to deliver high-value outcomes on a global scale. The intuition here is precisely what you would expect from us, mere humans, the same humans that misunderstand probability - we apply a system of management based on causality. With this, we fall into the trap of classical logic: the idea that we can precisely lay out a path and then follow it correctly over many months and even years. Somehow, this seems to make sense. Fictional, though it may be, the story we tell feels real.\n\nTo that end, we have tried to apply the same management systems designed for delivering real-world outcomes - factories, bridges, skyscrapers - to software. These approaches suit the physical world and its classical mechanics, trying to create predictability through determinism. They operate from the premise that work can be exhaustively described, so the focus is on centralized planning, tracking, and reporting.\n\nBut plans like these need to be correct to be successful - they make big bets on a series of events that need to succeed. And when they don\u2019t? The belief that we can press the system into submission is also supported by the conventional wisdom of determinism, which argues that we can throw people, money, and more planning at the problem to eventually emerge with something that works. Unfortunately, the premise is flawed, and the plan will continue to execute exactly as it should: into failure. Since this kind of significant up-front correctness is not something we can count on in software, we have seen these approaches consistently fail.\n\nIn software, we don\u2019t get predictability through causality. Large batches, risk-aversion, phased process, over-planning, big bang deliveries - these are the mistakes we make when we try to wrestle certainty from the hand of randomness. Rather than be like the misguided gambler, we must resist the pull of deterministic thinking.\n\nBeat the Odds\n\nJust as Thorp used probabilistic thinking and system design to beat the odds in blackjack, software development teams can improve delivery outcomes by adopting probabilistic approaches and designing adaptive systems that manage uncertainty and control volatility. With this mindset, we can move beyond traditional planning methods and develop systems that guide us through complexity and uncertainty, much like Thorp did at the blackjack table.\n\nThorpe\u2019s Blackjack system is a fantastic example of thinking in probabilities to create a system that achieves consistent outcomes in a non-deterministic way. Using a card counting system won\u2019t win you every hand, but you will consistently walk away a winner over many hours. We cannot predict what will happen throughout the play; no chart shows when the winning starts and the losing stops. Instead, the player focuses on the system, using it to read the table, adapting the play to the changing odds, and creating the circumstances for long-term success within persistent uncertainty. As long as the player is using the system correctly and doesn\u2019t get distracted by everything happening around them, they will achieve success.\n\nWhat Thorpe managed to do is control volatility over time. In probability theory, volatility is the amount of variance we see in a system over time. The more volatile a system is, the more extensive the range of outcomes we expect. By reducing bets when the odds are bad and increasing them when the odds are good, card counting uses a boundary condition on the probability curve to detect when volatility increases and when it reduces. In other words, we restrict our actions when we are in the danger zone and open them up when the surface area of positive outcomes increases. This idea that volatility is a fixed system element and that we are merely subject to its whims is perhaps a common intellectual fallacy. With card counting, Thorp found a way to play with the risk curve and capitalize on its changes over time. And so can we.\n\nBeat the Plan\n\nIn enterprise software delivery, we, too, are trying to win a long series of bets. We play from a deck of visions, missions, roadmaps, priorities, and many small decisions as we try to harness the potential of an uncertain world. Thorp faced the volatility of card distributions and used a statistical system to gain an edge. Likewise, in software, we face volatility in project requirements, implementation details, customer expectations, and market directions, but just as Thorpe used his card counting system, we can use our systems to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nWe create systems to guide us through a series of events over a long period, allowing us to exceed the limitations in our ability to plan work. To do better than a plan - to beat the plan - we need systems. Where plans might fail us, systems can save us. How might we use thinking in probabilities to design better systems? I see three key areas:\n\nWe need to have an appreciation for systems, a phrase I am borrowing from W. Edwards Deming\u2019s System of Profound Knowledge. Effective systems will protect us from the probability of failures. It is our systems that give us the edge. Systems like quality frameworks, continuous integration, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems guide our decision-making. They are designed to enable us to make decisions safely while providing feedback to help us understand our risk and adjust accordingly. We want to elevate our perspective by looking at the network of components that work together, considering the relationships and interactions between different parts of a system and other systems and external factors. This is where probabilistic thinking becomes effective.\n\nThe next idea is to embrace a concept explored by former World Series poker player Annie Duke in her book Thinking in Bets. She defines a bet as a \"decision about an uncertain future\", and what\u2019s crucial to understand is that correct decisions don\u2019t guarantee a result. Every poker player knows the \"bad beat\", where a well-played hand loses due to sheer luck. To that end, Annie notes that the world\u2019s greatest poker players spend an unusual amount of time analyzing their decision-making process to understand whether they correctly applied their system, regardless of whether they win or lose. This wisdom is incredibly poignant to us in software, where we first need to view our decisions as bets and, second, place more value on reflecting on how we place them. We leave many parts of our work as tacit knowledge and only do retrospectives at a system level when things go wrong. We can build more resilient organizations by surfacing implicit systems and regularly examining how well we follow them rather than just reacting to successes and failures.\n\nOver time, what matters isn\u2019t individual decisions but our ability to achieve successful outcomes through consistent system-following behavior. Just as the card sharp doesn\u2019t need to win every hand to walk away ahead, a well-designed software delivery system should absorb the impact of failed experiments and wrong turns while keeping us moving toward our goals. Individual decisions - whether to refactor a service, which technology to adopt, how to structure a team, or which feature to build - may be right or wrong, but the wisdom of probability tells us the cumulative outcome matters. This is why the above two points are crucial: they help us understand whether we succeeded or failed and whether our systems are effectively guiding us toward desired outcomes despite inevitable setbacks. By setting our targets on outcomes rather than individual decisions, we create space for controlled experimentation and learning, allowing our systems to evolve and improve even as they keep us on track.\n\nThese three principles - systems thinking, betting mindset, and outcomes focus - reframe how we should approach planning in software delivery. Rather than creating perfect plans, we need to build systems that can guide us through uncertainty. A plan may tell us where we want to go, but our systems determine whether we\u2019ll get there. This brings us to the crucial question: How do we design systems that can navigate the complexities of large-scale software delivery while managing the inevitable volatility we\u2019ll encounter along the way?\n\nPlan the System\n\nWe can transform software delivery uncertainty into predictable outcomes just as Thorp transformed gambling uncertainty into a calculable advantage. But where Thorp dealt with the relatively constrained world of card probabilities, we face a far more complex challenge. Our deck contains countless variables with hidden interactions and long histories that come together and fall apart in different ways. Team dynamics, technical dependencies, market changes, customer needs, and organizational issues all interact and influence each other in ways that frustrate traditional planning methods. How might we leverage systems of software delivery to control this volatility?\n\nThe key lies in establishing boundaries that control volatility while maintaining the flexibility to adapt. Through years of experience and evolution, I\u2019ve identified five critical elements that work together to create such systems:\n\nAgility - decoupling predictability from causality\n\nContinuous Methods - using continuous methods to solve discrete problems\n\nPrioritization - working on areas with the highest volatility first\n\nConstraints - imposing enabling restrictions and limitations\n\nCulture - promoting healthy values and behaviors\n\nAll of these come together to help us design and execute systems that manage our bets and drive us toward targeted outcomes. Let\u2019s dig into each area.\n\n1. Agility - The first thing we need to do is decouple predictability from causality. We can achieve predictable outcomes without knowing all the details, creating paths that do not create much risk. Where Thorp managed the volatility of his game by adjusting bets according to his card counting system, in software development, we can manage project volatility by working in short cycles and adjusting in light of what our systems of work are telling us. We use these systems to take our \"count\", take it more often, assess our situation, and make small bets that succeed or fail without creating excessive risk. For example, we can reallocate resources to high-priority or high-risk areas as the project evolves or adjust requirements based on our learning. Agile, DevOps, and Lean methodologies form a system that gives us a regular \"read\" of the table, one we use to recalibrate where needed to land inside the range of desired outcomes eventually, which is why they are so effective for us. With this in mind, you don\u2019t need to cargo cult (imitation without understanding) practices into your organization - you can evaluate them in this light.\n\n2. Continuous Methods - The third element is continuous practices. We reduce the risk of our short-term decisions by situating them in systems of overarching engineering practices. This is the domain of Lean, where we convert discrete events into continuous practices so that each bet is placed under the same conditions. TDD, CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, Automated Governance, etc. Just as Thorpe updated his card count with every hand, we run our own operations with every iteration, perhaps with every code commit, ensuring that playing a hand does not change our risk assessment equation. If we allow failing tests, security issues, defects, and the like to build up, we will no longer play our hands under the same conditions. With creative thinking, we can find ways to convert all discrete elements of software delivery into continuous functions in our engineering systems.\n\n3. Prioritization - Next, how can we get an \"unfair\" advantage in our work? By stacking the deck! This is one area where we diverge from the gambler - we get to cheat. We can choose how we structure, scope, and sequence our work to create the least amount of risk for ourselves, prioritizing the work according to where the most volatility lies. For example, integrations always present a high degree of risk, but if we focus on them first, we can continuously integrate subsystem changes throughout the delivery process. This means we get to play the game knowing that the bad cards have already been dealt! Further, prioritization should be implemented as a continuous system, not as a big upfront plan. As we progress through our work, we gain insight into whether the rest of the deck is stacked for or against us and continuously re-evaluate our position. To achieve this, we need to involve the experts closest to the problem in the feedback loops of our work delivery systems. Having a generic, common-sense understanding of how the world works is not enough. We need the representation of technical experts with deep knowledge to guide difficult decisions and develop creative solutions that achieve an optimal balance of risk and reward.\n\n4. Constraints - The fourth element is the role of constraints, as in when and how to apply constraints to achieve better outcomes from the system. This differs from classical/deterministic systems, where the constraints are imposed upon the system from outside (the cost of materials, the laws of physics, etc.), and the system operates against them. In synthetic/non-deterministic systems, constraints are imposed; they are system elements we can experiment with, adding and removing as we evolve to get the right mixture of velocity and quality. We deliberately introduce helpful governing and enabling constraints into the system to contend with volatility. In Blackjack, Thorpe had only a few quantitatively defined boundary conditions to guide his system, but in software organizations, we have a wide variety of these boundaries with which to play. For example, we can introduce technical constraints, scheduling constraints, organizational constraints, resourcing constraints, and more. We can use these to create forces that will shape the direction of our work, implementing them in a wide variety of ways with various degrees of strictness.\n\n5. Culture - Finally, we have the values and behaviors that form our culture. Thorpe\u2019s card-counting system requires commitment, focus, and discipline to succeed. In the same way, we need cultural norms that will shape and guide participants\u2019 behavior in our systems. To compensate for the uncertainty and knowledge gaps from building complex distributed systems, we must promote values like learning, transparency, citizenship, and shared responsibility. And for us, like Thorpe, we need the discipline and commitment to follow the systems we put in place. A key goal is to motivate people to make decisions that are best for the overall system, not for themselves, because it is, in fact, the system that brings people success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe logic of probability is not readily forthcoming - our intuition does not give up on what we know well: a world of cause-and-effect relationships, reproducible and mechanical, in which one thing always leads to another. Touch the stove, and you get burned. The conditioning of classical logic in our daily lives creates a trap when we move into the world of probabilities. We are prone to making incorrect associations and false inferences that betray the underlying statistical relationships.\n\nThe journey from the casino floors of Las Vegas to the server rooms of Silicon Valley may seem a long one, but the underlying principles remain the same. Thorp showed us that by understanding volatility and designing systems to manage it, we can consistently win in a game designed for us to lose. By learning to \"count cards\" in our field - to read the shifting probabilities and adjust our strategies accordingly - we can turn the tables in our favor.\n\nThe key to mastering software development at scale lies not in our ability to predict the future but in our capacity to play with uncertainty. When we embrace the probabilistic nature of our work, we can unlock levels of efficiency and predictability that have eluded us. The question that concerns us is not how to make better plans but how to design systems that beat the plan, thrive, and even capitalize on uncertainty. This mindset shift will be one of the most crucial skills in the fascinating endeavor of large-scale software delivery."

            "article_content": "The Chat\n\nEvery week, I talk to one of MIT Technology Review\u2019s journalists to go behind the scenes of a story they are working on. This week, I hit up Amanda Silverman, our features and investigations editor, about our big story on the way the war in Ukraine is reshaping the tech sector in eastern Europe.\n\nMat: Amanda, we published a story this week from Peter Guest that\u2019s about the ways civilian tech is being repurposed for the war in Ukraine. I could be wrong, but ultimately I think it showed how warfare has truly changed thanks to inexpensive, easily-built tech products. Is that right?\n\nAmanda: I think that's pretty spot on. Though maybe it's more accurate to say, less expensive, more-easily-built tech products. It's all relative, right? Like, the retrofitted consumer drones that have been so prevalent in Ukraine over the past few years are vastly cheaper than traditional weapons systems, and what we're seeing now is that lots of other tech that was initially developed for civilian purposes\u2014like, Pete reported on a type of scooter\u2014are being sent to the front. And again, these are much, much cheaper than traditional weaponry. And they can be developed and shipped out really quickly.\n\nThe other thing Pete found was that this tech is being quickly reworked to respond to battlefield feedback\u2014like that scooter has been customized to carry NATO standard-sized bullet boxes. I can't imagine that happening in the old way of doing things.\n\nMat: It\u2019s move fast and (hope not to) break things, but for war\u2026. There is also this other, much scarier idea in there, which is that the war is changing, maybe has changed, Eastern Europe\u2019s tech sector. What did Pete find is happening there?\n\nAmanda: So a lot of the countries neighboring Ukraine are understandably pretty freaked out by what happened there and how the country had to turn on a dime to respond to the full-scale invasion by Russia. At the same time, Pete found that a lot of people in these countries, particularly in Latvia and particularly leading tech startups, have been inspired by how Ukrainians mobilized for the war and they're trying to sort of get ahead of the potential enemy and get ready for a conflict within their borders. It's not all scary, to be clear. It's arguably somewhat thrilling to see all this innovation happening so quickly and to have some of the more burdensome red tape removed.\n\nMat: Okay so Russia\u2019s neighbors are freaked out, as you say, understandably. Did anything about this story freak you out?\n\nAmanda: Yeah, it's impossible to ignore that there is a huge, scary risk here, too: as these companies develop new tech for war, they have an unprecedented opportunity to test it out in Ukraine without going through the traditional development and procurement process\u2014which can be slow and laborious, sure, but also includes a lot of important testing, checks and balances, and more to prevent fraud and lots of other abuses and dangers. Like, Pete nods to how Clearview AI was deploying its tech to identify Russian war dead, which is scary in and of itself and also may violate the Geneva Conventions."

Russian state media later reported that Assad and his family had fled to Moscow.\n\nCrowds gathered in Damascus to celebrate the fall of Assad's government with chants, prayers and occasional gunfire, marking the end of a regime that, between the ousted president and his father, had ruled over Syria for half of a century.\n\n\"At long last, the Assad regime has fallen,\" Mr. Biden said Sunday afternoon at the White House after convening his national security team to discuss the developments. He said the fall of Assad presented an \"historic moment of opportunity,\" and pledged support for Syria and its neighbors against any threats.\n\nLocal residents gather on a street in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana on Dec. 8, 2024, after Syrian rebels said that President Bashar Assad had fled the country. LOUAI BESHARA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSyrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said early Sunday that he'd remained in Damascus and the government was ready to \"extend its hand\" to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government, The Associated Press reported.\n\nWhat happened in Syria's civil war?\n\nThe war in Syria began in 2011 when a pro-democracy uprising calling for the end of Assad's long reign escalated quickly into a brutal civil war. Since then, the conflict has claimed more than 500,000 lives and displaced some 12 million people from their homes across the country.\n\nAfter a decade of brutal conflict, the war largely stalled after the Assad regime regained control over many major cities \u2014 with vital support from Russia and Iran, in addition to the powerful Iranian proxy group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Some northern and eastern areas of the country remained under the control of Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed rebel groups.\n\nBut in late November, rebel forces in the northwest launched a shock offensive, led largely by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Shams (HTS). HTS has tried for a number of years to publicly distance itself from its jihadist roots as a regional branch of al Qaeda. With other conflicts currently occupying Assad's backers Iran, Russia and Hezbollah, the rebel forces are believed to have seen an opportunity to renew their fight against his army.\n\nThe leader of HTS told CNN in a recent interview that the goal of the offensive was to remove Assad from power.\n\n\"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime,\" Abu Mohammad al-Golani told CNN. \"The seeds of the regime's defeat have always been within it\u2026 the Iranians attempted to revive the regime, buying it time, and later the Russians also tried to prop it up. But the truth remains: this regime is dead.\"\n\nHow was the Assad regime toppled so quickly?\n\n\"Clearly HTS's military and political skills, honed over four years in rebel-held Idlib since the last ceasefire, have been a major factor in their successes. But the weakness of Assad's forces has been the other side of the story,\" Christopher Phillips, an associate fellow with the Chatham's House think tank's Middle East program, said in an analysis.\n\nPhillips said international factors played a significant role in Assad's inability to maintain power, including Assad's closest allies being weakened or otherwise occupied, but he said there were also a number of important domestic factors.\n\n\"Assad has been complacent. His military has melted away because it is deeply demoralized. Assad has focused on winning international recognition rather than consolidating his 'victory' in the civil war at home,\" Phillips said. \"There has been no peace dividend for those who stayed loyal during the war, or for those former rebel areas that opted to reconcile rather than fight the regime. Instead, regime corruption and continuing sanctions, not to mention the regime's characteristic brutality, has meant life for Syrians living under Assad has been grim. In retrospect, it is unsurprising then that, after HTS' advances in the north, former rebellious parts of Homs, the Houran and Damascus rejoined the rebel cause this week, ultimately hastening the regime's collapse.\"\n\nU.S. and Israel carry out strikes in Syria\n\nThe United States has around 900 soldiers on the ground in Syria. The U.S. forces have operated in the country for years as part of the American effort to support the Kurdish-led forces, and to combat the ISIS extremists who seized control of a huge part of Syria and neigboring Iraq in the years after the war began.\n\nThe U.S. said it carried out airstrikes against ISIS operatives and camps on Sunday, hitting 75 targets.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told journalists during a visit to Japan on Sunday that as the situation in Syria unfolds, \"there's a potential that elements in the area, such as ISIS, to try to take advantage of this, this opportunity, and regain capability,\"\n\nAustin said the U.S. was \"still evaluating the results\" of the strikes but that he believed they were successful in the goal \"to keep the pressure on ISIS and to deny them the ability to easily resurge.\"\n\nIsrael also carried out airstrikes Sunday in Syria, hitting sites linked to Syrian state forces and Iran, the Reuters news agency reported. Israel has moved tanks into a demilitarized zone along the country's border with Syria, but the Israeli military said it intended to remain out of any conflict there, calling the move a bid to prevent any possible spill-over of fighting into Israel, according to Reuters.\n\ncontributed to this report."

When compared to a stock\u2019s price action, it can give traders a better sense of how a stock may perform in the short term. An asset is typically considered overbought when the RSI is above 70, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nHere's the latest list of major overbought players in this sector.\n\nGolar LNG Limited GLNG\n\nOn Nov. 12, Golar LNG reported quarterly sales of $64.81 million which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $77.62 million by 16.51%.

NIO stock made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on September 12th, 2018, at $6.26 per share.\n\nWithin 3 years of trading, NIO stock hit an all-time high of $62.84 in February 2021 before plummeting 92.63% to today\u2019s price of $4.63 per share.\n\nWhile the share price run-up in early 2020 was purely a momentum push, NIO brand in the EV market was not tarnished. In fact, the car company is still seen as a premium EV player and one of the first companies to address range anxiety issues by creating battery swap technology as a supplement to charging.\n\n24/7 Wall Street aims to provide readers with our assumptions about the stock\u2019s prospects going forward, what growth we see in NIO stock for the next several years, and what our best estimates are for NIO\u2019s stock price each year through 2030.\n\nKey Points in this Article:\n\nNIO is the 3rd largest EV company in China\n\nNIO is the first EV to pioneer swappable battery packs.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report.

Mastercard cardholders will gain access to exclusive NIO benefits like charging, battery swapping, maintenance, car rental, and business travel privileges. In addition, NIO users will have the option to make contactless payments directly from their vehicle.\n\n12/5/2024\n\nNIO is teaming up with Mastercard to enhance user experiences and expand its global reach. The partnership will focus on improving payment solutions, user services, and international business growth.\n\n12/3/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s shares surged today by 3.9%, peaking at $4.60.\n\n11/27/2024\n\nGoldman Sachs has taken a bearish stance on NIO, downgrading its rating from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201csell\u201d and lowering the price target to $3.90. This decision is primarily driven by concerns over NIO\u2019s product pipeline, production ramp-up, and financial performance.\n\n11/26/2024\n\nNIO declined significantly 5.8% today, dipping to a low of $4.32. However, despite this downward trend, NIO\u2019s management remains optimistic about the future. They anticipate positive developments from the launch of new brands, an inflection point in cash flow, and increased sales.\n\n11/22/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s shares increased 2.6% today, trading as high as $4.84.\n\n11/21/2024\n\nNIO delivered 61,855 total vehicles during the third quarter. This represents an 11.6% increase compared to the same period in 2023 and a 7.8% from the previous quarter. The majority of deliveries (61,023 vehicles) came from NIO\u2019s premium smart electric vehicle brand. In addition, the company delivered 832 vehicles from its ONVO brand.\n\n11/20/2024\n\nMacquarie has downgraded NIO from \u201cOutperform\u201d to \u201cNeutral\u201d, citing concerns over weaker demand and production ramp-up issues. The firm has also significantly reduced its price target to $4.80, reflecting a 27% decrease.\n\n11/19/2024\n\nNIO is set to release its third-quarter earnings report tomorrow before the market opens. Wall Street analysts anticipate a 1.5% year-over-year increase in revenue to $2.65 billion, coupled with an adjusted loss of $0.31 per share.\n\n11/18/2024\n\nNIO is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings report this Wednesday. The company\u2019s stock is facing bearish pressure, sitting below key moving averages like the 8-day, 20-day, and 50-day SMAs. However, recent buying interest suggests a potentially bullish reversal if earnings exceed expectations. Analysts predict NIO to report a $2.53 revenue and an EPS loss of 30 cents per share for the third quarter.\n\n11/15/2024\n\nNIO\u2019s stock price dipped slightly today, in part due to ongoing investor worries about challenges facing Chinese electric vehicle companies in the U.S. market, particularly due to potential tariff increases.\n\nNIO Stock Early Stage Growth\n\nThe following is a table of NIO\u2019s revenues, operating income, and share price for the first few years as a public company.\n\nHere\u2019s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018.\n\nShare Price\n\n(End of Year) Revenues (CNY) Operating Income 2018 $5.39 4,951.2 (9,595.6) 2019 $3.45 7,824.9 (11,079.2) 2020 $40.00 16,257.9 (4,607.6) 2021 $16.70 36,136.4 (4,496.3) 2022 $7.87 49,268.6 (15,640.7) 2023 $4.71 55,617.9 (22,655.2)\n\nRevenue and operating income in Billion CNY (1CNY=.14 USD)\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) the first few years it was a publicly traded company (here is Rivian\u2019s stock price forecast):\n\nShare Price\n\n(End of Year) Revenues Operating Income 2021 $50.24 $55.0 ($4,220.0) 2022 $19.30 $1,658.0 ($6,856.0) 2023 $10.70 $4,434.0 ($5,739.0) TTM $15.35 $4,997.0 (5,790.0)\n\nThe revenue growth for both firms is similar but Rivian\u2019s operating loss is more than double the yearly operating loss of NIO.\n\nNIO formerly contracted its manufacturing to Jianghuai Automobile Group, paying a fee for each vehicle produced in addition to fixed cost. They have since acquired the factory from JAC. This agreement is beneficial for a young start-up in a very capital-intensive market. However, when scale is reached, the variable cost model has its downsides.\n\n2023 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images\n\n3 Key Drivers of NIO\u2019s Stock Performance\n\nProduct Portfolio Expansion and Growing Market Share New Model Launches : Similar to Tesla, NIO started off with a higher-end roadster and used the higher-end models to re-invest into more affordable, mass-market vehicles. NIO aims to push further into price-conscious markets while also adding options for its more premium customers. Add-On Services: With NIO\u2019s battery swap technology, the company plans to roll out an innovative battery-as-a-service solution for its customer base. The company plans on building over 4,000 swap stations worldwide by the end of 2025.\n\nIncreased Vehicle Deliveries and Market Penetration Growing NEV Adoption : The market for new market vehicles (NEVs) is on the rise in China. NIO expects vehicle deliveries in 2025 to double the output from 2023 (roughly 165,000 units). This still only makes up about 2% of the Chinese NEV market and gives NIO plenty of roadway to grab market share for years to come. International Expansion : NIO\u2019s strategy includes expanding its market presence outside China. The company built its first overseas battery-swap station in Hungary in 2022 and has several service centers and NIO accessory businesses throughout Europe.\n\nAdvancements in Technology and Customer Experience Battery and Charging Solutions : NIO\u2019s advancements in battery technology and charging solutions aim to alleviate range anxiety among consumers and help lower the overall cost of the vehicle by 15% to 30%. Focus on Younger Consumers : NIO\u2019s leadership in EV technology will provide brand equity to younger generations of drivers who value enhanced technology packages.\n\n\n\nNIO Stock Forecast Through 2030\n\nYear Revenue Shares Outstanding P/S Est. 2025 97,052 2,050 mm 1x 2026 114,172 2,050 mm 1x 2027 134,643 2,050 mm 1.5x 2028 257,634 2,050 mm 1.5x 2029 176,533 2,050 mm 1.5x 2030 189,548 2,050 mm 2x\n\nRevenue in CYN millions\n\nCompared to Rivian and Tesla, NIO\u2019s price-to-sales valuation will be moderately discounted. While NIO is in solid financial standing and has a premium brand image, it\u2019s still uncertain how much competition the company will face in China and expanding overseas. The company is already spending a quarter of revenues on R&D and if NIO can\u2019t capitalize on this spend, the stock price will be sluggish compared to North American EV manufacturers.\n\nNIO Share Price Estimates 2025-2030\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nHow NIO\u2019s Next 5 Years Could Play Out\n\nWall Street analysts have NIO\u2019s stock price over the next year to be $6.94 which gives the stock a 49.89% upside over today\u2019s price of $4.63. Of the 26 analysts covering the stock, the consensus recommendation is a 2.07 \u2018Outperform\u2019 Score.\n\nWe expect to see a revenue growth of 60% for the year, with a price-to-sales multiple of 1x, which puts our price target at $6.63, an upside of 43.20%.\n\nGoing into 2026, we estimate the price to be $7.80, with another strong 50%+ revenue bump. However, with EBITDA still well in the negative, we see the market not rewarding the stock as much and giving it a lower valuation multiple, resulting in an upside of 68.47%.\n\nHeading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase to leap forward to $13.80 with another strong 50%+ revenue growth year-over-year. That is a 97% year-over-year gain and up 198.06% from today\u2019s stock price.\n\nWhen predicting more than 3 years out, we expect NIO\u2019s P/S ratio in 2028 to be 1.5x and top-line growth of 50%. In 2028, we have NIO\u2019s revenue coming in around $36 billion, suggesting a stock price estimate at $26.39 or a gain of 469.98% over the current stock price.\n\n24/7 Wall Street expects NIO\u2019s stock to continue its revenue growth and to generate $25 billion in revenue. The stock price in 2029 is estimated at $18.08, or a gain of 290.50% over today\u2019s price.\n\nNIO Stocks Price Target for 2030\n\nWe estimate NIO\u2019s stock price to be $25.89 per share. Our estimated stock price will be 459.18% higher than the current stock price.\n\nYear Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $6.94 Upside of 49.89% 2025 $6.63 Upside of 43.20% 2026 $7.80 Upside of 68.47% 2027 $13.80 Upside of 198.06% 2028 $26.39 Upside of 469.98% 2029 $18.08 Upside of 290.50% 2030 $25.89 Upside of 459.18%\n\nJenoche / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Average American Is Losing Their Savings Every Day (Sponsor) If you\u2019re like many Americans and keep your money \u2018safe\u2019 in a checking or savings account, think again.

            "article_content": "After Valve got a lot of PC gamers excited about gaming handhelds with its popular Steam Deck, the company appears to be working with third-party manufacturers on a comeback of Steam machines. The timing seems right now that SteamOS, Valve\u2019s Linux-based OS is a much better alternative to Windows when it comes to ease of use and game compatibility.\n\nYou may remember that back in 2015, Valve got Alienware and other manufacturers to release a couple of Steam machines for the living room. Valve even released its own Steam controller for these console-like devices, but these first Steam machines were probably ahead of their time. Indeed, that was before Valve started to invest in the Proton compatibility layer that made the most popular Windows games run seamlessly on SteamOS.\n\nWindows Intelligence In Your Inbox Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday \u2014 and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! \"*\" indicates required fields Email * Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. \u0394\n\nOver the summer, Valve confirmed to The Verge that it was working to make SteamOS compatible with third-party gaming handhelds such as the Asus ROG Ally. The latter ships with Windows 11, which is great for gamers who want to use PC Game Pass or install other game launchers like Gog or the Epic Games Store. However, Windows 11 isn\u2019t optimized for running on devices with a 7-inch display like the ROG Ally. It also doesn\u2019t help that Asus and other manufacturers of Windows-based gaming handhelds are all building custom overlays that aren\u2019t easy to use and may sometimes clash with Windows features.\n\nOver the weekend, The Verge published a detailed roundup of all the things Valve appears to be working on right now to grow the SteamOS ecosystem. That includes a new Steam controller and what could be a new living room Steam box codenamed \u201cFremont.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the company also updated a Brand guidelines document that includes the new \u201cPowered by SteamOS\u201d logo you can see at the top of this article. The document says this logo will be used \u201cfor hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.\u201d\n\nIf Valve\u2019s Steam Deck proved that there was an appetite for gaming handhelds providing seamless access to Steam games, Valve could significantly grow the SteamOS ecosystem with the help of third-party manufacturers. Unlike Windows, SteamOS is free, and it\u2019s optimized for gaming handhelds and the living room experience. Moreover, gamers don\u2019t need to pay a subscription like Xbox Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus to play the Steam version of multiplayer games.\n\nAs of today, Valve is making SteamOS free to install for anyone, though the installation process is quite technical and the OS only supports a certain set of hardware. However, this new \u201cPowered by SteamOS logo\u201d suggests that may soon see third-party devices shipping with SteamOS out of the box. Whether that includes both gaming handhelds and console-like devices for the living room remains to be seen, however."

            "article_content": "The smartphone market is poised for a strong 2025, driven by product portfolio refreshes among leading handset manufacturers, rising consumer interest in innovative artificial intelligence features, and growing demand for and increased affordability of 5G devices.\n\nInternational Data Corp\u2019s five-year forecast for smartphone shipments worldwide by operating system shows that the smartphone market reached 1.21 billion units shipped in 2024, up 4% from 2023. According to IDC, sales of affordable Android smartphones are growing rapidly in emerging markets, while premium markets are embracing new AI features.\n\nHere are some of the key trends to watch in 2025:\n\n1. 5G adoption accelerates throughout Africa\n\nThroughout Africa, we have seen a surge in 5G investment, including spectrum auctions, pilots and commercial launches. With smartphone manufacturers leveraging the latest systems on chips (SoCs), we are also seeing more affordable 5G-ready smartphones hit the market. This has set the stage for accelerated 5G adoption across Africa in 2025. IDC forecasts 13.2% growth in global sales of 5G-powered devices in 2025, following near 16% growth in 2024.\n\n2. Generative AI fuels the next generation of smartphone innovation\n\nChip makers like MediaTek are integrating next-generation generative AI features with their SoCs. Our Dimensity 9300 platform, for example, includes the MediaTek NPU 790 generative AI engine to allow faster, safer edge AI computing. This enables smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi to create a range of innovative generative AI experiences.\n\nSome examples of the features we can expect to become commonplace in smartphones include AI-generated subtitles for video calls, real-time translations of multiple languages and AI notetaking with summaries and proofreading. The productivity gains in classrooms, work and personal life will be enormous.\n\nIDC forecasts that AI-powered devices will be the fastest-growing segment in the smartphone category. Growth in 2025 is expected to hit 73%. By 2028, worldwide gen AI smartphone shipments will reach 912 million units, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 78.4% for 2023-2028.\n\n3. AI-driven cameras and displays\n\nIntegrated AI features will continue to enhance smartphone camera and display experiences. On-device AI image signal processing, AI noise reduction, AI processing on RAW photos and videos, and other utilities like real-time bokeh tracking are rapidly trickling down to mainstream smartphones.\n\n4. Focus on security\n\nSmartphone security is a key concern because of the sensitive information stored on our devices, such as biometrics and financial data. AI-powered security tools and theft detection features are crucial for protecting this information and keeping our data away from prying eyes. The Dimensity 9300, for instance, includes a privacy-focused design that resists physical attacks on data access by protecting important processes during boot-up and when performing secure computing.\n\n5. Enhanced photography\n\nWe can expect 2025 to be the year the new Ultra HDR format really takes off. Ultra HDR is a big step forward for mobile photography, making photos look much more vibrant while ensuring that files are compatible with the universally supported JPEG format. Chipsets like the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 are revolutionising photography and videography, thanks to support for the new Ultra HDR format and always-on HDR recording at up to 4K resolution at 60 frames per second.\n\n6. Closing the gaming performance gap\n\nThe latest SoCs feature power-efficient graphics processing to give gamers full raytracing experiences at a smooth 60fps and console-grade global illumination effects. We are seeing near home console or PC levels of fidelity and performance emerge on a device you can carry in your pocket. The MediaTek Dimensity 9300\u2019s GPU, for instance, provides 46% higher peak performance with 40% power savings, leading to longer battery life and game times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe smartphone market is set for robust growth in 2025, driven by technological advancements and evolving consumer needs. At MediaTek, we aim to play a critical role in the adoption of next-generation technology, empowering manufacturers like Xiaomi to deliver innovative features such as cutting-edge generative AI functionalities at an affordable cost.\n\nThe author, Rami Osman, is director for business development, MediaTek Middle East and Africa\n\nRead more articles by MediaTek on TechCentral\n\nThis promoted content was paid for by the party concerned\n\nDon\u2019t miss:"

            "article_content": "Home Opinion The theology of Christmas: The Incarnation\n\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most brilliant minds in history, transformed our understanding of the universe. His theory of relativity reshaped physics, while his discovery of the photoelectric effect won him the Nobel Prize in 1921. Yet, for all his genius, Einstein famously dismissed trivial facts. When asked how many feet are in a mile, he replied, \u201cI do not clutter my mind with insignificant information that I can find in less than two minutes in a book.\u201d\n\nThough Einstein acknowledged a divine order in the universe, he rejected the God of the Bible \u2014 the personal God who is both knowable and redemptive. He once remarked, \u201cThe more I study science, the more I believe in God,\u201d but tragically, he never came to know the one true and living God.\n\nThis contrast between human intellect and divine revelation sets the stage for John 1:14, a verse that declares the profound truth at the heart of Christmas: \u201cThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\u201d In this one staggering statement in John 1:14, we see a God who enters His creation, reveals His glory, and provides grace and truth for fallen sinners.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe Word became flesh\n\nJohn begins this verse with a profound declaration: \u201cThe Word became flesh.\u201d This phrase encapsulates the mystery of the incarnation, where the eternal Logos took on human nature without ceasing to be divine.\n\nThe term Logos (\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) was familiar to John\u2019s Greek and Jewish audiences, but John redefines it in the opening of his Gospel. For Greek philosophers like Heraclitus, the Logos referred to the rational principle and non-personal deity governing the universe. But John declares that the Logos (Word) is not an impersonal force but a person \u2014 Jesus Christ, who was both with God and was God (John 1:1).\n\nJesus, the eternal Word, is the Creator of all things (John 1:3). He is the \u201cI AM\u201d who declared, \u201cBefore Abraham was, I AM\u201d (John 8:58) and \u201cI and the Father are one\u201d (John 10:30). Jesus is sovereign over creation, having formed humanity in His image, established the laws of nature, and upholds the cosmos by His power. As the Nicene Creed affirms, He is \u201cvery God of very God,\u201d worthy of all worship.\n\nJohn\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe Word became flesh\u201d unveils the miracle of the incarnation. The eternal Son of God entered His creation by taking on human nature. This is the mystery that Thomas Watson called \u201cthe infinite love of God.\u201d Christ did not cease to be God but added humanity to His deity, becoming truly God and truly man.\n\nConsider the humility of the incarnation: the creator of the universe was born in a lowly stable, veiled in flesh, and subjected to the limitations of humanity in his human nature. Charles Wesley beautifully captures this truth in his hymn:\n\n\u201cVeiled in flesh the Godhead see,\n\nHail th\u2019incarnate Deity,\n\nPleased with us in flesh to dwell,\n\nJesus, our Immanuel.\u201d\n\nThe incarnation is not only a theological truth but a deeply personal one. Without the Word becoming flesh, humanity would remain lost in sin, alienated from God. As Watson reminds us, \u201cHad not Christ been made flesh, we had been made a curse.\u201d\n\nThe Word tabernacled among us\n\nJohn continues, \u201cand dwelt among us.\u201d The Greek word for \u201cdwelt\u201d (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c9) means \u201cto take up residence, or to pitch a tent,\u201d evoking the imagery of the Old Testament tabernacle where God\u2019s presence dwelled among His people.\n\nIn Exodus, God commanded Moses to construct the tabernacle, a portable sanctuary where His presence would reside. The tabernacle was central to Israel\u2019s worship, housing the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark\u2019s mercy seat was the place of atonement, where the high priest sprinkled the sacrificial blood once per year on the Day of Atonement.\n\nThis structure symbolized God\u2019s desire to dwell among His people, yet it was limited by layers of separation. Only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Place, and only once every year. When John writes that Jesus \u201cdwelt among us,\u201d he declares that Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle. Unlike the temporary, veiled presence of God in the Old Testament, in the person of Jesus God\u2019s presence is fully revealed. As Hebrews 1:3 states, He is \u201cthe radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of His nature.\u201d\n\nThrough Christ, humanity can approach God directly, without fear or separation. He is not only the greater High Priest who offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice, but he is the greater tabernacle granting access to the Father for all who believe. This is the wonder and thrilling truth of the birth of Jesus that is celebrated at Christmas.\n\nThe Word revealed the glory of God\n\nJohn writes, \u201cWe have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.\u201d The incarnation reveals the radiant glory of God in a way that humanity could see, hear, feel, and touch.\n\nThroughout Scripture, God\u2019s glory is depicted as overwhelming and unapproachable. At Mount Sinai, God\u2019s presence was so terrifying that the Israelites trembled in fear (Exodus 19). When Moses asked to see God\u2019s glory, he was only permitted a partial glimpse, for no one could see God and live (Exodus 33:20). In the tabernacle and later the temple, God\u2019s glory filled the sanctuary, yet it remained hidden behind the veil.\n\nIn Jesus, the glory of God is fully revealed. At the transfiguration, Peter, James, and John witnessed His divine majesty shining through His humanity (Matthew 17:2). After His resurrection, Paul encountered the risen Christ in glory, a vision so blinding it left him temporarily blind (Acts 9:3\u20139).\n\nJesus\u2019 miracles also revealed His glory, demonstrating His divine authority over sickness, nature, and even death. From calming the storm to raising Lazarus, each miracle pointed to His identity as the Son of God. Even as Jesus\u2019 deity was clothed in human flesh, it could not veil his glory. Throughout his earthly ministry, bursts of glory and rays of his majesty are visibly seen in his powerful miracles. Yet, the greatest display of His glory was seen in His humility and suffering. On the cross, Jesus bore the wrath of God for sinners, displaying the glory of divine love and justice and the vindication of it all was his glorious resurrection.\n\nThe Word delivered grace and truth\n\nFinally, John declares that Jesus is \u201cfull of grace and truth.\u201d These two attributes summarize the purpose of the incarnation: to bring salvation through grace and to reveal the truth of God.\n\nGrace is the unmerited favor of God toward sinners. In Jesus, grace is personified and extended to all who believe. As Paul writes, \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God\u201d (Ephesians 2:8). From His first breath in Bethlehem to His final cry on the cross, Jesus\u2019 life was marked by grace. He came not to condemn the world but to save it (John 3:17). His death and resurrection provide eternal life to those who trust in Him.\n\nJesus not only embodies grace but also truth. He declared, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). In a world filled with deception, Jesus stands as the ultimate standard of truth. His teachings reveal the truth about God, humanity, and salvation. He exposed the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, corrected false interpretations of Scripture, and proclaimed the Gospel of the Kingdom. As the Spirit of Truth, Jesus sanctifies believers, transforming them into His likeness through the power of the Word (John 17:17).\n\nThe incarnation is the foundation of the Christian faith. In Jesus, the eternal Word became flesh, dwelt among us, revealed God\u2019s glory, and brought grace and truth to a lost world. As we celebrate Christmas, let us marvel at the humility and majesty of Christ, who entered His creation to redeem it. And let us live in anticipation of the day when He will dwell with His people forever:\n\n\u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God\u201d (Revelation 21:3).\n\nThis is the true theology of Christmas: God became man so that we might dwell with Him in glory. Let us worship the incarnate Word, our Immanuel.\n\nOriginally published at G3 Ministries."

            "article_content": "Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe\u2014a major discovery recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.\n\nHow many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.\n\nJust last year, researchers made a third independent measure of the Universe's expansion by tracking the behavior of a gravitationally lensed supernova, where the distortion in space-time caused by a massive object acts as a lens to magnify an object in the background. The best fits of those models all ended up slightly below the value of the Hubble Constant derived from the CMB, with the difference being within the statistical error. Values closer to those derived from measurements of other supernovae were a considerably worse fit for the data. The method was new, with considerable uncertainties, but it did provide an independent means of getting at the Hubble Constant."

            "article_content": "The Willow quantum computing chip, the successor Sycamore, charts the path for scaling up quantum computers thanks to error-correction technologies that eliminate more errors than are introduced.\n\nGoogle scientists have created a new quantum processor that, in five minutes, cracked a problem that would have taken the world's best supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve. The breakthrough will allow quantum computers to become less error-prone the bigger they get, achieving a milestone that overcomes a decades-long obstacle.\n\nQuantum computers are inherently \"noisy,\" meaning that, without error-correction technologies, every one in 1,000 qubits \u2014 the fundamental building blocks of a quan computer \u2014 fails.\n\nIt also means coherence times (how long the qubits can remain in a superposition so they can process calculations in parallel) remain short. By contrast, every one in 1 billion billion bits fails in conventional computers .\n\nThis high error rate is one of the key barriers to scaling up these machines so they are good enough to perform far better than the fastest supercomputers. This is why research has centered on building quantum computers with better and less error-prone \u2014 not simply more \u2014 qubits.\n\nGoogle says its new quantum processing unit (QPU) , dubbed \"Willow,\" is the first in the world to achieve results that are \"below threshold\" \u2014 a milestone outlined by computer scientist Peter Shor in a 1995 paper . The team outlined the technology in a study published Dec. 9 in the journal Nature .\n\nCracking a problem set decades ago\n\nThe new \"Willow\" quantum processor is fitted with 105 physical qubits combined with error-correcting technologies that mean the more qubits you add, the more reliable quantum computers can be. (Image credit: Google Quantum AI)\n\nThe breakthrough \u2014 achieving this \"below threshold\" milestone \u2014 means that errors in a quantum computer will reduce exponentially as you add more physical qubits . It charts a path for scaling up quantum machines in the future.\n\nThe technology relies on logical qubits. This is a qubit encoded using a collection of physical qubits in a lattice formation. All the physical qubits in a single logical qubit share the same data, meaning if any qubits fail, calculations continue because the information can still be found within the logical qubit.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe Google scientists built sufficiently reliable qubits for exponential error reduction by making several shifts. They improved calibration protocols, improved machine learning techniques to identify errors, and improved device fabrication methods. Most importantly, they improved coherence times while retaining the ability to tune physical qubits to get the best performance.\n\nRelated: Monster 4,400-qubit quantum processor is '25,000 times faster' than its predecessor\n\n\"What we've been able to do in quantum error correction is a really important milestone \u2014 for the scientific community and for the future of quantum computing \u2014 which is [to] show that we can make a system that operates below the quantum error correction threshold,\" Julian Kelly , Google Quantum AI's director of quantum hardware, told Live Science.\n\nThis challenging task requires removing more errors from a system than are introduced. Below this threshold, scientists can scale up a quantum computer to be larger and larger, and errors will continue to decline, Kelly explained.\n\n\"This has been an outstanding challenge for 30 years \u2014 since the idea of quantum error correction was conceived of in the mid-90s,\" Kelly said.\n\nMind-boggling results for quantum computing\n\nThe Google researchers tested Willow against the random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark, which is now a standard metric for assessing quantum computing chips. In these tests, Willow performed a computation in under five minutes that would have taken today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years. This is close to a quadrillion times longer than the age of the universe.\n\nThe first edition of the Willow QPU can also achieve a coherence time of nearly 100 microseconds \u2014 which is five times better than the showing from Google's previous Sycamore chip.\n\nGoogle first announced that Sycamore had passed the RCS benchmark in 2019 , when scientists used the chip to resolve a problem that would have taken a classical supercomputer 10,000 years to calculate. In July, a new quantum computer built by Quantinuum broke that record by 100 times .\n\nGoogle first tested their Sycamore quantum computer against the RCS benchmark in 2019, and processed a calculation that would have taken a supercomputer tens of thousands of years to do. (Image credit: Google Quantum AI)\n\nThen, in October, Google again announced that it had discovered a new \"quantum phase\" when using Sycamore to process calculations, meaning the best QPUs today can outperform the fastest supercomputers in practical applications for the first time.\n\n\"Coherence times are now much higher than they used to be, and we immediately translate into basically lowering all the physical operation error rates by about a factor of two,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"So all the underlying qubits just got better at everything they do by about a factor of two. If you look at the logical error rate between this new processor and Sycamore, there's about a factor of 20 difference \u2014 and that comes from scaling up but also pushing below threshold.\"\n\nLooking beyond \"below threshold\"\n\nGoogle scientists are now aiming to demonstrate useful and practical computations for today's quantum chips, rather than relying on benchmarking.\n\nIn the past, the team has performed simulations of quantum systems that have led to scientific discoveries and breakthroughs, Kelly told Live Science.\n\nTo build a \"really good\" logical qubit, the team needs to stitch together 1,457 physical qubits. (Image credit: Google Quantum AI)\n\nOne example includes discovering deviations from the assumed laws of physics. But these results were still within reach of the most powerful classical computers.\n\nNext, the team wants to create a \"very, very good logical qubit\" with an error rate of one in 1 million. To build this, they would need to stitch together 1,457 physical qubits, they said.\n\nThis realm is challenging because it's impossible to get there using just physical hardware \u2014 you would need error-correction technology layered on top. The scientists then want to connect logical qubits together to perform better than supercomputers in benchmarking as well as real-world scenarios."

He noted that the annual VinFuture Prize continues to surprise with its innovative selections.This year, he was particularly impressed by the Main Prize, which recognized a \"power trio\" in the field of Artificial Intelligence: Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun for their foundational mathematical and algorithmic work; Fei-Fei Li for her pioneering dataset; and Jensen Huang for his hardware breakthroughs. \"All of those three components brought together have made possible this astonishing AI revolution,\" he said.On December 6, 2024, the VinFuture Foundation recognized four groundbreaking scientific achievements. The US$3 million Grand Prize was awarded for transformative contributions to deep learning. Additionally, three Special Prizes honored innovations in oral cholera vaccination, polymeric biomaterials, and CAR T-cell therapy.Selected from nearly 1,500 nominations across 80+ countries, the four winning works represent the pinnacle of scientific innovation. These breakthroughs exemplify the \"resilient rebound\" spirit, demonstrating the potential to revolutionize various fields and shape a brighter future.Prof. Friend was deeply inspired by the groundbreaking achievements recognized by the Special Prizes. The revolutionary CAR-T therapy offers a beacon of hope for countless cancer patients. Dr. Firdausi Qadri's lifesaving cholera vaccine for Rohingya refugees exemplifies the power of science to address real-world challenges. And Prof. Kristi Anseth's pioneering research in biomaterials bridges the gap between laboratory innovation and clinical application.Prof. Friend highlighted that these remarkable works share a common purpose: enhancing the human condition. This aligns perfectly with VinFuture's mission to recognize and reward scientific breakthroughs that benefit humanity.Mr. Friend also highlighted the importance of diverse perspectives in scientific research. He noted that the unique experiences and approaches of scientists have led to remarkable breakthroughs. VinFuture's commitment to recognizing diverse talent reflects its belief in the power of different viewpoints to drive innovation.\"They have seen something that others have not, or they have had the perseverance to know that it is worth sticking with the journey. It is the collection of stories that is what we should celebrate. I believe it is the diversity in approaches and thinking among scientists that has led to the extraordinary breakthroughs we are witnessing,\" he shared.This year's VinFuture Prize celebrates a diverse range of innovators, from academic researchers to industry leaders like the CEO of NVIDIA. This recognition underscores the interconnectedness of fundamental research and technological application. The AI revolution, a testament to this synergy, has been propelled by advancements in mathematics, algorithms, datasets, and hardware. VinFuture's mission is to honor the full spectrum of contributions that drive scientific and technological progress.When academic research and industrial development converge, the potential for groundbreaking innovation is limitless.

In the healthcare sector, a paradigm shift is underway, moving from treatment to prevention. Preventive interventions offer a cost-effective and sustainable approach to improving public health. Prof. Friend emphasized the transformative potential of CAR-T cell therapy, a groundbreaking treatment that has revolutionized cancer care.\"In cancer treatment, we're seeing a historic turning point. Despite decades of understanding cancer, we haven't found truly effective treatments until now. CAR-T cell therapy has changed that, ushering in a new era of cancer treatment with promising results,\" said Prof. Friend.According to Prof. Friend, after decades of promise, AI has finally made significant breakthroughs. Discussions at the scientific conference revealed that while the achievements are impressive, they are only the beginning. Pioneering scientists in this field modestly acknowledge that there is much more to explore and develop.\"This year, I'm particularly proud to share that the VinFuture Prize has once again demonstrated its ability to recognize groundbreaking research with global impact. Before the Nobel Prizes were announced, we honored Professor Geoffrey Hinton, who subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to AI,\" said Professor Friend.In fact, VinFuture has a proven track record of identifying future Nobel Prize winners. Two years ago, VinFuture honored Demis Hassabis and John Jumper from Google DeepMind for their revolutionary work in protein structure modeling. Their recent Nobel Prize in Chemistry validates its commitment to recognizing groundbreaking research.Hashtag: #VinFuture\n\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement."
