            "article_content": "Did you know that Jimmy Carter was open about seeing a UFO?\n\nDid you know that Jimmy Carter was open about seeing a UFO?\n\nCHARLOTTE (QUEEN CITY NEWS) \u2014 If you saw a U.F.O., would you tell anyone? What if you were a high-profile politician? Would you admit it, or would you be silenced by the stigma that often accompanies such out-of-this-world tales?\n\nA lawmaker who would eventually become the 39th president of the United States reported his encounter, and the reaction may surprise you.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t know this, but the late former president Jimmy Carter saw a color-changing U.F.O. in Georgia back in 1969.\n\nHis willingness to discuss it leaves behind a unique legacy of openness about U.F.O. sightings.\n\nAmericans honor former President Jimmy Carter\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter\u2019s personal encounter happened outside a Lions club in Leary, Georgia. He was with a group of about two dozen witnesses who all saw a bright orb changing colors from blue to red to white. According to history.com., the orb moved toward and away from the crowd, stopped, and then disappeared behind pine trees. Carter said the object was self-illuminated and not solid in nature. It was in view for about 12 minutes before it passed out of sight.\n\nWhen Carter was governor in 1973, he filed an official report with the International U.F.O. Bureau. He spoke freely about the encounter and even promised, during his 1976 presidential campaign, to release all government information if elected.\n\nAccording to reports, he backed away from his pledge, citing security concerns and defense implications.\n\nA member of the Carter family did some research and decided it was likely from the release of a glowing chemical cloud produced by rockets launched from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Some of these sodium and barium chemical clouds were visible by the scattering of sunlight as far away as Leary, Georgia, appearing around the same time of the sighting. A copy of this report is at the Jimmy Carter Library.\n\nCarter is quoted as saying, \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ll never make fun of people who say they\u2019ve seen unidentified objects in the sky.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter left a message cast to the cosmos in 1977.\n\nUSA Today reports that in a message sent to space, along with recordings of Earth\u2019s music, languages, and images, Carter left a message on a golden record launched on the space probe, Voyager 1, saying, in part, \u201cWe hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations.\u201d The message continues to travel beyond our solar system today.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

            "article_content": "UFO 50 is one of the most impressive and audacious video game releases in recent memory, precisely because of what it doesn't do. There are no hyperrealistic graphics or massive open worlds. Instead, UFO 50 is a collection of 50 games that pay homage to classic titles from the 1980s. Think of it as the Well-Tempered Clavier of 8-bit gaming.\n\nThe backstory of UFO 50 is that the games are the catalog of a fictional game company from the '80s. There are platformers, shoot-'em-ups, side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, RPGs, puzzle games, turn-based strategies, a point-and-click horror adventure, Metroidvanias, dungeon crawlers, and more. The collection recreates not just the pixel graphics and chunky synth soundtracks\u2014which are delightful\u2014but the experience of dusting off a trove of video game cartridges and exploring them at your leisure.\n\nLike their inspirations, these games don't hold your hand. There are no tutorials, and part of the fun is going into a game blind and figuring out its internal logic. For those who grew up in the 1980s and '90s, it's all a heady dose of nostalgia, but these aren't merely reskinned copies of old titles or minigames. A group of independent developers spent eight years crafting them, and each one is a complete game with an original idea or twist.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shock of UFO 50 is how consistently good all the titles are. The simple controls, tight design, and challenging-but-rewarding gameplay reminds players why video games are fun in the first place. If you've ever had trouble putting down a controller because \"just one more try,\" you will become obsessed with at least one\u2014more likely several\u2014of UFO 50's offerings.\n\nThe post Review: UFO 50 Pays Homage to '80s Video Games appeared first on Reason.com."

She always looks amazing.\n\n'She has a style formula and sticks to it. For royal occasions, she chooses belted tea dresses, in bright colours, often with dramatic sleeves.\n\n'She looks stunning, a far cry from jodhpurs and mucking out gear!'\n\nOne of the equestrian's standout looks from 2024 was the burgundy trouser-suit that she picked for Kate's comeback Christmas carol concert at Westminster Abbey last month.\n\nAmong the European royal ladies, Princess Sofia of Sweden also splurged on a new wardrobe comprising 97 new pieces that reportedly cost \u00a3101,562 (\u20ac122,452) in total.\n\nHer sister-in-law and the wife of Prince Carl Philip, Crown Princess Victoria acquired new clothes worth nearly \u00a368,000 (\u20ac81,717).\n\nRanked 12th on the list was Queen Maxima of the Netherlands after the value of her clothes was estimated at around \u00a350,000 (\u20ac59,726), followed by Queen Letizia of Spain and Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit.\n\nIt was estimated that the 20 royal women spent over \u00a31.65 million on 1,488 new items in 2024."

            "article_content": "After a feature in the book-tracking app Fable shocked some readers, the company introduced safeguards. PHOTO: ELLIUS GRACE/NYTIMES\n\nNEW YORK - Fable, a popular app for talking about and tracking books, is changing the way it creates personalised summaries for its users after complaints that an artificial intelligence model used offensive language.\n\nIn an Instagram post this week, Mr Chris Gallello, the head of product at Fable, addressed the problem of AI-generated summaries on the app, saying that Fable began receiving complaints about \u201cvery bigoted racist language, and that was shocking to us\u201d.\n\nHe gave no examples, but he was apparently referring to at least one Fable reader\u2019s summary posted as a screenshot on Threads, which rounded up the book choices the reader, Ms Tiana Trammell, had made, saying: \u201cYour journey dives deep into the heart of Black narratives and transformative tales, leaving mainstream stories gasping for air. Don\u2019t forget to surface for the occasional white author, okay?\u201d.\n\nFable replied in a comment under the post, saying that a team would work to resolve the problem. In his longer statement on Instagram, Mr Gallello said that the company would introduce safeguards.\n\nThese included disclosures that summaries were generated by artificial intelligence, the ability to opt out of them and a thumbs-down button that would alert the app to a potential problem.\n\nMs Trammell, who lives in Detroit, downloaded Fable in October 2024 to track her reading. Around Christmas, she had read books that prompted summaries related to the holiday. But just before the new year, she finished three books by Black authors.\n\nOn Dec 29, when Ms Trammell saw her Fable summary, she was stunned.\n\n\u201cI thought: \u2018This cannot be what I am seeing. I am clearly missing something here,\u2019\u201d she said in an interview on Jan 3.\n\nShe shared the summary with fellow book club members and on Fable, where others shared offensive summaries that they, too, had received or seen.\n\nOne person who read books about people with disabilities was told her choices \u201ccould earn an eye-roll from a sloth\u201d. Another said a reader\u2019s books were \u201cmaking me wonder if you\u2019re ever in the mood for a straight, cis white man\u2019s perspective\u201d.\n\nFable\u2019s head of community, Ms Kim Marsh Allee, said in an e-mail on Jan 3 that two users received summaries \u201cthat are completely unacceptable to us as a company and do not reflect our values\u201d.\n\nShe said all of the features that use AI were being removed, including summaries and year-end reading wraps, and a new app version was being submitted to the app store.

Everything is twisted with a horror theme, so it\u2019s more of a fun fusion between burlesque, cabaret and all types of circus traditional acts. There\u2019s a lot of like characters coming from the underground world.\u201d\n\nOoh, you had me at burlesque and underworld, which is why this is PG-13, by the way. Don\u2019t worry, this horror-themed show starts with a story.\n\nRoxana Midi: \u201cThere are, like, portals open, and each portal will bring a circus act, you know. We\u2019ll have a wheel of death, we have some jugglers, we have very sexy vampires, zombies, It has a graveyard keeper, they have me as an exorcist. We have a girl hanging by her hair, that\u2019s amazing. I don\u2019t know what kind of shampoo and conditioner she\u2019s using.\u201d\n\nFrom jump-scares to a haunted maze, they just want you to have fun.\n\nRoxana Midi: \u201cBut it\u2019s also sexy. It\u2019s also funny. We\u2019re doing all types of illusional stuff \u2014 the costume, the attitude, the music, the vibe. It is, but it\u2019s a show.\u201d\n\nAnd all seats under the tent offer a great view of the terror.\n\nRoxana Midi: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty intimate.

It\u2019s more daring, and every time brings curiosity in people, and Halloween is one of the favorite holidays for everybody.

The best of our novelists, featured here in Listener\u2019s Top 10 power list, have sold more than 320,000 books between them in our fair land in the past 10 years.\n\nAnd they\u2019re not all names you might expect to see.\n\nSure, literary mavens Eleanor Catton, Witi Ihimaera and Catherine Chidgey feature \u2013 and deservedly so. But you may not be familiar with the work of paranormal romance writer Nalini Singh, who comes in at number five; and if we included international sales of her books, she\u2019d be number two, beaten only by Te Awamutu-born and raised author Heather Morris with her runaway bestseller The Tattooist of Auschwitz which has sold a whopping 18 million copies globally.\n\nNicky Pellegrino, New Zealand\u2019s undisputed literary star of food, love and all things Italian, ranks, as do beloved historical fiction writers Deborah Challinor and Jenny Pattrick. Charity Norman, a relative newcomer to call New Zealand home (she arrived in 2002), can claim her rightful place as our queen of crime fiction.\n\nThe list features writers across a variety of fiction genre, with books set in the past, present and future, but if there is a common thread to be found, all but one are women. They and their publishers deserve applause.\n\nBut perhaps we should cheer the loudest for Becky Manawatu, whose singular title published in the time frame \u2013 Au\u0113 \u2013 sold so many copies, it earned her a place on the list.\n\nWithout further ado, here is the list of Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s most successful fiction writers in the last decade.\n\nEleanor Catton is in top spot on the list of New Zealand's best-selling local novelists.

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

The outage began on December 26th, 2024 at 10:40 AM and was mostly resolved by 3:11 PM, except for except ChatGPT which was 100% recovered by 6:20 PM.\n\nThe following services were impacted:\n\nChatGPT\n\nSora video creation\n\nAPIs: agents, realtime speech, batch, and DALL-E\n\nCause of OpenAI Outage\n\nThe cause of the outage was a cloud provider data center failure which impacted OpenAI databases. While the databases are mirrored across regions, switching over to a backup database required manual interaction on the part of the cloud provider to redirect operations to a backup datacenter in another region. The manual intervention was cited as how the outage was fixed but the given reason for why it took so long was the scale of the project.\n\nA failover is an automated process for switching to a backup system in the event of a system failure. OpenAI announced that they are working toward creating infrastructure changes to improve responses to future cloud database failures.\n\nOpenAI explained:\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, we will embark on a major infrastructure initiative to ensure our systems are resilient to an extended outage in any region of any of our cloud providers by adding a layer of indirection under our control in between our applications and our cloud databases. This will allow significantly faster failover.\u201d\n\nSignificant ChatGPT Outage\n\nOpenAI\u2019s said the ChatGPT outage was due to a regional cloud provider database failure but the effect was global, evidenced by user reports on social media from across Europe and North America.\n\nGoogle Trends, which tracks search volume, indicates that this may have been the largest such event, with more people searching for information about it than for any previous outage.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/lilgrapher"

            "article_content": "If you are still in awe of Generative AI solutions such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Meta AI, and Gemini, you are in for more surprises. OpenAI, for one, is talking about much more powerful and deeper Large Language Models (LLMs) that promise to become an integral part of our daily activities.\n\nImagine a customer wanting to do a banking transaction, say checking their bank balance. He can pose that question to ChatGPT\u2019s advanced model, and if the bank has adopted the solution, it can start a conversation, access the customer\u2019s account by verifying it by sending an OTP to their registered KYC contact numbers, and answer the queries.\n\nThis enhances the customer experience and allows banks to handle a larger volume of queries with fewer resources.\n\nSimilarly, HR departments can sift through a huge number of resumes using the advanced models. By simply posing a few filters (experience, geography, etc.), it can help the HR departments can shortlist candidates in no time. \u201cYou can even schedule interview schedules using the solution,\u201d Atty Eleti, a member of technical staff at OpenAI, has said.\n\nDemonstrating the capabilities of some of the OpenAI\u2019s advanced models at T-Hub here on Friday, he said that the upcoming AI solutions would continue to become smarter, moving beyond simply answering questions to actually performing tasks and solving complex problems. Talking on the \u2018Unlocking OpenAI\u2019s potential for India\u2019, he spoke on some advanced models such as O-Series (\u2018Reasoning\u2019 models) GPT-4 Mini, and Sora. While the reasoning models demonstrate an ability to \u2018think\u2019 before responding, GPT-4 Mini is a more cost-effective version of GPT-4, and Sora helps users create realistic HD videos simply by providing text prompts.\n\nEleti said the future of AI interaction would extend beyond text and voice to encompass a broader range of modalities, including video, physical motion, and even social cues.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming AI models will dynamically generate user interfaces, control robots, and interact with the physical world in more sophisticated ways, blurring the lines between the digital and real,\u201d he said.\n\nAs AI technology advances, it will become more affordable and accessible to a wider population. He said OpenAI was committed to reducing the cost of its models and making them available through various platforms, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the transformative power of AI.\n\nPegging the user base for LLMs at about 0.5-1 billion, he said there a large number of people in the world that are yet to access these services.\n\nIndia plans\n\nHe said India emerged as the second biggest base for the US company in terms of the user base and the number of developers.\n\n\u201cIndia is a key market for its technology, with the country boasting the second-largest user base for its products. Millions of Indians are already using OpenAI\u2019s tools for various purposes, from education and personal productivity to business operations.\n\nHe said the company has significantly invested in improving its models\u2019 support for Indian languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, and Urdu. This has resulted in an 80 per cent reduction in token counts for these languages, leading to faster processing times and lower costs.\n\nHe said the company was working with Indian businesses to demonstrate the potential of AI and encourage its adoption. He cited the examples of 10Bed ICU, which uses OpenAI\u2019s technology to transcribe doctor-patient conversations and summarise patient files, and HealthifyMe, an AI-powered nutrition tracker that provides personalised health insights.\n\nLater, an OpenAI team met with Telangana government officials to discuss how to leverage AI for effective governance and enhanced citizen service delivery. This session aimed to foster collaboration between OpenAI and government stakeholders and highlight AI\u2019s pivotal role in driving impactful public service solutions.\n\nJayesh Ranjan, Special Chief Secretary, Department of Information Technology, Electronics & Communications (ITE&C, Govt of Telangana), said the government would continue collaborating with OpenAI to promote AI innovation and opportunities.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nI have a confession to make: Even though I\u2019ve been a tech journalist for much of my career and consistently rushed to embrace, or at least test out, the latest and greatest in personal technology, I\u2019ve never quite found voice assistants to be useful for me to use regularly.\n\nPart of that was because the tech has so far been admittedly pretty clunky: Apple pushed the boundary by acquiring and releasing Siri back in 2011, and was soon joined by the Amazon Echo smart speaker and Alexa voice assistant back in 2014. While I tested and used both, I stopped after a few weeks in both cases because I found myself constantly having to \u201cfight\u201d with the voice interaction \u2014 pausing before I spoke a query or repeating myself too often, for example.\n\nI know I\u2019m hardly alone, as numerous articles have been written over the last decade-plus about the shortcomings of both of those early voice assistants.\n\nBut then along came OpenAI with ChatGPT, and its humanlike Advanced Voice Mode audio interaction launched \u2014 finally, after a lengthy delay from its first target date \u2014 back in September 2024.\n\nMany AI power users have remarked about how useful and helpful OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode is: able to scour the web for information and carry on full conversations, analyze and react to imagery uploaded to it, even to pause when interrupted and allow the human user to redirect or move the conversation to other topics rapidly \u2014 much like real human-to-human conversation.\n\nAnd more recently, OpenAI cofounder and president Greg Brockman reshared a post on X by AI power user and Wharton School of Business professor Ethan Mollick noting that it is possible with newer versions of the Apple iPhone to map its new \u201caction button\u201d to ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, allowing users to turn the voice on with one click.\n\nI already had Advanced Voice Mode available to me as one of the pinnable and customizable widgets on the top of my iPhone Lock Screen, but this requires you to actually look down at the phone and find the icon.\n\nMapping Advanced Voice Mode to the iPhone\u2019s physical Action Button \u2014 the small one, located on the left side of the device \u2014 seems like an even more accessible option that requires only feel to activate. I just enabled it and am hopeful it will finally lead me to use this admittedly amazing tech more often. Here\u2019s how I did it:\n\nYou need a newer iPhone, from 15 Pro and up\n\niPhone 15 Pro\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max\n\niPhone 16\n\niPhone 16 Plus\n\niPhone 16 Pro\n\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nThe Action Button is a new physical button located on the left edge of newer versions of the iPhone, just above the volume up and down buttons.\n\nWhen setting up a new one of these iPhone models running iOS 18 or later, the phone\u2019s starting process should give you an option to select what you want to use the Action Button for. By default, it is set to \u201csilence\u201d your iPhone\u2019s ringer and notification sounds.\n\nHowever, if you already set up your iPhone and didn\u2019t get this option or use it, don\u2019t fear! You can still adjust it later. Here\u2019s how.\n\nDownload the official ChatGPT iOS app from the App Store\n\nIt\u2019s available here. While free ChatGPT users can still access it, there is a variable monthly limit on how many times they can call up Advanced Voice Mode. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise and Edu paying subscribers (starting at $20 per month) all have much higher or unlimited caps on the number of Advanced Voice Mode interactions they can access.\n\nOnce you have the ChatGPT iOS app installed on your iPhone, proceed to the next step.\n\nGo to \u2018Settings\u2019 to re-assign the iPhone Action Button\n\nTap on the \u201cSettings\u201d gear icon on your home screen. Then, scroll down to the second section of options and you should find \u201cAction Button\u201d listed third, below \u201cGeneral\u201d and \u201cAccessibility.\u201d Tap it.\n\nThis should open the Action Button assignment application/option on your phone, which is a screen where you can swipe between different options for what the Action Button will do when pressed.\n\nSwipe left to move through the options (and right to go back to one) until you reach the option labeled \u201cShortcut\u201d (it was the ninth screen for me).\n\nTap the up/down arrow selector screen below the text \u201cShortcut\u201d and it should open yet another selection screen, this time showing a variety of Shortcuts similar to those found in the official Apple iPhone Shortcuts app.\n\nExcept, if you scroll down below \u201cGet Started\u201d and any custom shortcuts you previously created in the \u201cMy Shortcuts\u201d sections, you\u2019ll see a list of third-party app icons that also offer shortcuts. Among them should be the ChatGPT iOS app. Tap this.\n\nFinally, this should pull up yet another selection screen showing various different actions within the ChatGPT iOS app that can be mapped to your iPhone\u2019s Action Button. You want to tap to select the one that shows a small headphones icon labeled \u201cStart voice conversation.\u201d\n\nTapping this should bring you back to the main Action Button selection screen, with Shortcut once again displayed prominently and \u201cStart Voice Conversation\u201d now listed as the action.\n\nAfter all that, you can finally swipe up to close the Settings app and long press on the physical action button. It should pull up the familiar Advanced Voice Mode screen showing a blue circle denoting the voice assistant. Begin speaking when you see this circle and you\u2019re off to the races!\n\nBonus: setting ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode up on your Lock Screen widgets\n\nIf you are interested in setting up your iPhone Lock Screen like I have, to also have a tappable onscreen icon to activate ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, you can do so pretty easily as well. Read on for how\u2026\n\nOnce again, you\u2019ll need to have the ChatGPT iOS app downloaded (duh). Then, you can tap to wake up your phone and long press on the time displayed at the top. This will bring you to the Lock Screen/Wallpaper customization screen, which looks like this:\n\nTap \u201cCustomize\u201d then \u201cLock Screen\u201d from the two options that appear:\n\nAfter tapping \u201cLock Screen,\u201d the iPhone should display an editable version of your Lock Screen denoted by boxes around widgets and interactive element spaces. It looks like this:\n\nGo ahead and tap the \u201cAdd Widgets\u201d screen and it should present, among many different options from different apps, one showing the ChatGPT iOS App icon (a flower design) with a small headphone icon inside it. Tap this one and it should now appear in your top Lock Screen \u201cshelf,\u201d alongside any others you choose (I chose a Weather widget).\n\nThat\u2019s it! Happy voice chatting and New Year."

            "article_content": "Health tech companies focused on behavioral health are confident that reimbursement trends favor them in 2025.\n\nPayment flexibilities for telehealth, hospital-at-home care and remote prescribing have been temporarily extended until March 31. The changes will prolong COVID-19-era payment for remote care across all specialties.\n\nRelated: CMS deals telehealth a win, but sector still needs Congress' help\n\nFor many in mental health tech, new reimbursement codes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 November physician payment rule are an even bigger deal.\n\nThe codes reimburse providers for using digital mental health treatment applications or devices that have been cleared or granted De Novo authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWhile the codes are narrow in scope, analysts said the move signifies a larger recognition among CMS and commercial insurers that virtual platforms treating mental health should be reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shortage of good mental health providers, and it is easy to argue that mental health services can be delivered in a virtual environment. No examination is needed,\u201d said Carrie Nixon, co-founder and managing partner of Nixon Gwilt Law, which works with digital health companies. \u201cThose factors have made mental and behavioral health the obvious jumping off point for all types of virtual, synchronous and asynchronous methods of delivering care.\u201d\n\nDigital therapeutics companies, which develop programs that can treat patients primarily through smartphone applications, have struggled because of a lack of reimbursement, said Andy Molnar, CEO of industry trade group the Digital Therapeutics Association.\n\nThe codes will be a lifeline for many behavioral health-focused digital therapeutics companies such as Big Health. The company has two FDA-cleared apps for treating insomnia and anxiety and is in line to benefit from CMS\u2019 new codes, said CEO Yael Berman.\n\nThere has been demand for Big Health\u2019s apps from providers looking for first-line treatment for sleeping disorders but no reimbursement, she said. The lack of reimbursement has limited its growth opportunities.\n\n\u201cReimbursement has really been the key barrier because we've had providers reaching out over the years, but there was no way to get them to be able to offer it to their patients unless it was free,\u201d Berman said.\n\nJoe Perekupka, CEO of digital therapeutics company Freespira, said the shortage of mental health providers requires a more progressive approach from the federal government in treating the mental health crisis. Perekupka said with these codes, he hope CMS is starting to recognize this need.\n\nFreespira, which offers a mobile health to reduce symptoms of panic disorder, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder, is unsure its services fit within the scope of CMS\u2019 codes, Perekupka said. Still, he predicted the codes will open the door to expand for broader digital mental health treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental shift in the philosophy at CMS,\u201d Perekupka said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big shot of adrenaline into the arm of digital mental health treatment.\n\nOutside the therapeutics space, companies such as Brightside Health and Talkspace have seen a shift in mentality from the federal government. In May, virtual mental health company Talkspace began rolling out its services to Medicare members. The company is expecting Medicare members to adopt the program this year when it starts marketing their services, said Erin Boyd, chief growth officer.\n\nIn addition to changes at the federal level, more commercial insurers are actively engaging with mental health tech companies, Boyd said. Talkspace has shifted its focus over the past few years from a direct-to-consumer payment model to working with commercial insurers and employers. The payer business accounted for more than 65% of its revenue through the first nine months of 2024.\n\n\u201cAfter COVID, it just made sense to be in as many networks as possible,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWe changed our marketing focus two years ago to really emphasize that you could use your insurance to get Talkspace, and that's been significant in changing the amount of registered users we have on the platform.\u201d\n\nWith the opportunities increasing for reimbursement, companies must prove their worth to CMS and commercial insurers, said Molnar at the trade group. If the codes aren\u2019t used or the outcomes data isn't showing a strong return on investment, CMS will move slowly to expand coverage, he said."

            "article_content": "Cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, procedural utilization, and health care costs in the United States represent a high burden demonstrating upward trends across the past several years, according to study findings published in The American Journal of Cardiology.\n\nAnnual health care spending in the US in 2021 reached $4.3 trillion ($12,914/person), with hospital services as the largest category of related costs ($1.3 trillion). In the current study, investigators characterized trends in cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations, health care costs, and procedural utilization.\n\nThe investigators conducted a retrospective analysis using discharge data and ICD-10 codes from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016 to 2021 (costs adjusted and reported in 2023 dollars). The NIS is the largest all-payer, encounter-level database in the US for hospitalizations (about 7 million deidentified hospitalizations/year).\n\nThe investigators noted in 2021, the 4,687,370 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the US cost $108 billion. The highest costs, $18.5 billion, were accounted for by heart failure (HF), $11.2 billion by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), and $10.9 billion by stroke. Adults aged at least 65 years accounted for 64% of all cardiac-related hospitalizations, and those aged 45 to 64 years accounted for 30% (55% men; 70% White; 16% Black; 9% Hispanic).\n\n\u201c \u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021, significant upward trends were noted in the following:\n\nHF\n\nStroke\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nSTEMI\n\nChest pain\n\nHypertensive emergency\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nAortic dissection\n\nSudden cardiac death\n\nPericarditis\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia\n\nPulmonary heart disease\n\nTotal costs increased over $10 billion across the study period, although not linearly, with significant declines likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Total CV-related costs by 2030 may reach $131.3 billion.\n\nProcedures most performed in all years included coronary, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-bypass peripheral vascular surgery, pacemaker replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n\nStudy limitations include ICD codes may underreport primary diagnoses, NIS data are event-level related to discharge with unclear interpretation of how readmissions affect the data, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations and costs was undetermined.\n\n\u201cOverall, from the years 2016 to 2021, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures demonstrated upward trends,\u201d the investigators wrote. \u201c\u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Some [or one] study author(s) declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

The striving for healthier balance sheets was also aided by the post-pandemic demand boom, experts added.\n\n\u201cThe Covid pandemic triggered a realisation among corporates to maintain higher liquidity for unforeseen challenges. Simultaneously, consumer behaviour, including post-pandemic revenge buying, boosted company performance and added to cash reserves,\" said\n\nBhavesh Shah, Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking at Equirus.\n\nShah further highlighted the role of a robust stock market in strengthening balance sheets. \u201cThe IPO and QIP rallies enabled companies to deleverage. Debt repayment has become a key objective for IPO fund utilisation, as markets reward companies with debt-free operations,\" he said.\n\nSeveral other factors such as digitisation-led increase in productivity and regulatory changes also helped Indian companies better manage their balance sheets.\n\n\u201cDigitisation has driven efficiency, stringent cost controls have improved productivity, and regulatory changes like the insolvency code have streamlined operations. Additionally, companies prioritised liquidity as a buffer against uncertainties,\" said Feroze Azeez, deputy CEO of Anand Rathi Wealth Limited.\n\nWhile the cost of equity is higher than debt, companies are likely to maintain a balanced mix to optimise financial strategies, he said.\n\nStronger earnings for export-led businesses in the post-pandemic period coupled with shorter capex cycles also helped, experts said. \u201cExport-driven sectors like IT and pharma experienced super-earning cycles post-Covid. Short-cycle capital spending in areas like renewables and 5G upgrades also led to better IRRs, contributing to cash accumulation,\" said Santosh Pandey, president and head of Nuvama Professional Clients Group.\n\nIndia Inc\u2019s balance sheets today are among the strongest in years, with leverage significantly reduced.\n\n\u201cAs of March 2024, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio of BSE 500 companies stands at 2.5x-2.7x compared to 4.5x before Covid. This means companies can repay their debt in 2.5-3 years of earnings \u2014 a healthy position,\" said Pandey.\n\nDeployment of cash reserves in 2025\n\nWhile global and domestic demand concerns persist, analysts believe strategic investments such as inorganic opportunities will drive growth.\n\nPandey highlighted a shift toward short-cycle projects and M&A activity. \u201cSectors like solar, cloud computing and pharma are focusing on acquisitions rather than building plants from scratch. Companies are prepared to deploy cash as demand slowdown is seen as temporary,\" he said.\n\nEquirus\u2019 Shah echoed the sentiment, predicting a balanced approach. \u201cIndian companies will invest in manufacturing capabilities to meet future demand while maintaining a cautious reserve. Inorganic growth through acquisitions will also be a key strategy, especially for companies with robust business models,\" Shah said.\n\nAccording to Azeez, for listed players, spending will depend on demand dynamics. \u201cWhile FMCG shows mixed trends, with rural areas outperforming urban, EMS is thriving, and cement players are focusing on acquisitions. Unlisted sectors like education, renewables, and transport could see significant investments,\" he said.\n\nWith slower organic growth anticipated in certain sectors, India Inc is likely to turn to inorganic opportunities. Consolidation across sectors will drive growth, analysts said.\n\n\u201cA clear polarisation exists between companies with strong financials and those struggling. Companies with scale and solid business models will act as consolidators, using funds to acquire smaller players and strengthen their market position,\" said Shah\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nNuvama\u2019s Pandey added that M&A activity has been strong across sectors, offering exponential growth opportunities. \u201cA strong war chest makes it easier for companies to act quickly in such scenarios,\" he said.\n\nDespite challenges such as global tariff wars and a weakening domestic demand environment, India Inc\u2019s strong cash reserves and reduced leverage position it to navigate 2025 with confidence. \u201cThe demand slowdown is seen as temporary. Companies are unlikely to hesitate in deploying cash to capitalize on growth opportunities,\" Pandey said.\n\nFirst Published: January 03, 2025, 17:37 IST"

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "Visionary Realms is an ambitious game studio that recently launched early access for Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen, a massively multiplayer online role-playing social fantasy game.\n\nThe December 13 launch on Steam was a bittersweet moment for the team, which had been run by EverQuest game pioneer Brad McQuaid. McQuaid died at age 50 in 2019, in the midst of the game\u2019s development.\n\nBut the team carried on and after years of development, the company was able to launch early access for Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen, a social high-fantasy MMO game for the the PC. It is available for purchase on Steam for $40.\n\nIn an interview, the game leaders said they were honored at the reception it received for bringing back the classically spirited challenge, discovery, awe and social experience to MMOs, and it hopes sharing the story inspires other indies.\n\n\u201cTo get to this point is very proud and humbling experience,\u201d CEO Chris Rowan said in an interview with GamesBeat. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got it out on early access on Steam and the reaction has been spectacular, with mostly positive reviews, great sales. We\u2019ve been finding our way around this concept of open development, doing things with the doors and windows open and inviting the community to be part of that, and sharing what\u2019s happening, and taking their feedback and including them in testing from an earlier stage than is has ever really been done.\u201d\n\nChris Rowan is CEO of Visionary Realms.\n\nHe said there were ups and downs to that process, but the net was positive. The game is still in development but now it can earn revenues through early-access payments.\n\nThe early access build contains six zones, six playable races and 12 playable classes. Players can level up to level 40 and more content will be added throughout the early access period. So far, the game has reached 40,000 unique players and more than 6,000 have logged in on early access.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are great and the concurrency on Steam is strong,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cThe concurrency has been better than expected and quite healthy. It did really well on the first day and has been steady since then. We actually got into the top 10 on day one, which was exciting for a small studio like us.\u201d\n\nGameplay features\n\nPantheon: Rise of the Fallen is a classic social fantasy MMO.\n\nThe features available include \u201cadventure together,\u201d where players form adventuring parties and guilds with friends to overcome greater challenges to receive greater rewards. It also has a \u201cclimb everywhere\u201d feature where players can climb nearly any surface in the game for adventure in every direction.\n\nIt also has discover with perception, where you can uncover clues, dialogues and outcomes that enrich the story and your travels using the perception system. And you can plunder the depths, where you can delve into copious dungeons with other players where every cavern may lead to treasure, battle or a new friendship.\n\nPlayers can fight a menagerie of monsters in challenging combat where strategy, knowledge and teamwork make the difference between victory and defeat. Players can adopt roles such as the Tank, Healer, Damage or Support and choose from a variety of class skills to customize their loadouts.\n\nPlayers can also acquire powerful and iconic equipment and rare abilities that boast of the places you\u2019ve been in the game and the battles you\u2019ve won. These things can empower your character with enhanced attributes and unique effects. The denizens of the world Terminus have wide variety and can spawn with a multitude of different behaviors which alters their actions and strategies, ensuring no two adventures are alike.\n\nOrigins\n\nA community screen from Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen\n\nThe team started contemplating the game back in 2015, in the days of casual games, pay to win, and other kinds of new business models being tested. World of Warcraft had had its good run and the team wanted to do a classic MMO that set a really high bar for quality.\n\n\u201cBrad and I had worked together, and he felt like it was felt very passionately that it was time to kind of bring back the spirit of MMOs, what really made them great at the core, in the very beginning and and there were a lot of people who were into the idea,\u201d said Rowan. \u201cThere were a lot of people who felt they had been orphaned from what made MMOs so great. That momentum built. And before we knew it, Visionary Realms was launched, and was time to build Pantheon.\u201d\n\nThe game was a slow burn at the beginning and was very thinly funded. The ideation happened and the first serious funding came in 2017. That helped bring on more people and help accelerate the company. But then tragedy struck.\n\n\u201cWith Brad passing in 2019, people thought the project was going to die,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cMaybe counter intuitively, it got the community and the team even more charged up. You know, when you believe in something, when you\u2019re building a game because you want to play it yourself, when you\u2019re really passionate about it, then people are going to see it through. We\u2019ve been largely driven by passion and sacrifice and creativity and hard work. And to be perfectly honest, resourcefulness and grit.\u201d\n\nOvercoming challenges\n\nA community screen from Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen\n\nThis is the work of a small indie studio which had to overcome numerous very serious challenges along the way while watching other efforts not make it to the finish line, Rowan said.\n\nAlong the way, the company stayed independent and true to its vision through grit, persistence, plus some angel and crowdfunding.\n\nVisionary Realms challenged the boundaries of dev transparency\u2013 with a lot of openness, interactivity and honesty with the community. That eventually became its path to success, Rowan said.\n\nThe team peaked at about 30 people, and now it has around 18 to 20, some of them part-timers who have other jobs. The company has raised less than $10 million through a combination of investors and crowdfunding.\n\n\u201cThe amount of effort and commitment and passion and sacrifice has just been astonishing,\u201d Rowan said.\n\nAsked how the team held together after McQuaid\u2019s passing, Rowan said, \u201cI would credit everybody involved in the project \u2014 their commitment, their passion, and that goes as for the community as well. People wanted to see this game built. We were building it because we thought the world needed a game like this. Again, we were building it because we wanted to play it. Just like Sven Vinge said at The Game Awards.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSven said that the game of the year [for 2025] is going to be built by a studio. It might not be us, but it can be built by a studio that\u2019s building a game that they want to build, that\u2019s not designed by the marketing department, but designed by passionate game designers. And after the shock wore off to a person, everybody said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do this. We got to do this because the world needs this game. We got to do this for Brad. We got to see this through.\u2019 Our resolve was renewed.\u201d\n\nThe company also successfully changed the art style to be more timeless and speed up development. It also made a significant shift in management style that resulted in faster production, iteration and progress.\n\nChris Perkins is creative director of Visionary Realms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trend for a lot of Souls-like games now. I would describe our game as a classic MMO,\u201d said Chris Perkins, creative director, in an interview with GamesBeat. \u201cThere\u2019s a classic genre of MMOs when the genre itself first got started. It was very different and unique in style than modern MMOs. They were very social. They weren\u2019t holding your hand a lot. They could be even pretty punishing in some cases. One of the ways I think we differentiate ourselves is with that classic style.\u201d\n\nPerkins added, \u201cWe\u2019re bringing it into 2025 and we\u2019re not interested in making a really cumbersome, like a fossilized game that\u2019s really difficult for people to get into. We recognize a lot of the advancements in quality of life that have been made over the years. We want to make a game that\u2019s more accessible, but we want to make a game in the modern era that really taps into that classic formula that has kind of been lost.\u201d\n\nTo the team, classic means games that were expected to be more of a shared experience among players. There\u2019s more of a social element. The game wasn\u2019t as on rails. And the goal was to make a more challenging MMO in the mechanics, but also where there was a risk-reward in that there is some sting from a death, Perkins said.\n\n\u201cThis may be the last chance we have. In fact, this might be the last studio that is really leaning into believing this can be a style of MMO that has legs today,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to to do something here that may not have another chance. There\u2019s a lot in that that\u2019s driving us.\u201d\n\nFor good or bad, the latest AI tools didn\u2019t arrive in time to be really useful in the development of the game. The team is still experimenting with AI but Rowan said it\u2019s not quite there yet.\n\n\u201cWe got to EA before the AI tidal wave hits,\u201d Rowan said.\n\nThe roadmap\n\nVisionary Realms is working on its next addition to Pantheon.\n\nThe current aim is to take in the massive amount of feedback coming in now and polishing the game that has been released. The team thinks of the current offering as a slice of the game. Then the next task is to ramp up the next part of the world, which his massive. On the tech side, the company plans to upgrade to the Unity 6 operating system with new optimizations and better performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real journey, against many odds, with many bumps along the way,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a really tough year in the past year in the industry, with a lot of studios falling by the wayside. I\u2019m just pleased that through our community support and the passion of the team and the support of customers that we\u2019ve been able to make it here, and we plan to get even stronger from here.\u201d\n\nBrad McQuaid of Visionary Realms. He died in 2019 but would be proud of Pantheon.\n\nThe team was small but it made good choices about focusing on easy-to-use, accessible game-building technology. The team built its own platform with a focus on low code and no code, using Node Graph technology. It allows designers who aren\u2019t programmers to get content into the game without having to interact with the programmers, Rowan said.\n\n\u201cIt is really quite amazing that a team of this size, with this budget, has managed to pull this off,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cThe proof is in the pudding. It\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are loving it, our passion and long hours, combined with really good, accessible technology,\u201d Rowan said."

            "article_content": "Juuse Saros stopped all 27 shots he faced, and the Nashville Predators shut out the Vancouver Canucks by a 3-0 final on Friday night at Rogers Arena. The result gives the Preds a victory in their first game of 2025 and snaps a three-game skid to end the previous year.\n\nSteven Stamkos scored Nashville\u2019s first of the night before Gustav Nyquist and Colton Sissons added empty-netters to close out the evening as the Preds were able to grind out two points.\n\n\u201cUndefeated in 2025,\u201d Stamkos said with a smile. \u201cIt was one of those games where maybe we didn't necessarily have our best early\u2026 Juice made some big saves that kept us in it, and [the penalty kill] was great like it's been all year. And we talked about building\u2026 Good teams find ways to win when it's not necessarily their best. It's a tough League to win in each and every night, so tonight, maybe we can build off that. It was a back-and-forth game of chess at certain times, but we found a way to get one and played pretty solid, and in the third [we] didn't give them too much. And it's a pretty good recipe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought [Saros] was obviously really good for us,\u201d Preds Head Coach Andrew Brunette said. \u201cI thought we did the things that make us a good team. We had some success and we had some opportunities offensively. It was just a little bit, maybe sporadic in how we managed the puck and how we managed the game. So we made it harder on ourselves. I liked our third period. I thought there was a commitment to close a game out, and we haven't done that a whole lot. So for me, that was an opportunity to hopefully build off it a little bit.\u201d\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying, neither club was able to find the back of the net through the first half of the contest, but late in the second stanza, Stamkos started a give-and-go with Jonathan Marchessault, and No. 91 for the visitors finished the play with a one-timer past Canucks goaltender Kevin Lankinen for a 1-0 lead.\n\n\u201cI knew we had some guys trailing late, and I didn't really want to force anything into the middle, so I pulled up, and the play is probably made because [Filip Forsberg] drives the net and takes one guy and then Marchy's behind\u2026and he gave it back,\u201d Stamkos said of the play. \u201cSo it was [a] great play, and nice to see that go in, obviously a big goal in the way the game was going.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the Canucks continued to push - including on a late power play - but Saros and his teammates turned aside each opportunity before Nyquist and Sissons added insurance to finish things off.\n\n\u201cIt was a good one to start the year,\u201d Saros said. \u201cObviously our penalty kill came in huge at the end, we didn\u2019t give them much on those power plays. That was huge. So [it was a] good one to get the two points.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like we've been in plenty of these types of games throughout the season, we just haven't closed some of them,\u201d Stamkos said. \u201cSo, you have to build off something. And at this point, with where we are in the standings, obviously we need points. And what do you have to lose, really? I mean, let's go out there and not play scared to lose. Let's go out and try to win. And that was a good third period for our group.\u201d\n\nNow, the Preds will turn their attention to Calgary and a matchup with the Flames tomorrow night with a chance to have a successful back-to-back set.\n\n\u201cJust build some momentum off the win,\u201d Stamkos said. \u201cI think we can clean up some things, but anytime you win, it's a bit better feeling about yourself going into the game tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNotes:\n\nPredators forward Ozzy Wiesblatt made his NHL debut on Friday night after being recalled from Milwaukee (AHL) on Thursday. The winger registered two hits and drew a penalty in 9:40 of ice time.\n\nPrior to Friday\u2019s game, the Preds also recalled defenseman Spencer Stastney and forward Fedor Svechkov from Milwaukee. Both players appeared in Friday\u2019s game, with Stastney recording 17:54 of ice time in his first game with Nashville this season.\n\nTommy Novak (upper body) and Jeremy Lauzon (lower body) both missed Friday\u2019s game with injuries and are both considered day-to-day. The Preds also placed defenseman Adam Wilsby on Injured Reserve with his upper-body injury to join forward Cole Smith on IR. Winger Zach L\u2019Heureux also missed Friday\u2019s contest as he served the first of his three-game suspension.\n\nPer NHL Stats, Steven Stamkos scored his 567th career goal to pass Patrick Marleau (566) for 24th place on the NHL\u2019s all-time list. Mike Bossy ranks 23rd with 573.\n\nThe Predators will now jet off to Calgary to face the Flames tomorrow night at the Scotiabank Saddledome before concluding their five-game trip on Tuesday in Winnipeg."

But when I wish to distract myself from the sullenness of working from home and not really engage in hardcore gaming, I find myself reaching out to my phone and not a gaming console. Sadly, though, the ease of gaming on a phone accompanies the immediate regret in the form of neck pain. Hence, with the turning of the year, I am placing my bets on a phone that doubles as a gaming console with the help of specialized tools to aid in connecting to a larger display \u2014 monitor, TV, or projector.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the Redmagic 9S Pro, a phone dedicated to gaming. Below, I will take you through all the ways the phone can be utilized for gaming on a large screen and explain why you would want to consider buying one, especially if you like casual gaming without much commitment. Before that, here\u2019s a brief introduction to the phone.\n\nWhy the Redmagic is unique\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s unusual cyberpunk aesthetic already makes you believe it is a one-of-a-kind phone. No matter the angle you look at it, it unequivocally amazes you with its distinctive appearance. Despite the sharp edges and neat skin, the designs feel very refined.\n\nRedmagic has nailed some of the firsts as a phone company before gaming phones became a norm. It introduced capacitive trigger buttons to help you be better at gaming. Additionally, a high-speed fan is built inside the Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s chassis to vent out any heat ejected from the chipset while gaming. The fan is automatically activated while running games or charging, so the phone never appears to heat up much.\n\nDriving the phone is an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which is paired to 12GB of RAM on my unit. On top of that, a striking 6.8-inch AMOLED display with an under-display selfie camera and a nearly bezel-less outlook makes it one of the finest and most attractive pieces of mobile hardware from 2024.\n\nWith these features and specifications, the Redmagic 9S Pro is grossly underutilized by being limited to Android games. I say this because while Android phones \u2014 or phones, in general \u2014 have adopted key hardware components from PCs, the software has yet to match the same finesse as desktop environments. And while there are methods to force-fit mobile devices into PC setups, the endeavor requires efforts that not everyone is willing to make.\n\nThis is where the Redmagic 9S Pro comes into play, with its specialized modes to activate a gaming console-like environment without any special hackery. This is accomplished with a mix of software features and external controls that the phone offers.\n\nA special button for a special mode\n\nBesides the circular power button on the right side of the Redmagic 9S Pro lies a two-way slider switch with slopey accents and metallic red color. Flicking the switch upward activates a special mode on the phone called \u201cGame Space.\u201d When you turn on Game Space, the screen rotates horizontally as the phone enters a distinct interface.\n\nThe games installed on the Redmagic 9S Pro are listed in the \u201cGame Lobby\u201d as large tiles that can be stacked in a list or snapped to a grid. Tapping each tile or card shows when the game was installed and the total number of hours you have spent playing the specific game. The space also lets you access one-touch controls to toggle audio and fan on or off along with different controls to change the view of the interface.\n\nWith the red switch slotted upward, the phone is restricted to the game space, and you can\u2019t use it normally. But this interface is not where the Redmagic 9S Pro really stands out. The features, although less nuanced, can also be seen in the form of game modes for other devices.\n\nInstead, the 9S Pro offers a rather unique experience when you project the phone onto a bigger display.\n\nGaming on a big screen\n\nThis Redmagic gaming phone\u2019s true superpower lies in its desktop mode. While other phone brands emphasize a desktop environment for work \u2014 as Samsung does with its Linux-like DeX interface \u2014 the 9S Pro favor a gaming-oriented setup that appears particularly inspired by a console.\n\nThere are two ways to utilize this specialized mode: by connecting to a display either with a wired connection or wireless. In both methods, you can either directly cast the contents of the phone\u2019s screen onto a larger display or extend like you would with a computer or laptop, so you can continue interacting with your phone while also viewing the Game Space being cast to an external display.\n\nWith the wireless mode, you start by searching for a wireless display \u2014 one that supports Miracast or Chromecast \u2014 on the Redmagic 9S Pro.\n\nThe wireless casting functionality is native to Android, which means the phone\u2019s screen is simply duplicated on the larger display. A setup like that isn\u2019t exactly beneficial, especially while gaming, since you would need to look at the phone to ensure you are hitting the right buttons. So, Redmagic takes a different approach to remedy that issue.\n\nIn the extended screen mode, you see a display like the one seen below. The screen turns into a wireless touchpad that you can use to interact with the interface.\n\nNext, when you cast the phone wirelessly onto a bigger screen, the phone\u2019s screen can be turned into a large virtual gamepad. On the left of this gamepad, there\u2019s a direction pad and on the right, a set of ABXY buttons. Two joysticks for right and left are overlaid with these sets of buttons. This layout appears as an overlay on top of the actual game\u2019s interface.\n\nThe overlay can be hidden, so it\u2019s easier to navigate through the maze of convoluted menus on mobile games, and resurfaced when you are ready to dive into action. This is even useful for games that don\u2019t inherently support gamepads, as the keys can be remapped over existing buttons.\n\nThe overlay buttons are massive and fairly responsive, and I could get used to them with barely any practice or peeling my eyes away from the TV. With this setup, I thoroughly enjoyed games such as Call of Duty: Mobile, especially since I could continue using the capacitive triggers that I had mapped for shooting.\n\nWith the unfair, pleasantly unethical, advantage that a large 50-inch TV added for me, I scored some of the best kill-to-death ratios in deathmatches and constantly emerged as the MVP in the majority of the games. The bigger graphics and the brighter colors of the TV also make it much easier to scan for enemies across the landscape.\n\nAdding to the experience was the fact the Redmagic 9S Pro transmitted the visuals at up to 120 frames per second (fps) with low graphics and 60 fps with \u201cUltra\u201d video quality. Even though this is practically a mobile game upscaled to a massive display, the finer nuances are nearly undetectable from just a few feet away. More importantly, there is barely any latency on wireless connections even when my router sits in a different room.\n\nWhere wired connection rules\n\nWith wired connections \u2014 either through HDMI or DisplayPort, the Redmagic 9S Pro automatically connects in the most appropriate setting, and you don\u2019t need to manually toggle between duplicating the screen or extending it. With the red Game Space switch set to its off position, the screen is simply duplicated just as it is for any other phone that supports video out over its USB port. But when the switched is flicked on, the external display shows its console-like interface while the phone\u2019s display becomes a touchpad.\n\nThe cast display adjusts to the size and resolution of the second screen, eliminating any letterboxing or empty bars around the display.\n\nHowever, with the phone hooked to a display using a wire, using it to control the larger screen can feel cumbersome and jarring. Thankfully, there are a few ways around it. First, you can connect a keyboard and a mouse to operate the console-like ecosystem. Redmagic even gives you tools like key-mapping software that you can use to assign various keyboard and mouse buttons to each game separately. While it would be slightly easier if there were presets for games, you have to configure the control manually.\n\nNonetheless, you still get the advantage of using a keyboard and mouse for games that could benefit from the extra physical keys. More importantly, since the keyboard and mouse connected via this method are not detected in games like PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty: Mobile, you are not paired with other players using emulators or similar setups for first-person shooter gaming.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of ports, I use a . I relay an HDMI cable out of the hub and connect a wired mouse and keyboard through the USB ports. And to make sure I don\u2019t run out of power while gaming on a large screen, I connect a charger using the hub\u2019s USB-C port.\n\nI chose this hub over any other because it comes with a screen on top, which means I can see charging speeds and get a sense of the screen resolution via HDMI. Thanks to this tiny screen, I know the Redmagic 9S Pro projects to my 4K monitor at full 4K resolution at 60Hz.\n\nWhile getting higher refresh rates could be a challenge over HDMI 2.0 (since most USB hubs without Thunderbolt don\u2019t support HDMI 2.1 or newer standards), you can still use a USB-to-DisplayPort cable to relay contents at 4K resolution and up to 120Hz refresh rate. The onboard Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\u2019s GPU can handle the demand for this high-resolution output over the USB port. At the same time, the fan helps maintain a steadily convenient temperature inside the phone despite the load.\n\nA wired setup involving a mouse and keyboard is especially great if you like to game while sitting at a desk. But like I said at the beginning of the article, my objective this winter is to hole up in my sofa for as long as I can. So, I turned to a Bluetooth controller that lets me play games and control the phone\u2019s interface from a distance.\n\nFor this task, I picked up the , one of the most versatile gaming controllers. Although the extendable section is designed to keep the phone \u2014 or a Nintendo Switch \u2014 in between the two sides of the gamepad, Bluetooth connectivity means it works seamlessly even without a device tucked in those claws. Each of the grips features an individual vibration motor for rumble, and the trigger buttons have hall effect switches, similar to a PlayStation 5\u2019s controllers, for a precise level of pressing, which can be especially useful for controlling throttle in racing games.\n\nThe primary reason I chose this controller is that it can connect to a device in four different modes. In wireless connections, it can emulate a regular Android gamepad but can also replicate a PlayStation DualShock controller and Nintendo Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons. In wired mode, it can work as an Xbox controller. Based on the game I run \u2014 and whether it supports an Android gamepad or not \u2014 I can choose the mode to run.\n\nFor instance, since Call of Duty has native support for PS DualShock controllers, I was simply to slot the GameSir into the DS mode and use it native key mapping without any hackery. However, for games such as Mech Arena or Genshin Impact that do not support controllers (at least on Android), GameSir\u2019s app can also be used to map custom controls over practically any game.\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro, hooked to my 50-inch QLED TV and connected wirelessly to the GameSir controller, makes the ideal setup for me to enjoy a plethora of games without actually having to get up from my cozy spot.\n\nA similar setup can be achieved using a wireless connection, with two wireless devices in a signal chain \u2014 the controller and the wireless display. You might witness some latency, though, which may not be favorable for competitive games. But at the same time, having the phone handy also means you can control the interface almost immediately, especially if the controller you are using does not have a touchpad built in.\n\nI spent countless hours trying to nail the same level of dexterity on Call of Duty: Mobile as with the virtual joystick above, but jamming physical buttons and joysticks feels like a more satisfying experience than tapping a screen. It might be a different case with you, but the Redmagic 9S Pro\u2019s flexibility allows plenty of room for adjustment for all measures.\n\nBesides Call of Duty, I extensively played Shadow Fight 4 (comparable to Street Fighter), especially since it offers native controller support. Similarly, Farlight 84, a lighthearted battle royale that looks like Fortnite and Apex Legends had a baby, is another title I thoroughly enjoyed thanks to this setup.\n\nBut that\u2019s not where I settled. Of course, Android allows all sorts of emulation tools to run classic Nintendo, PlayStation, PSP, or even older Windows games. So I installed Dolphin Emulator, PPSSPP Emulator, and Winlator, snagged a few free ROMs off the internet, and ran a bunch of my favorite games from my childhood and teenage years, such as Need For Speed: Most Wanted, successfully rotting on my couch for the entirety of the Christmas break.\n\nAll this happened while I barely experienced any glitches in the gameplay with these emulators and got stable frame rates, thanks to the constantly running fan at the back. Redmagic also allows connecting to a laptop or Windows PC and running Android games while you utilize the connected peripherals, but that\u2019s not the utility I\u2019m going after.\n\nThe Redmagic 9S Pro is oddly satisfying\n\nOver the time I have spent with the Redmagic 9S Pro, I have had an unwavering opinion that there is no phone like it. Perhaps the ones that are are from the same brand. After a slight learning curve, I thoroughly enjoyed gaming on the Redmagic 9S Pro and especially cherished times when I spent playing games on the larger display. If you tap into the world of emulators, there\u2019s hardly a chance you will emerge from it without spending a few days just wheeling in nostalgia.\n\nEven without the casting features, the Redmagic 9S Pro is commendable as a gaming phone. Besides a souped-up flagship Snapdragon processor, the dedicated cooling fan and the trigger button give you such an advantage over competitors. Meanwhile, the RGB lighting sets the right mood for gaming.\n\nMost importantly, for the hardware it brings, the 9S Pro has an unbeatable price. For , you get the unlocked version that also includes an 80W fast charger. If you were to spend $250 more, you could get a newer generation of gaming phone from Redmagic with a Snapdragon 8 Elite instead and 16GB of RAM, though that might be overkill. The 9S Pro, on the other hand, brings unmatched value and can be just as good as a primary phone as it will be as a secondary phone specifically for gaming \u2014 all depending on your budget. Either way, you will be blown away."

By standardizing processes and fostering collaboration, MLOps amplifies the overall efficiency and impact of ML initiatives.\n\nQ5: How do you manage large-scale model training?\n\nA: Managing large-scale model training requires efficient resource allocation, optimized data pipelines, and robust infrastructure. Distributed training strategies, like model and data parallelism, are crucial for scaling workloads and reducing training time. Cloud-native solutions, such as AWS, significantly lift the burden by offering tools like Amazon SageMaker for distributed training, automatic model tuning, and seamless integration with storage solutions like Amazon S3. These platforms provide scalability, dynamic resource allocation, and cost efficiency, allowing teams to focus on improving model performance without managing complex infrastructure, ultimately streamlining the training process and accelerating delivery of production-ready models.\n\nQ6: What\u2019s your strategy for real-time inference?\n\nA: Real-time inference requires a strategy that balances latency, cost, and scalability while meeting the application\u2019s performance requirements. Cloud-based solutions like Amazon SageMaker are often preferred for their ability to autoscale and handle variable workloads efficiently. For example, in a fraud detection system for financial transactions, real-time inference ensures decisions are made within milliseconds to prevent unauthorized activity. Low-latency solutions typically rely on optimized endpoints and hardware accelerators like GPUs or Inferentia chips to minimize response times.\n\nThe choice between cloud and on-premises depends on factors such as compliance, cost, and infrastructure availability. Batch inference, suitable for periodic processing like nightly reporting, contrasts with real-time inference, which demands near-instant responses. While cloud services excel in dynamic scaling for real-time use cases, on-premises solutions might be preferred for applications requiring strict data governance or where bandwidth costs are a concern. By aligning the inference type with the workload\u2019s needs and choosing the right deployment environment, organizations can achieve a cost-effective and performant real-time AI pipeline.\n\nQ7: What role does generative AI play in your solutions?\n\nA: Generative AI plays a transformative role in my solutions by enabling innovative ways to generate, analyze, and interact with data. It empowers systems to create realistic and contextually accurate outputs, such as synthetic data for training models, personalized content, or automated decision support. Additionally, generative AI simplifies coding by generating boilerplate code, providing suggestions, and breaking down complex implementation concepts into actionable steps\u2014much like how a drill bit simplifies mechanical tasks. By leveraging models like transformers and diffusion models, I integrate generative AI into workflows for tasks like content generation, anomaly detection, and multimodal understanding. This approach not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of solutions but also opens doors to solving problems that traditional AI methods struggle to address, such as creating human-like interactions or scaling creative processes in real-time applications.\n\nQ9: How do you manage technical debt in AI systems?\n\nA: Managing technical debt in AI systems requires a proactive and structured approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and long-term efficiency. I prioritize clear documentation, modular architecture, and robust testing frameworks to reduce complexity and facilitate easier updates. Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions help identify and resolve inefficiencies or outdated practices before they compound.\n\nIn addition, I emphasize the importance of monitoring and retraining models to address issues like data drift or outdated assumptions, which can quickly lead to technical debt in AI systems. Leveraging automation tools for CI/CD pipelines and version control ensures that changes are seamlessly integrated and tracked, reducing manual effort and mitigating risks.\n\nQ10: How do you see AI/ML infrastructure evolving?\n\nA: AI infrastructure is evolving towards more sophisticated and automated solutions. The adoption of serverless computing will enhance deployment capabilities. Implementation of edge computing will reduce traditional limitations. Focus on sustainability will increase resource efficiency. Security considerations will become increasingly important. Integration with emerging technologies will streamline AI operations. Continuous learning will remain essential for innovation.\n\nAbout Pranav Murthy\n\nPranav Murthy is a distinguished AI/ML leader with extensive experience in research and practical applications.

            "article_content": "When I was planning my reporting trip to Africa this past June, I knew I wanted to visit Bamenda, Cameroon. I\u2019d heard about an archdiocesan-wide push to have an adoration chapel in every parish and had been impressed with the local leader, Archbishop Andrew Nkea.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know, at least not until just weeks before my visit, was that I would be walking into a literal warzone.\n\nBamenda is in the epicenter of the Cameroonian Civil War, which pits English-speaking separatists against the Francophone-dominated government. Since 2017, the conflict has killed roughly 8,000 people.\n\nLearning about the war definitely gave me second thoughts about visiting Bamenda. At the same time, it also put the archdiocese\u2019s push for Eucharistic adoration in a new, more dramatic light. And in the end, my conviction that this story needed to be told won out.\n\nThe daylong visit to Bamenda had its share of hair-raising moments, including an episode where our jeep got stuck on a muddy backstreet \u2014 even my host, a local monsignor, said he was scared in that moment.\n\nBut by God\u2019s grace, I left Bamenda unharmed and with many powerful encounters with local Catholics. I hope that my story\u2019s portrayal of their complete and total reliance upon the Lord in the midst of the ongoing conflict will inspire other Catholics to renew their own Eucharistic devotion \u2014 because I know it inspired me."

            "source": "The Motley Fool",
            "article_content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.26%) is home to 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy, making it the most diversified of the major U.S. stock market indexes.\n\nBut the S&P is weighted by market capitalization, so the largest companies have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. As of this writing, the following five companies have a combined market cap of $14.9 trillion, representing 28.8% of the entire value of the index:\n\nApple AAPL -0.20% ) Nvidia NVDA 4.45% ) Microsoft MSFT 1.14% ) Alphabet GOOG 1.31% ) GOOGL 1.25% ) Amazon AMZN 1.80% )\n\nThe S&P 500 delivered a return of 25% during 2024, whereas the S&P 500 Equal Weight index, which assigns the same weighting to every stock regardless of its market cap, was up by just 10%. The difference can be partly explained by the average gain of 61% in the preceding five stocks.\n\nA lot of the value those five companies created in 2024 came from their efforts in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. They are forecast to spend hundreds of billions of dollars combined this year in their quest for AI supremacy. If it pays off, they could become even more influential over the S&P 500.\n\n1. Apple: 7.6% of the S&P 500\n\nApple recently launched its Apple Intelligence software for users of the latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. It includes a suite of new AI-powered writing tools that can summarize emails and texts and instantly generate replies on command. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize users' notifications after learning their preferences.\n\nEven the Siri voice assistant got an upgrade thanks to an integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nApple Intelligence makes use of the company's latest chips -- the A18 Pro for the iPhone, and the M3 and M4 for iPads and Macs -- which were specifically designed for processing AI workloads on-device. This hardware, and the future generations that will follow, paves the way for Apple to continue pushing the boundaries of the AI revolution with new features.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, so this company could eventually become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers, bar none.\n\n2. Nvidia: 6.6% of the S&P 500\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered the first AI supercomputer to OpenAI in 2016. Now, it's the leading supplier of graphics processors (GPUs) for developing AI, and most tech giants are clamoring to put them in their data centers.\n\nNvidia just started shipping its new Blackwell GB200 GPUs, which offer a substantial leap in performance over its previous generations. The Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, can perform AI inference at up to 30 times the speed of the equivalent H100 system. That gives developers the computing power they need to deploy the largest AI models to date.\n\nDemand is significantly outstripping supply for Blackwell chips, and they're likely to be the dominant driver of Nvidia's sales growth. The company is on track to generate a record $128.6 billion in total revenue during fiscal 2025, which wraps up at the end of this month, followed by almost $200 billion in fiscal 2026.\n\nDespite an 800% gain over the past two years, Nvidia stock might still be cheap, so it could become an even larger piece of the S&P 500 this year and beyond.\n\n3. Microsoft: 6.3% of the S&P 500\n\nMicrosoft rocked the tech sector at the start of 2023, when it announced plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI. It has since used the startup's technology to launch its own AI virtual assistant called Copilot, which is now embedded in its flagship software products, including Windows, Edge, and Bing.\n\nCopilot can also be added to the 365 productivity suite for an extra monthly subscription fee. It allows users to instantly create text and image content in Word and PowerPoint, which can speed up their workflows. Organizations around the world pay for 365 for more than 400 million of their employees, so even if only a fraction of them add Copilot, it could become a big source of recurring revenue.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership also helped Microsoft launch a portfolio of AI services on its Azure cloud platform. Azure AI has become a go-to destination for developers seeking state-of-the-art data center computing infrastructure and ready-made large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's latest o1 series to build their own AI software.\n\nMicrosoft allocated $55.7 billion to capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024, which ended June 30, and most of that figure was related to AI data centers and chips. It had already spent a further $20 billion during its fiscal 2025 first quarter, ended Sept. 30, so it's on track to invest a record amount in its AI ambitions during the current year.\n\n4. Alphabet: 4.1% of the S&P 500\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, which has a 90% market share in the internet search business. AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are transforming the way people access information online, which is threatening traditional search engines like Google. To protect its dominance, Alphabet launched its own family of AI models, called Gemini, along with a chatbot with the same name, but it's also using them to change how Google Search responds to queries.\n\nIn the past, people would enter a query into Google Search and it would produce a list of links to third-party websites. Now, an increasing number of queries return a text-based response at the top of the results, which is generated by AI. Alphabet is taking that to the next level with its new AI Overviews feature, which incorporates text, images, and links to third-party websites to provide a more holistic answer to almost any question.\n\nAlphabet says the links within Overviews receive more clicks than if they appeared in traditional search results instead, which is great news since Google Search accounts for most of the conglomerate's total revenue. If Alphabet successfully pulls off this transition, not only will it protect its dominant market share, but it might also create an opportunity to generate record amounts of revenue by selling ad spots to businesses in Overviews.\n\n5. Amazon: 4.1% of the S&P 500\n\nAmazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, and it's integrating AI into the entire customer experience. It offers a virtual shopping assistant called Rufus that can help customers find the most suitable product for their needs. It even uses a tool called Project Private Investigator inside its fulfillment centers, which uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they're shipped out to reduce costly returns.\n\nThen there's Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest provider of cloud services. It wants to dominate the three core layers of AI: data center infrastructure, LLMs, and software. To achieve this goal, AWS designed its own chips, its own family of models called Titan, and its own AI virtual assistant called Q.\n\nAWS generated $27.4 billion in total revenue during the third quarter of 2024, which ended Sept. 30. That was a 19% increase from the year-ago period. However, AI revenue within AWS soared by a triple-digit percentage, and Amazon says this business is growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its lifecycle.\n\nAmazon allocated around $75 billion to AI capital expenditures during 2024, and it's likely to spend even more in 2025 to cement its leadership position."

Unfortunately, not every computer is built for the best games on the market. Laptops and pre-built PCs don't always ship with the best possible specs. And if you built your computer, it can be very expensive to update the internal components.\n\nIf you want to play the latest and greatest games, but aren't sure if your PC can handle them, you'll need to know what graphics card you have installed. Once you have this information, you can then compare it to the minimum requirements for the game you want to play. Here's how to figure it out.\n\nOur Top-Rated Graphics Cards\n\nWhat's a Graphics Card?\n\nWhen you turn on your computer, the images that appear on the screen\u2014whether it's a simple Word document or a complex 4K gaming experience\u2014are generated by a graphics processing unit (or GPU). These chips can range from simple \"integrated graphics,\" which are part of the motherboard or processor, to larger, more powerful expansion cards that have their own fan system.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese cards\u2014often called \"discrete\" or \"dedicated\" graphics cards\u2014can usually perform more powerful tasks than integrated graphics, like better 3D gaming, accelerated video rendering, or even certain non-graphical jobs like mining Bitcoin. This extra utility comes at the expense of higher power usage, increased heat, and more space in your computer, which is why you won't find dedicated graphics cards in ultra-thin laptops.\n\nThere are two main components of a graphics card: the chip that does the work, and the card (which includes other hardware like the cooler, voltage regulation module, and so on). There are two main chip manufacturers today: Nvidia and AMD (though Intel's Arc line has also hit the market). There are many card manufacturers\u2014Asus, EVGA, MSI, Gigabyte\u2014that use these chips, adding their own tweaks to set themselves apart. One manufacturer's version may have better fans, can come overclocked, or have a better warranty.\n\nKnowing what graphics card you have can be confusing, since the chip itself has its own model number that's separate from the card's model number. So when you're looking up what graphics card you have, you'll need to decide whether knowing the chipset is enough (for example, the \"Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060\") or whether you need the actual manufacturer and model of the card (such as the \"EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 Superclocked,\" which uses Nvidia's chipset). The former is very easy to find in Windows, while the latter is a bit more complicated.\n\nJust like any other computer component, graphics cards can become outdated over time. The card you bought in 2015 is unlikely to play 2025's AAA games at high settings, so if you're ever unsure whether a game like Elden Ring will run on your PC, you'll want to compare its minimum or recommended requirements to the hardware you currently have.\n\nFind Out What GPU You Have in Windows\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out what graphics card you have from the Windows Device Manager. Type \"Device Manager\" into the Start menu and press Enter to launch the Control Panel. Click the drop-down arrow next to Display adapters, and it should list your GPU. If you aren't sure which company designed the chip, right-click on it and choose Properties to see the manufacturer\u2014AMD, in my case. (Note that Device Manager uses your graphics drivers to determine what GPU you have, so if you suspect the wrong drivers may be installed, skip to the next section.)\n\nOnce you have the GPU name, you can compare it to the minimum requirements on the game you want to play. Usually, a higher number denotes a better card\u2014so a game that requires an RX 580 may not run well on an RX 480, which is less powerful (though there are sometimes ways around that). If you're comparing two cards that use different naming schemes\u2014like AMD's RX 580 and the more powerful RX Vega 56\u2014you may have to do a little research to see which card is more powerful. Information like release year and price can usually give you the answer.\n\nFind the Manufacturer and Model Number\n\nIf, for some reason, you need to know exactly what model video card you have, you'll have to do a bit more work. The manufacturer is easy enough to find with a third-party app called Speccy. Download the free version, start it up, and click the Graphics option in the sidebar. Scroll down and look for the Subvendor entry, which should tell you who made the card in your PC. (You'll also be able to see how much video RAM your card has, among other specs.)\n\nUnfortunately, this won't tell you the exact model number, which you'll need for, say, warranty claims or tech support. (Asus makes a few different RX 580 cards, and they'll need the exact model number to help.) For that, you'll need to search your email for the receipt (if you bought the card online). Otherwise, you'll need to open the PC up. In this case, find the graphics card, remove it, and look at the sticker on the side\u2014it should have the model number you need.\n\nMake sure to write this information down somewhere so you don't need to crack your PC open next time\u2014you never know when you might need it!"

The computational demands of running generative AI models make traditional cloud deployments look like a kid\u2019s lemonade stand. According to Gartner\u2019s projections, enterprise AI workloads will consume more than 30% of total cloud infrastructure capacity by 2025.

In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"
