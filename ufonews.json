        "article_content": "From UFO sightings to Big Foot \u2014 inside the eeriest National Park in America: \u2018Like the X-Files\u2019\n\nWhen Navajo Ranger Stanley Milford Jr and partner Jon Dover were assigned to the department for investigating paranormal activity in Arizona and Utah\u2019s Monument Valley, the pair couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cOh my goodness, we\u2019re going to be like The X-Files,\u201d said Dover.\n\nBut as Milford reveals in \u2018The Paranormal Ranger \u2013 A Navajo Investigator\u2019s Search for the Unexplained\u2019 (William Morrow), Dover\u2019s hunch was accurate. \u201cI never ex\u00adpected to go looking for ghosts, Bigfoot, UFOs, extra-terrestrials, or Navajo witches,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201c[But] the cases led me to one conclusion: There\u2019s much more to this world than we can imagine.\u201d\n\nAuthor Stanley Milford, Jr. and his new book about a paranormal US National Park.\n\nThe son of a Navajo father and Cherokee mother, Milford\u2019s 11-year stint investigating paranormal activ\u00adity within Navajo reservations defined his career.\n\nFrom UFO sightings in Arizona to Big Foot encounters in New Mexico\u2019s Chuska Mountains, Milford treated each case with equal seriousness. \u201cFor those who experienced paranormal encounters, the event could be traumatizing,\u201d he writes. \u201cI learned to shut my mouth and open my ears.\u201d\n\nSome investigations followed him home. In November 2010, Milford visited offices in Window Rock, Arizona. \u201cThe employees heard disembodied voices, felt un\u00adseen hands touch them,\u201d he writes.\n\nUFO sightings were among the Park\u2019s paranormal activities. ktsdesign \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nThere were also Big Foot sightings. Whocares1799/Wirestock Creators \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nSoon, Milford was targeted. \u201cI felt an invisible finger touch my lip. It moved across my mustache, from one side to the other,\u201d he recalls. \u201c[Then] I heard two male voices, about three feet away. \u201c[But] There was no one there.\u201d\n\nLater, a chair shot across a room, a laptop battery crashed against a wall and scores of coins rained down, all landing heads up. \u201cThe only conclusion was that a spirit was saying, \u201cHeads up, I\u2019m here,\u201d he adds.\n\nThen Milford\u2019s cousin and fellow investigator Tony was pursued too. He found a dollar bill with \u2018DIE\u2019 scrawled on it and saw a 12-inch butcher\u2019s knife fly across his kitchen. \u201cThe spirit was trying to send a message,\u201d writes Milford. \u201cIf it wanted to hurt us, it could.\u201d\n\nToday, Milford no longer doubts there are powers beyond our comprehension. \u201cParanormal inves\u00adtigation is less about what\u2019s out there than what\u2019s right here in front of us,\u201d he writes."

        "article_content": "The King of UFOs\n\nA television show has claimed that King Charles piloted a UFO across the skies in Canada, in 1975. This shocking claim comes in an interview of an eyewitness included in. The eyewitness claimed to have seen the monarch at the helm of a spaceship in Canada. The witness, Dan Costello, said Charles III -- then the Prince of Wales -- was one of the three pilots steering a prototype UFO at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia.Costello said Charles was positioned nearby at HMS Endeavour serving as a helicopter pilot when he was summoned for a secret mission known as \u2018Project Serpico\u2019. The submersible vehicle he helmed apparently discharged a bluish ionic flame, referring to the electrically charged particle, that scorched the earth underneath it.But was it a UFO? Costello said he didn't think it was extraterrestrial but it might be technology developed by Nikolai Tesla.Costello said the craft had dual rotor blades like a helicopter but would also just sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on and no sound of propulsion just a crackle of electromagnetism.The movie-maker, Christopher Lee, however, told UK Metro that Costello's claims might be quite far-fetched. \"I\u2019ve literally interviewed five or six times for over 10 hours \u2013 his story has been consistent and the technical detail he has supplied has been astonishing \u2013 you only see about seven minutes of him in the film,\" Lee said.\"I also looked into the area where he claims it happened and there are large underwater caissons and the British Navy did have a presence here combined with Prince Charles being stationed as a helicopter pilot on HMS Endeavour \u2013 so it does seem possible.\"Lee said Charles had long had a keen interest in UFO and the documentary says Prince Philip was a \"stickler for alien sightings too\".\"I have been contacted by someone close to Charles that claims Charles had a UFO experience so I\u2019m sure he does believe there is something in the skies that we can\u2019t explain,\" Lee said."

        "article_content": "UFO 50 \u2013 one of the best games of the year (Mossmouth)\n\nA reader explains why he thinks everyone should play indie compilation UFO 50 and why no-one will agree on which are its best games.\n\nUFO 50 was created by Derek Yu (creator of Spelunky), his childhood friend Jon Perry, and a load of other extremely talented game developers. The game was announced in 2017 and finally came out last month and I am pleased to say the wait was more than worth it.\n\nUFO 50 is a collection of 50 complete 8-bit style games (not mini-games) created by the fictional company UFOSoft, with many lasting several hours. As of the time of writing, I have spent around 27 hours on the game and have completed six games and have 100% on no games. There\u2019s so much to explore and I imagine I will be playing this game for many more months (years?) to come. Here\u2019s some of my personal favourites.\n\nParty House\n\nYou\u2019re having a house party and need to invite guests but you want to make sure they\u2019re worth it, whether they bring more cash in or make your party more popular. You also need to make sure the party doesn\u2019t get too rowdy or someone will call the cops! This is one of the most simple games in the collection but it\u2019s also one of the best.\n\nMost time will be spent in the \u2018shop\u2019 section deciding which guests you would like to add to your roster, all of who cost popularity to add. Some earn popularity, some earn cash, and some have special abilities. As you use your cash to expand the house, the game really shines. Using your abilities, you\u2019ll find yourself booting, swapping and predicting guests, while watching those numbers tick up ever so satisfyingly.\n\nOnce you get popular enough, you can start to add star characters to your roster. You have 25 days and 25 parties to get four-star characters at one time to throw the ultimate party. With five scenarios to pick from, each with different characters and a random scenario mode, it\u2019s easy to sink several hours into this one.\n\nParty House is a lot of people\u2019s favourite (Mossmouth)\n\nCamouflage\n\nOut of the many puzzle games in the collection, this one is my favourite. You play as a chameleon who uses the power of camouflage to escape from the various predators in each level. Unlike most games in this collection, Camouflage is very forgiving, enabling you to go back to your previous square when you die.\n\nThe game starts out with stationary enemies but later introduces enemies that patrol around the level, making for some frantic puzzle solving. The puzzles aren\u2019t too difficult but they sure do make you feel smart.\n\nBushido Ball\n\nImagine a samurai-themed fighting game but it\u2019s really just Pong. There are six playable characters each with unique abilities and stats. Each player can roll, slash the ball or do their special when they have enough power. The aim is to beat all the other characters to win the tournament.\n\nWith a full run taking less than 20 minutes, Bushido Ball had me constantly thinking \u2018Just one more go\u2019 until I had spent over two hours in the game and finally beat the tournament.\n\nQuibble Race\n\nThis is the strangest game in the collection and I love it. The aim is to make the most money by betting on Quibble races, by whatever means necessary. This involves bribing characters to break quibble\u2019s legs, drug them or even poison them \u2013 yes, you can play as a quibble murderer.\n\nYou can also sponsor quibbles, which will give you more money when they win, encouraging you to go for the underdogs which makes for some of the most entertaining races. Watching these quibbles constantly fall over and banging the table as your prize quibble falls over and dies is one of the most entertaining experiences gaming has to offer, especially in three-player co-op.\n\nDevilition\n\nDevils have invaded the town and it\u2019s your job to stop them! In each of the 10 rounds, you must use your randomly-assigned characters (and cannons) to create a chain reaction on a 10\u00d710 board that will kill all of the devils. However, you must avoid killing the villagers, as if there are more devils than villagers at the end of the round then you lose! Once you have placed all of the characters, you may detonate one of them and begin the chain reaction. Watching as your creation destroys everything in sight is immensely satisfying.\n\nThere\u2019re many more games in the collection I would have loved to talk about but the best thing I can say is just go play UFO 50 for yourself. What\u2019s so magical about the game is that everyone has a completely different experience and everyone\u2019s top five will be vastly different. By the time I reach 50 hours, this list will probably have changed entirely \u2013 there\u2019s still 15 games I haven\u2019t got round to at all!\n\nBy reader Daniel T.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like Bushido Ball there\u2019s 49 other games to try (Mossmouth)\n\nThe reader\u2019s features do not necessarily represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.

These sightings continued for 17 days, prompting suspicions that Russian or Chinese agents might be involved.On January 6, 2024, a clue emerged when a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota, Fengyun Shi, was caught flying a drone near Langley. His drone, which had photographed Navy ships, was abandoned after getting stuck in a tree. Shi was arrested a week later as he prepared to board a flight to China and was charged with unlawfully photographing classified naval installations.While US officials have confirmed similar drone swarms near Edwards Air Force Base in Nevada, the Defence Department has yet to publicly identify those behind these apparent surveillance efforts."

An altered photo of Bryre was among them.\n\nIt was a picture of the teen and her friend at the beach that Bryre had posted to her social media account when she was 16 years old, but the picture had been altered to remove the girls\u2019 bathing suits and showed them appearing nude. The picture was the same as the one she had posted except for the nudity, and although Bryre knew it had been digitally altered, she was shocked and horrified at how real it looked.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw the picture it was just really confusing, how it was so realistic, and I was like, why? Why is there this picture of me? I don't talk to this guy. Neither does (my friend), It was just overwhelming.

In November 2010, Milford visited offices in Window Rock, Arizona. \u201cThe employees heard disembodied voices, felt un\u00adseen hands touch them,\u201d he writes.\n\nUFO sightings were among the Park\u2019s paranormal activities. ktsdesign \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nThere were also Big Foot sightings. Whocares1799/Wirestock Creators \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nSoon, Milford was targeted. \u201cI felt an invisible finger touch my lip. It moved across my mustache, from one side to the other,\u201d he recalls. \u201c[Then] I heard two male voices, about three feet away. \u201c[But] There was no one there.\u201d\n\nLater, a chair shot across a room, a laptop battery crashed against a wall and scores of coins rained down, all landing heads up. \u201cThe only conclusion was that a spirit was saying, \u201cHeads up, I\u2019m here,\u201d he adds.\n\nThen Milford\u2019s cousin and fellow investigator Tony was pursued too. He found a dollar bill with \u2018DIE\u2019 scrawled on it and saw a 12-inch butcher\u2019s knife fly across his kitchen. \u201cThe spirit was trying to send a message,\u201d writes Milford. \u201cIf it wanted to hurt us, it could.\u201d\n\nToday, Milford no longer doubts there are powers beyond our comprehension. \u201cParanormal inves\u00adtigation is less about what\u2019s out there than what\u2019s right here in front of us,\u201d he writes."

        "article_content": "The museum offers more than just vampire artifacts, though. There is a display with exorcism chairs examining \u201clevels of demonic ownership,\u201d a seance exhibition and a doll room which Crimi said sees \u201cthe most paranormal activity\u201d of any space in the museum.\n\n\u201cSometimes things will move,\u201d Crimi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s demonic, necessarily. I think it\u2019s just, you know, activity \u2026Children love to also go into dolls. People like to go into dolls. So it\u2019s just a way of the spirits feeling happy.\u201d\n\nAs word has spread about the eerie museum, its number of visitors have grown to 500 each weekend, Crimi said. Visitors travel across the nation and internationally to see VAMPA\u2019s collection of antique vampire killing sets, the largest in the world.\n\nCrimi said they\u2019ve benefitted from the widespread cultural appeal of the paranormal \u2014 an interest which, for all the technological advancements of the 21st century, is still as compelling to many people as it was in the Dark Ages.\n\n\u201cPeople are fascinated by what they don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been a fact of life. People are searching and trying to understand life as they\u2019re trying to deal with the concept of death.\u201d\n\nThe various objects in the museum\u2019s collection are sinister, but what makes the site special is the presence of \u201ca little girl by name of Abigail,\u201d Crimi said.\n\nCrimi has lived on the property for more than 30 years. He said during that time, employees often argued amongst themselves over who had spilled the milk, and his own daughters, when they were young, would accuse each other of having drank the milk.\n\n\u201cThis was a dairy farm, so we think there\u2019s a correlation with Abigail and milk, and we still have experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cEven last week, I poured milk for the cats, and within two minutes, the cats weren\u2019t even in the room, half the milk was gone.\u201d\n\nCrimi said that unlike other, more negative experiences he\u2019s had with paranormal activity, which he declined to share, Abigail is \u201cnot demonic in any sense of imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s more mischievous,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a little girl, so she likes to play.\u201d\n\nInvestigation into Abigail and other paranormal activity on the VAMPA Museum property is one of the subjects of a two-part documentary, \u201cParanormal Pickers,\u201d featuring Crimi and paranormal investigator Eric Mintel and his team. It premiered at Doylestown\u2019s County Theater on Oct. 11.\n\nCrimi said putting all the spookiness of the museum aside, he sees it as a family-friendly experience that emphasizes goodness in the world.\n\nThere\u2019s a room in the museum dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel and his battle against the devil \u2014 a room which Crimi said is his favorite because it helps express the museum\u2019s central focus: \u201cHow to fight evil.\u201d\n\nEven objects like carved skeletons aren\u2019t necessarily meant to be scary, Crimi said. The Stoics, for example, displayed skulls with the Latin phrase, \u201cMemento Mori\u201d \u2014 \u201dRemember you will die\u201d \u2014 as an affirmation of life.\n\nCrimi said the museum has donated to St. Jude\u2019s Hospital for Children and other charitable causes, and he wants to continue to grow their community impact in the coming years.\n\nThe museum is open year-round, Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m., and by appointment during the week. Admission is $15 for adults, $8 for children ages 6-17 and free for children under 6. Information about upcoming events and special ticketed experiences can be found on VAMPA\u2019s Instagram."

However, they lacked the cupule which was common in most seeds of the period. This prompted scientists to determine that the variety was 40 million years older that what was previously estimated.\n\nAlasemenia has a coat that is extends outward and forms wing-like lobes. The broad and convex structure of these wings helped the seeds to fly in the wind. The research notes that three-winged seeds of Alasemenia were adapted better to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings.\n\nAccording to the published study, experts compared Alasemenia against two other known winged seeds from the Late Devonian period. Both Warstenia and Guazia had four wings. While the former\u2019s wings were short and straight, the latter\u2019s were broad and flat."

But there\u2019s one enigmatic figure that has players scratching their heads\u2014a god who appears briefly in a crucial cutscene, yet remains shrouded in secrecy.\n\nZhu Bajie\u2019s first appearance in the story. | Image Credit: Game Science\n\nThis mysterious deity, glimpsed in the Chapter 4 ending animation, has sparked curiosity and speculation among fans. What\u2019s even more fascinating is that the character\u2019s origins are apparently unknown even to Game Science, the developer behind the hit game.\n\nThe Tale of the \u201cDiscount God\u201d\n\n\u26f6 \u26f6 \u26f6 \u26f6 \u26f6\n\n\u00d7\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong, based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, has woven a rich tapestry of mythology and mysteriously ambiguous storytelling. But it\u2019s the animated cutscene at the end of Chapter 4 that\u2019s caught the attention of eagle-eyed players.\n\nThis sequence, which delves into the tragic backstory of Zhu Bajie (also known as \u201cPigsy\u201d to Western audiences), features a mysterious god whose identity has become the subject of much speculation.\n\nIn the animation, we see Zhu Bajie\u2019s past self, the once-mighty Admiral Tianpeng, becoming infatuated with a beautiful heavenly maiden. As he follows her, he stumbles upon a private moment between the maiden and this unknown god. This discovery sets in motion the events that lead to Zhu Bajie\u2019s fall from grace and eventual transformation into the pig-like creature we know from the main story.\n\nBut who is this god? Many players initially assumed it might be the Jade Emperor, a major figure in Chinese mythology. However, the truth might be far stranger than anyone imagined:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting that we couldn\u2019t find any official statement from Game Science confirming this story. But if true, it adds a whole new layer of mystery to this already enigmatic character. A god so powerful that he can manifest in a game without even the developers knowing who he is? That\u2019s some next-level divine intervention!\n\nOf course, some players are taking a more pragmatic view of the situation:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nAnd who can blame them? In the world of game development, where budgets can balloon faster than Zhu Bajie at an all-you-can-eat buffet, every little bit helps. Plus, as one astute commenter pointed out, this discount-driven decision-making might be more culturally relevant than we realize:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nWho knew that a mysterious god in a video game could teach us so much about smart shopping?\n\nA Divine DLC Opportunity?\n\nWill the DLC let fans seek justice for their beloved Pig Yaoguai? | Image Credit: Game Science\n\nWhile the Discount God\u2019s identity remains a mystery, some players are already clamoring for more. The original poster\u2019s sentiment (\u201cdeserves a thorough beatdown\u201d) is shared by many who\u2019ve grown attached to the lovable character of Zhu Bajie throughout their journey in Black Myth: Wukong. But will we actually see the Discount God make an appearance in future content? That\u2019s the million-yuan question:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nWhile Game Science has been tight-lipped about official DLC plans, the rumor mill has been working overtime. Some reports suggest that the developer aims to release two DLCs before moving on to their next project, Black Myth: Jiang Ziya. There\u2019s even talk of a release window for the first DLC that appears to be all but confirmed.\n\nOf course, in the world of game development, nothing is certain until it\u2019s officially announced. As one wise commenter put it:\n\nComment\n\nbyu/_-K7NG-_ from discussion\n\ninBlackMythWukong\n\nWhether or not we\u2019ll ever get to face off against the Discount God in a future DLC, one thing\u2019s for certain: Black Myth: Wukong has captured the imaginations of players around the world, weaving together mythology, mystery, and apparently, savvy business practices. And really, isn\u2019t that what great storytelling is all about?\n\nSo, what do you think? Is the Discount God a stroke of accidental genius or a divine accounting error? And more importantly, do you think he could hook us up with a discount on the eventual DLC? Let us know in the comments below!"
