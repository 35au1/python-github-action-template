        "article_content": "It\u2019s not just the Mulders of the world watching the skies anymore \u2013 the Scullys are getting involved. The US Department of Defense (DoD) has released its latest report on UFOs, with some intriguing stats and stories.\n\nAs part of a recent effort to take strange sightings more seriously, the US government set up the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to provide a way for people to report incidents so they could be officially cataloged and investigated.\n\nTo avoid half a century\u2019s worth of baggage, the government avoided the term \u201cUFO,\u201d rebranding sightings as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). The A in the new name originally stood for \u201cAerial,\u201d but was made more general to also cover weird things seen in space or oceans.\n\nThe latest Consolidated Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena has some fascinating insights. This report covers the time period of May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024, with 757 new incidents reported this year. That brings the total number of incidents reported to AARO since it began to 1,652. Of the new reports, 708 occurred in the air and 49 were seen in space, while there were no new ocean-based incidents.\n\nThe most common form that UAP take is lights in the sky, which accounts for 65% of the reports gathered this year. Orbs, spheres and otherwise round objects account for 22%. The iconic disk shape only made up 1% of reports, funnily enough.\n\nLet\u2019s get it out of the way early \u2013 according to the report, \u201cAARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.\u201d Instead, 49 cases were officially closed after further investigation was able to pin them to mundane sources, with 70% being attributed to balloons. Drones, birds, satellites and aircraft accounted for the rest, with the expansion of SpaceX's Starlink constellation accounting for a growing number of cases of mistaken identity. Another 243 cases were recommended for closure, but will be peer reviewed first.\n\nFrustratingly, the vast majority \u2013 444 cases \u2013 lacked enough data to make a conclusion, so they\u2019ve been placed in an active archive. This means they\u2019ll be reopened if new data becomes available, and they\u2019ll be checked against new cases for signs of patterns or trends that could lead to explanations.\n\nAn unresolved case of a UAP flying past a Navy fighter jet US Navy/Public Domain\n\nIf you\u2019ve done the math, you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re left with 21 cases. And these are the really interesting ones \u2013 the sightings with \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors\u201d that means they merit deeper analysis. These could potentially indicate breakthrough aerospace technologies operated by foreign (human) groups, the report says. The DoD will investigate with the help of intelligence and science and technology partners.\n\nThe standout case was a report from the crew of a commercial flight that almost collided with a cylindrical object off the coast of New York. AARO is still investigating what this might have been.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only potential safety issue, although the others involved Identified Flying Objects. The report outlines 18 times where drones were flown over protected areas, including one that stuck around for nearly two hours. In October 2023, drones were spotted flying over a nuclear facility in Virginia for six nights in a row. In another case, a drone crashed and was recovered by law enforcement, who are still investigating where it came from.\n\nSince a lack of data is one of the main problems, AARO is testing a new sensor system called GREMLIN. This uses a mix of 2D and 3D radar, GPS, radio, electro-optic infrared, and ADS-B flight tracking, which would help detect, track and identify UAP, and confirm or rule out obvious explanations faster. A short trial was conducted in March 2024, and a longer, 90-day test run will follow soon at a site of national security, the report says.\n\nHopefully that\u2019ll give us a better idea of what\u2019s going on in our skies, seas and space. It\u2019s probably not aliens, but the answer \u2013 or answers \u2013 could still be fascinating.\n\nYou can read the full report here (PDF).\n\nSource: DoD"

        "article_content": "UFO sightings and alien abductions are often reported by folks in the boondocks without any witnesses around to back up their stories.\n\nNot for Linda Napolitano, who was in 1989 taken from her New York City apartment and beamed onto a spaceship by extraterrestrials, as 23 onlookers bore witness, it is claimed.\n\nNapolitano's story has gripped UFO enthusiasts for decades. Now, the incident has exploded onto the small screen \u2014 and into the courtroom.\n\nA Netflix show presents the abduction as an 'elaborate hoax,' and Napolitano has fought back with a lawsuit accusing the streamer of defamation.\n\nHer complaint reopens a rift between a husband-and-wife duo of alien researchers and raises tough questions about those who say they've encountered visitors from space.\n\nAs millions of viewers stream The Manhattan Alien Abduction, and lawyers duke it out in court, concerns about who is being honest will doubtless intensify.\n\nWhile the US government is increasingly open to discussing aliens, it's unclear whether those with abduction stories are telling the truth, or suffering from false memories, mental health issues or just making it up.\n\nNapolitano, a stay-at-home mom, stands by her story that on the night of 30 November 1989, three aliens kidnapped her outside her 12th-floor Lower Manhattan apartment.\n\nLinda Napolitano, 77, has stuck by her story of being abducted by aliens from her Manhattan apartment in 1989\n\nThey made her levitate out her window and into a spacecraft hovering above the city, where they carried out experiments on her, before returning her to her bedroom, she says.\n\nBut this astonishing event wasn't her first brush with aliens, she claims.\n\nThirteen years prior, upstate in the Catskills, she recalls finding a strange bump on the side of her nose.\n\nThis was later identified as a mystery foreign object.\n\nSeveral months before the 1989 incident, Napolitano says she wrote to UFO researcher Budd Hopkins about that incident in the Catskills, and joined his support group for abductees.\n\nHopkins believed the object in her nose was implanted by aliens.\n\nAn X-ray purportedly shows the object, but, when a specialist came to check Napolitano's nose, it could not be found.\n\nAfter the 1989 incident, Hopkins scoured downtown for people to corroborate Napolitano's story.\n\nAbout 20 people witnessed it; some even said they saw Napolitano floating above her building, it is claimed.\n\nHopkins documented this in his book Witnessed: True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge Abduction.\n\nBut he used pseudonyms for the witnesses, casting doubt on their authenticity.\n\nAmong the purported witnesses were two guards for then-UN chief Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar \u2014 but these testimonies have also been questioned.\n\nNapolitano insists they were all genuine onlookers who saw the night's mind-boggling spectacle.\n\nThe Netflix recreates Napolitano's story of being levitated out her window and into a spacecraft hovering above the city\n\nThe docuseries presents archive footage of Napolitano pointing up to where she says the abduction took place\n\nUFO researcher Budd Hopkins' hypnosis sessions with Napolitano have been called into question\n\n'If I was hallucinating, then the witnesses saw my hallucination,' she told Vanity Fair in 2013.\n\n'That sounds crazier than the whole abduction phenomenon.'\n\nHopkins' then-wife, Carol Rainey, a filmmaker and UFO researcher, was also embroiled in the case.\n\nShe initially believed Napolitano and they became friends, she said, but over time she grew skeptical.\n\nRainey says Hopkins interviewed abductees under hypnosis in search of suppressed memories.\n\nBut the results of his sessions with Napolitano were not credible, she said.\n\nThe three-part Netflix docuseries features interviews with Napolitano, 77, who now lives in Tennessee, and Rainey, who died in 2023.\n\nIt also features archive footage of Budd, who died in 2011.\n\nIn the show, Rainey, then divorced from Budd, said her ex-husband had 'lost his objectivity' and may have guided Napolitano's comments under hypnosis.\n\nShe vowed to 'continue to ask questions' about the suspect abduction story.\n\nIn her appearances, Napolitano maintains she told the truth.\n\nOnly a 'sociopath' would fabricate such a grand narrative, she says, while accusing Rainey of debunking her in a bid to 'get even with Budd.'\n\nNapolitano's story has gripped UFO enthusiasts for decades\n\nNapolitano (left) and Carol Rainey started out as friends but fell out over the abduction story.\n\nAn X-ray purportedly shows a mystery object in Napolitano's nose, but there are questions over its authenticity\n\nShe's in part backed up by her son Johnny, who appears in the documentary, though his likeness is obscured.\n\n'There\u2019s no way I believe she would want to make anything like this up,' he says.\n\nHe recalls seeing three 'beings' in the family living room, in what he calls a 'terrifying' experience that left him feeling 'hopeless.'\n\n'I just try to erase it from my life,' he says.\n\nAccording to Napolitano, the aliens were not done with her family after that night in 1989. She says they came back years later and targeted her family, giving them nosebleeds.\n\nNapolitano, Hopkins' estate, and others filed the lawsuit against Netflix, Rainey's estate, and others at New York Supreme Court, two days before the show started streaming on October 30.\n\nThe complaint seeks an undetermined amount of monetary damages for six claims, from fraud to defamation, and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nAnother request to stop the show from screening was not granted in time.\n\nThe complaint says Napolitano 'was not remotely close to be like or appear as the person that is on screen' and that she 'never had any bone to pick' with Rainey.\n\nNapolitano 'was set up as such a villain for purposes of controversy and conflict, all of which was a patently and deliberately false portrayal to support the false narrative of the truth,' it adds.\n\nNetflix did not answer our request for comment.\n\nNapolitano told DailyMail.com that she could not 'take any risks' by discussing her abduction amid the lawsuit.\n\n'I don't talk about the case at all,' she said."

Maybe, but not because of Apple Intelligence.\n\nThis past week Google officially launched the Gemini app on iOS, allowing iPhone users to get the complete Gemini AI experience. The app is launching just weeks after Apple released the first version of its new Apple Intelligence AI platform, which also included a ChatGPT integration.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis means the iPhone now has access to all of the three biggest AI platforms... well, sort of. Here's what iPhone users should know about the new Gemini app, how it compares to Apple Intelligence, and why the iPhone could be the best device for AI now.\n\nGoogle brings Gemini app to iPhone\n\nThe Gemini app is now available for free on the App Store, although it is only compatible with iPhones at launch (sorry, iPad users). It includes the full suite of Gemini features such as text and image generation, live chat, study aid tools, image search, assistant features, and more. It's worth noting that you may need a Google Gemini Advanced subscription to access certain features.\n\nAll that's required to download the Gemini app is iOS 16 or above (and adequate storage, of course). That includes all iPhone models starting with the iPhone 8 and later, plus the iPhone SE 2nd and 3rd generation.\n\nThis is important to note since very few iPhones are compatible with Apple Intelligence right now. Only the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max, iPhone 16/16 Plus, and iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max can access Apple Intelligence as of late 2024. That's a far smaller list of compatible devices compared with those that can download the new Google Gemini app.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis opens new options for iPhone users who want to tap into AI. If you can't access Apple Intelligence, you now have a competitive new alternative. On the other hand, if you can access Apple Intelligence, you might now be wondering if it's still the best AI tool for your phone.\n\nApple Intelligence vs Google Gemini app\n\napple intelligence vs google gemini\n\nApple Intelligence and Google Gemini are both AI platforms that use large language models to generate text and images and comprehend verbal, text, and visual input from users. Both have some similar features, such as text and image generation, assistant features, and writing aid tools. However, there are some major differences iPhone users should know.\n\nFirst, it's important to keep in mind that Apple Intelligence is still in its early stages. Google Gemini has been out for longer (previously under the name \"Bard\"). As a result, it is a much more fleshed-out AI platform right now. Apple Intelligence will eventually have most of the same features, but Apple is planning to slowly roll them out over the next year, so you may be in for a long wait.\n\nThe main advantage of waiting it out for Apple Intelligence is privacy. Apple Intelligence is only compatible with specific iPhones because it runs mainly on-device, meaning it doesn't send all of your data to the cloud to process AI tasks. Gemini is a cloud-based AI platform, so be aware that Google will most likely save and utilize data from your Gemini interactions in some capacity.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn contrast, Apple emphasized early on that it would not use iPhone users' personal data to train Apple Intelligence. If any data does need to go to the cloud for processing, it is completely anonymized, preserving users' privacy. If data security is important to you, Apple Intelligence may be the better AI platform if it's compatible with your iPhone.\n\nIs the iPhone the best device for AI now?\n\niphone 15 pro max in front of apple intelligence icons\n\nThe launch of Apple Intelligence coupled with the new Gemini app has quickly made the iPhone arguably the best device for AI, perhaps second only to a MacBook. At the very least, the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max and iPhone 16 line-up are now the best phones for AI since they have access to the most AI algorithms.\n\nWe predicted early this year that apps would become the best way to experience AI, rather than dedicated devices. This has largely panned out, especially on the iPhone. That's partly due to the sheer reach the iPhone has thanks to its massive user base. iPhones make up five out of the top ten bestselling smartphones in the world right now.\n\nSo, if a developer wants to get their AI platform to a large number of people as efficiently as possible, launching an iPhone app is the obvious strategy. Of course, that might not be good news if you're an Android user. However, if you're intrigued by the explosion in AI development this year and want to have access to the most algorithms possible, it might be time to buy an iPhone."

Thank you for your understanding!\u201d\n\nIn IGN India\u2019s review of the premiere, the episode earned a rating of 10/10 with the following conclusion: \u201cWith just the first episode, Dandadan has shown what makes anime so amazing, and how the art form gives life to something you just can't see in other mediums.\u201d\n\nThe same Hindi dub can be streamed on Crunchyroll, along with Tamil, Telugu, and English. Dandadan is streaming in Japanese and English dubs on Netflix and Anime Times on Prime Video.\n\nMuse describes Dandadan as follows:\n\n\u201cDAN DA DAN follows Momo, a high school girl from a family of spirit mediums, and her classmate Okarun, an occult geek. The two of them started talking after Momo rescued Okarun from getting bullied. However, an argument ensues between them \u2013 Momo believes in ghosts but denies aliens, and Okarun believes in aliens but denies ghosts. To make each other believe in what they denied the existence of, Momo goes to an abandoned hospital known for its UFO sightings, and Okarun goes to a tunnel that is said to be haunted. In each place, they encounter overwhelming paranormal entities that defy comprehension. Amid trouble, Momo awakens her hidden power and Okarun gains the power of a curse to challenge the paranormal entities!

Portmeirion, Gwynedd, Wales\n\nThis unique village was designed and built by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis between 1925 and 1973 in the style of an Italian village. It is famous for its colourful buildings, beautiful gardens, and as the filming location for the 1960s TV series \"The Prisoner.\" Clovelly, Devon\n\nThis charming village is known for its steep, cobbled streets that lead down to a small harbour. The village is traffic-free, and goods are traditionally transported by donkeys or sledges. The picturesque setting and historic buildings make it a delightful place to explore. Pluckley, Kent\n\nOften referred to as the most haunted village in England, Pluckley is reputed to have a large number of ghosts and paranormal occurrences. Visitors come to explore its spooky reputation and to see locations such as the Screaming Woods, Fright Corner, and various haunted pubs and houses. The village's eerie atmosphere makes it a fascinating destination for those interested in the supernatural.\n\nAnother tiny village in the UK has been compared to a retro 1940s film set.\n\nAnd an abandoned village in England only opens to tourists once a year.\n\n5 Ilam Park is a huge estate that incorporates attractions like Ilam Hall and a tiny stone church Credit: Alamy"

        "article_content": "A section of one of Britain's most important Roman roads has been found after almost 2,000 years.\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered part of the ancient Roman road known as Watling Street beneath modern London's Old Kent Road.\n\nWatling Street was paved by the Romans in 43 AD and ran 276 miles (444km) from Dover to the West Midlands.\n\nThis is the first time that researchers have found physical proof that parts of the Roman highway survive directly below its modern counterpart.\n\nAlthough Roman roads are characteristically straight, it has proven exceedingly difficult to find hard evidence of Watling Street's path through the capital.\n\nHowever, during work to expand Southwark borough's heat network, a 5.8m (19ft) wide and 1.4m (5ft) tall section was found beneath the busy street.\n\nGillian King, director of archaeology at RPS Consulting Ltd, says that the discovery of this section has 'redrawn the Roman road map' for London.\n\nMs King added: 'It is a key finding for archaeological research for London.'\n\nArchaeologists have found a section of one of Britain's most important Roman roads directly beneath modern London's Old Kent Road (pictured), 2,000 years after it was first built\n\nThe Roman road known as Watling Street ran from the port of Dover, through London and up into Wroxester in the West Midlands where it connected the Roman City of Viraconium to the fort of Deva\n\nThe fragment of the Watling Street was found directly beneath the Old Kent Road (pictured). Although archaeologists know that the road passed through London, until now it has been hard to uncover the exact route\n\nWatling Street was built shortly after the Roman invasion in 43 AD and served as one of the most important arterial roads in Roman Britain.\n\nIt ran northwest from the critical port of Dover through St Albans to the Roman city of Verulamium, modern-day Wroxeter, and the fort of Deva, now Chester.\n\nThe road was so important that it was even used by visiting emperors including Hadrian in 122 AD when he ordered the construction of Hadian's Wall to separate England and Scotland.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Roman Empire, Anglo-Saxons named Wroxester 'W\u00e6tlingaceaster' which gradually morphed into 'Watling' after which the road is named.\n\nLike many Roman roads, Watling Street's solid construction meant it remained an important part of the medieval transport system and slowly became absorbed into our modern road networks.\n\nAlthough we have a good idea of the road's general route from historical records, archaeologists have previously struggled to identify its path through London.\n\nHowever, as Southwark Council prepared for construction work, archaeologists were able to uncover a complete section of Watling Street.\n\nThe section sits south of the junction of Old Kent Road and Ilderton Road and is remarkably well-preserved for its age.\n\nThe road (pictured) is made up of three layers: a compacted gravel sealed by two layers of chalk, topped with another layer of compacted gravel and sand\n\nArchaeologists excavated a 5.8m (19ft) wide and 1.4m (5ft) tall section of the 2,000-year-old road\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nIt is made up of three distinct layers with a foundation of compacted gravel sealed by two layers of chalk and topped with another layer of compacted gravel and sand.\n\nThe archaeologists say that there originally would have been another surface layer made up of the same material around the level of the current street but this has been eroded over time and is now lost.\n\nDave Taylor, Museum of London Archaeology project manager, says: 'It\u2019s amazing this section of road has survived for almost 2000 years.\n\n'There has been so much activity here over the past few hundred years, from sewers to power cables, tramlines and of course the building of the modern road, so we\u2019re really excited to find such a substantial chunk of Roman material remaining.'\n\nThe researchers hope this discovery will lead to a better understanding of Watling Street's route and Roman construction techniques.\n\nSouthwark Council's archaeology officer Dr Chris Constable says that excavations in the early 1990s had found a section to the South of Old Kent Road but had not confirmed the exact course.\n\nDr Constable says: 'In the planning for this project, we\u2019d expected to solve this question but the extent of survival of the road is remarkable.\n\n'We hope this project will answer some other archaeological questions in the borough.'\n\nThe Roman Army created highways during the four centuries Britain was under the rule of the Roman Empire. From 43 to 410 AD, it is thought the army created 2,000 miles (3,200km) of surfaced roads across the UK (map pictured)\n\nArchaeologists say that there would have once been an extra layer on top which sat around the level of the modern street but this has long since been worn away and lost\n\nThe London portion of Watling Street was first discovered in 1671 as Christopher Wren rebuilt St Mary-le-Bow following the Great Fire of London in 1666.\n\nBefore this discovery, much of what experts could learn about Watling Street came from a series of Roman documents called the Antonine Itinerary.\n\nThese papers record the names of military stations and the distances between them which allowed researchers to trace the route all the way out to the Roman fort which would become Chester.\n\nArchaeologists now believe that the road ran from the bridgehead on the Thames towards modern-day Newgate near London Wall.\n\nWatling Street then led over Ludgate Hill and the Fleet River where it branched into the main path towards the West Midlands and the Devil\u2019s Highway west to Silchester."

        "article_content": "The microbiome is still a treasure trove for science. This immense ecosystem of microbes (viruses, bacteria and fungi, among others) that populates the gut and other parts of the body helps humans with basic functions such as protecting them from external pathogens or metabolizing certain foods. But the scientific community is still trying to clearly describe everything that happens there and how exactly the inhabitants of this small, great living universe behave. A study recently published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents has delved into the depths of this microbial universe and has discovered a new antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) hidden in bacteria in the microbiome. The research suggests that this microbial universe in the intestine may be a reservoir of resistant genes capable of jumping from one bacterium to another.\n\nThe discovery sheds light on a new, unknown corner of the complex human microbiome, and also provides insight into one of the greatest health threats facing the modern world: superbugs. Antibiotic-resistant microbes cause 1.7 million deaths a year worldwide and, according to a projection published in The Lancet last September, could kill more than 39 million people directly and 169 million indirectly (through association with other pathologies) over the next quarter-century.\n\nThe research identified a new gene (NpmC) capable of neutralizing the action of aminoglycosides, a family of antibiotics used to treat serious bacterial infections. The scientists found this enzyme in an inhospitable place in human and animal microbiomes in China and Canada: it was hidden in non-cultivable bacteria whose complete genomes are unknown. \u201cWe cannot cultivate 98% of the world\u2019s bacteria; we cannot make them grow in the laboratory for various reasons [because they take months to grow, because they feed on other bacteria, because laboratory conditions are toxic to them...]. We only know them from the [partial] genomic information that we extract from feces,\u201d explains the author of the study, Bruno Gonz\u00e1lez-Zorn, director of the Antimicrobial Resistance Unit at the Complutense University of Madrid and advisor to the World Health Organization (WHO) in this field.\n\nUsing these genomic data of unknown function collected in animal and human samples from China and Canada, the researchers were able to synthesize these partial gene sequences in the laboratory and study and understand their behavior. \u201cWe saw that expressing these genes in bacteria in the laboratory confers high levels of resistance to this family of antibiotics, aminoglycosides, which are widely used in intensive care units,\u201d explains the scientist. Specifically, what this gene does, the microbiologist points out, is to place a molecule [a methyl group] in the ribosome, which is a structure of the bacterial cell that physically prevents these antibiotics from binding to the ribosome and performing their antibacterial function.\n\n\u201cWe are just beginning to discover the dark matter of the intestine. The microbiome is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes waiting to be discovered,\u201d says Gonz\u00e1lez-Zorn. Researchers are analyzing new families of genes capable of circumventing the effect of antibiotics and, according to the UCM microbiologist, there are already international scientific groups working \u201cto prevent the creation of this methyl group or to resensitize these bacteria.\u201d\n\nMore genomic surveillance\n\nHowever, there are still many mysteries to be solved regarding the role played by the microbiome in antibiotic resistance, the expert admits: \u201cTechniques do not yet allow us to know in depth the composition of the human microbiome. The entire genome of all bacteria or of bacteria that are present in very small quantities is not known.\u201d In this sense, the microbiologist focuses on strengthening genomic surveillance to tackle one of the major global threats to health: \u201cThe discovery of NpmC as a new mechanism of resistance to aminoglycosides is a wake-up call to intensify genomic surveillance and reinforce global strategies for controlling antimicrobial resistance from a One Health perspective [a comprehensive approach to balance and optimize human, animal and environmental health].\u201d\n\nMar\u00eda del Mar Tom\u00e1s, a microbiologist at the A Coru\u00f1a University Hospital Complex and spokesperson for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), highlights that the newly discovered antibiotic resistance gene \u201chas been found in non-pathogenic bacteria and it must be taken into account that it could reach the clinical setting.\u201d That is to say, it could jump from a non-harmful bacteria to a pathogenic one and make this microbe that causes infections resistant to this family of antibiotics.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to prevent this gene from reaching a clinical setting, but this study can serve to develop new aminoglycosides or antibiotics that avoid this resistance mechanism. It is also necessary to analyze which are the mobile elements that can transmit this gene from one bacterium to another to avoid transmission. But more studies of the genomic environment of this gene are required,\u201d reflects the microbiologist, who has not participated in this research.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"
