            "article_content": "The FAA has placed temporary flight restrictions on the operation of drones over parts of New Jersey, according to a notice published on the agency\u2019s website. The ban on drone activity is likely related to the recent bout of mass hysteria over supposed \u201cdrone\u201d sightings, though the agency hasn\u2019t said so explicitly. The FAA told the New York Times the ban was enacted at the request of \u201cfederal security partners,\u201d without elaborating further.\n\nThe drone ban covers 22 different New Jersey communities and is set to expire on Jan. 17, 2025. It\u2019s not immediately clear why that end date was chosen. The FAA didn\u2019t address Gizmodo\u2019s questions about the specific timing of the flight restrictions and their relation to drone sightings in an email Thursday morning and directed us to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cWe continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,\u201d a spokesperson from DHS told Gizmodo over email. The spokesperson did not address our specific questions on the record.\n\n\u201cIn coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nPeople in New Jersey started reporting odd \u201cdrones\u201d in the sky to police around Nov. 18, according to NBC News, and there have reportedly been sightings every day since, aside from a conspicuous pause on Thanksgiving. The so-called drones have caused more and more people to post videos taken of what they believe to be unmanned aerial vehicles. And while some of the videos are difficult to explain, the vast majority appear to be regular commercial aircraft.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for internet cranks to get worked up about nothing, this drone panic has spread to areas that are unexpected. Several elected leaders have called for action by the federal government, including president-elect Donald Trump who\u2019s both claimed the government is trying to hide something and said they should be shot down.\n\nBut the concern has been bipartisan. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, has called for more action and played up the hype.\n\n\u201cSome of the drones are small. Some of the drones\u2019 flight patterns are erratic,\u201d Schumer said on Sunday, according to NBC News. \u201cMultiple drones flying together can confuse a traditional radar system and that\u2019s why, again, this new technology can really get us the answers that we need.\u201d\n\nPeople are also pointing lasers at commercial flights, an incredibly dangerous activity that can light up the inside of a cockpit and blind pilots. Laser strikes were already a serious problem, but have become so common during the current drone hysteria that the FAA was forced to issue a statement warning the public not to do it. Shining a laser at planes is a federal crime that can bring jail time and hefty fines.\n\nSome of the most difficult-to-believe theories about the drones are coming from elected leaders, including claims by a Republican congressman that they\u2019re actually being deployed by an Iranian mothership off the east coast of the U.S.\n\n\u201cKnow that Iran made a deal with China to purchase drones, motherships, and technology in order to go forward,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey on Fox News Dec. 11. \u201cThe sources I have are good. They can\u2019t reveal who they are because they are speaking to me in confidentiality. These drones should be shot down.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Iran has deployed a drone mothership, despite the fact that Van Drew has access to real power and should know things. Van Drew is a member of the U.S. House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. But nothing would surprise us at this point when it comes to weird sightings. With Trump taking power again in a month, things are shaping up to get so much weirder in the months and years ahead, drones or no drones."

Here's how experts say you can and should, report UFO or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in Canada.\n\nTransport Canada collects aviation occurrence information and enters it into the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, known as CADORS.\n\nIn CADORS reports, Transport Canada said the term \u201cUFO\u201d can include sightings of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs or drones), balloons, meteors, weather phenomena and birds.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u201cIt should not be interpreted to mean something of extraterrestrial origin. The information in CADORS should be treated as preliminary, unsubstantiated and subject to change,\u201d said Flavio Nienow, Transport Canada spokesperson, in a statement.\n\nTransport Canada said they don't have any additional information to provide beyond what can be found in CADORS.\n\nHow does Transport Canada followup on reports?\n\nWhen reports like these are generated, Nienow explained the next steps depend on the type of the incident reported.\n\n\u201cFurther follow up may be undertaken by various organizations including Transport Canada, Nav Canada, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u201d he said. \u201cTransport Canada will use every tool at its disposal in an attempt to find an aircraft found to be operating in an unsafe and unlawful manner.\u201d\n\nNienow said anyone who witnesses unsafe aviation activity should contact Transport Canada or local law enforcement. Witnesses are encouraged to record and provide as much information as possible to help Transport Canada review incidents more effectively. For example, send clear photos or videos, record the date, time and any other identifying marks.\n\nOther aviation incidents may be reported at Incident reporting: Report an aviation incident. Drone-related incidents can also be reported.\n\nHow else can you report?\n\nThe U.S.-based National UFO Reporting Center collects all sorts of reports \u2014 including UFO and UAP reports from Canada, the U.S., and around the world. They encourage people to use their website to report occurrences.\n\nThroughout its history, the organization has processed more than 180,000 reports.\n\n\u201cWe look at every single report. We make an assessment,\u201d said Christian Stepien, the organization's chief technology officer, and follow up on reports that require a more in-depth look.\n\nReports are placed in the organization's databank, where you can review past reports categorized by date and location.\n\nThis publication reached out to the Ontario Provincial Police about UFO or UAP reports and asked how they advise citizens both generally and specifically to report them. We have not yet received a response."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

            "article_content": "Surprising reason why 'aliens are more likely to be seen at Christmas'\n\nFor some, Christmas isn't just about festive cheer; it's also prime time for spotting extraterrestrial visitors, reports suggest. December has become notorious for an increase in reported UFO sightings, and experts believe there's a valid explanation.\n\nChristian Stepien, technical director at the UFO Reporting Centre, notes that fireworks and light shows are often mistaken for otherworldly phenomena. The centre typically observes a \"slight uptick\" in such reports twice annually, with the holiday season being a peak time for these supposed cosmic encounters.\n\nRon James from the Mutual UFO Network told The Daily Beast: \"We do have a slight uptick twice a year in the summer and around the holidays. There are a few reasons why people might be paying more attention: they might be off work, they're doing family activities and things they don't normally do, so there are more possibilities for people to encounter things. Then, of course, there's always Santa Claus and the reindeer.\"\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\"If there is an uptick, I can understand that because there's a lot of people out during Christmas time shopping and doing things. They might be looking up in the air so I can understand it if there is.\"\n\nUfology research has pointed towards a \"significant\" surge in UFO sightings on Christmas Day, clocking in 75 reported cases for 2021. Chris Rutkowski from Ufology revealed: \"Most were simply lights in the sky, and yes, some were of a single red light flying overhead followed by a string of others.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nThere have indeed been historical reports of unidentified flying objects during the festive season dating back to Christmas 1965, with pioneering astronaut Wally Schirra Jr.\n\nAboard Gemini 6 observing an unusual \"object,\" he described at the time: \"We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, probably in polar orbit. Looks like he might be going to re-enter soon [...] You just might let me pick up that thing.\"\n\nComplementing his account, fellow space savant Thomas Stafford observed: \"I see a command module and eight smaller modules in front. The pilot of the command module is wearing a red suit.\"\n\nWally and Thomas sent the control room into a spin with their claims of spotting something otherworldly during their space mission, but it turned out to be a festive prank. Wally whipped out his harmonica to play Jingle Bells, revealing the joke.\n\nMr Stafford recalled: \"Wally came up with the idea. He could play the harmonica, and we practised two or three times before we took off, but of course, we didn't tell the guys on the ground.\"\n\nDiscussing whether Christmas brings more UFO sightings, Ron James chimed in: \"My feeling is that there's not an actual increase in phenomenon occurring. It's more that there's more people in a position to see and experience things that might already be there pretty much consistently.\""

AI agents are programs that let you manage and control Mac or Windows apps using written ChatGPT prompts and voice.\n\nThat\u2019s the future of AI computing I want from ChatGPT and similar AI products. I want to tell AI to look at my screen and do whatever I ask it to. I also want it to perform internet searches on my behalf, whether in the ChatGPT app or a browser. More importantly, I want to do most of it by voice, with the help of Advanced Voice Mode and future versions of it.\n\nOpenAI isn\u2019t quite there, but the demos the company showed during its penultimate \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement tell me we\u2019re heading in that direction.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for Mac now works with even more coding apps. OpenAI also added support for note-taking apps, including the Apple Notes app that comes on all Apple devices. The best part about it is that Advanced Voice Mode can be used to talk to ChatGPT about the contents on your screen.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nWe\u2019re still not getting full agentic functionality from ChatGPT. It\u2019s an iterative upgrade over what OpenAI announced about a month ago for the Mac app. At the time, the company gave ChatGPT the ability to look at the contents on the screen in certain coding apps on the Mac. The feature wasn\u2019t as much an agentic control of the computer as OpenAI leveraged a built-in accessibility API in macOS to read text.\n\nBut OpenAI has built on that, adding support for more coding apps, including Warp, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others. As you can see in the short clips below, you can use the Mac app to instruct ChatGPT to look at the screen in a specific app. You\u2019ll be able to choose which app you\u2019re giving the AI access to, and that\u2019s the only thing it\u2019ll see.\n\nIn addition to expanding support to more apps, OpenAI is also bringing o1 and o1 pro mode to the mix of models that can be used to code for you. Advanced Voice Mode wasn\u2019t a part of these demos, as the OpenAI engineers still used text-based prompts to demo the new functionality.\n\nNow you can code with the power of o1 and o1 pro mode. pic.twitter.com/qdj9RuLRKQ \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThese updates aren\u2019t exciting if you don\u2019t code for a living. But you can already write all sorts of text. That\u2019s where ChatGPT might come in handy if you use a Mac. Here\u2019s where the Advanced Voice Mode feature shines.\n\nOpenAI showed a demo of ChatGPT\u2019s agentic behavior for note-taking apps. The list of supported apps includes Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. The demo below shows ChatGPT looking at a Notion note to understand the context and answer a prompt. The AI then performs a search for factual information about a historic event and generates text trying to mimic the voice of the note\u2019s author.\n\nInstead of typing the prompts, you might want to talk to ChatGPT with Advanced Voice Mode rather than type your prompts. This might boost your productivity, assuming everything works as intended. As you\u2019ll see in the second demo, the AI quickly understands your needs, but it might fail here and there.\n\nAnd you can use Advanced Voice when you work with these apps. pic.twitter.com/drZoRc7xvC \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThen again, we\u2019re still in the early days here. What OpenAI has shown only scratches the surface of what ChatGPT might do one day on Mac and PC.\n\nUntil then, you can try these new ChatGPT capabilities in the Mac app as long as you have access to a premium tier (Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu). OpenAI will bring these features to the Windows app in the future. ChatGPT Free users will also get them next year."

However, Talkie remains downloadable on Google Play, where the app was last updated on Thursday. Users in the US who previously downloaded Talkie from Apple's store can still access the app.\n\nTalkie's official TikTok account, which has 29,800 followers, has not published any updates this week after previously posting daily. In response to a series of user inquiries regarding its removal from the App Store, Talkie attributed the situation to \"technical reasons\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Shanghai-based MiniMax declined to comment on Friday.\n\nLaunched in June 2023, Talkie allows users to create and converse with personalised virtual characters through generative AI technology. It was the fourth-most downloaded app in the US in the first half of 2024, surpassing Google-backed rival Character.ai, which ranked 10th, according to data research firm Sensor Tower.\n\nGlobally, Talkie recorded 17 million downloads in the first eight months of the year, trailing Character.ai with nearly 19 million downloads, according to a Sensor Tower report in September. Talkie's monthly active users reached 11 million in July, with over half living in the US.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinky AI, another AI companion app developed by Chinese tech firm Kunlun Tech, has also disappeared from the US App Store. The Shenzhen-listed company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Yan Junjie, former vice-president of Chinese AI pioneer SenseTime, MiniMax secured US$600 million in a funding round in March led by Alibaba Group Holding, alongside prominent investors including HongShan, Hillhouse Investment and Matrix Partners, according to Itjuzi, a start-up database service. The unicorn was valued at US$2.5 billion at the time, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nOther big-name backers in previous financing rounds included Tencent Holdings, miHoYo and IDG Capital. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nMiniMax's revenue is expected to reach US$70 million this year, driven mainly by Talkie's advertising sales and in-app purchases, the Financial Times reported.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanion AI apps are particularly popular among younger users, with those aged 18 to 35 accounting for more than 70 per cent of the user base for top apps that also include Linky AI and HiWaifu, according to Sensor Tower.\n\nTalkie's domestic twin Xingye garnered 5.25 million monthly active users as of November, ranking seventh among AI apps in China, according to data from AIcpb.com.\n\nIn an interview in August with Chinese media, MiniMax CEO Yan said Xingye \"is not like ChatGPT or Character.AI; it's a community where users can interact with each other based on AI-generated content\".\n\nIn August, MiniMax also ventured into the text-to-video generation space with the Video-01 AI model, which has since been made available on both the mainland and international web versions of the company's consumer-facing Hailuo AI platform. Earlier this month, MiniMax released an image-to-video model that produces animations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, the overseas and domestic versions of Hailuo AI drew 16.35 million and 2.58 million visits, respectively, according to AIcpb.com.\n\nAmid an intensifying US-China tech war, in which AI has emerged as one of the key battlegrounds, many mainland-originated companies have sought to mask their origin over concerns of geopolitical risks.\n\nTalkie lists Singapore-registered company Subsup as its developer.

            "article_content": "Yet realizing measurable business value from AI-powered applications requires a new game plan. Legacy application architectures simply aren\u2019t capable of meeting the high demands of AI-enhanced applications. Rather, the time is now for organizations to modernize their infrastructure, processes, and application architectures using cloud native technologies to stay competitive.\n\nThe time is now for modernization\n\nToday\u2019s organizations exist in an era of geopolitical shifts, growing competition, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. AI applications can help by supporting innovation, but only if they have the flexibility to scale when needed. Fortunately, by modernizing applications, organizations can achieve the agile development, scalability, and fast compute performance needed to support rapid innovation and accelerate the delivery of AI applications. David Harmon, director of software development for AMD says companies, \u201creally want to make sure that they can migrate their current [environment] and take advantage of all the hardware changes as much as possible.\u201d The result is not only a reduction in the overall development lifecycle of new applications but a speedy response to changing world circumstances.\n\nBeyond building and deploying intelligent apps quickly, modernizing applications, data, and infrastructure can significantly improve customer experience. Consider, for example, Coles, an Australian supermarket that invested in modernization and is using data and AI to deliver dynamic e-commerce experiences to its customers both online and in-store. With Azure DevOps, Coles has shifted from monthly to weekly deployments of applications while, at the same time, reducing build times by hours. What\u2019s more, by aggregating views of customers across multiple channels, Coles has been able to deliver more personalized customer experiences. In fact, according to a 2024 CMSWire Insights report, there is a significant rise in the use of AI across the digital customer experience toolset, with 55% of organizations now using it to some degree, and more beginning their journey.\n\nBut even the most carefully designed applications are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. If given the opportunity, bad actors can extract sensitive information from machine learning models or maliciously infuse AI systems with corrupt data. \u201cAI applications are now interacting with your core organizational data,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cHaving the right guard rails is important to make sure the data is secure and built on a platform that enables you to do that.\u201d The good news is modern cloud based architectures can deliver robust security, data governance, and AI guardrails like content safety to protect AI applications from security threats and ensure compliance with industry standards.\n\nThe answer to AI innovation\n\nNew challenges, from demanding customers to ill-intentioned hackers, call for a new approach to modernizing applications. \u201cYou have to have the right underlying application architecture to be able to keep up with the market and bring applications faster to market,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cNot having that foundation can slow you down.\u201d\n\nEnter cloud native architecture. As organizations increasingly adopt AI to accelerate innovation and stay competitive, there is a growing urgency to rethink how applications are built and deployed in the cloud. By adopting cloud native architectures, Linux, and open source software, organizations can better facilitate AI adoption and create a flexible platform purpose built for AI and optimized for the cloud. Harmon explains that open source software creates options, \u201cAnd the overall open source ecosystem just thrives on that. It allows new technologies to come into play.\u201d\n\nApplication modernization also ensures optimal performance, scale, and security for AI applications. That\u2019s because modernization goes beyond just lifting and shifting application workloads to cloud virtual machines. Rather, a cloud native architecture is inherently designed to provide developers with the following features:\n\nThe flexibility to scale to meet evolving needs\n\nBetter access to the data needed to drive intelligent apps\n\nAccess to the right tools and services to build and deploy intelligent applications easily\n\nSecurity embedded into an application to protect sensitive data\n\nTogether, these cloud capabilities ensure organizations derive the greatest value from their AI applications. \u201cAt the end of the day, everything is about performance and security,\u201d says Harmon. Cloud is no exception."

Photograph: iStock\n\nA woman has told the High Court she fears for the safety of her five young children due to \u201cparanormal activity\u201d that has caused tables and chairs to move at her newly provided council home.\n\nLouise and Thomas Stokes took a High Court case alleging they could not stay at their previous home in Mount Temple, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim because of concerns for their children\u2019s health arising from a mould problem. The case was struck out on Friday.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons that a new property the family has been moved into by Leitrim County Council has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \u201cparanormal activity\u201d.\n\nThe family\u2019s original complaint to the High Court was that the local authority did not classify them as homeless even though it was alleged that mould in the first property was so bad had led to hospital visits and forced the entire family to sleep downstairs rather than in their bedrooms.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe claim against the council alleged that works were carried out to alleviate the situation by improving ventilation and removing the mould but the problem returned. Those works were insufficient, the family claimed, in arguing that the property was not fit for human habitation and emergency accommodation was needed.\n\nThe family alleged that in the five-year period they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning. The court heard that the council placed the family on a transfer list and they accepted the offer of a new property in October.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Simons that since she has moved there \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d. She said that while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter which the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. Ms Stokes claims she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d during a meeting.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids. I just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Justice Simons struck out the family\u2019s claim against the council, which he said only related to the first property. He said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and that \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the family\u2019s move.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \u201cparanormal activity\u201d and her fears for the safety of her children, but that a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

Federal agencies report having received several thousand tips from public sightings of moving lights in the sky in New Jersey and along the East Coast; the Federal Aviation Administration is taking the situation seriously enough that it has banned drones from flying over \u201ccritical New Jersey infrastructure.\u201d\n\nMuch of the rash of sightings is, according to experts, likely attributable to a combination of legitimate, scheduled airplane flights, helicopters, legally operated hobbyist drones, and celestial objects, with speeds, sizes, and distances misjudged by the error-prone human eye. The federal government has assured the public that there is nothing unusual or inexplicable about the reports. Still, valid questions remain about at least some of the sightings, and the White House hasn\u2019t exactly said what it knows. That\u2019s left plenty of room for people to throw around theories with varying degrees of outlandishness\u2014that these sightings could be the work of foreign actors, hidden government projects, or even angels.\n\nSensing the rising public interest, lawmakers have gotten in on the discourse as well: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, for example, posted a video of distant lights\u2014which seem to just be the constellation Orion\u2014and complained that the federal government was not taking drone sightings seriously enough. \u201cThe American people deserve answers and action now,\u201d he wrote. New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew boldly speculated that they could be from an Iranian \u201cmothership.\u201d Donald Trump referenced the drones in a crude joke about the former governor of New Jersey.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe only realm of speculation politicians are staying away from? Extraterrestrials.\n\nFrom a public-relations point of view, that makes sense, given that belief in alien life forms that visit Earth is considered, well, silly. But plenty of these politicians\u2019 constituents are talking about aliens, if chatter on social media and casual polling are any indication. And you can bet politicians are hearing about space aliens from concerned citizens around the country. Because thanks to some fairly radical changes in how Americans assemble their personal creeds, the belief in extraterrestrial visitations has become far from fringe. In fact, more Americans believe in alien spacecraft than ever before.\n\nAccording to Christopher Bader, a sociology professor at Chapman University who has polled Americans on their belief in the paranormal, some 35 percent of Americans believe that aliens have visited the Earth in modern times, and about a quarter of the population believes that at least some UFO sightings are extraterrestrial in origin. That number is well above where it was a couple of decades ago: A 1996 poll from Newsweek found only 20 percent of Americans were inclined to believe in alien UFOs; a Baylor religion survey in 2005 similarly found only 24 percent of people did. And Bader\u2019s data isn\u2019t an outlier: A Pew survey from 2021 found that more than 50 percent of people polled believed that \u201cUFOs reported by people in the military are likely evidence of intelligent life outside Earth.\u201d\n\nThat trend is not just about aliens. Overall, Americans are coming to embrace the paranormal in a multitude of ways. Bader\u2019s polling found that a majority of Americans believe in hauntings\u2014a 16-point increase from 2005\u2014and belief in psychic powers, while still relatively low, has roughly doubled in the past 15 years or so. These beliefs, he said, have been slowly but steadily growing.\n\nAs Bader sees it, one of the main reasons behind the general American embrace of the strange and paranormal is the long-running and steady decline of religious institutions. Churches, he said, can often serve as a kind of dampener on paranormal beliefs: Part of the role of a denomination is to lay out a particular creed. That creed may be supernatural\u2014God, after all, is beyond the realm of scientific proof\u2014but institutional religious doctrine does not usually include any mentions of space aliens.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow that fewer and fewer people attend religious services, \u201cit\u2019s common in surveys to find someone who says, \u2018I believe Jesus is the one and only son of God, and also my house is haunted, and there might be a Bigfoot,\u2019 \u201d Bader said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t use to believe all those things. Churches would say, \u2018Here is the correct package of supernatural beliefs you\u2019re allowed to hold.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn recent years, faith has become more personal, idiosyncratic, and unpredictable. \u201cUFOs and ghosts and psychic powers\u2014as organized religion plummets, those are growing rapidly,\u201d Bader said. \u201cOnce you no longer have your church telling you, \u2018Here\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to believe about the world,\u2019 it frees you to explore other things.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a common misconception, he said, that Americans are becoming godless secularists; the reality, instead, is that Americans are leaving organized religion in droves but remaining believers, in some way or another. Many Americans who abandon their parents\u2019 old denominations still pray, still believe in an afterlife, still believe in something beyond the physical world. Actual atheism remains quite rare\u2014atheists are only about 5 percent of the population, according to Pew survey data. And committed atheists tend to be pretty skeptical when it comes to paranormal matters. But the vast middle category of spiritual or casually religious Americans are much more open.\n\nThis trend crosses demographics. The only real political element to paranormal belief, Bader said, is that people who attend more conservative churches tend to reject paranormal explanations of unexplained phenomena simply because those churches tend to teach that people should see strange things as demonic manifestations. (In other words: UFOs could be the work of the devil, but not aliens.) Otherwise, it\u2019s all a matter of whether someone is casual enough about their religion to embrace the strange and surreal. (Bader did exempt Bigfoot\u2014 which he said is more of interest to an outdoorsy, gun-loving, and decidedly Republican demographic\u2014from the nonpartisan rule.)\n\nThese changes in the American faith landscape help explain the public\u2019s growing belief in the extraterrestrial\u2014and presumably, the belief that the East Coast drones are exactly that. But the other major factor for growing belief in extraterrestrial spacecraft is the cratering of public trust in government. Decline in public trust comes with a rise in belief in conspiracy theories.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA huge portion of the New Jersey drone speculators appear to believe that shadowy government figures are hiding something from the public\u2014no matter what the drones might be. Podcaster Joe Rogan has floated the idea that the drones are meant to inure the public to such aerial objects, to \u201cnormalize the idea of us being invaded\u201d because \u201cthey know some real UAPs [unidentified anomalous phenomena] are on their way.\u201d Other conspiracy theorists have revived an old claim that a staged alien invasion would provide cover to create an authoritarian global government.\n\nMAGA Republican politicians are fanning the flames, seemingly in large part to amplify distrust of the Biden administration. (Fox News speculated, for example, that anger over the drones will turn New Jersey red.) \u201cThe government knows what is happening,\u201d Trump said in comments to reporters on Monday. \u201cOur military knows and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.\u201d\n\nThe most emphatic element of the MAGA response is the final telling detail\u2014one that truly reflects the American soul: Encouraging citizens to shoot whatever it is out of the sky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you right now that if they try to tell us all to stay inside, stay home, shelter in place \u2018FOR OUR SAFETY\u2019 from the drones, there is no way in hell I will comply with that absolute bullshit,\u201d Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on Truth Social. \u201cI\u2019ll shoot the drones down myself along with every other red blooded freedom loving American.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s our future president\u2019s post on the matter from Dec. 13:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT\n\nWhat does it all add up to? The American response to unexplained aerial phenomena is clarifying\u2014not about what\u2019s in the sky, but for who we are: mistrustful people, lovers of the paranormal, eclectic in our beliefs, and trigger-happy (in word if not in deed). The New Jersey drone mystery may or may not get a clear explanation. But it has already told us something important about ourselves."

They published their findings in the Food Chemistry journal, via Science Direct, and pointed to a number of potential uses for the flavorful seaweed, as VegNews detailed.\n\nThe overall problem the researchers were looking to address was creating alternatives to land-based protein sources, whether that be meat, dairy, or plant-based. Seaweed provides a promising solution. It can grow well in a variety of conditions without fertilizers, watering, or insecticides.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Humanity will need to find and combine the intake of many more diversified protein sources than we have available in our diet today to meet sustainability and nutritional requirements,\" said Ingrid Undeland, a professor of food science at Chalmers, in a news release.\n\nThe research team said that its new method of extracting protein makes it more affordable and comparable to the process for pea and soy proteins. Sea lettuce is also rich in vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. As far as the taste, the scientists were bullish that there were tons of applications for it.\n\n\"It tastes like umami with a certain salty flavor, despite not containing such high levels of salt,\" said researcher Jo\u00e3o Trigo of a concentrate of the sea lettuce proteins. Trigo said the powder would be a \"great flavor enhancer for seafood dishes and products\" but dreamed bigger down the road.\n\n\"Why not protein smoothies or 'blue burgers' from the sea?\" Trigo asked.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that were to come to fruition, it would provide another alternative to animal-based protein sources. That could be important for the health of humans and the health of the planet, as research has clearly shown the benefits of plant-based diets.\n\nOn the human health side, a recent study said reducing red-meat consumption by 30% could save over 45,000 lives in a 10-year span. Those sorts of health benefits were also seen in a study featuring identical twins when the twins on the vegan diet saw major improvements in key health metrics.\n\nWhy do you eat plant-based foods?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nAs far as the planet's health, another study revealed switching away from red meat and dairy-based diets to plant-based ones could reduce greenhouse gases by 17%. The Guardian also explored a study that showed how much climate damage and resource usage could be cut down with plant-based diets.\n\nThe Chalmers University team said it is also working to boost the protein content in the seaweed by growing it in processed water used by the seafood industry. It also hopes to use the nonprotein parts of the sea lettuce for food, medical, and material applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, when it comes to food sources, Undeland noted that \"sea-based possibilities\" or \"blue proteins\" have so far been \"overlooked.\"\n\n\"Algae is a good addition to many of the products already on the market,\" Undeland concluded.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

The finding may upend historians' understanding of how Christianity was practiced in the early Roman Empire .\n\nMeasuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters) long, the amulet contains a wafer-thin sheet of silver foil that's rolled up tightly. Archaeologists discovered it in the grave of a man who died between A.D. 230 and 270. The man likely wore the amulet on a cord around his neck, as it was found just below his jaw.\n\nMagical amulet warded off evil\n\nThe purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, \"was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces,\" Tine Rassalle , an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\"\n\nThe location of the artifact's discovery is rare, she added.\n\n\"These amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world,\" Rassalle said, but \"they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity's early centers of growth.\"\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

(Image credit: Monument Office of the City of Frankfurt am Main)\n\nOne man took his Christian faith to the grave\n\nThe object was discovered in 2018 during excavation of a Roman-era cemetery outside of Frankfurt. In the grave, archaeologists also found an incense bowl and a pottery jug. But the silver amulet caught the archaeologists' attention.\n\nExperts at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology (LEIZA) in Mainz spent several years conserving, restoring and analyzing the amulet before announcing their findings in a statement Wednesday (Dec. 11).\n\n\"The challenge in the analysis was that the silver sheet was rolled, but after around 1800 years, it was of course also creased and pressed,\" Ivan Calandra , head of the imaging platform at LEIZA, said in the statement. \"Using CT, we were able to scan it at a very high resolution and create a 3D model.\"\n\nThe virtual 3D model enabled scientists to digitally unroll and analyze the inscription. The 18-line inscription was deciphered by Markus Scholz , a professor at the Goethe University Institute of Archaeological Sciences in Frankfurt. He said it's unusual that the writing is in Latin. \"Normally, such inscriptions on amulets were written in Greek or Hebrew,\" Scholz said in the statement.\n\nFrankfurt inscription finally translated\n\nThe \"Frankfurt inscription\" reads as follows (the question marks signify areas of uncertainty):\n\n(In the name?) of Saint Titus. Holy, holy, holy! In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of God! The Lord of the world resists with [strengths?] all attacks(?)/setbacks(?). The God(?) grants entry to well-being. May this means of salvation(?) protect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses (Jesus Christ).\n\nIn the early days of the Roman Empire, practicing Christianity could be risky. The Roman emperor Nero persecuted Christians in the first century A.D.; some were crucified, and some were forced to fight in the Colosseum . This created an atmosphere of fear among early Christians, which forced them to practice in secret, in places like the catacombs in Rome. The fact that this man in third-century Germany was buried with his amulet meant his faith was very important to him, according to the researchers.\n\nA small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning to reveal an 18-line Christian inscription in Latin dated to the third century. (Image credit: \u00a9 Leibniz Institute for Archaeology in Mainz (LEIZA))\n\nAmulet is rare in Western Europe\n\nA similar silver amulet was discovered in 2023 in Bulgaria. Dated to roughly the same time, the Bulgarian amulet was also found in a grave near the person's skull. The inscription mentioned the archangels Michael and Gabriel and referenced the \"guardian\" Christ. Experts studying the Bulgarian amulet suggested this language as well as the placement of the amulet in a grave stemmed from the need for early Christians to conceal and guard their faith.\n\nOther early metal amulets that have been found in the early Christian world often mix different faiths, including elements of Judaism and paganism alongside Christianity. According to the researchers, the Frankfurt amulet does not mention any other faith; it is purely Christian.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian god,\" Rassalle said, which is unusual because most amulets \"also appeal to angels, demons, or other supernatural entities.\"\n\nInscription may rewrite history of Christianity in Germany\n\nThe text of the Frankfurt amulet is therefore incredibly important for scholars of early Christianity, the researchers noted, particularly because it contains the earliest example of certain phrases, including \"Holy, holy, holy!\" \u2014 which is not known in Christianity until the fourth century \u2014 and an early quotation from Paul's Letter to the Philippians.\n\n\"This takes our understanding of Western Christianization and Christian monotheism to a whole new level!\" Rassalle said.\n\n\"The 'Frankfurt Inscription' is a scientific sensation,\" Frankfurt Mayor Mike Josef said in the statement. \"Thanks to it, the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond will have to be turned back by around 50 to 100 years. The first Christian find north of the Alps comes from our city: we can be proud of this, especially now, so close to Christmas.\"\n\nEditor's Note: This story was originally published on Dec. 15 and updated on Dec. 20 to include new images and information about the excavation."

            "article_content": "The final day of OpenAI\u2019s \u201c12 Days of Shipmas\u201d has arrived with the unveiling of o3, a new chain-of-thought \u201creasoning\u201d model that the company claims is its most advanced yet. The model is not yet available for general use, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview starting today.\n\nOpenAI and others hope that reasoning models will go a long way toward solving the pernicious problem of chatbots frequently producing wrong answers. Chatbots fundamentally do not \u201cthink\u201d like humans and different techniques are needed to try and create the best simulacrum of a human thought process.\n\nWhen asked a question, reasoning models pause and consider related prompts that could help produce an accurate answer. For example, if you ask the o3 model, \u201ccan habaneros be grown in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d the model might lay out a series of questions it will research to come to a conclusion, such as \u201cwhere do habaneros typically grow,\u201d \u201cwhat are the ideal conditions for growing habaneros,\u201d and \u201cwhat type of climate does the Pacific Northwest have.\u201d Anyone who has used chatbots knows you sometimes have to prompt a chatbot with additional follow-ups until it finally gets the right result. Reasoning models are supposed to do this additional work for you.\n\no3 is the successor to o1, OpenAI\u2019s first chain-of-thought reasoning model. Reps said they decided to skip the \u201co2\u201d naming convention \u201cout of respect\u201d for the British telecommunications company, but it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that it makes the product sound more advanced. The company says the new model comes with the ability to adjust its reasoning time. Users can choose low, medium, or high reasoning time; the greater the compute, the better o3 is supposed to perform. OpenAI says it will spend time \u201cred-teaming\u201d the new model with researchers to prevent it from producing potentially harmful responses (since again, it is not a human and does not know right versus wrong).\n\nReasoning is the buzzword of the day in the field of generative AI, as industry insiders believe it is the next unlock necessary to improve the performance of large language models. More compute eventually does not offer equivalent performance gains, so new techniques are needed. Google DeepMind recently unveiled its own reasoning model called Gemini Deep Research, which can take 5-10 minutes to generate a report that analyzes many sources across the web in order to come to its findings.\n\nOpenAI is confident in o3, and offers impressive benchmarks\u2014it says that in a Codeforcing testing, which measures coding ability, o3 got a score of 2727. For context, a score of 2400 would put an engineer in the 99th percentile of programmers. It gets a score of 96.7% on the 2024 American Invitational Mathematics Exam, missing just one question. We will have to see how the model holds up in real-world testing, and it is still generally not a good idea to rely too much on AI models for important work where accuracy is necessary. But optimists are confident that the problem of accuracy is being solved. Hopefully so, because as it stands, Google\u2019s AI Overviews in search are still the subject of frequent social media ridicule.\n\nAI model companies like OpenAI and Perplexity are in a race to become the next Google, collecting the world\u2019s knowledge and helping users make sense of it all. They even have search products now that are meant to more directly replicate Google with access to real-time web results.\n\nAll of these players seem to leapfrog one another with every passing day, however. The feeling is somewhat reminiscent of the late \u201990s when there were a myriad of search engines to choose from\u2014Google, Yahoo, and AltaVista, Ask Jeeves, just to name a few, all hoovering up the internet\u2019s data and presenting it just with a different UX. Most of them disappeared after one came along that was supremely better than the rest\u2014Google.\n\nOpenAI clearly has a strong lead right now with hundreds of millions of monthly active users and a partnership with Apple, but Google has received a lot of plaudits recently for advancements in its Gemini models. The Verge reports that the company is going to soon integrate Gemini more deeply into its search interface."

            "article_content": "When looking to build or renovate your home or office, looking at emerging trends can inspire a project with long-term utility and timeless style. Trends in the New Hampshire construction industry include efforts toward greener designs and increased energy efficiency, which keep the overall maintenance costs and energy use down. Our panel shares their insights into the specifics they are seeing in their work.\n\nPanelists:\n\nDylan R. Cruess, Chief Operating Officer, TF Moran Inc., tfmoran.com\n\nJeremy Baldwin, AIA and Multifamily Studio Lead, Maugel DeStefano Architects, maugel.com\n\nDylan R. Cruess, Chief Operating Officer, TF Moran Inc.\n\nWhat are the emerging trends shaping the construction industry? How can businesses align their strategies with these developments for a competitive edge?\n\nAs with many industries, technology is pushing and shaping the construction industry from the design to the actual construction. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is becoming much more common and accepted in design and construction projects. With BIM, you can create a 3D computer model of the entire project including the parking areas, utility connections and building construction, which allows owners, engineers and contractors to visualize the final development and detect any conflicts before construction. To gain a competitive edge, businesses should always be looking at how technology is affecting their industry and should aim to be ahead of their competitors in adopting new technology.\n\nAmid evolving environmental concerns, how are sustainability practices influencing construction projects, and what are the key considerations for businesses looking to adopt eco-conscious approaches?\n\nSustainability practices have long been a focus in civil engineering design and construction. In the early to mid-2000s, there was a big push for LEED Certification which was a way to demonstrate that a development went above and beyond the construction requirements for sustainability. Since the 2000s, municipal regulations and building codes have been revised to incorporate many of LEED Certification\u2019s sustainability requirements, so it is now common practice in the construction industry to minimize environmental impacts and focus on sustainability.\n\nIn the context of urbanization and infrastructure growth, what role does innovative project management play in ensuring the successful execution of complex construction endeavors, and how can businesses excel in this area?\n\nFor urbanization and infrastructure growth, project management and future development planning are absolutely critical. My firm is involved in several large mixed-use developments that require substantial expansion of existing sewer, water, stormwater and electrical systems. When considering expansion of existing infrastructure, the existing systems\u2019 total capacity and connection points need to be considered as well as what additional demands a new development will place on existing systems.\n\nWith a focus on safety and regulatory compliance, what steps should businesses take to mitigate risks and ensure the well-being of workers and stakeholders in construction projects?\n\nSafety and regulatory compliance start with a company culture that prioritizes safety. My firm tells our field personnel that they can always say \u201cno\u201d to any task in the field if they have any safety concerns. Additionally, focusing on safety equipment is paramount in promoting a safe work environment. The cost of safety equipment and gear is negligible compared to the lost time and medical expenses of a workplace injury or safety incident.\n\nJeremy Baldwin, AIA and Multifamily Studio Lead Maugel DeStefano Architects\n\nAs the construction industry looks ahead to new mechanical code changes, refrigerant requirements have become a hot topic of conversation. These regulations could significantly impact mechanical designs for future projects, and staying ahead of the curve is critical. Here\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s driving these changes, why they matter, and how you can prepare.\n\nWhy are refrigerants being phased down?\n\nThe phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the 2020 AIM Act is the centerpiece of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. HFCs are commonly found in refrigerants like R-410A, and they have a high global warming potential. The goal is to reduce HFC usage by 85% by 2036, requiring a shift toward more sustainable refrigerant options such as A2L refrigerants.\n\nHow will the new regulations impact mechanical design?\n\nThis phasedown represents a significant shift in how mechanical systems are designed. While A2L refrigerants offer environmental benefits and improved efficiency, they also introduce unique challenges:\n\nR-410A is being phased out. The current refrigerant standard for HVAC systems, R-410A, will be replaced by A2L refrigerants with lower HFC\u2019s.\n\nA2L refrigerants will be the new standard. These refrigerants have lower global warming potential, greater energy efficiency, making them a more sustainable choice. However, A2L is mildly flammable (Class 2), which requires updated safety measures.\n\nNew safety requirements for HVAC designs. Refrigerant lines that penetrate more than one floor or ceiling assembly will need ventilated shafts, either natural or mechanical. Exceptions may apply for smaller systems serving single units.\n\nWhat are the new requirements?\n\nA2L refrigerants will be the standard for new HVAC, refrigeration and heat pump systems.\n\nRated shafts will be required for refrigerant lines passing through multiple floors to address flammability concerns.\n\nExisting systems using R-410A will be allowed to remain in use until January 1, 2026, but manufacturers are already phasing out the production of R-410A systems. Replacement parts and repair options for older systems will become increasingly scarce.\n\nWhy do these new changes matter?\n\nTransitioning to A2L refrigerants will help the construction industry achieve environmental goals without compromising performance. However, the shift introduces complexities in design, safety and installation that developers, engineers and contractors must navigate. Additionally, some states have already implemented requirements for mechanical ventilation and emergency backup power for these rated shafts.\n\nHow is Maugel DeStefano Architects preparing?\n\nAs architects, we are committed to guiding our clients through this transition. Our approach includes:\n\nClose collaboration with suppliers. We\u2019re coordinating with vendors to ensure a smooth switch to A2L systems, establishing timelines and evaluating integration with existing designs.\n\nProject-by-project assessments. Each project is analyzed to incorporate energy codes, compliance requirements, and HVAC system options for maximum efficiency and safety.\n\nClient education. We\u2019re keeping clients informed about these changes, advising on long-term costs and addressing compatibility issues between older and newer systems.\n\nOur priority is to ensure that developers, contractors, engineers and policymakers understand how these new regulations will shape future projects. By proactively addressing these changes, we aim to deliver compliant, efficient and cost-effective designs while supporting environmental sustainability.\n\nIf you have questions about how these changes might affect your projects, please reach out to us. We\u2019re here to help you navigate the evolving landscape of refrigerant requirements."

            "article_content": "This year, Rockefeller scientists illuminated the mysteries of memory and immune evasion. They unraveled how cancer infiltrates the body, how vitamin A influences wound healing, and how the impulse to eat is driven by three neurons. Groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, CRISPR technology, and stem cell biology reflect an impressive year for advancement in biomedicine. Here are some of the intriguing discoveries that came out of Rockefeller in 2024.\n\nVitamin A's healing role\n\nIt turns out Vitamin A is playing an unexpected role in wound repair: hair follicle stem cells are involved in the healing process in a way mediated by retinoic acid, the active form of Vitamin A. A study from the laboratory of Elaine Fuchs found that, during this process, stem cells enter a temporary state of plasticity in which they adopt traits of multiple cell types. Given that an unchecked version of this kind of plasticity is present in some cancer stem cells, the findings raise the possibility that retinoids could also play a role in cancer suppression.\n\n\"This hasn't been on the radar until now,\" Fuchs says. \"It's an exciting front to now investigate.\"\n\nMemory's hidden architect\n\nRobert B. Darnell's lab unveiled a tool edging neuroscience much closer to understanding a phenomenon known as dendritic translation-a \"holy grail for understanding memory formation,\" he says. Dendritic translation is a coordinated burst of neuronal activity, which involves an uptick in localized protein production within the spiny branches that project off the neuron cell body and receive signals from other neurons at synapses. It's a process key to memory-and its dysfunction is linked to intellectual disorders.\n\nUsing a new platform they developed, Darnell's team identified several previously unknown regulatory mechanisms that drive dendritic translation. The work \"defines a whole new biochemical pathway which fits with, complements, and vastly expands what we already knew about memory and learning,\" Darnell says.\n\nAutism's missing link\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is tied to more than 70 genes, and the laboratory of Mary E. Hatten has long focused on the link between the ASTN2 gene and cerebellar changes in children with autism, as well as other neurodevelopmental conditions. This year, however, Hatten's lab took that work to the next level with research demonstrating that knocking out ASTN2 in mice induces hallmark autism-like behaviors, including reduced vocalization, diminished social interaction, increased hyperactivity, and repetitive actions.\n\n\"It's a big finding in the field of neuroscience,\" Hatten says, and one that is inspiring her team to delve deeper into the hereditary components of autism. \"We're very excited that we've been able to show in detail what ASTN2 does, but there are a lot more genes to investigate.\"\n\nMetastasis's surprising origins\n\nA pair of compelling studies from the Tavazoie lab challenged conventional wisdom around cancer metastasis. Earlier this year, the lab demonstrated that sensory neurons play a direct role in promoting the growth and spread of breast cancer, providing the first ever evidence of peripheral nerves releasing a signal to enhance metastasis.\n\nMost recently, Tavazoie's team demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer metastasis may be, in part, a hereditary disorder driven by mutations in an inherited gene variant common to about 70 percent of white women. The scientists note their finding isn't cause for alarm-the variant does not make people more likely to develop cancer, though it may up the risk for metastasis outcomes by between 2 to 22 percent-but it could open up a new pathway to treatment.\n\n\"We've been so focused on the cancer cells, the 'seeds,' that we've ignored the germline-the 'soil',\" Tavazoie explains. \"It's now clear that focusing on the soil is critical.\"\n\nCRISPR's new tricks\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has long been likened to a kind of genetic scissors, thanks to its ability to snip out any desired section of DNA with elegant precision. Now, thanks to work done in the lab of Luciano Marraffini, we know that certain CRISPR systems operate something like a molecular fumigator as well: In a collaboration with MSKCC, the team found a CRISPR system that also produces a flood of toxic molecules in response invading phages or plasmids, effectively shutting down the infected cell in order to prevent the contagion from spreading through the rest of the bacterial population.\n\n\"It's a completely brand-new type of CRISPR chemistry,\" says Christian Baca, a graduate student in the Marraffini lab. The group envisions one possible application of their discovery may be a diagnostic tool for infection-but it hints at much more. \"It's more evidence that CRISPR systems have an array of immune strategies at their disposal.\"\n\nTelomere's balancing act\n\nTelomeres, the protective caps found at chromosome ends, must be kept at just the right length: too short, and dangerously accelerated aging ensues; too long, and they predispose their owners to cancer. Precise regulation is paramount, and Titia de Lange's laboratory recently published work that fundamentally changes our understanding of telomere biology.\n\nAmong their findings, de Lange's team discovered that two enzymes work in concert to ensure proper telomere maintenance. Scientists knew the telomerase enzyme helps prevent telomeres from growing shorter with each round of replication. But every DNA double helix has two strands to copy, and telomerase is capable of handling only one. Her team demonstrated how a second enzyme-the CST-Pol\u03b1-primase complex-manages the other strand."

            "article_content": "You've almost certainly put lettuce on a burger, but what if a type of seaweed called sea lettuce was the burger.\n\nResearchers at the Chalmers University of Technology have high hopes for just that after unveiling a method to extract three times more protein from sea lettuce than a conventional burger. They published their findings in the Food Chemistry journal, via Science Direct, and pointed to a number of potential uses for the flavorful seaweed, as VegNews detailed.\n\nThe overall problem the researchers were looking to address was creating alternatives to land-based protein sources, whether that be meat, dairy, or plant-based. Seaweed provides a promising solution. It can grow well in a variety of conditions without fertilizers, watering, or insecticides.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Humanity will need to find and combine the intake of many more diversified protein sources than we have available in our diet today to meet sustainability and nutritional requirements,\" said Ingrid Undeland, a professor of food science at Chalmers, in a news release.\n\nThe research team said that its new method of extracting protein makes it more affordable and comparable to the process for pea and soy proteins. Sea lettuce is also rich in vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. As far as the taste, the scientists were bullish that there were tons of applications for it.\n\n\"It tastes like umami with a certain salty flavor, despite not containing such high levels of salt,\" said researcher Jo\u00e3o Trigo of a concentrate of the sea lettuce proteins. Trigo said the powder would be a \"great flavor enhancer for seafood dishes and products\" but dreamed bigger down the road.\n\n\"Why not protein smoothies or 'blue burgers' from the sea?\" Trigo asked.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that were to come to fruition, it would provide another alternative to animal-based protein sources. That could be important for the health of humans and the health of the planet, as research has clearly shown the benefits of plant-based diets.\n\nOn the human health side, a recent study said reducing red-meat consumption by 30% could save over 45,000 lives in a 10-year span. Those sorts of health benefits were also seen in a study featuring identical twins when the twins on the vegan diet saw major improvements in key health metrics.\n\nWhy do you eat plant-based foods?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nAs far as the planet's health, another study revealed switching away from red meat and dairy-based diets to plant-based ones could reduce greenhouse gases by 17%. The Guardian also explored a study that showed how much climate damage and resource usage could be cut down with plant-based diets.\n\nThe Chalmers University team said it is also working to boost the protein content in the seaweed by growing it in processed water used by the seafood industry. It also hopes to use the nonprotein parts of the sea lettuce for food, medical, and material applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, when it comes to food sources, Undeland noted that \"sea-based possibilities\" or \"blue proteins\" have so far been \"overlooked.\"\n\n\"Algae is a good addition to many of the products already on the market,\" Undeland concluded.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

By means of improved tokenization pricing in the U.S. market, analysts saw the possibility for steady increase in 2025. Trading at a discounted 8x 2025 earnings, Joint Stock Co. Kaspi.kz also drew interest for its 20% sales growth and 40% net income margins.\n\nTransUnion (TRU, Financials) has 24x 2025 EPS multiple still lagging the industry median of 30x, hence it is positioned for a value improvement. One important difference noted by analysts is the company's steady organic expansion.\n\nLeveraging automation and self-checkout systems, Aramark is improving transaction volumes and service forms. J.P. Morgan believes financial deleveraging and margin expansion will drive long-term development.\n\nWith a free cash flow margin of 31% and sales increase of 34%, Mondays.com (MNDY, Financials) is doing well. In the cooperative software industry, the company's emphasis on low-code/no-code workflow orchestration lends a competitive advantage.\n\nAccording to J.P. Morgan, these businesses represent the growing influence of technology in changing conventional services and generating investment possibilities in 2025.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

            "article_content": "PEPE is one of the best-performing meme currencies, rising 135% in one month. While Shiba Inu grew 70%, it was modest. PEPE reached a new ATH of $0.000026 on December 7, raising its market cap to $11 billion. However, it had shed some of its value after witnessing massive taking, as it stands at $10 billion as of this writing. Though impressive, it still falls short of SHIB's $17 billion valuation. Despite the notable gap, many still believe 2025 might be the year for a significant shift in positioning between the two meme coins. PEPE's rising momentum is powered primarily by community-generated enthusiasm and robust whale activity. On-chain data also revealed that PEPE consistently surpassed SHIB in terms of daily trading volume, indicating increased investor interest. However, Shiba Inu's ecosystem has a distinct edge. Shibarium, the Layer-2 network, offers concrete benefits such as lower fees and better transaction rates for SHIB-based apps. Analysts believe the ongoing PEPE momentum and overcoming SHIB are a matter of when not if.\n\nBluntz Capital, a well-known crypto analyst, discussed PEPE's recent rise on X, stating that there is no scenario in which $PEPE does not surpass SHIB this cycle. He further emphasized that global recognition and mindshare of PEPE are too significant, making it inevitable, in his opinion. However, can PEPE surprise us? AI has its take."

Which is another way for us to say goodbye for now, and see you in 2025!\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nImage Credits:We Are / Getty Images\n\nThis week brought us some M&As, but also some reminders that it\u2019s always worth looking closer at things, whether that\u2019s prospective LPs or shiny announcements.\n\nClean capital: More than 20 VC firms, many of which invest in defense tech, signed the Clean Capital Certification, self-attesting that they have not and will not take money from U.S. geopolitical adversaries such as China and Russia.\n\nHave-nots: The AI hype is distorting aggregate VC data. Digging deeper, the fundraising landscape is radically different for non-AI startups, and many that raised a Series A round 18 months ago are likely facing challenges in raising Series B funding, Tribeca Venture Partners co-founder Brian Hirsch told TechCrunch.\n\nBig deal with caveats: Nuclear startup Oklo, which is backed by Sam Altman, signed a massive but nonbinding agreement with data center operator Switch. The deal is also subject to the startup receiving approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission after having its previous application denied in 2022.\n\nAI productivity: Grammarly is acquiring productivity startup Coda to expand its scope. In an unusual move, Coda CEO and co-founder Shishir Mehrotra will become the new CEO of Grammarly, replacing Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, who will move on to an adviser role.\n\nInformed answers: Perplexity acquired Carbon, a Seattle-based startup that connects LLMs to external data before they generate an answer. This could help Perplexity tap into \u201cinternal databases, cloud storage, or document repositories,\u201d the company said.\n\nMost interesting fundraises this week\n\nAs startups rushed to disclose their latest fundraising news before the holidays, there were plenty of deal announcements this week.\n\nMammoth pre-IPO round: Databricks raised $10 billion in one of the largest rounds in VC history. The mammoth Series J might be its last fundraiser before its highly anticipated IPO; but while its CEO isn\u2019t ruling it out for 2025, it could also be in 2026, he said.\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest unicorn: South African fintech Tyme Group raised a $250 million Series D round. Led by Nu Holdings, the parent company of Latin American fintech Nubank, it put Tyme\u2019s valuation at $1.5 billion.\n\nRing maker: Finnish wearable startup Oura raised a $200 million Series D funding round at a $5.2 billion valuation. It included participation from Fidelity Management and glucose device maker Dexcom, with which Oura recently entered a partnership.\n\nTravel is back: Canadian travel startup Hostaway, which makes software for vacation rental operators, raised $365 million at a $925 million valuation. The round was led by General Atlantic and will help the company double down on growth.\n\nMomentum for accessibility: Evinced, which helps companies comply with online accessibility requirements, raised a $55 million Series C round to expand into Europe, where new regulations will take effect in June.\n\nFast funding: AI startup Decart, which is based in San Francisco but with operations in Israel, secured $32 million in fresh funding at a $500 million valuation, a mere two months after coming out of stealth.\n\nFind the money: Agave Games, the Turkish startup behind highly entertaining mobile game Find the Cat, raised an $18 million Series A round of funding it will use to build out its team and work on upcoming titles.\n\nMost interesting VC and fund news this week\n\nImage Credits:Axelle/Bauer-Griffin / FilmMagic / Getty Images\n\nPendulum swing: Marcy Venture Partners, Jay-Z\u2019s VC firm, merged with Pendulum Opportunities to form MarcyPen Capital Partners, which now has $900 million in assets under management.\n\nGoing backstage: Backstage Capital founder Arlan Hamilton announced that she\u2019s moving on to an advisory role; 360 Venture Collective will be \u201cacquiring a significant stake in Backstage\u2019s management entity\u201d and joining in co-managing operators and providing capital for the firm, which previously faced criticism and struggles.\n\nVote of confidence: G2 Venture Partners, a spinout of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers investing in climate and sustainability startups, is raising $750 million for a third fund that would confirm LP bullishness for its thesis.\n\nLast but not least\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\n\nWe\u2019re leaving you with a list of the 51 most disruptive startups of 2024 \u2014 a collective effort with contributions from several members of the TechCrunch team.

            "article_content": "People take shelter in a metro station during an air raid alarm in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Friday.\n\nA Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, early Friday killed at least one person and wounded 12 other people, officials said. Moscow claimed it was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Russian soil using American-made weapons.\n\nAt least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine\u2019s air force said that it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said. Falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts.\n\n\u201cWe ask citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats, because there is very little time to find shelter,\u201d the air force said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the almost three years since Moscow\u2018s full invasion of Ukraine began, Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia\u2019s bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country\u2019s war effort.\n\nThe falling debris in Kyiv smashed into the city center, causing damage to around two dozen high-rise office buildings as well as the Catholic Church of St. Nicholas, a city landmark, and the Kyiv National Linguistic University.\n\nWhat may have been the blast wave from an intercepted low-flying missile also blew out windows or caused other damage at six embassies, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout five hours later, air raid sirens rang out again. Valeriia Dubova, a 32-year-old photographer, took cover with many others in a crowded subway station.\n\nShe said that in the morning attack, she sheltered at home and could feel the walls shaking from the blasts. Outside, fire engines and ambulances raced down city streets, she said.\n\n\u201cWith the naked eye you could see that many buildings, high-rises, were damaged, with glass shards on the ground, far from the explosion epicenter,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia\u2019s Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said.\n\nThat day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country\u2019s war effort.\n\nThe use of Western-supplied weapons to strike Russia has angered the Kremlin. Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time on Nov. 19 after Washington eased restrictions on their use.\n\nThat development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile, called Oreshnik, for the first time. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used a second time.\n\nNovikov writes for the Associated Press."

            "article_content": "Listen to article\n\nPakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) endured yet another day of massive selling on Thursday as it nosedived nearly 4,800 points \u2013 the largest single-day drop in the bourse's history.\n\nA highly volatile trading session left investors puzzled, which came after a recent prolonged record-breaking spree. The biggest single-day slump followed Wednesday's record fall of 3,790 points, when investors resorted to heavy profit-taking at significantly higher stock valuations.\n\nThe intense selling pressure was fuelled by several domestic factors and was particularly pronounced in sectors like chemical, commercial banks, power generation and refineries. The KSE-100 index moved between the intra-day low of 105,937.37 points and the high of 111,745.03 points.\n\n\"The government's move to prevent non-filers from investing in mutual funds or managing investment portfolios with banks has largely disappointed market players, which resulted in this hefty decline,\" AKD Securities Director Research Awais Ashraf told The Express Tribune.\n\nBesides, some market participants were apprehensive about a potential end to the monetary easing cycle, influenced by the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) inflation forecast and its emphasis on maintaining a tight monetary policy stance, he added.\n\nKTrade Securities attributed the downturn to heightened political uncertainty as well as year-end adjustments.\n\nAt the close of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a colossal loss of 4,795.32 points, or 4.32%, and settled at 106,274.98.\n\nArif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti wrote \"the stock market witnessed panic selling on the outlook of a cautious SBP policy easing due to multiple risks.\"\n\nBesides, weak global crude oil prices and institutional selling of overbought stocks played the role of catalysts in the record bearish activity, he added.\n\nTopline Securities wrote in its commentary that the KSE-100 index experienced an unprecedented collapse, plummeting 5,132 points in a single trading session and marking the steepest point-wise decline in its history.\n\nThe sharp sell-off was triggered by significant redemptions by local mutual funds, compounded by year-end profit-taking by institutions, which collectively dragged the market into turmoil.\n\nMari Petroleum (-10%) extended its losing streak, hitting the lower circuit for the third consecutive session. Persistent concerns over its overvaluation, particularly concerning the near-term fundamentals, fuelled the sell-off, it said.\n\nLeading the downward trajectory were heavyweights such as Mari Petroleum, Hub Power, United Bank, Oil and Gas Development Company and Engro Corporation, which together contributed a staggering 1,556 points to the index's overall decline, Topline added.\n\n\"When it rains, it pours; the KSE-100 gave up another -4.32% day-on-day to take the three-day losing streak to -9.2%,\" Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote in its review.\n\nIn total, six shares rose while 94 fell with Mari Petroleum (-10%), Hub Power (-8.38%) and United Bank (-4.52%) being the biggest downside contributors.\n\nIndus Motor (+9.07%), Rafhan Maize Products (+3.92%) and AGP Limited (+1.26%) provided the maximum positive support, it said.\n\nA beautiful price action saw the market take out equal lows at 107.5k and beyond. With the completion of five waves down, a convincing short-term counter-trend rally is now poised to materialise, AHL said.\n\nIt anticipated counter-trend rallies that were likely to be capped below 111.5k over the coming weeks.\n\nJS Global analyst Muhammad Hasan Ather highlighted that the index extended its sharp decline on Thursday, tumbling 4.3% (4,795 points) to close at 106,275.\n\nThe drop followed Wednesday's record-breaking loss of 3,790 points, as selling pressure persisted across major sectors, including chemicals, banks, power and refineries.\n\nInvestor sentiment was weighed down by concerns over the government's Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill 2024, which targets non-filers, and stock-specific corrections driven by perceived overvaluation.\n\nWorldCall Telecom, K-Electric, Cnergyico PK and Pak Elektron led the trading volumes for the day. He anticipated that despite the steep losses, the ongoing market correction may offer attractive buying opportunities, underpinned by ample liquidity, declining interest rates, and easing political uncertainty.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 1.17 billion shares compared to Wednesday's tally of 1.11 billion.\n\nShares of 472 companies were traded. Of these, 66 stocks closed higher, 371 fell and 35 remained unchanged.\n\nWorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 177.7 million shares, losing Rs0.19 to close at Rs1.52. It was followed by K-Electric with trading in 81.9 million shares, losing Rs0.39 to close at Rs5.22 and Cnergyico PK with 68.4 million shares, losing Rs0.7 to close at Rs5.84.\n\nDuring the day, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs1.40 billion, the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL) reported."

Each monitor includes a mounting kit to securely attach a mini PC at the back of the stand, positioned closer to the base for easier access.\n\nThe two monitors offer other practical features, including a groove at the base that you can use to stash a smartphone. There\u2019s also an integrated USB hub for users managing multiple devices.\n\nNot 4K, sadly\n\n(Image credit: Asus)\n\nBoth models offer ergonomic adjustments to suit various viewing preferences. The stands support tilt from -5 to 35 degrees, swivel 180 degrees left and right, pivot 90 degrees in either direction, and 130mm of height adjustment. The IPS panels deliver wide 178-degree viewing angles and 16.7 million colors, with a 5ms response time, 350cd/m\u00b2 brightness, and a contrast ratio of 3,000:1.\n\nRather disappointingly, the display resolution of the two screens is Full HD+ (1,920 x 1,200), rather than 4K upwards, which may limit their appeal to those requiring higher detail or sharper visuals, such as content creators, or those who like to have a lot of windows open on screen at the same time.\n\nConnectivity varies slightly between the two models. The BE248CFN includes HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.4, USB Type-C with a 96W power delivery function, a four-port USB 3.2 Gen 1 hub, and Gigabit Ethernet. The BE248QF adds a mini D-Sub 15-pin connector, catering to users with legacy hardware.\n\nBoth monitors incorporate 2W stereo speakers and Asus Eye Care technologies, such as Flicker-Free and Low Blue Light, which should make them comfortable to use during extended work sessions.\n\nAre you a pro?

            "article_content": "With a newly installed Windows PC, only a few system services and programs start. The resource requirements are correspondingly low and the operating system responds quickly.\n\nThis changes over time, which is mainly due to the additional software installed. Programs and services that start automatically after Windows logon lead to delays. The startup time of the system increases and it takes longer and longer for the desktop to respond to mouse clicks or for a program to start.\n\nHow noticeable the system slowdowns are depends on the overall performance of the computer and the performance of the hard drive or SSD.\n\nAs a general rule, a program that is only installed but does not start automatically cannot slow down Windows. However, this only applies if there is enough space available for temporary files or downloading updates, for example.\n\nTo avoid mistakes, you should therefore never fill drives close to their capacity limit. With both hard drives and SSDs, too little free space also affects speed for other reasons (see box \u201cMaking the most of hard drives and SSDs\u201d).\n\nAs in real life, tidying up is also a regular task in Windows. Removing superfluous files ensures that there is always enough free space on the drive. You should also remove unused programs, move particularly large files from the SSD to an existing hard drive and deactivate autostart if it is not required.\n\nget windows 11 pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro Price When Reviewed: 199.99 Best Prices Today:\n\nThe Windows on-board tools can provide valuable services here, while additional tools offer more and advanced functions.\n\nHowever, there is no simple one-click solution. Ultimately, the tools can only collect what you can possibly delete. After that, the responsibility lies with you. In this article, we provide decision-making aids and show you where you should be careful and what you should not delete.\n\nNote: The tips in this article apply to Windows 11, but some of the functions are also available in Windows 10.\n\n1. Check memory utilization\n\nCall up Settings \u2014 for example, with the key combination Win+I or a search in the Start menu. Go to System > Memory. You will see an informative overview with the total utilization of the system drive as well as the storage space used by temporary files and installed apps.\n\nUnder Other, Windows displays the space occupied by files that cannot be specified in more detail. Clicking on Show more categories takes you to a list of other areas, such as Documents, Pictures and Videos. You can see how much storage space is occupied in each case.\n\nClicking on one of the categories shows detailed information:\n\nOther shows some of the largest folders on the drive. You can open the folders by clicking on them in Windows Explorer and then decide whether something can be deleted.\n\nshows some of the largest folders on the drive. You can open the folders by clicking on them in Windows Explorer and then decide whether something can be deleted. Installed apps leads to Apps > Installed apps. The view can be sorted by size or installation date. You can use the three-dot menu to uninstall programs that you no longer need.\n\nleads to Apps > Installed apps. The view can be sorted by size or installation date. You can use the three-dot menu to uninstall programs that you no longer need. Temporary files shows a list of areas in which files that may no longer be required are stored. After a Windows upgrade, Previous Windows installation(s) appears in the list. This is the folder C:\\Windows.old. You can remove this if everything is running smoothly and you no longer want to return to the previous Windows installation. Windows automatically deletes the folder after about a month.\n\nUnder System > Storage > Temporary files there is a tick in front of all entries that you can delete without hesitation. To do this, click on Remove files. You can also tick the boxes in front of Downloads and Recycle bin.\n\nBut be careful: Downloads relates to your personal download folder. If you do not want to lose the downloaded files, do not tick this box. For Recycle Bin, you should make sure that there are no unintentionally deleted files in the recycle bin. Open the recycle bin by double-clicking on the desktop icon and check the contents.\n\nOnly delete if necessary: You can delete everything under Temporary files, but this is not useful in every case. The \u201cthumbnails,\u201d for example, are preview images that Windows saves in db files in the folder C:\\Users[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer.\n\nThis allows Windows Explorer to load the preview images more quickly. After some time, the db files also contain preview images whose originals have long since been deleted. Regular cleaning therefore seems advisable.\n\nOn the other hand, the files do not usually take up much memory space and if you delete everything, Windows Explorer has to rebuild the cache of the preview images. Although this does not take long, it is unnecessary.\n\nThe situation is similar with temporary internet files. Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser saves the elements of web pages in a cache, allowing it to display them more quickly. If the temporary internet files are deleted, it will take longer to load pages on regularly visited websites.\n\nAs a rule, the Edge cache does not occupy more than 1GB, which means that not much storage space can be freed up. Other web browsers use their own cache, which can be emptied in the respective programs (see point 7).\n\nStorage overview: In the Settings under System > Storage you can find out how the hard drive is used. Click on the categories for further details. Foundry\n\n2. Windows 11 cleanup functions\n\nIn Windows 11, go to System > Storage in Settings and click on Cleanup recommendations. You will see the storage space occupied by downloads and the recycle bin as well as Previous Windows installation(s), if still available.\n\nTick the areas in which you want to delete files and click on the [X] GB cleanup button. However, this will not only delete the selected files, but also other temporary files. Click on Advanced options to find out about the effects.\n\nThe settings correspond to those under System > Storage > Temporary files, but the current selection is added, for example Recycle bin. If you consider it necessary, you can remove the tick from some areas before cleaning.\n\nThe list you get after clicking on Large or unused files is more interesting. You will see particularly large files and files used a long time ago that you may be able to delete. The list under Unused apps can also be helpful. However, only programs that you have installed via the Microsoft Store are displayed.\n\nAn alternative for Windows 10 and 11 is Iobit Uninstaller.\n\nUnder Programs, go to Rarely used to display the applications that are rarely used. The list can serve as a guide, but is usually not complete and sometimes shows inaccurate dates. However, it is not possible to do better than this because Windows does not reliably log the start time of a program.\n\nWhat can be deleted? The \u201ccleanup recommendations\u201d point to obvious areas such as the recycle bin. However, you can also have large files and unused apps listed. Foundry\n\n3. Free up storage space\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do all the tidying up yourself, you can leave the task to Windows. In the Settings, go to System > Storage and set the switch behind Storage Sense to On.\n\nThe service can be configured by clicking on Storage Sense. A tick is already placed in front of Keep Windows running smoothly by automatically cleaning up temporary system and app files.\n\nAutomatic user content cleanup is also switched on, but is only activated when required due to the default setting During low free disk space (default). However, you can also set a schedule for the clean-up with Daily, Every week, or Every month.\n\nAn interval can be specified under Delete files from recycle bin if they have been there for over:. The default setting is 30 days. If you are worried that there may still be files in the recycle bin after 30 days that you would like to restore, it is better to set Never and empty the recycle bin manually.\n\nThe same applies to the setting for the download folder, where the default setting is Never. Only if you are sure that this folder will never contain files that you still need should you set it to 30 days or 60 days, for example.\n\nUsers of the Microsoft cloud storage Onedrive will find a useful setting under Locally available cloud content. With the default setting of 30 days, Onedrive automatically changes the status of the files in the synchronized folder to Available online if they have not been opened within this period.\n\nThis means that the files no longer take up any space on the drive. If you open one of these files afterwards, it will be available on the device again. Files that you have marked as Always keep on this device are not affected by this setting. If you do not want Onedrive to change the status of the files, set Never.\n\n\u201cStorage optimization\u201d automatically creates more space on the system drive. You can specify what is deleted and when. IDG\n\n4. Relocate standard storage locations\n\nIf your PC has an additional SSD or hard drive, you can use this as alternative storage. An external USB drive is also suitable, but must be permanently connected depending on how it is used.\n\nFurther reading: The best SSDs\n\nYou can simply move personal files to the other drive using Windows Explorer. However, Windows also offers options to change the storage location of default folders.\n\nIn the Settings, go to System > Storage, click on Advanced storage settings and then on Where new content is saved.\n\nAs the name suggests, the settings only apply to new files. To save space on the system drive, you can specify the second drive under New apps will save to:, for example E:\\. Click on Apply for the setting to take effect.\n\nYou can also select the second drive under New documents will save to:, whereby Windows creates the folder E:[user name]\\Documents. If you now save a document in a word processor or the Windows Notepad editor, the new storage location is preset.\n\nHowever, this procedure has a disadvantage: In Windows Explorer, Documents still leads to the previous folder on drive C:\\. An overview of files from both locations is provided by the libraries, which Windows Explorer does not display by default.\n\nTo change this, go to Options in the three-dot menu and switch to the View tab. Under Navigation pane, tick the box next to Show libraries. If you then go to Libraries > Documents, you will see the files from both folders.\n\nMoving personal folders completely: Because of the disadvantage mentioned above, it makes more sense to move folders such as Documents, Pictures, and Downloads completely to another drive.\n\nFirst create the destination folder, for example E:[username]\\Downloads. Right-click on the desired folder in Windows Explorer, go to Properties and then to the Path tab.\n\nClick on Move and select the previously created folder. After clicking on OK, confirm with Yes that Windows should move the existing files to the new location. In Windows Explorer, under Start or in the navigation area, open the folders with the previous content but with the new storage location.\n\n5. Change storage location for apps\n\nA conventionally installed desktop program is located by default in the folder C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files (x86), which Windows Explorer displays as C:\\Program.\n\nIf space becomes tight, programs cannot simply be moved to another drive, as the paths to components and settings in the Windows registry are then no longer correct. However, you can usually specify a user-defined destination on a different drive when reinstalling programs in the setup program.\n\nThis is particularly recommended for an SSD with little storage space and if a program requires a lot of storage space, for example a PC game. However, the loss of speed when starting from a slower hard drive must be accepted.\n\nApps from the Microsoft Store can also be moved to another drive without reinstalling them. In Settings, go to Apps > Installed apps and click on Move in the three-dot menu for the desired app.\n\nSelect the target drive and click on Move. If the menu item is not available, it is a desktop application. The pre-installed system apps cannot be moved, which is why the menu item is grayed out.\n\nApps from the Microsoft Store can be moved to another drive. This option is not available for pre-installed system apps. IDG\n\nMaking optimum use of hard drives and SSDs Due to its physical structure, a conventional magnetic hard drive delivers data at different speeds. The average transfer rate of a current hard disk can be 200MB per second, for example. In the outer area of the magnetic disk, the read/write heads can capture more sectors in the same amount of time than in the inner area due to rotation and circumference. With a freshly installed Windows, the system files are located in the fast outer area; what is added later is located in the increasingly slower inner areas. The hard disk can reduce this effect by using a cache. The data first ends up in the fast cache and only then on the hard drive. The transfer rate is gradually reduced by the limited size of the cache as you copy many small or a few large files to the hard drive. In the course of using a hard drive, files are deleted and new ones are created. The drive\u2019s controller uses the next free blocks to store the data. If a file does not fit into the area of a contiguous block, the next one is used, which may be a long way away. The read/write heads then require longer paths, which reduces the transfer rate and increases access times. The performance of the hard drive can be improved by defragmentation. The files are reorganized in blocks that are as contiguous as possible, which speeds up access. The \u201cOptimize drives\u201d defragmenter from the Windows accessories (Win R, dfrgui) does this automatically once a week by default. The Windows defragmenter seems to do its job perfectly, as it regularly certifies that the drives have a fragmentation level of \u201c0%.\u201d This may even be more or less true for PCs in average use. However, large files are often heavily fragmented, which increases as the hard drive fills up because the contiguous, free blocks become fewer and fewer. This particularly affects games and the usually very large virtual hard disks of virtualization software. If this applies to you, first make sure there is enough free space on the hard drive. Only then can a defragmenter work optimally. A suitable program for this is Defraggler. After starting, select the hard drive and click on \u201cCheck.\u201d If the program shows severe fragmentation, click on \u201cDefrag.\u201d As the process takes a long time for large hard drives, you can also selectively process individual files. Switch to the \u201cFile list\u201d tab. Click on the \u201cFragments\u201d column header to sort the list by heavily fragmented files. The selected file can be optimized via the context menu item \u201cSelected defragmentation.\u201d Special features for SSDs: SSDs do not need to be defragmented because the memory accesses are direct and the position of the memory cells is irrelevant. This results in short access times, which means that Windows and programs start faster. The transfer rate is approximately 2 to 4 times higher than with hard disks, which also has a positive effect on overall performance. However, you should also regularly free up storage space on SSDs. If the drive is filled to the brim, the controller on the device does not have enough free cells to organize the memory. The service life of an SSD increases if memory cells are not rewritten too often and there are enough spare lines. With an average-use PC, however, there is no need to worry about the internal functions of the SSD. The manufacturers reserve an area for over-provisioning as standard, to which the user has no access. Depending on the model and total capacity, this reduces the actual usable memory by 7 to 10 percent. This ensures that even with a well-filled SSD there are still free cells available. On SSDs for server use with many write accesses, a larger area is usually reserved for over-provisioning. Some manufacturers also offer tools with which the reserve memory can be increased, for example Samsung Magican. However, this is only useful for servers. Defraggler attempts to move files into areas that are as contiguous as possible. The function can also be used specifically for individual, particularly large files. IDG\n\n6. Clean up discs\n\nThe disk clean-up function has been included with Windows 98, but the tool\u2019s days are numbered. It is still included in Windows 11 24H2, but Microsoft already recommends using the functions in the Settings (see points 1 to 3).\n\nHowever, if you wish, you can still use Disk Cleanup. However, this does not offer any particular advantage because the functions are now fully available in the settings under System > Storage.\n\nIf you still want to use Disk Cleanup, start the tool by searching in the Start menu or by pressing Win+R, entering cleanmgr and clicking on OK. If there are several hard drives, select the drive that you want to clean up, usually the system drive, C:. Click on OK to confirm.\n\nAfter the analysis, tick the areas in which you want to delete something. For more information, click on a line and read the description. There is nothing you cannot delete without hesitation. However, the instructions for the recycle bin and temporary internet files from point 1 also apply here.\n\nBy default, Disk Cleanup only handles user files. If you click on the Clean up system files button and select the system drive, additional options are available to you. For example, Previous Windows installation(s) (if available), Log files for Windows upgrades, and Device driver packages.\n\nOn the More options tab, you can also click on Clean up under System restore and shadow copies. This deletes all restore points except for the last one, which can save several gigabytes.\n\nConfigure profile: If you want to use disk cleanup regularly for certain tasks, you can save the settings in a profile. If system files are also to be deleted, the configuration must be carried out with administrative rights, otherwise the rights of the standard user are sufficient.\n\nWith the saved settings, you can start Disk Cleanup without further configuration and delete everything at once.\n\nStep 1: Use the Start menu to search for cmd. Right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.\n\nStep 2: Type cleanmgr /sageset:1 and confirm with the Enter key. The number \u201c1\u201d is the serial number of the profile. You can enter any number up to four digits to save multiple profiles.\n\nStep 3: Tick all the desired options. Click on OK to save the settings.\n\nStep 4: Right-click on a free area on the desktop. Select New > Shortcut from the menu. In the input field, type\n\ncleanmgr /sagerun:1\n\nand click on Next. Enter a meaningful name and confirm with Finish.\n\nStep 5: Right-click on the shortcut, go to Properties and switch to the Shortcut tab. Click on Advanced and tick the box next to Run as administrator. Click OK and then click OK again.\n\nIf you now start Disk Cleanup by double-clicking on the shortcut, all configured tasks will be processed automatically.\n\nDisk Cleanup is considered outdated in Windows 11. However, it is still available in Windows 11 24H2 and can be used as usual. Foundry\n\n7. Delete browser data\n\nOne program that constantly generates data on the hard drive is the web browser. Browsers do not display websites, images, or videos directly, but first save the content, including images and JavaScript files, in the cache memory.\n\nDepending on how a website is configured, data is preferably loaded quickly from the cache or updated via the internet connection.\n\nAs the cache improves the performance of the browser, it is not recommended to delete it. Browsers usually use memory space moderately and do not use more than necessary. However, you should delete the cache if there are errors in the page display, for example.\n\nIn Microsoft Edge, click on the three-dot menu at the top right and select Settings. Continue in the navigation area on the left-hand side and Privacy, search, and services.\n\nUnder Delete browser data, click on Choose what to clear. Under Time range, you can select a time period for which you want to delete elements. Under Cached images and data you can see how much memory the browser is using.\n\nRemove the tick in front of the areas in which you do not want to delete anything. It is better to exclude Cookies and other site data. Cookies are required, for example, for navigation on websites and also for automatic login.\n\nYou should also be careful with Passwords and Autofill form data. If you have saved data via the browser, this will be lost if you tick the box here. After checking the settings, click on Clear now.\n\nOther browsers offer similar options. Firefox users, for example, go to Privacy & Security in the Settings menu. Under Cookies and website data, click on Remove data. Remove the tick in front of Cookies and website data (recommended) and click on Clear to delete only the cache memory.\n\nBrowsers store numerous files on the hard drive, which makes websites load faster. However, in the event of errors or for data protection reasons, the files should be deleted. Foundry\n\n8. Optimize autostart\n\nMany programs install services or nest themselves in the notification area next to the clock. This is practical for some applications \u2014 for example, if they regularly display important information or report available updates.\n\nHowever, programs that you rarely use should be removed from the autostart. You can do this using Windows\u2019 on-board tools via the Task Manager, which you can start most quickly by pressing the key combination Ctrl+Shift+Esc.\n\nOn the Autostart tab, programs can be removed from Autostart via the Deactivate context menu item. Nothing is deleted in the process. You can reactivate the programs at any time.\n\nIf you want to analyze all autostart ramps, use the Autoruns tool. You can deactivate services and autostart entries and reactivate them later.\n\nThe tool also offers an analysis via virustotal.com to determine whether malware is present.\n\nIf possible, you should uninstall programs that you do not use. This frees up space on your hard drive and improves security. However, the uninstall routines are often not thorough.\n\nIf you want to remove software with less residue, use tools such as Geek Uninstaller or Iobit Uninstaller.\n\nThe cleanup functions in Windows 11 already do a good job. However, additional tools allow a different view of the situation and work more thoroughly. Sometimes too thoroughly, however. Therefore, familiarize yourself sufficiently with the functions before you delete something irretrievably.\n\nBleachbit is one of the tools that can be used to delete a great deal. Close all applications, especially the web browser, before starting the tool. For each category, such as Firefox, Microsoft Office or System, there is a brief description of the options. Only tick the options if you are aware of the effects.\n\nIf in doubt, click on Preview first. Bleachbit will then show you which files are affected. Only after this check do you click on Final cleanup.\n\nAnother tool for the same purpose is Ccleaner. It is somewhat clearer than Bleachbit, but offers more settings and explanatory texts.\n\nYou can also use the Ccenhancer extension, whose rule sets you can set up via Download latest. This will significantly extend the scope of the main program\u2019s program recording.\n\nCcleaner is by far the most popular software for cleaning up the operating system and installed applications.\n\nAmong other things, it offers tools for clearing out the autostart, analyzing hard drive contents, searching for duplicates, managing browser plugins, and securely overwriting free hard drive space in order to delete any file fragments.\n\nTreesize Free and Windirstat help to analyze the drives. These tools detect large files that you may no longer need and want to delete. Everything is actually a particularly fast search tool, but can also be used to sort the file list by size and thus identify space wasters.\n\nTidying up the registry usually does nothing. Nevertheless, you can use a tool such as Wise Registry Cleaner to analyze the registry. If you change anything here, you should first create a backup copy, for example with the Registry Backup tool.\n\nFiles or folders cannot be deleted if the access rights are missing. Use PC-WELT MyRights to add a new context menu item to Windows Explorer, which appears after a right mouse click while holding down the Shift key. Click on Take ownership to obtain full access rights.\n\nWinsxs: The supposedly huge folder When examining your hard drive, you may come across the \u201cWinsxs\u201d folder in the Windows directory. In the properties, Windows Explorer often shows a size of several gigabytes. It contains important program libraries that are used by many applications, as well as system and exe files in different versions. Some of the supposedly numerous files are hard links, i.e. special file links that refer to the corresponding files under \u201cWindows System32,\u201d for example. The actual size is therefore sometimes several GB smaller. Never delete files from the \u201cWinsxs\u201d folder yourself. Doing so can permanently damage the function of the system or applications. Windows regularly cleans up the folder automatically via the task scheduler and removes files that are no longer required.\n\nFoldersizes\n\nFoldersizes\n\nAnalyze partitions and search for large folders\n\nWhen tidying up your hard drive, you often don\u2019t know where to start. Foldersizes helps you by organizing folders by size and displaying this list as a pie chart, bar chart, or map. You can search for space-wasters down to file level with a click of the mouse.\n\nIn contrast to Windirstat, for example, Foldersizes offers a wider range of functions. The disadvantages: The tool is only available in English and must be licensed for 30 US dollars after a trial period of 15 days.\n\nLargest File Finder\n\nLargest File Finder\n\nCompile a list of the largest files\n\nIf you are wondering where all the free space on your new SSD has gone, the freeware Largest File Finder will help you. You don\u2019t need to install the tool, instead you can start searching for the 100 largest files on the entire disc or in the specified folder immediately after double-clicking on its EXE file. At the end, it compiles a list organized by size, which you can use as a guide if you want to create space as easily and efficiently as possible.\n\nDuplicate Media Finder\n\nDuplicate Media Finder\n\nFind and delete all duplicate files\n\nDespite its name, Duplicate Media Finder Free not only searches for media files such as videos, audio files, and images, but also for duplicate files in general. It also finds duplicates that have a different name than the original, which is referred to here as the \u201cmaster file.\u201d The free program is only available in the Microsoft Store. It is a slimmed-down version of a much more comprehensive, paid-for software, which is available for a good $40.\n\nClonespy\n\nClonespy\n\nFind duplicate files and delete them individually\n\nAn alternative to Duplicate Media Finder is Clonespy. The English-language tool immediately indicates when it encounters a duplicate file and, if desired, marks the older versions or the versions with the longer file or folder name. Clonespy is also able to find files with the same name but different contents or to compare files in two folders \u2014 for example on a local and a shared network drive.\n\nRevo Uninstaller\n\nRevo Uninstaller\n\nRemove programs cleanly and without leaving any residue\n\nRevo Uninstaller is the reference in the category of free uninstall programs: The program works very reliably, first starts the uninstall routine of the respective software, and then scans the registry and file systems for any remnants.\n\nThe uninstaller also includes tools for cleaning up browsers, Microsoft Office, Windows, the registry, and Autostart. A special feature is the hunting mode, which allows you to remove programs without a functioning uninstaller.\n\nIobit Uninstaller\n\nIobit Uninstaller\n\nConvenient uninstaller with many extras\n\nIobit\u2019s uninstaller works in exactly the same way as Revo\u2019s uninstaller, but offers a deletion mode for selected programs in one go without prompting. It lists apps from the hardware manufacturer, recently installed programs as well as oversized and rarely used applications, and can also delete browser extensions and Windows apps. You can use an install monitor to log the installation of new software and remove the programs cleanly later.\n\nPrivazer\n\nRemove superfluous ballast\n\nThe free Privazer program carries out a deep scan for user traces on your drives, USB sticks, network drives, and much more. The first step is to select which storage medium is to be analyzed. Then specify which files you want to search for.\n\nAfter starting Privazer, a wizard will help you with the configuration with recommendations. Then start the search by clicking on OK. In the search results, you can click on categories such as Internet activities or Cookies to obtain information on the files concerned. To be on the safe side, you should tick the box next to Create a restore point.\n\nIf problems occur, the deleted files can then be restored. Finally, click on Clean. The deletion of cookies, residual traces of old files, or temporary files is intended to counteract the slowing down of your computer due to data ballast.\n\nThe Spybot \u2013 Search & Destroy freeware scans the system for various types of spyware, malware, dialers, keyloggers, Trojans and other threats. IDG\n\nSpybot\n\nRemove unwanted software\n\nSpybot \u2013 Search & Destroy is a long-established product for searching for browser tracking cookies and unwanted software. This does not necessarily have to be malware in the true sense of the word. Sometimes, however, programs install additional software that you do not want to use.\n\nAfter clicking on Scan system, the tool scans the drives and displays the findings. Check the results, uncheck the boxes next to entries that you do not want to delete, and click on Fix selected.\n\n7-Zip\n\n7-Zip\n\nArchive files and compress them to save space\n\nSpring cleaning is a good opportunity to go through your own file archive and move older or rarely used files to an archive. To save space, you should compress the files. If you want to protect confidential documents, the archive can also be encrypted and secured with a password.\n\nAll this is done for you by the 7-Zip compression program, which is free open source software. You can also use it to copy or move the archives to new folders.\n\nFaststone Image Viewer\n\nFaststone Image Viewer\n\nManage and edit photos\n\nMany users accumulate thousands or even more photos over time, which makes searching for a specific motif much more difficult. Faststone\u2019s Image Viewer shows you all the images in a folder in a preview and offers to convert them into a range of other commonly used formats. The software also has simple editing tools on board, can create a slideshow, and copy and move the image files collectively to other folders.\n\nDigikam\n\nDigikam\n\nManage and search for photos professionally\n\nSoftware for managing large photo collections is usually expensive and therefore only of interest to professional photographers. Digikam is an exception to this rule. The program is open source and free of charge. Digikam is based on a database engine that offers extensive search options according to the date and place the photo was taken as well as other Exif data. This additional information can also be edited. But beware: Digikam is a professional program, which is why it takes time to get to grips with its operation.\n\nPowerlame\n\nPowerlame\n\nSearch and convert MP3 files\n\nAs with photos, the problem with MP3 music is that hundreds or even thousands of files gradually accumulate. The desired song is then difficult to find, especially if you don\u2019t have the title or artist on hand. In these cases, Powerlame can help.\n\nThe tool also reads large MP3 collections and offers a search mask for ID3 tags. It can also rip CDs, adjust the volume of all MP3s, and convert them into WAV files or search for the corresponding CD covers.\n\nMedia Monkey\n\nMedia Monkey\n\nAdd missing data to song files\n\nFor the search in the ID3 tags to be successful, the fields must also be filled in. This is usually not the case with self-ripped MP3s in particular. Media Monkey helps you to enter information about a song such as artist, title, album or composer. Among other things, the program automatically searches for the album, downloads the cover, and enters the data in the tag fields. The tool is also an excellent player that creates playlists and offers an equalizer.\n\nSumo\n\nSumo\n\nCheck installed software for updates\n\nYou should not only regularly clear your Windows PC of junk data, but also make sure that the installed programs are always up to date. Updates not only eliminate software errors and close security gaps, they often also bring new functions. The freeware Sumo scans the existing applications, lists the outdated programs, and takes you to a download site for the update. The paid Pro version can also take care of the installation for you.\n\nDriver Easy\n\nDriver Easy\n\nUpdate drivers to the latest version\n\nAs a rule, Windows provides the appropriate drivers for all hardware components of the PC and also updates them. However, these are often slimmed-down versions without the extended functionality offered by the drivers from the manufacturer\u2019s website.\n\nDriver Easy makes it possible to check the existing driver equipment, point out newer versions, and install them. The free software version only allows manual installation and has a limited download speed.\n\nIobit Driver Booster Free\n\nIobit Driver Booster Free\n\nDetailed driver information\n\nThere is also a free version of Iobit\u2019s Driver Booster. This is limited in the display of outdated drivers and refers to other products from this manufacturer in several places. However, the installation of new driver versions works automatically and quickly enough after a mouse click. In comparison with Driver Easy, Driver Booster found more and more up-to-date driver versions for our test PC. The Pro version offers an automatic update and the automatic creation of restore points.\n\nCore Temp\n\nCore Temp\n\nMeasure and display CPU temperature\n\nIt\u2019s not just in spring that you should take a look at your computer\u2019s hardware. This also includes checking the processor temperature: If it\u2019s too high, this is often a sign that the cooler is dusty, the fan has become loose, or the heatsink is no longer firmly attached to the processor.\n\nAlthough a protective circuit prevents the CPU from burning out, this lowers the processor clock and slows down the computer. The freeware Core Temp shows you the current temperature of each individual CPU core.\n\nGPU-Z\n\nGPU-Z\n\nAll information about the graphics card at a glance\n\nA PC\u2019s graphics chip can also overheat and should therefore be checked regularly. The freeware GPU-Z is suitable for this purpose: It determines the model of the graphics card or chip during installation and retrieves the corresponding data from a database on the Internet. A click on Lookup takes you to the corresponding website. In the Sensors tab, you will find the current GPU measurement values, including the clock frequency, temperature, fan speed, memory utilization, and power consumption.\n\nHD Tune\n\nHD Tune\n\nCheck the temperature and status of the hard drive\n\nIf your computer\u2019s hard drive or SSD fails, important data is often lost. You should therefore keep an eye on its condition and check it regularly. With the HD Tune tool, you can perform a benchmark test, check the sectors for errors, and read out the current temperature.\n\nIf the values deteriorate, you can intervene at an early stage, back up your data or transfer it to a new SSD straight away. The paid version HD Tune Pro provides further benchmarks and information."

After fully embracing the potential of public cloud services, many companies are reevaluating their strategies and shifting workloads back to on-premises infrastructures.\n\nThis trend, known as cloud repatriation, is driven by rising costs and increasing complexities in public cloud environments. More and more repatriation projects are underway as enterprises continue to receive exorbitant cloud bills. Many enterprises now realize that the unexpectedly high costs of cloud services are unsustainable in the long term.\n\nGEICO has made headlines for its decision to repatriate numerous workloads back to on-premises solutions. In a recent interview, Rebecca Weekly, the vice president of platform and infrastructure engineering, said the initial goal of moving to the cloud was to reduce costs and complexity, but it ultimately had the opposite effect."

            "article_content": "From a Mediterranean shipwreck to a mosaic on display in Washington, DC, these are the discoveries that made scholars of the biblical world say \u201cwow\u201d this year.\n\nEmil Aladjem/Israel Antiquities Authority via AP\n\nThe continued fighting in Israel limited biblical archaeology this year. But a few excavations made it into the field in 2024, and some of their discoveries are remarkable. Israel also sent some of its most treasured discoveries aboard\u2014a boon for many in the US who would like to see them.\n\nWhile the most important discoveries of this past year will not be known for years to come, these are the top stories about archaeological developments related to the land of the Bible, the biblical period, and the early history of Christianity that caught our attention in 2024.\n\n10. A new center in Jerusalem\n\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) opened its new center in Jerusalem after 14 years of construction. The Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel hasn\u2019t had a grand opening yet\u2014that may still be a year or two away. But the $106 million structure just down the hill from the Israel Museum began inviting the public to see the new archaeological discoveries.\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nArchitect and urban planner Moshe Safdie designed the building to resemble an excavation site. The entrance is covered by a canopy resembling those found at excavations all over Israel. As visitors descend, they see galleries, laboratories, films, and exhibits that display a small portion of the archaeological richness of the Holy Land.\n\n9. The Siege of Jerusalem\n\nThe Assyrian king Sennacherib \u201ccame down\u201d on Jerusalem in 701 BC \u201clike the wolf on the fold,\u201d with his armies \u201cgleaming in purple and gold,\u201d as famously described by the poet Byron. The king, for his part, ordered an inscription memorializing the feat, saying how he\u2019d shut up Hezekiah \u201clike a caged bird in his royal city.\u201d Sennacherib conveniently omitted the fact that he failed to actually take Jerusalem.\n\nThe site of that siege has been identified by archaeologist Stephen Compton using modern mapping techniques.\n\nCompton took a depiction of Sennacherib\u2019s camp from detailed relief panels excavated from Sennacherib\u2019s palace in Ninevah back in 1840, which are now on display at the British Museum. He superimposed that picture on aerial photos of a siege camp at Lachish, Judah\u2019s second largest city, which was conquered in 701 BC.\n\nCompton then looked around Jerusalem and found a similar layout at Ammunition Hill, now remembered as the site of fierce fighting in Israel\u2019s 1967 Six-Day War. It\u2019s a mile and a half north of Jerusalem\u2019s Damascus Gate. Perhaps someday an excavation will search for siege evidence from 701 BC.\n\nAlthough Jerusalem was not conquered by Sennacherib, the Assyrians exacted heavy tribute. Archaeologists also reported the excavation of an administrative center, near the new US Embassy in southern Jerusalem, that may have been used by the Assyrians to collect tribute. Researchers believe it was built on top of an older administrative center, built by King Hezekiah or his father Ahaz and razed by the invaders to demonstrate their authority. Excavation uncovered an array of personalized, stamped handles from storage jars.\n\n8. Skills of the ancient mariners\n\nThe IAA announced the discovery of the deepest and earliest shipwreck ever found in the Eastern Mediterranean. Previously, historians knew of only two Bronze Age shipwrecks in the region, both near the coast of Turkey. This discovery, 56 miles offshore, suggests ancient mariners were venturing far from shore, which would only be possible with well-developed celestial navigation skills.\n\n\u201cThis is a world-class, history-changing discovery,\u201d said Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA\u2019s marine unit. \u201cThis reveals the ancient mariners\u2019 navigation skills\u2014capable of traversing the Mediterranean Sea without a line of sight to any coast.\u201d\n\nA natural gas company was surveying the sea floor with a submersible robot and came upon a huge pile of jugs a mile below the surface. A few of the jugs were raised to the surface and identified as Late Bronze Age Canaanite storage vessels from the 14th\u201313th century BC. The Canaanites later became known as seafaring Phoenicians and developed a trading network that ranged across the Mediterranean Sea during the Iron Age.\n\n7. A libation token\n\nClay seal impressions with images and letters on one flat side and perhaps the impression on the other are common in biblical archaeology. It\u2019s quite rare to find a blob of ancient clay that is pinched on one side with writing and an image on the reverse, but that\u2019s what a team at the Temple Mount Sifting Project found.\n\nThe discovery, made in 2011, was identified in 2024 as a pilgrim\u2019s token, which could be exchanged for an offering at the temple. The wine jar depicted on the token may indicate it was payment for wine to be poured out on the temple altar. The use of such tokens is described in the Mishna, the oral Jewish law compiled in the second century.\n\n6. Canaanite complex conundrums\n\nSome of the excavations that took place in 2024 explored Canaanite cult complexes dating to the Early Bronze Age, 1,000 years before Abraham, and to the Late Bronze Age, around the time of the Exodus.\n\nSalvage archaeologists preparing the way for urban expansion excavated a site near Beit Shemesh this year and found a building that had been used for ritual activity before being suddenly abandoned. Tiny cultic vessels, which probably had a symbolic purpose, were still intact.\n\nFew similar public buildings from the period have been found in Israel, and this site is helping archaeologists develop their understanding of early urbanization.\n\nAbout six miles south, another Canaanite cult complex has been uncovered at Tel Azekah. Archaeologists say it began as an open-air sanctuary with a spectacular view and was later enclosed. It was dubbed \u201cthe Temple of the Rising Sun.\u201d\n\nTen miles further south, the 14th season of excavation at Tel Burna ended after just three weeks because of the war, with some significant mysteries still unsolved. Archaeologists believe they discovered the part of the cultic complex where the priests lived, but they still don\u2019t know why the religious site appears to have strong cultural connections with Cyprus, which is located 300 miles away in the Mediterranean. And they don\u2019t know why such a large site\u2014perhaps the largest Canaanite cult complex of the Late Bronze Age\u2014was located so far from the coastal trade routes.\n\n\u201cHow did these hillbilly Canaanites build this cult complex?\u201d said Lipscomb University archaeologist Steven Ortiz, who joined the project in 2018, in an interview with CT.\n\nOngoing research at a mysterious mud-brick arch atop Tel Shimron in northern Israel uncovered a great quantity of Canaanite cultic objects. Next to the arch, in a depression that\u2019s called a favissa\u2014a place where sacrificial objects are discarded\u2014researchers found two bronze bull figurines, which are typically connected to the worship of El, the head of the Canaanite pantheon, or the storm god Baal. They also found 40,000 animal bones and 57,000 pottery shards, including remnants of a rare Minoan jug from Crete.\n\n\u201cIn terms of religion, we don\u2019t have anything like this,\u201d archaeologist Daniel Master said. \u201cThis is on a scale that we don\u2019t have anywhere else in this region.\u201d\n\n5. The gate of Shiloh\n\nWhen the Israelites lost the ark of the covenant to the Philistines, the priest Eli fell off his chair and broke his neck at the gate of Shiloh (1 Sam. 4:18). In 2024, the excavation by the Associates for Biblical Research at Tel Shiloh finished uncovering that gate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a niche in the fortification wall. We put a beam into that niche, and it goes right across the top of the pillars,\u201d excavation director Scott Stripling told Christianity Today.\n\nNear the pillars, archaeologists also found geometric paving stones forming a plaza, which is unexpected for that time.\n\nIn another area of the tel, or mound, excavators are uncovering the walls of a building the size of the biblical tabernacle, where the ark of the covenant was kept. They have also discovered a favissa with bones from sacrifices, pottery, and gold objects, which were apparently pendants.\n\n4. Redating a Jerusalem wall\n\nA wall once attributed to King Hezekiah is now thought to have been built earlier by King Uzziah. This indicates that Jerusalem was expanding even before a flood of refugees arrived after the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel in 732 BC.\n\nWhile that reassessment adds valuable insight into the history of the city, it\u2019s also a powerful example of what can be done with a creative combination of complementary technology to establish \u201cabsolute chronology.\u201d\n\nRadiocarbon dating, normally a boon to archaeology, doesn\u2019t work very well for objects made during the Iron Age, due to a cosmic phenomenon known as the Hallstatt Plateau. This has limited the precise dating of archaeological discoveries in Jerusalem during its time as capital of the united Kingdom of Israel and then Judah. For a decade, archaeologists have worked to combine radiocarbon results in four different excavation areas with a precise single-year timeline derived from dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.\n\nThis has led to several redatings, including the wall now attributed to King Uzziah.\n\n3. The start of the alphabet\n\nThe earliest use of alphabetic writing has been pushed back 500 years through the discovery of four small fingers of clay in a tomb at Umm el-Marra in northern Syria. The tomb, which contained burials in gold and silver, was discovered in 2004 and carbon-dated to 2400 BC, the Early Bronze Age, when Umm el-Marra was a crossroad of trade routes between Aleppo and the Euphrates River.\n\nJohns Hopkins University archaeologist Glenn Schwartz was positive about the dating but came slowly to the conclusion that he had found actual alphabetical writing. He went public with his conclusion at November\u2019s annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research.\n\n\u201cPreviously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cBut our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought.\u201d\n\nNumerous references to writing in the Old Testament seem to indicate a level of literacy that archaeology has been slow to support. But recent developments, including the discovery that topped CT\u2019s 2022 archaeology list, are providing a fuller picture of early literacy.\n\n2. Jesus recognized in Germany\n\nA silver amulet was found in an 1,800-year-old burial outside Frankfurt in 2018. In 2024, researchers were able to scan the item, virtually unrolling the thin amulet to read the Latin inscription inside, which says the amulet will \u201cprotect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses.\u201d\n\nThis discovery, announced in December, provides the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, indicating that Christianity spread to Northern Europe more quickly than had been thought. The person who wore it was buried between the year 230 and 270 AD.\n\n1. A mosaic free from prison\n\nThe Megiddo Mosaic was discovered 20 years ago, but the amazing artifact, built for a small group of Christians who worshiped together about 200 years after the time of Jesus, was inaccessible behind prison walls. In 2024, it was loaned to the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, and is now widely available for public viewing.\n\nThe mosaic floor includes three well-preserved inscriptions, and one, in Greek, mentions \u201cGod Jesus Christ,\u201d clearly testifying to the recognition of Jesus as more than a good teacher. The design shows the space was intentionally built for Christian worship. Centered on a Communion table, it more closely resembles a Jewish synagogue than the Roman basilica, and depicts two fish, the most popular Christian imagery before Constantine.\n\nThis is only the third church building that archaeologists have discovered that dates to the time before Constantine made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire. There is one at Dura-Europus in Syria and another at the location traditionally believed to be the apostle Peter\u2019s house in Capernaum. Those were both houses converted for worship.\n\nThis mosaic floor was not discovered at Tel Megiddo, a famous archaeological site, but a few miles down the road during the renovation of a prison. The mosaic will be on display at the Museum of the Bible until July. It will eventually return to Israel.\n\nThis is an unusually good time to see biblical archaeology in US museums. In addition to the Megiddo Mosaic, the IAA has a permanent display at the Museum of the Bible called People of the Land, and the IAA also has a traveling exhibit on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is currently at the Reagan library in California.\n\nThe Tel Dan Stele, which includes the first known reference to the house of David, is on display at the Jewish Museum in New York City through January 5. And Discovering the World of Jesus, which includes the controversial James Ossuary with the inscription \u201cJames, the son of Joseph, the brother of Jesus,\u201d is on display in Atlanta.\n\nGordon Govier writes about biblical archaeology for Christianity Today, hosts the archaeology radio program The Book and The Spade, and is the editor of Artifax."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

            "article_content": "The story so far: On December 13, Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of the Mission Governing Board of the nascent National Quantum Mission, said India plans to launch a quantum satellite in \u201c2-3 years for quantum communications\u201d.\n\nWhat is the National Quantum Mission?\n\nThe National Quantum Mission (NQM) is a Department of Science & Technology programme to accelerate the use of quantum physics in the development of next-generation communications and sensing systems.\n\nThe development of computers changed the course of human history from the mid-20th century onwards. Thanks to advances in this sector, which continue to this day, humankind has access to telecommunications, weather forecasts, drug-discovery programmes, search-and-rescue plans, artificial intelligence, etc.\n\nBut many of these advances are nearing a saturation point because the physics phenomena on which they are based, called classical physics, are hitting a performance upper-limit. Today scientists around the world are building new devices to perform the same functions but using quantum physics. Because the rules of quantum physics allow for the outcomes of classical physics as well as \u2018bonus\u2019 ones not found in the classical paradigm, the new devices are expected to have new abilities.\n\nThe Union Cabinet approved the NQM in April 2023 at a total cost of Rs 6,000 crore, to be implemented from 2023 to 2031. The planned quantum satellite is an experiment in this package.\n\nWhat is a quantum satellite?\n\nA quantum satellite is a term for a communications satellite that uses quantum physics to secure its signals.\n\nCommunications is a broad term that refers to technologies that send and receive signals. An important part of these technologies is security: preventing bad actors from intercepting a message being transmitted across large distances, through multiple networks.\n\nThe advent of quantum computers threatens the technologies currently being used to secure messages. Fortunately, quantum physics has also paved the way for new forms of protection, and quantum satellites are expected to facilitate them.\n\nHow are messages secured?\n\nSay two people, Anil and Selvi, are standing at two ends of a playground and wish to speak to each other. The simplest way is to shout or wave their hands. There is also a third person, Kaushik, standing in the middle of the ground trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. If Anil and Selvi are shouting or using hand signals, Kaushik will have little difficulty intercepting their messages \u2014 but not if they are communicating via WhatsApp.\n\nMessages in WhatsApp are encrypted. Encryption means a message is written in a secret code before it is transmitted. When the recipient receives it, they will use their knowledge of the code to decrypt the message and read it. If a bad actor like Kaushik somehow intercepts the message, he can\u2019t read it without knowing the code.\n\nFor example, in a Caesar cipher, the letters of the alphabet are offset by a fixed number. If the number is 5, the words BIRDS FLY AWAY become GNWIX KQD FBFD.\n\nThis paradigm is called cryptographic security. It gets its strength by hiding the key to cracking the code behind an extremely difficult mathematical problem. Anil\u2019s and Selvi\u2019s devices already have the solution to this problem. If Kaushik wants it, however, he has to first solve the problem with a computer \u2014 and the harder the problem, the more time (or more computing resources) he will need.\n\nA modern computer can crack a Caesar cipher quickly by repeatedly trying all possible keys (1-26) until the text becomes legible. But even the most powerful supercomputers can\u2019t crack the best Advanced Encryption Standard ciphers today in a single lifetime. Quantum computers may be able to do better, however.\n\nHow can quantum physics protect messages?\n\nQuantum cryptography uses the tenets of quantum physics to secure messages. Its most famous type is quantum key distribution (QKD).\n\nIn the example before, Anil used a secret code to encrypt or \u2018lock\u2019 his message and Selvi had the key to decrypt and read the message. QKD is concerned with sharing the key with Anil and Selvi such that if Kaushik is eavesdropping on the transmission, everyone will find out and the sharing is aborted.\n\nQuantum physics can reveal eavesdropping in different ways. One is quantum measurement \u2014 the act of measuring the properties of a quantum system, like a photon (the subatomic particle of light). According to the rules of quantum physics, a quantum measurement changes the state of the system. If information about the key is encoded in a stream of photons (in two states, one representing 0 and the other 1) and Kaushik traps and measures them to look for it, the state of the photons will change and Anil and Selvi will know the key has been compromised.\n\nAnother way is to use quantum entanglement: when two photons are entangled, any change to one particle will instantaneously change the other. (This is a necessarily simplistic description.)\n\nSince the key will be lost irrespective of what technological capabilities Kaushik possesses, QKD is said to provide unconditional security.\n\nHas QKD been implemented?\n\nRavindra Pratap Singh, of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, wrote in 2023 that the standards for different QKD protocols and the technologies they will require to implement as designed are still a decade away. This said, China currently operates the world\u2019s largest QKD network with three quantum satellites and four ground stations.\n\nExperts are also trying to implement QKD across longer distances. In the two decades since its experimental proof in 1992, the distance of reliable transmissions has increased to several hundred kilometres either through fibre-optic cables or free space.\n\nIn 2013, researchers from China reported that they had implemented QKD between a ground station and a moving hot-air balloon (carrying a payload of instruments) 20 km up. This demonstration bolstered the case for quantum satellites.\n\nIn an October 2024 study, researchers at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, reported that the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, Ladakh, offered the best atmospheric conditions through which to transmit data for a satellite-based QKD system. It had an estimated signal loss of 44 dB, compared to 50 dB in the Chinese experiment.\n\n\u201cOur main signal would be at 810 nm while the uplink and downlink would use 532 nm and 1550 nm of wavelength, respectively,\u201d the paper\u2019s lead author Satya Ranjan Behera told the Department of Science & Technology. The planned beam distance is 500 km.\n\nDoes QKD have drawbacks?\n\nBecause QKD on paper can be very different from that in the real-world, the U.S. National Security Agency has recommended the use of post-quantum cryptography rather than quantum cryptography. Its criticism is focused on five limitations:\n\n(i) \u201cQKD does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source\u201d;\n\n(ii) \u201csince QKD is hardware-based\u201d, QKD networks can\u2019t be upgraded or patched easily;\n\n(iii) \u201cQKD increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks\u201d that \u201celiminate many use cases from consideration\u201d;\n\n(iv) \u201cthe actual security provided by a QKD system is not the theoretical unconditional security from the laws of physics \u2026 but rather the more limited security that can be achieved by hardware and engineering designs\u201d; and\n\n(v) since eavesdroppers can cause a transmission to stop, they can deny the use of a transmission by its intended users (a.k.a. a denial-of-service attack).\n\nPost-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic techniques that resist attacks from both quantum and classical devices using more advanced classical encryption.\n\nQuantum physics also imposes some restrictions. For example, non-quantum information can be amplified before being transmitted across large distances whereas the no-cloning theorem prohibits the amplification of quantum information."
