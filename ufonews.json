            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nThe US Congress has been attempting to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs - as our maps show the places in the UK and America most likely to be visited by extra-terrestrials.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023. That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nUsers local to the New York City area confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nOther users deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious, and was shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a fuck about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on Thursday evening when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upwards or downwards.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump carries a pair of his new signature shoes before taking the stage at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCampaign catchphrases aside, we can probably all agree that this was a very weird year in politics, particularly in Pennsylvania, the swingiest of swing states. Before we look ahead to 2025 let\u2019s review the ways Pennsylvania\u2019s politics and politicians got a little (or a lot) weird in 2024.\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, President-elect Donald Trump did, in fact, take the stage at Sneaker Con in Philly back in February to unveil an official sneaker: gold high-tops with American flag logos, available for pre-order at $399 (limit three pairs per customer). Reporter John Cole had to convince his editor it wasn\u2019t a social media joke, and ended up with a front row seat despite little advance notice from the campaign about where and how to catch Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump admitted the sneakerhead crowd was \u201ca slightly different audience than I\u2019m used to,\u201d but also said launching the shoe line was something he had wanted to do for \u201ca long time.\u201d He did not wear the shoes on stage. And further proving that politics make strange bedfellows, we discovered that according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the president of Sneaker Con made donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and a Trump-affiliated PAC, although in relatively small amounts.\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, the head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) talked about the agency tracking UFO sightings, to the surprise of committee chairperson Jordan Harris. It took a while to receive them, but senior reporter Peter Hall sought records on the sightings, which showed PEMA investigated more than a dozen incidents over the past decade.\n\nThe sightings included mysterious lights following a motorist on a dark country road, a saucer-shaped craft hovering over a suburban subdivision, and a flaming orb falling into the woods, the records show. Many of the incidents are reported to Stan Gordon, a Westmoreland County resident who operates a 24-hour UFO, bigfoot and cryptid reporting hotline, who said the line has \u201cnever stopped ringing\u201d since the Kecksburg UFO incident of 1965.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken these cases very open mindedly,\u201d Gordon told the Capital-Star \u201cWe approach them scientifically.\u201d\n\nMold in a government office does not seem like the kind of situation that would require a whistleblower, but here we are. A staffer at Rep. Eric Davanzo\u2019s (R-Westmoreland) district office in West Newton complained of foul odors, and bought tests to check for the presence of mold. That didn\u2019t go over too well when the tests came back positive, and she was later fired. She sued for wrongful termination and the Commonwealth Court ruled she could move forward with a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nFirst things first: If you want to try to modify the weather in Pennsylvania, you need a license \u2014 but since the law took effect in 1967 no one has applied for one (we asked).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), former GOP nominee for governor, claims that new technology and a proliferation of weather modification patents \u201cowned by a combination of Federal Government Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and large multinational corporations\u201d have brought forward the need to update Pennsylvania\u2019s law. He wrote a memo seeking co-sponsor for legislation he intends to introduce.\n\nThe legislation would ban the release of substances within the borders of Pennsylvania to affect the temperature, weather or intensity of sunlight, and appears to be rooted in the false belief that condensation trails left by high flying aircraft are actually trails of chemicals \u2014 aka chemtrails \u2014 released by the government for nefarious reasons, that has become conflated with techniques being explored to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to write a story with so much potential to use the phrase \u201cred wave.\u201d Alas, it only occurred to our headline writer much later (which, truly, is probably for the best). In June, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) objected to a bill to create a grant program that would make pads and tampons free for public school students. She didn\u2019t like that the bill\u2019s cosponsorship memo referred to menstruating women as \u201cpeople,\u201d and claimed the bill was \u201cjust another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s prime sponsors, Rep. Darisha Parker (D-Philadelphia), said the bill would serve to \u201crestore the dignity to these women and girls who have gone unsupported far too long.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 117 to 85. It did not advance in the Senate."

            "article_content": "AI is now everywhere, even if it is not natively integrated. It has given everyone the power to get things done, understand complex things, and create images using their imagination. Meta AI, the AI-powered chatbot, has been rolled out to almost everyone, and here is how to use the Meta AI in WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of all these apps before you try. Also, it is possible that Meta may not have rolled it out for all users and countries. So, if you press @ and Meta AI doesn\u2019t show up, that would be why.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in WhatsApp\n\nMeta AI was the first to roll on WhatsApp and has been incredibly useful for many. If you are a small business or struggle with creative writing, Meta AI can help you rather quickly. You can access Meta AI using the @ button in single or group chat and interact with it directly as a contact.\n\nSince the group chats are visible to everyone, use the one-to-one chat to get things done and then forward it to other groups or chats.\n\nYou can also access Meta AI using the individual chat option. The interesting part is that Meta AI now offers an AI studio with many ChatBots of different styles. That includes advice and connections, pop culture, Anime, and more.\n\nRead: Stop Meta from using your data for AI training\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Instagram\n\nInstagram is all about Reels and Images. That\u2019s where the Meta AI imagine feature comes into the picture. While it is not natively integrated yet, you can use it in Group or Individual conversations by asking it to generate images using the /imagine switch.\n\nHow to use Meta AI in Facebook Messenger\n\nLike above, you can quickly access Meta AI using the @ button from the text box. You can then ask a question; for example, you can ask for restaurant recommendations, information on a topic, or even a request. Or you can go ahead and tag a conversation and ask Meta to explain it.\n\nIf images are your thing, then directly type /imagine or @metaAI /imagine followed by your description, and it will generate AI images you can send. However, do remember that Meta AI will provide answers or content directly within your chat, visible to all participants.\n\nRead: Is it Real or AI Picture? How to identify using tools?\n\nMeta AI in WhatsApp is not working\n\nIf Meta AI isn\u2019t working correctly in WhatsApp, make sure your app is up to date, as older versions might not support the feature. If issues persist, clear the app\u2019s cache through your phone\u2019s settings to resolve minor glitches. Restart the app by closing and reopening it to refresh the connection.\n\nMeta AI is not able to read chat in the Group\n\nEven though Meta Ai is part of WhatsApp groups or Messenger, it can read or analyze a message even if tagged. If you want it to read, you must type it, and it will be visible to everyone."

            "article_content": "For a lot of people growing up in the 2000s and early 2010s, their coming of age happened on the Internet. There was Facebook where you added everyone you had ever known and there was an innocuous Instagram where people would share their unfiltered (or with extreme colour filters) everyday moments \u2014a cup of coffee, a pretty flower on a sidewalk, or a funny selfie with their best friend. Those were simpler times\u2026 of course, not as simple as before smartphones were invented, but who even remembers that now?\n\nHowever, whoever hopped on to these platforms in their early phases can tell you that these were solid places to strengthen old or existing friendships; and to harbour new ones as well. Everyone you knew from school or college, you could talk to for hours on Facebook; and on Twitter (now X), you could connect with people over common interests\u2014politics, law, cinema, and what not.\n\nThe Internet could have been a wonderful place to nurture these friendships\u2014and for many, it has been\u2014but it\u2019s led to a deeper isolation we\u2019ve now embedded in our lives, that of shrinking social circles.\n\nAlso Read The year AI took centrestage Why India\u2019s gaming content creator ecosystem has become pivotal for brands Gen AI fuels surge in cyber threats, advance strategies needed: Palo Alto The rise of family-centric OTT content: A game-changer in streaming\n\nWithout notice, the world moved away from making friends through chance encounters, awkward interactions, or through being in the same communities to becoming friends with strangers through virtual mediums across geographies and topographies, simply because the online algorithm somehow connected you two.\n\nNow, in the past few years, technology seems to have taken a step further. From real friends and virtual friends, we\u2019ve now moved to imaginary friends, the elephant in the room\u2014AI companions.\n\nBut wait, will it be a stretch to say that just because the way we make friends, or who we make friends with has changed, our social circles have also shrunken?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. A 2023 survey conducted by Meta-Gallup found that over one in five people globally feel lonely. In the same year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that loneliness is now a \u201cglobal public health concern\u201d. The United Nations agency went on to add that loneliness has the same effect on people\u2019s mortality as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\n\nSo, if the Internet is a space where you can interact with practically anyone, provided they also have access to the Internet, why do so many people feel lonely? The answer is in what the American Psychological Association defines loneliness as\u2014\u201cpeople\u2019s levels of satisfaction with their connectedness, or their perceived social isolation\u201d\u2014you might be connected with many people, but the question then is whether you are satisfied with that connection.\n\nDr Kedar Tilwe, consultant psychiatrist, Fortis Hospital Mulund & Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, says, \u201cExcessive use of social media has led to us defining our experiences by the number of likes and shares we receive rather than by the actual quality of experience that we go through. This has led to a disconnect, which is affecting us and increasing our sense of loneliness. At the same time, the tendency to believe that everyone else on that platform is enjoying their life to the fullest, whereas we are missing out on it, can cause an excessive sense of loneliness.\u201d\n\nDr Tilwe adds, \u201cThe other factor is the fear of missing out, which can further worsen our sense of hopelessness or worthlessness. This fear often stems from the belief that we may not be able to experience everything that life has to offer, leading to a sense of lacking. Even a person with less screen time but who is extremely sensitive and feels like they are missing out on experiences can be more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nA study published in the American Sociological Review in 2006 had noted that people were having friendships that weren\u2019t as meaningful as they would have liked, which in 2024 also points to the fact that social media makes you believe that you have a lot more friends than you actually do, an illusion that\u2019s getting harder to break as the online world becomes a more and more important aspect of our lives.\n\nInterestingly, as part of their \u2018switch-off\u2019 campaign, tech company Vivo recently released a report titled, Impact of Smartphones on Parent-Child Relationship. The report highlighted that 76% parents said that they \u201ccannot live without their smartphones\u201d, 71% children said that they were dependent on smartphones, and 94% children said that they \u201cactually wish that some of the most popular social media apps had never even been invented\u201d.\n\nThis aversion to social media platforms is understandable, considering that they are made to be addictive, since their algorithms engage us in an infinite loop and their notifications prompt the generation of the chemical dopamine in our systems. In 2022, Max Fisher wrote in his book The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Brains and Our World, \u201cDopamine creates a positive association with whatever behaviours prompted its release, training you to repeat them\u2026 When that dopamine reward system gets hijacked, it can compel you to repeat self-destructive behaviours. To place one more bet, binge on alcohol\u2014or spend hours on apps even when they make you unhappy.\u201d\n\nThis, right here, is why it then becomes important to remember that we can\u2019t let go of our real life human connections in lieu of online friendships. A 2018 study in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology had in fact noted that decreasing one\u2019s dependency on social media apps led to reduced feelings of loneliness, and depression as well.\n\nThe other side\n\nIt\u2019s not that social media and AI have made everyone lonely, though. A 2024 working paper published by Harvard Business School, titled AI Companions Reduce Loneliness, analysed six studies conducted on people who signed up on AI friendship apps and found that people who had mentioned the term \u2018loneliness\u2019 while reviewing these apps on the App Store gave it a higher rating, perhaps because the app/AI companion made them feel less lonely. Not just that, the researchers also found that users \u201cexpressed loneliness-related thoughts\u201d to chatbots and that they felt \u201cheard\u201d without judgement by these AI companions.\n\nIn fact, a 2024 study published in Nature journal, titled Loneliness and Suicide Mitigation for Students Using GPT3-Enabled Chatbots, also noted that users felt positive changes in their behaviour and felt more confident after conversing with AI companions like Replika, with some even mentioning that \u201cReplika stopped them from attempting suicide.\u201d\n\nJAMA Network, too, recently published a study saying that AI-generated empathy was helping humans feel better.\n\nThis, then, helps make sense of the fact that AI companions and friends make up the \u201csecond-largest AI-driven business\u201d in the United States, behind only chatbots, tech analysts say.\n\nWorries remain\n\nBut there still remain concerns about the kind of connections people make on social media or with AI companions, and if they are altering the inherent way we look at our social circles. Will we start relying so much on AI companions that we end up with no human friends and no human contact? Will that increase feelings of loneliness in us? Is simply conversing with an AI companion enough when it comes to our need for social interactions? Will the lack of human touch, which many scientists have said is a necessity, not get to us?\n\nIn a May 2024 piece published in The New York Times, Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University, was quoted as saying, \u201cThe major issue I have with loneliness metrics is they often fail to distinguish between the ordinary healthy loneliness, which gets us off our couch and into the social world when we need it, and the chronic dangerous loneliness, which prevents us from getting off our couch and spirals and leads us to spiral into depression and withdrawal. I think of loneliness as our bodies\u2019 signal to us that we need better, more satisfying connections with other people.\u201d\n\nDr Sameer Malhotra, senior director and head of mental health and behavioural sciences at Saket\u2019s Max Super Speciality Hospital, agrees with this. He says, \u201cPeople tend to ignore other life priorities and get too involved and influenced by the world of social media.\u201d This social media-induced loneliness and the absence of human connection can precipitate bigger concerns like major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse disorders, Dr Tilwe adds.\n\nNot all\u2019s lost\n\nBut, of course, not all\u2019s lost. Mental health professionals say even small efforts to regain control over your life in real time can have successful dividends.\n\nDr Tilwe advises limiting your overall screen time and having some time for yourself that you ensure is a dedicated \u201cscreen-free time\u201d. Other than this, you can also practise digital detox for at least 4-6 hours a week, which really isn\u2019t a lot of time to go by without looking at a screen.\n\nAnd baby steps might be the easier way to go about this as well. Says Dr Malhotra, \u201cStart by having at least one meal in a day with your family.\u201d\n\nOther than this, to combat the loneliness epidemic, that has only been exacerbated by the increased involvement of social media and AI relationships in our lives, the doctors suggest:\n\nTry and lead a balanced lifestyle\n\nTake out some time to spend in nature every week\n\nEngage in any physical sport or activity\n\nMaintain a healthy sleep cycle\n\nDon\u2019t let social media cloud your real priorities\n\nDon\u2019t neglect your responsibilities or your own self\n\nTry to pursue meaningful or creative hobbies\n\nTry to develop hobbies that don\u2019t require gadgets\n\nEnsure you have a demarcated time each day to be spent gadget-free\n\nMental health experts also emphasise that if you\u2019ve been too deeply invested in the rabbit hole of the Internet, it might be important to rebuild your relationship with your own self as well, and re-learn the value of interacting with others without a virtual medium.\n\nBut most importantly, Dr Malhotra says, \u201cRevive the real time spent with your family and friends and avoid excessive dependence on the digital world or on social media.\u201d\n\nCause for concern"

            "article_content": "A witch who lives in a cemetery with human corpses has revealed how she leads a paranormal, supernatural lifestyle.\n\nWren Harris is a qualified Clinical Aromatherapist, Massage Therapist and Reiki Practitioner, and she\u2019s been a witch for 26 years. The 41-year-old, who\u2019s from Leicestershire, explains how she\u2019s always felt more at home in \u2018supernatural settings\u2019, which is why she lives in a three-bedroom house in a cemetery.\n\nWren shares her home with husband Justin, 50, and their children, and explains that she never turns away any visitor who is in need of help to locate the grave of a loved one buried near her home. To share her experiences with the supernatural, Wren runs an Instagram account under the name of \u2018@the_cemetety_witch\u2019 and has over 36,000 followers.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"When we first moved in I felt the presence of a man in our bedroom near the fireplace and moving towards the window, almost like a piece of video playing out,\" Wren said. \"He was not aware of me and seemed to be going about his business. I have also felt a presence near my bed on several occasions, like someone was standing there.\n\n\"We also had some activity in the lounge when we first moved in, some loud noises and bangs that had no source. All the activity seemed to stop once we settled. Recently our youngest daughter has experienced something. She couldn't put it into words but refused to sleep in the bedroom for about six months. Otherwise, our house has a sense of deep peace and things have largely settled now that we have been here a while.\n\n\"I was drawn to the space next to our house and initially thought it might be a small area for us to use, but it turns out that it's where babies are buried. Often they were buried without headstones in Victorian England because they were expensive and deaths amongst children were extremely common. I've had several miscarriages myself and feel protective over this part of the cemetery and wonder if that's why I was drawn to it.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nAlthough this would be alarming to most, Wren refuses to allow trolls who spread \"fear and hatred\" to affect her and is instead focused on making witchcraft accessible and challenging dangerous and outdated beliefs. \"There are always those people who go out of their way to locate Witchcraft accounts and leave negative comments. Usually these people have closed, private accounts and don't leave themselves open in the way that I do,\u201d said Wren.\n\n\"Sadly, most of these people are ardent Christians who have a warped view of Witchcraft. Under a picture of a late friend who was prominent in the Druid community, someone on Instagram left the comment that he was, 'now burning in hell.' The irony was not lost on me that this person who was claiming that their way is the only way and that they are morally superior, was the person spreading fear and hatred. They left a number of aggressive comments across my account denouncing me as all kinds of evil. But I don't let these comments get to me.\"\n\nWren's journey with witchcraft began when she found a book on the occult when she was only twelve years old. She says that she immediately felt a sense of familiarity like she had returned \"home\". It has also allowed her to \"love and accept\" herself and \"strive to do better\" and her parents were supportive of her newfound practice.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) Image: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe explained: \"When I was about 12, I found a book in my parents' loft called Cult and Occult by Francis King. It had been put aside to sell at a car boot sale. It covered topics such as sacred geometry, palmistry and dowsing. There was a section on British Witchcraft and I was mesmerised by the photographs; there was something about them that seemed incredibly familiar as if I'd gone 'home'. Not long after this experience, I went on a trip to Avebury Stone Circle and West Kennet Long Barrow with my school, leaving me enchanted further.\n\n\"Between these two experiences a whole new world had opened up to me. At about age 14 or 15 my mum paid for a subscription to a magazine called \"Mind, Body & Spirit\u201d. It was a ring binder collection where you received a new candle or crystal or tarot card each week, and that opened my eyes further.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 18 I joined the Pagan Federation and the Children of Artemis - two organisations which helped me step onto my path properly and led me to start meeting other like-minded folk. In recent years I have written for Witchcraft magazines and websites, reviewing books in Witchcraft, and been involved in the Pagan community both online and in person.\"\n\nWren tries to incorporate Witchcraft into her daily routine. She explains: \"Our house is extremely cold so I currently start the day with a cup of something hot, stirring in good vibes and setting my intentions for the day. I usually light some incense and a candle and set about the tasks of the day. Often we'll get a knock on the door for cemetery business, delivery men trying to find our address or people trying to locate graves. When my husband comes home we have a cup of tea together and make dinner, which again involves a bit of magic in its preparation. Many of my daily rituals and tasks involve some form of Witchcraft. Each waking moment is a chance for intention setting and opportunity. Each waking moment is a chance for joy and celebration.\"\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\nShe says that it gives her life more meaning and allows her to be completely authentic. \"Witchcraft is a lifestyle for me,\" Wren said. \"It is my beliefs, my attitudes, my practices. It is an opportunity for me to stand in my authentic self. It is an opportunity to embrace the turn of the Wheel and celebrate the deep meaning of the seasons as we navigate our way through the year, deepening our connection to nature.\n\n\"These celebrations add context and meaning to life and the passing of time. This path has helped me love and accept myself as an individual, made me strive to do better, and truly embrace the important things in life.\"\n\nWren is also extremely passionate about helping other Witches on their spiritual journeys and challenging negative perceptions of Witchcraft.\"I'm passionate about Witchcraft and would love to team this with the enthusiasm of others starting out on their path,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd really like to help and inspire new witches by sharing what I've learned by releasing my own personal Grimoire and mentoring in some way. I feel I have stepped into the Crone aspect of my life and Witchcraft journey, and it is now time to widen the circle by sharing my experience and knowledge.\n\nImage: mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi) mediadrumimages/@the_cemetery_wi)\n\n\"I am passionate about educating others on the topic of Witchcraft, making it accessible and dispelling myths. And I feel sorry for people who are driven to spend their time judging others. I truly wish the best for them and hope they can find a kinder way in their treatment of others moving forward. I think that we are very lucky in the UK in that we are more likely to be laughed at for calling ourselves witches, rather than being persecuted, which is absolutely brilliant, but I do think there is some element of not being taken seriously.\"\n\nWren also offered some advice for those who are interested in Witchcraft or leading a more spiritual life. \"What drives many Pagans is a deep love for nature and the desire for self-development,\" she said. \"We're also a very friendly bunch that love a good celebration. Buy some books on the subject, maybe approach some experienced witches for advice, and get reading and practising. Embrace who you are and don't compare you or your journey to others. The truth is that the learning on this path never stops - that's the beauty of it.\n\n\"The word \"witch\" is just a label that doesn't need to be adopted if it doesn't feel right. Some people lead magical lives without even realising it. That there are magical acts embedded in our everyday lives such as blowing out candles on a birthday cake and making a wish, drawing images in the air with a sparkler, or lighting a candle in church with loving intention.\n\n\"We all celebrate similar things, for example, the celebration of light in winter, which is celebrated by festivals spanning various religions. That those who follow this path are just like you and me.\""

Last year's excellent Alan Wake 2 then fleshed out that interlocked story further, and even unofficially (for probably legal reasons) tied it to back Max Payne and Quantum Break - both of which are owned by Rockstar Games and Xbox respectively.\n\nBut when asked about if there's an endgame in sight - an Avengers Endgame type of conclusion, if you will - Sam Lake told IGN that the studio are \"just getting started\" and \"it's too early to start talking about an endgame.\"\n\nSam Lake on Control 2, Remedy\u2019s Connected Universe, and the Studio\u2019s Future - YouTube Watch On\n\n\"I love tying these things together,\" he said. \"I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand, entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting. And the way we are looking at it is, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own feet, but then, for our fans, for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story.\"\n\nLake also explains that newcomers can jump into any of their games, and then hopefully dip back into the other, older Remedy games to \"dive deeper into that rabbit hole.\"\n\nFor now, Remedy will continue tugging at these threads in its first ever co-op shooter FBC: Firebreak coming next year, paranormal sequel Control 2, and maybe even with its Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes in collaboration with Rockstar Games.\n\nCheck out more upcoming games of 2025 and beyond to not miss a single beat."

Interestingly, Paul McCartney was asked if he ever had a supernatural experience and he went on to reveal his views on ghosts.\n\nA lot of classic rock got pretty mystical. Interestingly, Paul McCartney was asked if he ever had a supernatural experience and he went on to reveal his views on ghosts. Other members of The Beatles had plenty to say about the paranormal.\n\nWhat Paul McCartney did when his kids were afraid of ghosts\n\nThe Beatles had plenty to say about faith. John Lennon got in a lot of trouble proclaiming that The Beatles were \u201cmore popular than Jesus.\u201d He later penned the atheist/communist anthem \u201cImagine.\u201d Meanwhile, George Harrison famously converted to Hinduism. His faith had a significant impact on his work with The Beatles and on his solo career. Paul\u2019s views on these topics have not received nearly as much attention.\n\nDuring a 2024 interview from PaulMcCartney.com, a fan asked the \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed\u201d singer was asked if he had ever encountered the supernatural. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he replied. \u201cNot really.\n\n\u201cMy dreams are very supernatural, I can go anywhere there,\u201d he added. \u201cBut not in real life. I\u2019ve never actually seen a ghost or a spirit, and I\u2019m not a great believer in all that. A lot of it comes from raising kids: when they\u2019d say, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m scared of ghosts,\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018There\u2019s no such thing.\u2019 You do a lot of that as a parent.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Band on the Run\u2019 singer has similar views of ghosts and religion\n\nThe \u201cSilly Love Songs\u201d singer went on to denounce the entire concept of the supernatural. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think the human mind is susceptible to getting a bit worked up and overexcited, and often these things have a rational explanation in the end.\u201d\n\nDuring a 2012 interview with The Independent, Paul was asked if religion plays a meaningful role in his life. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a kind of personal faith in something good, but it doesn\u2019t really go much further than that. It\u2019s certainly not subscribing to any organized religion.\u201d\n\nPaul went on to denounce mainstream religion. \u201cI think that [organized religion] is the cause of a lot of trouble \u2014 \u2018My god is better than yours,'\u201d he opined. \u201cBut I do think there is something greater than me \u2026 and that\u2019s not easy to imagine.\u201d Paul didn\u2019t explain what the \u201csomething greater\u201d was supposed to be, but given his other comments, we can probably assume it\u2019s not a standard conception of God.\n\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney agreed on something\n\nWhile John and Paul did not see eye-to-eye on many subjects, they said similar things about mysticism. During a 1980 interview in the book All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, the \u201cWhatever Gets You Thru the Night\u201d star said he viewed magic simply as science which had yet to be explained. Like Paul, his views on the subject were ultimately naturalistic.\n\nWhile Paul isn\u2019t a believer, supernatural concepts impacted The Beatles\u2019 work. One of their most famous album tracks is called \u201cMagical Mystery Tour.\u201d In the 1997 book Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, the singer said \u201cThe Fool on the Hill\u201d was inspired by The Fool, one of the most famous tarot cards.\n\nWhether you believe in the supernatural or not, we can all agree The Beatles\u2019 music is magic."

            "article_content": "Understanding genetic influences on weight\n\nRecent advancements in genetics have shed new light on the complex relationship between our genes and weight management. Research conducted by the University of Essex has uncovered 14 specific genes that significantly influence how individuals respond to weight-loss strategies. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that weight loss is solely a matter of diet and exercise, offering a deeper understanding of why people experience such varied results despite similar efforts.\n\nThese findings not only highlight the biological factors at play but also open new avenues for personalized approaches to weight management. As scientists delve deeper into this genetic landscape, the potential for tailored solutions that cater to an individual\u2019s unique genetic profile becomes increasingly promising.\n\nBreakthrough research findings\n\nA landmark study conducted on 38 adults aged 20 to 40 analyzed over 1,000 genetic variants to determine their impact on weight loss. The researchers observed dramatic differences in outcomes, even among participants following the same diet and exercise routines. This study highlights the importance of genetics in shaping metabolism, fat storage, and the body\u2019s ability to burn calories efficiently.\n\nKey findings from the study revealed that individuals with certain genetic markers experienced improved fat metabolism and greater efficiency during exercise. This suggests that genetics may hold the key to unlocking more effective weight-loss strategies, particularly for those who struggle with conventional methods.\n\nKey genetic markers and their impact\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries is the role of the PARGC1A gene, which affects mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Approximately 20-40% of the global population carries this gene variant, which has been linked to improved fat-burning capabilities during physical activity.\n\nThe PGC-1\u03b1 protein, regulated by this gene, plays a critical role in determining how efficiently the body uses energy. Individuals with this genetic advantage may find it easier to lose weight through exercise, as their bodies are better equipped to metabolize fat.\n\nAlso, researchers identified other genes that influence factors like appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity, and the body\u2019s response to caloric restriction. These genetic markers create a unique profile for each individual, shaping their weight-loss potential and response to various interventions.\n\nExercise interaction with genetics\n\nWhile genetics provide a framework for weight management, they require activation through physical activity to be effective. The study emphasized that even individuals with favorable genetic traits saw minimal results without regular exercise. This underscores the importance of combining genetic predispositions with an active lifestyle.\n\nParticipants who exercised consistently experienced significantly greater weight loss compared to those with similar genetic profiles who led sedentary lives. The findings suggest that physical activity acts as a catalyst, enabling individuals to fully leverage their genetic potential.\n\nFor those without advantageous genetic markers, the study provides hope that dedication to exercise and healthy eating can still lead to meaningful results. Genetics may provide an edge, but they are not the sole determinant of success.\n\nFuture implications for weight management\n\nThe insights gained from this research pave the way for a future where weight-loss strategies are tailored to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. Personalized weight management programs could include genetic testing as a standard component, helping individuals identify the most effective approaches based on their unique profiles.\n\nFor instance, someone with a genetic predisposition for slow fat metabolism might benefit from a higher-protein diet and strength-based exercise routines. Conversely, those with genes favoring fat-burning could focus on cardiovascular workouts for optimal results.\n\nHowever, the study also cautions against relying solely on genetic information. Healthy lifestyle habits remain crucial, and genetics should be seen as a tool to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014traditional weight-loss efforts.\n\nPersonalized weight-loss strategies\n\nThe idea of using genetic data to craft individualized weight-loss plans is both exciting and practical. By understanding how specific genes impact metabolism, appetite, and energy use, healthcare providers can offer targeted recommendations that maximize results.\n\nFor example, genetic insights could help determine which types of exercise are most effective for a given individual or identify dietary patterns that align with their body\u2019s unique needs. These personalized strategies could lead to more sustainable weight loss and improved overall health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe discovery of 14 genes that influence weight-loss effectiveness marks a turning point in our understanding of weight management. While traditional methods like diet and exercise remain essential, this research highlights the critical role of genetics in shaping individual outcomes.\n\nAs we move toward a future of personalized healthcare, integrating genetic information into weight-loss programs could revolutionize the way we approach fitness and nutrition. By combining scientific insights with healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve lasting success in their weight-loss journeys.\n\nThis emerging field offers hope to those who have struggled with weight loss, providing a path toward more effective and tailored solutions. The intersection of genetics and weight management is not just a scientific breakthrough\u2014it\u2019s a promise of a healthier, more inclusive future."

            "article_content": "OpenAI says its corporate structure must evolve to advance its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2014 AI that can complete most tasks humans can \u2014 benefits all humanity.\n\nThe company currently has a for-profit org controlled by a nonprofit, with a \u201ccapped profit\u201d share for investors and employees. But in a blog post published Friday, the company says it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest.\n\nThose details had been reported elsewhere. In December, The New York Times revealed that OpenAI was in discussions to pay its nonprofit billions of dollars for it to cede control. However, it\u2019s the first time OpenAI has laid out its proposal in a public memo.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup \u2014 we have to become an enduring company,\u201d OpenAI wrote in its post. \u201cThe world is moving to build out a new infrastructure of energy, land use, chips, data centers, data, AI models, and AI systems for the 21st century economy. We seek to evolve in order to take the next step in our mission.\u201d\n\nOpenAI says establishing the PBC would enable it to \u201cbalance shareholder interests, stakeholder interests, and a public benefit interest\u201d in its decision-making while allowing it to \u201craise the necessary capital with conventional terms.\u201d It would also create one of the best-resourced nonprofits in history, OpenAI claims; OpenAI\u2019s existing nonprofit would receive shares in the PBC \u201cat a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a nonprofit and a for-profit today, and we will continue to have both,\u201d OpenAI wrote. \u201cOur current structure does not allow the board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission and does not enable the nonprofit to easily do more than control the for-profit. The PBC will run and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business, while the nonprofit will hire a leadership team and staff to pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft.\n\nIn October, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation, bringing its total raised to $17.9 billion. The company still expects to lose money this year, however \u2014 $5 billion, according to CNBC \u2014 and the terms of its latest funding round require that it complete a for-profit transition within two years.\n\nThe plan faces hurdles.\n\nOne of OpenAI\u2019s co-founders, billionaire Elon Musk, has filed for an injunction to halt the company\u2019s transition to a for-profit, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission. Musk has also alleged that OpenAI has deprived his own AI company, xAI, of capital by extracting promises from investors not to fund it.\n\nOpenAI has called Musk\u2019s complaints \u201cbaseless\u201d and simply a case of sour grapes.\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI\u2019s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, nonprofit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government,\u201d Meta wrote in the letter.\n\nOpenAI competitors like xAI and Anthropic are structured as PBCs but lack a nonprofit component.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s structure as it exists today is what ultimately led to the abrupt ousting of CEO Sam Altman last November, which greatly displeased investors \u2014 in particular Microsoft. It also gives OpenAI\u2019s board the power to determine exactly when OpenAI has achieved AGI, and exempts this AGI from the licensing agreements the startup has in place with customers.\n\nOne of those customers is Microsoft \u2014 and Microsoft and OpenAI are said to have a specific, internal financial definition of AGI. According to The Information, the two companies signed an agreement last year stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nOpenAI continues to deal with an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Carroll Wainwright, who researched aligning AI systems with safety policies, wrote in a post on X this fall that OpenAI \u201cwas structured as a nonprofit [but] acted like a for-profit\u201d and \u201cshould not [be trusted] when it promises to do the right thing later.\u201d\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said that he has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about OpenAI\u2019s transition plan as outlined.\n\n\u201cFirst, there is surprisingly little discussion of actual governance details, despite this arguably being the key issue,\u201d Brundage wrote. \u201cSecond, a well-capitalized nonprofit on the side is no substitute for PBC product decisions \u2026 being aligned to the original nonprofit\u2019s mission \u2026 Third, while there is a ton of potential for a well-capitalized nonprofit to drive \u2018charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science,\u2019 that is a very narrow scope relative to the original OpenAI mission. What about advancing safety and good policy?\u201d\n\nBrundage said that he worries about OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit becoming a \u201cside thing\u201d that gives license to the PBC to operate as a \u201cnormal company\u201d without addressing potentially problematic areas.\n\n\u201cBesides board details, what other guardrails are being put in place \u2026 to ensure that the nonprofit\u2019s existence doesn\u2019t (seem to) let the PBC off too easy?\u201d he wrote. \u201c[A]s OpenAI knows (in part from work I coauthored there), competition also begets corner-cutting. What are the PBC and nonprofit going to do about this?\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday."

I can choose cash, card, mobile app, QR code, tap to pay, buy now and pay later (BNPL), or even cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a survey by Square, preferences are pretty widespread across the board. While 58% of consumers still use cash, 57% prefer mobile wallets, and 53% use QR code payments. Another 44% use traditional credit and debit cards, 44% use touchless card payments, and 43% use BNPL.\n\nBNPL is particularly notable, as it\u2019s now being adopted in more industry verticals than before. Groceries, for example, may be available for purchase via BNPL. In fact, BNPL grocery purchases increased by 40% between 2023 and 2024, according to Deloitte. This is a direct response to the current economic and political climate, which is causing a decrease in discretionary spending.\n\nThe list of payment options will only continue to grow as the economy moves further away from cash and check and towards innovative payment methods like NFC or biometric payments. This also means considering options like subscriptions, cryptocurrency, saved payments, bill splitting, peer-to-peer (P2P), and gift cards.\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting stat from Deloitte: 70% of consumers say their store choice is highly influenced by whether or not the store offers their preferred payment method. It is therefore important for businesses to keep up.\n\nRelated: Best crypto payment gateways\n\nCash vs cashless\n\nToday\u2019s consumers like convenience and options. I remember when it was just a cash or credit world\u2014now, consumers can choose to pay for their purchases in many ways.\n\nHowever, according to data from Square, about 58% of shoppers still prefer cash. In fact, some trends are even indicating a move back to cash and away from digitization.\n\nSo, there\u2019s really no clear winner in a cash vs. cashless debate. The real answer for businesses is to create ways to allow customers to pay with or without cash.\n\nRelated: What is a cashless society? From speculation to near-reality\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\u2014like Apple Pay and Google Pay\u2014are another payment trend that has been around for a while but continues to impact businesses everywhere, especially as this technology evolves.\n\nPer Deloitte, 57% of consumers prefer to pay with mobile wallet apps. Digital wallets actually made up 37% of transaction value for e-commerce payments and 15% of POS payments in North America in 2023.\n\nContactless pay can also fall under the category of mobile payments. Mobile payments involve the use of NFC technology so a customer can hold up their phone or smartwatch to the reader rather than having to insert a chip or swipe a card. The contactless payment market is also expected to see major growth\u2014at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 113% through 2029, according to Juniper Research.\n\nRelated: Top mobile payment methods\n\nCrypto payments\n\nCryptocurrency payments skyrocketed in popularity when they were first introduced. The trend did lose some steam partly due to regulatory challenges, currency volatility, susceptibility to fraud, and low confidence in the currency\u2019s viability over the long term, perhaps thanks to the FTX scandal and collapse.\n\nWith this doubt, the crypto payments market is only forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2029.\n\nHowever, since Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, crypto and bitcoin have seen a resurgence of popularity in the United States.\n\n2. Biometrics features\n\nBiometric payments are experiencing a surge in growth, with forecasts to grow at a CAGR of 113.6% from 2024 through 2028, per Juniper Research. Some forecasts even say it will be the norm within the next decade. These payments incorporate biometric technology\u2014usually in the form of fingerprint or facial recognition\u2014to improve both data privacy and transaction convenience.\n\nSecurity is a top concern for businesses, both themselves and their customers. This is especially important when it comes to payments\u2014there\u2019s lots of sensitive information going around, so businesses are always looking for ways to tighten things up from a security perspective. Biometric payments are another layer of security that can help accomplish this.\n\nNot only does biometric authentication help boost security, but it also makes login and connection more efficient. I can\u2019t tell you how many passwords I have to remember\u2014if I can use my fingerprint or my face to authenticate something instead, that\u2019s one less password I have to keep track of. And remember, shoppers love efficiency and convenience.\n\n3. AI to facilitate and fight fraud\n\nFraud is always a threat to businesses and consumers. According to Avidchange\u2019s B2B Payment Security report, more than three-quarters of businesses have experienced payment fraud in the past year alone.\n\nSpeaking of security, AI is another payment trend to watch. And this can work in businesses\u2019 favor or, in a worst-case scenario, fraudsters\u2019 favor. Globalpayments reports that as many as 43% of businesses have plans to employ AI technology to help with fraud detection.\n\nWhile AI is an amazing tool to detect fraudulent transactions and add a layer of security, it also makes the work of a hacker much more accessible.\n\nRather than manually decoding payment information, hackers can tap into AI technology to make it easier to accomplish their tasks. In fact, Deloitte actually predicts that AI could enable losses to fraud of up to $40 billion by 2027. So, it\u2019s important to use payment technology that integrates the latest and most advanced security features.\n\n4. Instant payments\n\nWhile consumers love the convenience of being able to pay with anything other than cash, this has also added to delays when it comes to being able to access said cash.\n\nDigital payments often come with a waiting period\u2014for example, if I make a purchase with my credit card at a store, it might take a day or two for the charge to show up. Likewise, when I transfer money from PayPal or Venmo to my account, I usually have to wait a few days to receive the funds in my bank account.\n\nThese delays don\u2019t gel with our instant gratification society. So, payment technology is adapting to instant payments. For example, if I want to receive my PayPal or Venmo funds right away, I can actually pay a fee for an instant transfer.\n\nInstant payments are actually expected to make up 22% of transactions by 2028, per Capegemini\u2019s World Payments Report 2025. It\u2019s also believed that more instant payment availability will also facilitate more digital payment adoption by both businesses and consumers alike. JPMorgan reports about 80% of finance professionals believe faster payments will positively impact business.\n\nBut time will tell on this one\u2014only about 5% of global banks have advanced business technology, so there\u2019s still work to do.\n\n5. B2B is going digital\n\nB2B payments used to be largely check-based. But checks are quickly becoming antiquated in the payments industry. In fact, 80% of B2B transactions used to be paid by check\u2014that figure is now closer to one-third. And only about 5% of businesses are even prepared to make vendor and supplier payments by check.\n\nYou can see the decline in cash and check in B2B payment trends in the chart below. In 2019, they made up half of all B2B payments. Now, they account for less than one-third. Digital ACH transfers are making the most headway, but card and wire payments also experienced a slight increase."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Employment Judge Forwell noted that Elizabeth Benassi was unfairly confronted about her footwear upon arriving at the office.\n\nA 20-year-old woman was awarded \u00a330,000 (approximately Rs 32.2 lakh) in compensation after being dismissed from her role at a recruiting agency for wearing trainers to work. Elizabeth Benassi, who began working at Maximus UK Services in 2022 at the age of 18, claimed she was unfairly targeted for her choice of footwear, despite other colleagues wearing similar shoes without repercussions.\n\nBenassi\u2019s case was heard at an employment tribunal in Croydon, south London, which ruled in her favour. The tribunal found that the company displayed a \u201cdesire to find fault\u201d with the young employee and had failed to inform her about its dress code policy.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBenassi, employed for just three months, argued that she was singled out and treated \u201clike a child\u201d by her manager, who criticised her trainers. She told the tribunal that most of her colleagues were in their twenties, but as the youngest employee, she was subjected to excessive scrutiny and \u201cmicromanagement\u201d because of her age.\n\nEmployment Judge Forwell noted that Benassi was unfairly confronted about her footwear upon arriving at the office. \u201cNo allowance was made for the fact that she was new and may not have been familiar with the dress code,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIt was therefore a clear unfairness and indicates a desire to find fault.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal also rejected the agency\u2019s claim that Benassi had been made aware of the dress code policy. Judge Forwell pointed out that had such information been provided, it would likely have been mentioned in an email exchange at the time.\n\nMaximus UK Services, a company that provides recruitment services for the Department for Work and Pensions, denied any wrongdoing. However, the tribunal found the company guilty of victimisation and awarded Benassi \u00a329,187 in compensation.\n\nWhile the tribunal sided with Benassi on the issue of victimisation, her additional claim of age-related harassment was dismissed.\n\nThe case has sparked discussions about the treatment of young workers in the workplace and the potential for age-based discrimination. The tribunal\u2019s ruling underscores the importance of clear communication around workplace policies, as well as the need for fair treatment of new employees."

            "article_content": "Part 1: From the Roots of the Web to Columbia SC Website Design Excellence\n\nWeb design isn\u2019t just about making a website look pretty\u2014though that\u2019s often the initial impression people get when visiting a business online. It\u2019s about weaving a story, engaging visitors, and guiding them through an experience they\u2019ll remember. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve spent nearly two decades perfecting this craft, transforming how businesses in Columbia, South Carolina, and beyond connect with their audiences. Let me tell you, when you\u2019ve worked through every trend, from neon-tinted text on black backgrounds in the early 2000s to today\u2019s minimalist, responsive designs, you start to see the web as more than just code and graphics; it becomes an ecosystem of endless possibilities.\n\nThe Evolution of Design: From HTML Tables to Responsive Frameworks\n\nLet\u2019s rewind a little to the early 2000s. Websites back then were like those department store mannequins from the \u201890s\u2014awkwardly posed, overly dressed, and not very functional. Everything was laid out using HTML tables, CSS was still in its infancy, and JavaScript? Well, it was more likely to crash your browser than enhance your experience. In Columbia, SC, website design was no exception. Local businesses were just dipping their toes into the digital pond, and a \u201ccontact us\u201d form was considered cutting-edge.\n\nFast forward to today, and everything has changed. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have turned the design process into something akin to Lego-building. You pick your components, snap them together, and voil\u00e0! But here\u2019s where it gets tricky: while these frameworks make development faster, they also come with their downsides. Bootstrap sites, for instance, can sometimes look overly similar, which is something Web Design Columbia actively avoids. Cookie-cutter designs? Not on our watch.\n\nThe Intersection of Creativity and Technology\n\nA fascinating statistic from a 2023 global survey showed that 38% of website visitors will stop engaging with a site if the layout is unattractive or the content is poorly structured. That\u2019s why Columbia SC website design firms like ours emphasize aesthetics and functionality. Every pixel and line of code has a purpose.\n\nOne of our more unique projects was redesigning a legacy site that had been built on Joomla\u2014an oldie but a goodie in the content management world. The site was functional but far from user-friendly, and the client wanted something that could compete with modern platforms like Shopify or WordPress. After hours of brainstorming, we restructured their database, migrated their content, and built a sleek, responsive design that worked seamlessly on every device. Here\u2019s a fun fact: that site saw a 120% increase in user engagement within six months.\n\nResponsive Design: A Double-edged Sword\n\nResponsive design\u2014where your website automatically adjusts to fit any screen size\u2014is one of the most significant innovations in web design. But, like all technologies, it\u2019s not without its challenges. Take Columbia SC website design as an example: while mobile responsiveness is now a given, optimizing for speed on mobile devices remains a headache for developers worldwide. According to a Google report, 53% of mobile users will leave a site if it takes longer than three seconds to load.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve tackled this issue by combining the best server configurations with cutting-edge tools like Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights. We even use Cloudflare to reduce load times and improve security. But even with these tools, challenges persist. Older devices, for instance, often struggle with sites that rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. The balance between functionality and speed remains a dance we\u2019re perfecting.\n\nPlatforms of Choice: The Good, The Bad, and the Pricey\n\nWhen discussing Columbia, SC, website design, platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace must be mentioned. WordPress, which powers over 43% of the web, offers unparalleled flexibility, but its open-source nature can also be a curse. Owning a classic car is like owning a classic car: You can customize it endlessly, but without proper maintenance, it can break down.\n\nWix and Squarespace, on the other hand, cater to those who want a simpler, drag-and-drop solution. They\u2019re fantastic for small businesses just starting out but often lack the scalability needed as they grow. A client in Columbia once came to us frustrated that their Wix site couldn\u2019t handle the traffic spikes during their annual sale. We rebuilt their site on a more robust platform, ensuring it could grow alongside their business.\n\n\n\nThe Role of SEO in Modern Web Design\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) isn\u2019t just a buzzword; it\u2019s the lifeline of any website. Columbia SC website design services like ours incorporate SEO strategies right from the planning stage. But here\u2019s a reality check: even the best design can\u2019t mask poorly executed SEO. Google\u2019s algorithms are sophisticated, and they prioritize user experience above all else.\n\nOne of the common complaints we\u2019ve heard globally is about platforms like Shopify and Wix, where SEO capabilities are somewhat limited. While these platforms offer basic SEO features, they often fall short when compared to fully customizable options available on WordPress. That\u2019s why we emphasize starting with a clear SEO strategy, using tools like Semrush and Ahrefs to track performance, and continuously refining it.\n\nPart 2: The Heart of Columbia SC Website Design and What Lies Ahead\n\nColumbia\u2019s Unique Web Design Landscape\n\nColumbia, South Carolina, isn\u2019t just known for its southern charm and vibrant business community; it\u2019s also becoming a hotspot for innovative digital solutions. Web Design Columbia has been at the forefront, leveraging nearly two decades of experience to create designs that resonate with both local and global audiences. While the city might not have the tech reputation of Silicon Valley, it offers something unique\u2014a personal touch that prioritizes relationships over transactions.\n\nThis focus on collaboration sets Columbia, SC, website design apart. One memorable project involved a local nonprofit organization that needed to overhaul its aging Zen-Cart platform completely. We migrated their site to Shopify, ensuring a smooth transition without downtime. Here\u2019s the kicker: the new site\u2019s streamlined design and improved navigation led to a 200% increase in donor contributions within just three months. Success stories like these highlight the power of combining technical expertise with understanding community needs.\n\nWhen Design Meets Development\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about Columbia, SC, website design without diving into the synergy between design and development. Think of it like a duet: the designer sets the tone, and the developer brings the melody to life. But achieving harmony isn\u2019t always easy. Many businesses globally complain about miscommunication between these two roles, which can result in sites that look great but function poorly\u2014or vice versa.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve found that fostering collaboration between designers and developers is key. We use tools like Figma for wireframing and prototyping, ensuring that everyone\u2014clients included\u2014has a clear vision of the final product. Interestingly, a 2022 survey revealed that 60% of website redesigns fail to meet client expectations due to a lack of proper planning. That\u2019s why we emphasize transparency and iteration, involving clients at every process stage.\n\nThe Downsides of Modern Web Trends\n\nWhile modern web design trends like minimalism and parallax scrolling can be visually stunning, they also have pitfalls. Minimalist designs, for example, often sacrifice functionality for aesthetics. A user might love a site\u2019s clean, open look but get frustrated when basic navigation isn\u2019t intuitive.\n\nAnother trend that divides opinion is parallax scrolling, in which background images move slower than foreground content to create a 3D effect. While this can add depth and dynamism, it can also lead to slower load times and compatibility issues on older devices. Columbia, SC, website design projects must carefully weigh these pros and cons.\n\nOne of our more challenging projects involved incorporating parallax elements into a local restaurant\u2019s website. The result was visually spectacular, but we quickly realized that some older browsers struggled to handle the animations. By optimizing the code and offering a simplified version for less capable devices, we struck a balance that satisfied all users.\n\nGlobal Inspirations, Local Applications\n\nWeb design is a global language, but its application varies by region. In Columbia, South Carolina, businesses value authenticity and practicality\u2014traits that don\u2019t always align with the flashy, experimental designs you might see in tech hubs like New York or San Francisco. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Columbia, SC, website design lacks innovation.\n\nWe often draw inspiration from global trends and adapt them to fit local sensibilities. Take the rise of dark mode, for instance. Platforms like Twitter and Slack initially popularized this feature and has been praised for reducing eye strain and saving device battery life. While dark mode is trendy, we\u2019ve found that it doesn\u2019t always suit every brand\u2019s identity. A local healthcare provider, for example, might benefit more from lighter, more calming color schemes.\n\nThe Future of Columbia SC Website Design\n\nLooking ahead, the future of web design in Columbia\u2014and globally\u2014is shaping up to be exciting and complex. Technologies like AI and machine learning are beginning to influence how websites are built and maintained. Tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney are already assisting with content creation and design ideation, but they\u2019re not without their limitations. AI lacks the nuance of human creativity, so it\u2019s better used as an assistant rather than a replacement.\n\nIn Columbia, businesses are starting to embrace these technologies, but cautiously. Web Design Columbia has experimented with AI-driven analytics tools to predict user behavior and optimize design choices. While these tools provide valuable insights, they\u2019re only as good as the data they\u2019re fed. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nWhy Experience Matters\n\nIn an industry where trends change faster than you can say \u201cresponsive design,\u201d experience is a critical asset. Columbia, SC, website design firms like ours have weathered countless changes, from the rise of mobile-first strategies to the current emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nOne interesting fact: according to a 2023 report, websites built by experienced teams are 50% more likely to meet their performance goals than those built by less seasoned developers. That\u2019s because experience isn\u2019t just about knowing what works; it\u2019s about knowing what doesn\u2019t. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve learned to anticipate challenges and adapt quickly, ensuring every project succeeds.\n\nYour Digital Journey Starts Here\n\nWeb design is more than just a service; it\u2019s a partnership. Whether you\u2019re looking to revamp an outdated site or build something entirely new, the team at Web Design Columbia is here to guide you every step of the way. With nearly two decades of experience, a commitment to quality, and a deep understanding of Columbia, SC, website design, we\u2019re ready to help your business thrive in the digital age.\n\nContact us today, and let\u2019s create something extraordinary together. The web is your canvas\u2014let us help you paint your masterpiece."

            "article_content": "Understanding genetic influences on weight\n\nRecent advancements in genetics have shed new light on the complex relationship between our genes and weight management. Research conducted by the University of Essex has uncovered 14 specific genes that significantly influence how individuals respond to weight-loss strategies. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that weight loss is solely a matter of diet and exercise, offering a deeper understanding of why people experience such varied results despite similar efforts.\n\nThese findings not only highlight the biological factors at play but also open new avenues for personalized approaches to weight management. As scientists delve deeper into this genetic landscape, the potential for tailored solutions that cater to an individual\u2019s unique genetic profile becomes increasingly promising.\n\nBreakthrough research findings\n\nA landmark study conducted on 38 adults aged 20 to 40 analyzed over 1,000 genetic variants to determine their impact on weight loss. The researchers observed dramatic differences in outcomes, even among participants following the same diet and exercise routines. This study highlights the importance of genetics in shaping metabolism, fat storage, and the body\u2019s ability to burn calories efficiently.\n\nKey findings from the study revealed that individuals with certain genetic markers experienced improved fat metabolism and greater efficiency during exercise. This suggests that genetics may hold the key to unlocking more effective weight-loss strategies, particularly for those who struggle with conventional methods.\n\nKey genetic markers and their impact\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries is the role of the PARGC1A gene, which affects mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Approximately 20-40% of the global population carries this gene variant, which has been linked to improved fat-burning capabilities during physical activity.\n\nThe PGC-1\u03b1 protein, regulated by this gene, plays a critical role in determining how efficiently the body uses energy. Individuals with this genetic advantage may find it easier to lose weight through exercise, as their bodies are better equipped to metabolize fat.\n\nAlso, researchers identified other genes that influence factors like appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity, and the body\u2019s response to caloric restriction. These genetic markers create a unique profile for each individual, shaping their weight-loss potential and response to various interventions.\n\nExercise interaction with genetics\n\nWhile genetics provide a framework for weight management, they require activation through physical activity to be effective. The study emphasized that even individuals with favorable genetic traits saw minimal results without regular exercise. This underscores the importance of combining genetic predispositions with an active lifestyle.\n\nParticipants who exercised consistently experienced significantly greater weight loss compared to those with similar genetic profiles who led sedentary lives. The findings suggest that physical activity acts as a catalyst, enabling individuals to fully leverage their genetic potential.\n\nFor those without advantageous genetic markers, the study provides hope that dedication to exercise and healthy eating can still lead to meaningful results. Genetics may provide an edge, but they are not the sole determinant of success.\n\nFuture implications for weight management\n\nThe insights gained from this research pave the way for a future where weight-loss strategies are tailored to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. Personalized weight management programs could include genetic testing as a standard component, helping individuals identify the most effective approaches based on their unique profiles.\n\nFor instance, someone with a genetic predisposition for slow fat metabolism might benefit from a higher-protein diet and strength-based exercise routines. Conversely, those with genes favoring fat-burning could focus on cardiovascular workouts for optimal results.\n\nHowever, the study also cautions against relying solely on genetic information. Healthy lifestyle habits remain crucial, and genetics should be seen as a tool to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014traditional weight-loss efforts.\n\nPersonalized weight-loss strategies\n\nThe idea of using genetic data to craft individualized weight-loss plans is both exciting and practical. By understanding how specific genes impact metabolism, appetite, and energy use, healthcare providers can offer targeted recommendations that maximize results.\n\nFor example, genetic insights could help determine which types of exercise are most effective for a given individual or identify dietary patterns that align with their body\u2019s unique needs. These personalized strategies could lead to more sustainable weight loss and improved overall health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe discovery of 14 genes that influence weight-loss effectiveness marks a turning point in our understanding of weight management. While traditional methods like diet and exercise remain essential, this research highlights the critical role of genetics in shaping individual outcomes.\n\nAs we move toward a future of personalized healthcare, integrating genetic information into weight-loss programs could revolutionize the way we approach fitness and nutrition. By combining scientific insights with healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve lasting success in their weight-loss journeys.\n\nThis emerging field offers hope to those who have struggled with weight loss, providing a path toward more effective and tailored solutions. The intersection of genetics and weight management is not just a scientific breakthrough\u2014it\u2019s a promise of a healthier, more inclusive future."

I\u2019ve been seeing this girl \u201cAngie\u201d for eight months now. She is everything to me. I fell in love with her right away, and she said she loved me first within the first month.\n\nBut now, I get yelled at for basically everything I say. Like today, I called her for the first time at 2:30 p.m. and she answered the phone saying, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask what she\u2019s up to and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business\u201d and then goes, \u201cI\u2019m done talking now.\u201d This is a typical conversation for us.\n\nAnnie, I never cheated on this girl. I have always treated her well. Is it cheating if I just quit talking to her and start looking for someone else? The crappy part is that I don\u2019t want anyone else. But I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can put up with this. -- Should I Stay or Should I Go\n\nDear Should I Stay: Before you start looking for someone else, you need to tell Angie the relationship is over. Just because she isn\u2019t treating you well doesn\u2019t mean you should stoop to her level.\n\nAs for not wanting anyone else, you\u2019ll never know until you start looking. You\u2019d be amazed at what a clean break and a little bit of time can do.\n\nDear Annie: I will be inheriting a modest sum of money and want to gift some of it to my two married children. I also want to gift some money to my daughter\u2019s two young children to be used for future educational needs. My son and his wife don\u2019t have children and will likely not have any in the future. They lost beautiful twins born prematurely many years ago.\n\nI want to be fair and compassionate with the distribution of money. If I gift the same amount to my two children and a smaller amount to our two grandchildren, do you think my son will feel the distribution is unfair? I realize the inheritance is mine to do with as I please, but I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. We are all kind and level-headed people. -- Grandma in a Quandary\n\nDear Grandma: Your thoughtfulness and consideration for everyone\u2019s emotions show what a caring grandma you are.\n\nGifting the same amount to each child, plus additional funds earmarked for your grandkids' education, is a perfectly fair approach. But because your son and daughter-in-law experienced such a profound loss, it\u2019s wise to consider how this might affect them emotionally. If you want, you could contribute something unique to them as well -- a trip, for example -- to show extra consideration.\n\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\n\n"

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Phil Ashley/Getty Images\n\nThe TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans.\n\nThis crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nAly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes\u2026 but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one.\n\nAlso: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is\n\nThousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem.\n\nThis ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. \ud83d\ude2e\n\nI'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.)\n\nLow key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. \ud83c\udf7f\n\nThat said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's.\n\nQuick Intro\n\nIf you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer.\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nI've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. \ud83d\ude80\n\nNeedless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses.\n\nBTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts.\n\nAll that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. \ud83d\ude05\n\nLet's recap how we got here\n\nThe TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024.\n\nByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. \ud83d\ude24\n\nHere is the recap:\n\nDeadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension).\n\nConsequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned.\n\nReason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government.\n\nTikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. \ud83d\ude43\n\nOn December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nIn response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban.\n\nAs of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain.\n\nIn addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. \ud83d\ude31\n\nTikTok ban could leave a void Meta won't fill\n\nTikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. \ud83d\ude33\n\nMeta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money.\n\nFor advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead\n\nTo understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible.\n\nThere are two main stages of awareness:\n\nIntent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you\u2026 you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward.\n\nDiscovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery.\n\nDiscovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly.\n\nStay with me; you need to understand this to see the void\u2026 \u23f3\n\nTikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\nSince TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers.\n\nWhat's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers.\n\nWithout TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThe biggest winners\u2026\n\nThe obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nGoogle is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine.\n\nYeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine.\n\nAmazon also stands to benefit.\n\nTikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful.\n\nAlso: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead\n\nOverall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people.\n\nI know what you are thinking: \"You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more.\" And I feel strongly about that.\n\nHowever, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. \ud83d\udd12\n\nLooking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day.\n\nThe biggest loser no one is talking about...\n\nByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. \ud83d\udcc9\n\nBut guess who's probably low-key pissed about this?\n\nShopify!\n\nAlso: This pocket camera has fully replaced my iPhone for video shooting\n\nShopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. \ud83e\udd1d\n\nTikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales.\n\nTikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions.\n\nAll I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhat next?\n\nIf you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you.\n\nThe obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem.\n\nThe real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it.\n\nHere's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience.\n\nI've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs.\n\nThe pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. \ud83d\udce2\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThink about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform.\n\nIf you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn.\n\nMy two cents\n\nAs someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. \ud83e\udd74\n\nAs a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry.\n\nAs a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out.\n\nAs a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price.\n\nAs a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld.\n\nAs an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it.\n\nThat said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote\u2026\n\n\"It's not happening to you. It's happening for you.\" \ud83e\udd17\n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times.\n\n\ud83d\ude07 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you.\n\nP.S. \ud83d\udce9 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

            "article_content": "Light jets have become significantly popular among owners and corporations in recent years. It is much more economical to purchase, operate, and maintain a light jet to transport only a few individuals. Increasingly more owners prefer having a light jet than operating a large jet for short flights.\n\nModern light jets like the Cessna Citation Mustang and Honda Jet HA-420 can comfortably accommodate four people and fly reasonable distances. The top manufacturers of light jets have seen tremendous growth in demand and deliveries in recent years. This article analyzes the delivery data of jets in the \"very light\" and \"light\" categories across multiple manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery light jet sales\n\nBusiness jets are classified as very light with a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) up to approximately 10,000 lbs. These jets have a standard capacity of 4-6 passengers. We compare four jets in this category: the Cessna Citation M2, the Honda Jet HA-420, the Cirrus Vision Jet SF-50, and the Embraer Phenom 100/100E.\n\nBased on the trends from the last five years, shown from numbers published by GAMA, it is evident that Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet is significantly more popular than others in the category. Between 2019 and 2023, Cirrus Aircraft delivered a whopping 426 Vision Jets, a remarkable number for any general aviation aircraft. In the last year alone, the company tallied 96 deliveries of the type.\n\nWith a capacity of up to six passengers, the SF-50 can fly a maximum range of 1,275 nm, approaching cruise speeds of 311 knots. The V-tailed aircraft is equipped with a luxury small cabin and features several safety features, including the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) and the Emergency Autoland system.\n\nCessna delivered 150 of its very light M2 jets in the last five years, with 25 deliveries last year. Powered by two Williams turbofan engines, the M2 has a maximum range of 1,550 nm. Honda Aircraft Company is a close third with 143 deliveries of the HA-420 during the five years, including 22 units delivered last year. With its highly efficient design and unique engine placement, the HondaJet can cruise at 422 knots and fly a range of 1,220 nm.\n\nEmbraer delivered the least among all manufacturers, with just 41 Phenom 100/100E delivered in the five years. The Phenom 100 can seat four passengers in a standard configuration and fly a range of 1,350 NM at 400 knots cruise speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight jet sales\n\nBusiness jets are classified as light, with a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) between 10,000 and 25,000 lbs. These jets have a standard capacity of 6-10 passengers. Four jets are compared in this category: Cessna Citation CJ4, Cessna Citation Latitude, Pilatus PC-24, and the Embraer Phenom 300.\n\nIn this category, Embraer stood out with 279 deliveries between 2019 and 2023, with 63 deliveries last year. The Phenom 300 can seat up to eight passengers in a standard configuration and fly a distance of 2,010 nm, cruising over 450 knots.\n\nSwitzerland-based Pilatus Aircraft delivered 213 examples of its PC-24 aircraft in the last five years, including 47 deliveries last year. With a standard capacity of eight passengers, the PC-24 can fly a maximum range of 2,100 NM and approach cruise speeds of 440 knots. The aircraft can operate from rugged and unconventional airfields, allowing greater flexibility for passengers.\n\nCessna delivered 201 Citation Latitudes between 2019 and 2023, with 41 deliveries last year. Powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300 turbofan engines, the Citation Latitude has a maximum range of 2,700 nm. Another aircraft from the Citation family, the CJ4, saw fewer aircraft produced, with 143 deliveries during the period, including 31 deliveries last year. The CJ4 can seat up to 10 passengers and fly a range of 2,165 nm at 450 knots cruise speed.\n\nIrrespective of the manufacturer and the model of the aircraft, light jets account for over 50% of all private jet sales in 2023."

That was a 20% drop from 497 UFO sightings in 2022 and also lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484).\n\nIt found that people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39).\n\nREAD MORE: Gorgeous Somerset cafe which perfects cake for the kids and coffee for the parents\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: The Saturday night when 85 cows thundered through a Somerset town\n\nYou can see what UFO encounters have been reported where you live using our interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\nSightings documented in the UK included:\n\n\n\nA \u201clong cigar-shaped craft with three or four roundish patterns on it\u201d was observed for 20 minutes before it \u201cvanished like a light being switched off\u201d above Chester in Cheshire in October last year.\n\nA \u201crocket-type object\u201d was spotted flying above the clouds over Hartlepool \u201cextremely fast and soundless with flames over the front\u201d in November 2022.\n\nA 30ft to 40ft wide \u201cround saucer-like object with detailed outer rim\u201d was seen \u201chovering over a house\u201d in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in January.\n\nSome Somerset sightings include two round discs, a dull red colour, following the flight path of an aircraft with no sound unlike the aircraft over Shepton Mallet, a moving light disappeared at Orion. Followed by multiple other lights all in the same place moving West to East over Glastonbury, and a tic-tac like shape moving very slowly in the sky above Spaxton.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings (48%) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25%) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17%), \u201csphere\u201d, (10%) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (9%).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings.\n\nThat was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34). When it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold - former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team - told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d. However, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US submarines and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government - or any other government - are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d He insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by Chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies. While the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be."

            "article_content": "Understanding genetic influences on weight\n\nRecent advancements in genetics have shed new light on the complex relationship between our genes and weight management. Research conducted by the University of Essex has uncovered 14 specific genes that significantly influence how individuals respond to weight-loss strategies. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that weight loss is solely a matter of diet and exercise, offering a deeper understanding of why people experience such varied results despite similar efforts.\n\nThese findings not only highlight the biological factors at play but also open new avenues for personalized approaches to weight management. As scientists delve deeper into this genetic landscape, the potential for tailored solutions that cater to an individual\u2019s unique genetic profile becomes increasingly promising.\n\nBreakthrough research findings\n\nA landmark study conducted on 38 adults aged 20 to 40 analyzed over 1,000 genetic variants to determine their impact on weight loss. The researchers observed dramatic differences in outcomes, even among participants following the same diet and exercise routines. This study highlights the importance of genetics in shaping metabolism, fat storage, and the body\u2019s ability to burn calories efficiently.\n\nKey findings from the study revealed that individuals with certain genetic markers experienced improved fat metabolism and greater efficiency during exercise. This suggests that genetics may hold the key to unlocking more effective weight-loss strategies, particularly for those who struggle with conventional methods.\n\nKey genetic markers and their impact\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries is the role of the PARGC1A gene, which affects mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Approximately 20-40% of the global population carries this gene variant, which has been linked to improved fat-burning capabilities during physical activity.\n\nThe PGC-1\u03b1 protein, regulated by this gene, plays a critical role in determining how efficiently the body uses energy. Individuals with this genetic advantage may find it easier to lose weight through exercise, as their bodies are better equipped to metabolize fat.\n\nAlso, researchers identified other genes that influence factors like appetite regulation, insulin sensitivity, and the body\u2019s response to caloric restriction. These genetic markers create a unique profile for each individual, shaping their weight-loss potential and response to various interventions.\n\nExercise interaction with genetics\n\nWhile genetics provide a framework for weight management, they require activation through physical activity to be effective. The study emphasized that even individuals with favorable genetic traits saw minimal results without regular exercise. This underscores the importance of combining genetic predispositions with an active lifestyle.\n\nParticipants who exercised consistently experienced significantly greater weight loss compared to those with similar genetic profiles who led sedentary lives. The findings suggest that physical activity acts as a catalyst, enabling individuals to fully leverage their genetic potential.\n\nFor those without advantageous genetic markers, the study provides hope that dedication to exercise and healthy eating can still lead to meaningful results. Genetics may provide an edge, but they are not the sole determinant of success.\n\nFuture implications for weight management\n\nThe insights gained from this research pave the way for a future where weight-loss strategies are tailored to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup. Personalized weight management programs could include genetic testing as a standard component, helping individuals identify the most effective approaches based on their unique profiles.\n\nFor instance, someone with a genetic predisposition for slow fat metabolism might benefit from a higher-protein diet and strength-based exercise routines. Conversely, those with genes favoring fat-burning could focus on cardiovascular workouts for optimal results.\n\nHowever, the study also cautions against relying solely on genetic information. Healthy lifestyle habits remain crucial, and genetics should be seen as a tool to enhance\u2014not replace\u2014traditional weight-loss efforts.\n\nPersonalized weight-loss strategies\n\nThe idea of using genetic data to craft individualized weight-loss plans is both exciting and practical. By understanding how specific genes impact metabolism, appetite, and energy use, healthcare providers can offer targeted recommendations that maximize results.\n\nFor example, genetic insights could help determine which types of exercise are most effective for a given individual or identify dietary patterns that align with their body\u2019s unique needs. These personalized strategies could lead to more sustainable weight loss and improved overall health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe discovery of 14 genes that influence weight-loss effectiveness marks a turning point in our understanding of weight management. While traditional methods like diet and exercise remain essential, this research highlights the critical role of genetics in shaping individual outcomes.\n\nAs we move toward a future of personalized healthcare, integrating genetic information into weight-loss programs could revolutionize the way we approach fitness and nutrition. By combining scientific insights with healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve lasting success in their weight-loss journeys.\n\nThis emerging field offers hope to those who have struggled with weight loss, providing a path toward more effective and tailored solutions. The intersection of genetics and weight management is not just a scientific breakthrough\u2014it\u2019s a promise of a healthier, more inclusive future."
