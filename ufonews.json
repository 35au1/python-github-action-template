            "article_content": "Dec. 7\u2014The arcane red light reportedly throbbed in the sky above Albuquerque's South Valley for about an hour in October 2023, caught on camera by a bewildered man who says, \"I've never seen a light that bright.\"\n\nA solid, bright orb drifted with angular elegance in February over Jal, near the state's southern border, startling an observer. As the nighttime scene unfolded near a Lea County oilfield, the observer reported feeling like the air was astir with a leaden static.\n\nVideos of these episodes of stargazing turning bizarre in a state known for enigmatic nighttime occurrences are among those catalogued by a popular UFO reporting platform and cellphone app operated by Enigma Labs. The company, founded in 2020, has issued a new report naming New Mexico its top state for sightings per capita, with several strange videos submitted this year showing lights over Albuquerque.\n\n\"New Mexico is a focal point for UFOs,\" said Alejandro Rojas, a consultant for Enigma Labs. \"But it's really interesting that New Mexico has really popped up in our data lately as being heads above the leader when it comes to submissions per person.\"\n\nThe data set comes as an obsession with unidentified flying objects continues nationwide, even after a congressionally mandated Pentagon report released in February found no evidence the federal government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and no evidence UFO sightings are signs of aliens visiting Earth.\n\nA Pentagon office, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, was created in 2022 to track what the government calls UAPs \u2014 unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 with 757 reported to the office between May and June of this year, according to a November report.\n\nStill, people continue to see things.\n\nIn the fast-paced digital age, Enigma Labs provides an online trove of oddities \u2014 an endless proliferation of sights and sounds.\n\nThe private company offers a website and cellphone app allowing UFO enthusiasts \u2014 and regular people who believe they have encountered the anomalous \u2014 to upload videos and photos with descriptions, aggregating and crowdsourcing the data.\n\n\"Like millions of ants crawling around us,\" the individual who spotted something in Jal said in the Enigma post.\n\n\"I hate to say it. Those are ships!\" gushed a man who claimed he was witnessing alien plasma ships in Gallup near the Arizona border.\n\nAll told, the Land of Enchantment's rate of 12.2 Enigma entries per 100,000 people is far higher than the next closest states of Nevada and Arizona, which boast submission rates of around 9 per 100,000 residents, according to the company.\n\nUFO researchers have theories about the large volume of entries here, citing how alien mythology and lore have been woven into the state's cultural fabric for decades. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, 1,708 sightings have been reported in New Mexico, most of them since 2000.\n\n\"We have a relatively small population, but the one thing we do have, and I think this factors into your question, is a preponderance of military operations areas and scientific development areas \u2014 Los Alamos [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] \u2014 a rich history of sightings,\" said David Marler, a longtime UFO researcher who lives in the Albuquerque area and serves as the executive director of a new UFO records center in Rio Rancho.\n\nWhile the Roswell incident has long been a dominant talker, Marler said there are many other intriguing reports of encounters over the last 75 years in New Mexico: April 1964, Socorro; April 1964, La Madera; March 1950, Farmington; November 1957, Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nA prevalent state for sightings\n\nEnigma Labs runs a New Mexico page that archives and cataloging sightings, rating and categorizing videos.\n\nAs of late November, the company had received 278 New Mexico sightings directly, according to an email from Rojas. Combined with publicly available sources, it has 3,531 total sightings in New Mexico archived.\n\n\"When you go back and look at early magazine reports and military reports going back to the 1950s, there were magazine articles showing maps where a lot of UFO sightings. One of the most prevalent states was New Mexico,\" Marler said.\n\nA fascination with the unknown has long gripped New Mexico. It's a state renowned \u2014 thanks to its dry climate, low population density and sprawling deserts \u2014 for its night sky viewing.\n\n\"One of the most spectacular reports is from last August. A witness said they were watching TV when they caught this weird object out of the corner of their eye. They were able to get a few seconds of video before it disappeared behind nearby trees,\" Rojas said of video footage taken in Chaparral, a Southern New Mexico community near El Paso.\n\nThe video shows a floating gray object with a television heard in the background.\n\nNew Mexico sightings logged into the Enigma Labs database break down like this: Albuquerque, 754; Las Cruces, 159; Roswell, 143; Alamogordo, 107; and Deming, 95. Rojas said eight sightings have been reported to Enigma from Santa Fe and one in Los Alamos.\n\nTwo friends were driving along San Mateo Boulevard in Albuquerque late one night in February when a moving craft in the sky lit up with lights flashing in a diagonal pattern.\n\nIn an episode that lasted about a minute, \"it went from a long craft to a triangle shaped craft with only 3 lights, and then to something that resembled a helicopter with one light, and quickly disappeared,\" states the caption on the for the video posted to Enigma Lab's site.\n\nNew records center in Rio Rancho\n\nTens of thousands of case files, among the earliest dated in 1947, are housed in Rio Rancho. They relay the stories of witnesses, couched in the diction of reports written by law enforcement officers or members of the military as far back as 70 years ago.\n\nThe files can be pored over at the new National UFO Historical Records Center, a facility that recently opened and can be visited by appointment.\n\n\"It's the largest historical archive ever assembled on the history of the subject in the history of the United States,\" said Marler, the director.\n\nThe volunteer-operated research center, at 1301 Nicklaus Drive SE, opened in October.\n\nIt holds rolls of decades-old microfilm, hundreds of thousands of audio recordings, an exhaustive library of foreign and domestic magazines, newsletters and periodicals \u2014 all dealing with reports of mysterious craft spotted from Earth. Some 2,000 books line the shelves, along with an interminable supply of UFO investigations and intrigue, with tales and testimony for those who believe.\n\n\"It's really set up for academics and for the general public who have a serious interest in the subject. It's not for the casual enthusiast per se,\" Marler said.\n\nThe center has files from the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, records kept by the largest citizen organization in the U.S. devoted to cataloguing UFO reports from 1956 until 1980, the year the group published its final newsletter. The center is currently digitizing the files for the first time ever.\n\nAlso in its possession are collections from the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, once based in Alamogordo, with tens of thousands of case files \u2014 as well as collections from the UFO Research Committee of Akron, especially active in the 1950s in Ohio.\n\n\"We're literally getting these holdings in from all different points of the globe,\" Marler said.\n\nWell-documented cases beyond Roswell\n\nAcademics of unexplained phenomena have descended on the Land of Enchantment for a beloved UFO festival in Roswell. But the mythic narratives don't go dry there.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. That always dominates the conversation and there are better, more well-documented cases on file,\" Marler said, referring to the 1947 crash of a craft near the Southern New Mexico city. While many believe it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft, the federal government has said it was a secret military balloon aimed at detecting Soviet atomic bomb tests.\n\nMarler said many New Mexicans aren't aware of other cases within their own state.\n\nIn November of 1957, a UFO was tracked on radar and \"violated\" the perimeter of the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, hovering around restricted sites, according to reports Marler has reviewed. He said the Rio Rancho records center has the original case file on it from \"Project Blue Book,\" the Air Force name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969.\n\n\"Two Air Force personnel were observing it with binoculars at night. They described it as looking like a car standing vertically on end with a white light emanating out of the bottom. The object had the ability to hover, to rapidly accelerate, to move slowly,\" Marler said.\n\nThe Socorro incident in April 1964 \u2014 unresolved in the Air Force investigations that transpired at the time and widely reported by New Mexico news publications \u2014 was observed by local police Officer Lonnie Zamora, who claimed he witnessed two humanoids beside a shiny, egg-shaped object that later rose into the air from an arroyo as flames belched from the rising craft.\n\nMarler said he had believed the Socorro case was an isolated one. In the last year, however, he received the APRO files and came across an account published in the Santa Fe New Mexican of a similar report four days after the Socorro incident from La Madera, a remote community north of Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County.\n\n\"Eyewitness Recounts Passage of 'Thing' Burning in Sky,\" reads a headline in the April 28, 1964, edition of The New Mexican.\n\n\"It talks about Socorro, but it talks about a landing in La Madera ... and it described an egg-shaped object,\" Marler said. \"... New Mexico State Police [investigated and] drew a detailed diagram of the landing site and took pictures and colored photographs.\""

            "article_content": "Mysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - after weeks of being photographed in New Jersey.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the FAA and FBI requesting an investigation, Fossella called the situation 'bizarre', according to PIX11.\n\n'It is odd and quite bizarre that nobody can figure out who is flying these drones, where they are coming from, and their purpose.\n\n'It is not just a bizarre situation, but also a concerning one, as it seems these drones can potentially become a danger to personal safety.'\n\nHe also stated that he was worried about the drones' ability to impede life-saving care in medical emergencies - especially over the two hospital systems on Staten Island.\n\n'It was recently reported that, during a medical emergency resulting from a crash in Branchburg, New Jersey, the presence of these drones prevented a medevac helicopter from being able to transport a seriously injured patient to the hospital.\n\n'We hope that such an investigation may shed light on what these drones are doing, where they are coming from and how to mitigate the risks they may pose on public safety.'\n\nMysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - days after being photographed in New Jersey\n\nYesterday, new footage of at least five or possibly six of the unidentified drones was captured in a 50-second cell phone video in New Jersey, which one commenter declared was 'the clearest video yet.'\n\nOne drone, heard roaring in the skies as it moved through the darkness, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly and red lights blinking at the tips of its wings and tail.\n\nAnother drone came into frame that resembled a classic 'black triangle' UFO or the triangular TR-3B, which beamed bright white lights from its nose, wingtips and tail.\n\nSince mid-November, a wave of unexplained drone sightings above central Jersey has left both law enforcement and the general public watching the skies, hunting for clues on what these mysterious night flights might be.\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy has attempted to calm residents claiming these true UFOs pose 'no known threat to the public at this time,' but FBI and local police are actively investigating.\n\nConcerns have heightened over the proximity of these drone-like UFOs to President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course, US military research facility Picatinny Arsenal and critical local infrastructure.\n\n'Water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments, and military installations' have all had the UFOs roaming above them in recent weeks, according to the chief of police for the New Jersey borough of Florham Park.\n\n'Their presence appears nefarious in nature,' the police chief added.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' NJ native and TikTok creator @_bucky13 commented under his phone footage of the eerie drones (still image above), captioned 'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.' At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

            "article_content": "Modern smartphones do a lot more than point-and-shoot. The hardware can offer a lot, but the actual photos you get will be dependent on whatever kind of processing is involved behind the scenes. Computational photography is the official term, and thanks to the increase in AI availability the last few years have seen it become more important than ever.\n\nThen a few weeks ago I came across Zerocam, the self-proclaimed \u201cfirst anti-AI camera\u201d, promising absolutely zero post-processing aside from some \u201csubtle color grading\u201d. Simply point, shoot and you\u2019re done. This got me wondering how Zerocam would compare to the stock camera apps on modern phones, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nZerocam is available on Android and iOS devices, so I\u2019ve employed the Google Pixel 9 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max to compare the results. My testing involved taking 2 photos on each phone at a time \u2014 one regular, and one on Zerocam.\n\nHow does Zerocam work?\n\n(Image credit: Zerocam)\n\nThe most immediate thing I noticed about Zerocam was that it is about as minimalist as you can probably get with a camera app. It seems as though zero processing also means zero anything else. All you have on screen is a shutter icon that cycles through different action words, a zoom indicator and a note telling you how many photos you can take that day.\n\nYes, there is a limit, because Zerocam is a subscription-based app. You get to shoot 5 free photos everyday, and if you want more you\u2019ll have to pay. How much depends on whether you\u2019re on Android or iPhone, with the latter charging more. Android users appear to have to pay $1 month or $11 a year, while iPhone users need to pay $2 a month or $13 a year.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why an app that is technically supposed to do nothing thinks this is the best way to monetize. The free daily limit is also giving me some weird flashbacks of the days before I owned a digital camera. When film was king and you had hard limits on how many photos you could feasibly take. Yes, I did mess up a few times, and while it was my own fault for not paying attention it was still pretty frustrating.\n\nThe other weird thing I noticed was that the zooming capabilities were different between Pixel and iPhone. Both phones have the same level of magnification, including 5x telephoto and 0.5x ultrawide, and yet that wasn\u2019t reflected in the app. The Pixel 9 Pro offered 1x and 2x magnification, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max could push it to 3x and then all the way back to 0.5x. Why? I don\u2019t know, and it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.\n\nSign up now to get the best Black Friday deals!

Line up your shot, activate the shutter, either on-screen or with the volume buttons, and you\u2019re good to go. Photos are then saved to your photo gallery for easy access. The photos are saved as JPEGs on the Pixel and HEIC on iPhone \u2014 just like any regular photo you take.\n\nFrom an ease-of-use standpoint, Zerocam does it all right. But I still can\u2019t help but wonder why isn\u2019t more functionality or settings control \u2014 especially since this is a premium app. Does that count as processing? I wouldn\u2019t agree that they do, not all of them anyway, and it just feels a bit like a missed opportunity.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want AI in their images? That\u2019s a valid choice, but at least give them the tools to tinker with the photo settings ahead of time. Especially if they're being asked to pay for it.\n\nHow do the photos compare to the official camera app?\n\nWhile the Zerocam interface could do with being a little less basic, it all comes down to the quality of the photos. To do this I took a number of everyday photos in Zerocam on both iPhone 15 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro. These were then followed by the same shot in the standard camera app \u2014 or as close as I can get. Pets aren\u2019t always cooperative models, and love to move around between shots.\n\nImage 1 of 2 iPhone 15 Pro Max. (Image credit: Future)\n\nZerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nIn this photo of the tree you can see that the iPhone produced photos that are brighter with more vibrant coloring than what Zerocam produced. The Pixel ended up producing pretty similar results, though the images weren\u2019t identical for obvious reasons.\n\nImage 1 of 2 Pixel 9 Pro. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam (Image credit: Future)\n\nQuality on the iPhone shots is pretty comparable, though the darkness on the Zerocam shot doesn\u2019t do the tree any favors. On Pixel, however, Zerocam\u2019s quality is noticeably lower than Pixel Camera. Perhaps that\u2019s testament tohow well Apple has designed its cameras compared to Google.\n\nImage 1 of 2 iPhone 15 Pro Max. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty similar story with the photo of my dog lying in his bed in my spare room. Zerocam on the iPhone isn\u2019t as bright, and the colors are more muted than the iPhone. However the final iPhone shot almost looks a bit overexposed, with the colors washing out a bit. In reality that scene was more of a middle-ground between the two.\n\nImage 1 of 2 Pixel 9 Pro. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nWeirdly the results on Pixel were almost the opposite. Zerocam\u2019s picture is more washed out and overexposed. Colors on the Pixel as a lot more vibrant in comparison, and probably closer to the actual room \u2014 though not quite. Thankfully the quality issue experienced on the tree hasn\u2019t made a return here.\n\nImage 1 of 2 iPhone 15 Pro Max. (Image credit: Future)\n\nZerocam.

If you ever took a picture on your phone about a decade ago, without the flash, you\u2019ll have seen plenty of pictures that look like Zerocam\u2019s view of the church. It\u2019s darker than it looked in real life, and the surroundings are just a little bit blurry \u2014 or at least it is on the iPhone. The Pixel photo is darker, but clearly my hand was held a little steadier when I took it.\n\nImage 1 of 2 Pixel 9 Pro. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThe iPhone and Pixel cameras look almost like they\u2019ve been taken at a totally different time of day. The building is a lot clearer, and it\u2019s obvious that the camera has exploited the screen lights to make the shot look so much clearer. Though, admittedly, I feel as though the Pixel did a better job, with the iPhone making the church look like it should belong in Silent Hill.\n\nImage 1 of 2 iPhone 15 Pro Max. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nWith the dogs in the park things are back to the previous trends. This photo was taken at 2x magnification in both apps, and it\u2019s obvious that the iPhone photo has brought back the brighter and more vibrant coloring compared to Zerocam. The quality isn\u2019t fantastic on either shot, especially with those far-off details, but the iPhone phone is definitely a lot clearer than the one taken by Zerocam.\n\nImage 1 of 2 Pixel 9 Pro. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story with the Pixel. Those far-off details don\u2019t look amazing, and the Pixel camera certainly didn\u2019t do as good a job at photographing the grass compared to iPhone. But things are sharper compared to Zerocam which has left a haze over both my dogs \u2014 and the grass.\n\nImage 1 of 2 iPhone 15 Pro Max. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nNow for the selfies, which wasn\u2019t particularly easy because of Zerocam\u2019s lack of front camera support. It's another thing that the developers should really be adding, because taking a selfie on a rear camera is really quite difficult \u2014 as I\u2019m sure you can see on my face. It\u2019s a similar story again, with Zerocam\u2019s photo coming out darker and with slightly less vibrant coloring. Meanwhile there really seems to be something in my house that makes the iPhone wash out certain colors \u2014 including whatever shade my face qualifies as.\n\nImage 1 of 2 Pixel 9 Pro. (Image credit: Future) Zerocam. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Pixel results are interesting, because the Pixel camera shot actually looks darker than Zerocam. That hasn\u2019t stopped Zerocam from washing out the colors a little bit, especially on the right side of the photo. There\u2019s a lot more noise in there too, which isn\u2019t ideal, though the quality is noticeably better than Zerocam\u2019s selfie on iPhone.\n\nBottom line\n\nZerocam certainly doesn't take bad photos, but it certainly doesn't take better photos than the stock camera app. At least not on the iPhone 15 Pro Max or Pixel 9 Pro, at any rate. Some of them were pretty close in quality, while others weren't. So really this is only the kind of app that you'd want if you have a moral objection to AI and image processing happening to your photos automatically.\n\nUnfortunately Zerocam's other failings mean that its pretty hard to recommend. Having to pay at least a dollar a month to take zero-AI photos seems crazy to me. Especially since the app's functionality is about as basic as you can get while still being able to take photos.\n\nI can understand an appeal to having a purist photo gallery, but I imagine most of the people interested in that will want more than just point and shoot. Especially if they're being asked to pay a subscription for it.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide"

The upgrade included a revamped Siri, AI writing tools, smart replies, an updated Photos app, and a new focus mode called Reduce Interruptions.\n\nIt was a fraction of the flashy AI features Apple showed off at its Worldwide Developer Conference earlier this year, as the company decided to do a staggered rollout. This second wave of features will be followed by more launching next year.\n\nSo what can you expect when you update to iOS 18.2 later this week?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnticipated features in the December update include tools like Genmojis and Image Playground, among others. Like the earlier Apple Intelligence features, the newest AI features will be available for all iPhone 16 models and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nChatGPT integration\n\nApple's iOS 18.2 introduces ChatGPT integration. Apple\n\nSiri received some enhancements in the iOS 18.1 update, but the iOS 18.2 update will further improve the voice assistant and allow integrated access to ChatGPT. With iOS 18.2, users will have access to the popular OpenAI chatbot through Siri and they'll be able to access the tool by talking to the voice assistant or typing to it.\n\nVisual Intelligence\n\nApple's visual intelligence feature is expected in iOS 18.2 Apple\n\nThe new update will also allow iPhone 16 users to gather information by pointing their device at an object.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tool is similar to Google Lens, which does reverse image searches and helps identify landmarks, plants, and other objects or places.\n\nGenmojis\n\nCreate a personalized \"Genmoji.\" Apple\n\nFor those who prefer to communicate with emojis over the written word, Genmojis could be a game changer.\n\nThe new update allows users to be more playful and interactive in their messages, creating custom emojis right from the keyboard and animated Genmojis of themselves, similar to Bitmoji.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage Playground\n\nImage Playground was introduced at Apple's WWDC 2024. Apple\n\nApple's Image Playground is its answer to popular AI image generators like OpenAI's Dall-E or Midjourney. The tool was first demonstrated at Apple's WWDC conference earlier this year.\n\nRelated stories\n\nImage Playground users can create images based on a specific description or concept and will be able to select different formats like animation. The tool will be available as its own app and will also be accessible through third-party apps.\n\nPhoto updates\n\niOS 18.2 is expected to introduce several photo updates, including video enhancements like improvements for navigating Collections and the ability to view a video more finely, which can be helpful with editing. Users also have the option to clear their Recently Viewed and Recently Shared album history, and Favorites will appear in the Utility and Pinned Collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther updates\n\nApple's Mail app is getting an AI makeover that will categorize emails based on their priority level.

Or be made to feel like a quiz show contestant with brainteasers like \u201chow many golf balls can you fit in a Boeing 747?\u201d. Unfortunately for job seekers, the rigmarole is getting increasingly out of hand.\n\nDemands from hiring committees in the tech sector are piling up. That means more interviews but also more technical tests. Alongside coding evaluations come requests for essays, lengthy take-home assignments and even days spent working with existing teams.\n\nOne friend in the Bay Area made it through multiple interview rounds only to be presented with a final challenge to \u201centertain\u201d the company\u2019s leadership. There were no other instructions. She didn\u2019t get the job.\n\nRecruiters will say that this is not being done to make life difficult for job seekers but because it is growing harder to find the right candidates. The blame, they say, lies with job seekers themselves."

            "article_content": "There are a lot of superhero series out there, but none are quite like Hellboy. Created by Mike Mignola, and featured in four live-action films, Hellboy is unique in that each director seems to have a wildly different approach to presenting the character and his world.\n\nSome of Hellboy\u2019s films seem to lean more into the character and his relationships, while others lean more into the humor and creature-side of things. One movie even slides into full horror movie territory, a la The Evil Dead series .\n\nBut, whichever approach is taken one thing is certain with each film \u2013 it will definitely be a unique little ride. So, here are all four Hellboy movies, ranked.\n\n(Image credit: Lionsgate)\n\n4. Hellboy (2019)\n\nDirector: Neil Marshall\n\nCast: David Harbour, Milla Jovovich, Ian McShane, Sasha Lane, Daniel Dae Kim\n\nWhat It\u2019s About: Our hero, Anung Un Rama, a.k.a., Hellboy (Harbour), must stop a blood queen (Jovovich) before her powers get out of control and she takes over the world. The movie also operates as an origin story for the hero, as well as a partial retelling of Hellboy: The Wild Hunt comic book story arc.\n\nWhy It Ranks Here On This List: Our very own Eric Eisenberg said it best in his middling review of the film , but this reboot of Hellboy just isn\u2019t very good. A major issue with it is the \u201chumor,\u201d as it tries (and fails) too often to be funny.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only issue, though, as the movie just feels way too busy for its own good. And, I understand what they were going for.\n\nA great deal of it introduces you to the lead as a character, and we spend a lot of time getting a feel for him and his world. In this way, I think Neil Marshall and the writers were trying to separate this tale from Guillermo del Toro\u2019s version. While that\u2019s definitely admirable, I don\u2019t really think they pulled it off, and this just ends up feeling like a lesser version of the character.\n\nAlso, they made a conscious effort to make this movie Rated-R, and it feels entirely unnecessary. The violence feels excessive and it isn\u2019t very fun, and the dialogue is needlessly profane.\n\nI do like that we get characters like King Arthur and Baba Yaga, and I also like that Harbour makes for an interesting contrast to Perlman, even though Harbour himself admitted that the movie had \u201cmajor problems.\u201d But overall, I think I\u2019m in agreement with most people in that we really just wanted Hellboy III. Not this.\n\n(Image credit: Ketchup Entertainment)\n\n3. Hellboy: The Crooked Man (2024)\n\nDirector: Brian Taylor\n\nCast: Jack Kesy, Martin Bassindale, Jefferson White, Adeline Rudolph, Leah McNamara\n\nWhat It\u2019s About: A young Hellboy and another member of the BPRD (Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense) end up in the Appalachian area surrounded by witches. There\u2019s a darker force, though, known as the Crooked Man who is in these parts, and Hellboy has to stop him.\n\nWhy It Ranks Here On This List: The Crooked Man is definitely the most different Hellboy movie we\u2019ve ever gotten, and probably because its creator, Mike Mignolia, was so deeply involved with the screenplay. It closely follows the story (maybe a little too closely, actually) from The Crooked Man comic, and it has the most horror elements out of any of the movies.\n\nI especially like Jack Kesy\u2019s performance as Hellboy. Unlike Harbour\u2019s, which felt like it was kind of angling for something similar to Perlman\u2019s performance, Kesy\u2019s portrayal feels completely different, and it\u2019s mostly because this is a younger version of the character.\n\nThis greatly impacts the tone. In a lot of ways, I would compare it to the two Judge Dredd movies that we\u2019ve gotten. The Sylvester Stallone movie was goofy, but also an interesting introduction to the character that I have a soft spot for.\n\nHowever, in the Karl Urban Dredd movie (which I find to be far superior) , the character and the world are just so much more lived in, which is how I feel about this Hellboy movie, which doesn\u2019t take forever and a day to introduce us to the character.\n\nIf I have one complaint, though, it\u2019s that the movie feels uneven. It starts out well, but then tries a bit too hard with the scares later on, which makes it not scary at all. Still, I enjoyed my time with this film for the most part.\n\n(Image credit: Sony Pictures Releasing)\n\n2. Hellboy (2004)\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\n\nCast: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Karel Roden, Jeffrey Tambor\n\nWhat It\u2019s About: Serving as an introduction to the character, Hellboy joins the BPRD (which is apparently in Newark, New Jersey), and bands together with other weird agents in order to stop the forces of evil.\n\nWhy It Ranks Here On This List: Do you know why I love Guillermo del Toro? It\u2019s because when looking at del Toro's best movies , you don\u2019t feel bad about putting Hellboy on the same list as his Oscar-winning picture, The Shape of Water. They\u2019re both great films! They also both distinctly feel like his pictures.\n\nThe first Hellboy succeeds where the 2019 film faltered because even though both work as origin stories, del Toro understood that getting to know the character could be accomplished throughout the film, and not have to take up the first hour or so.\n\nIt also helps that the entire cast was just phenomenal in their roles. Yes, Perlman makes for an excellent Hellboy, but I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t bring up Doug Jones as Abe Sapien or Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. I also think the movie\u2019s simplicity works in its favor, and it didn\u2019t need to be rated-R to still feel engaging. The PG-13 rating worked just fine.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s just really a treat of a movie, and it would definitely be the best Hellboy film ever made, if not for its fantastic sequel.\n\n(Image credit: Universal)\n\n1. Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008)\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\n\nCast: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Luke Goss, Anna Walton\n\nWhat It\u2019s About: A prince holds a grudge against humans (think Magneto, but for magical people) and he wants to take over the world for other magical creatures. He plans to do so with an army of golden robots. But, here come Hellboy, Abe Sapien, and Liz to save the day again. Adventure and humor ensue.\n\nWhy It Ranks Here On This List: I think The Golden Army is my favorite del Toro movie. Either that or Blade II. (Another great comic book flick!) What makes this movie work is pretty much everything. The sense of adventure, the dynamics between characters (Liz is pregnant this time, but Hellboy doesn\u2019t know that!), the special effects, the antagonist (Prince Silverlance is so cool!). Just everything is amazing with this film.\n\nAnd, it moves so quickly! Pacing is extremely important to me, and this movie moves so briskly. It\u2019s two hours long, but it feels like half that time, and I mostly think this is because the stakes are so high, but at the same time, it feels very personal, so you never lose track of anybody\u2019s emotions (Abe Sapien is especially interesting this time around).\n\nI also think it helps that this story isn\u2019t heavily inspired by any previous Hellboy story arc like the other three movies. Instead, it seems like its own unique thing, and benefits from that.\n\nThe Golden Army still very much holds up today, and it\u2019s one of my favorite comic book movies ever. They struck gold with this one."

Kincaid.\n\nThe Mount Hope resident, who launched her writing and illustrating career in 2007, will be featured at a special meet-and-greet next week in Oak Hill. The public can mingle with Kincaid from 6-8 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 10, at the administration building behind the Oak Hill Library branch.\n\n\u201cFor anyone interested in writing, I would say just do it,\u201d Kincaid says. \u201cDon\u2019t try to be super eloquent and sophisticated in your writing, just tell the story.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the point is to entertain, don\u2019t fill your story with words the reader constantly has to pull out a dictionary to understand what you are trying to say.\u201d\n\nKincaid said she\u2019s matured as a writer since her first endeavor, a children\u2019s book entitled \u201cThe Adventures of Casey the Lost Suitcase,\u201d which she penned as Tracy S. Kincaid. \u201cMy aunt had gone to Italy, but her suitcase didn\u2019t,\u201d she said in describing the concept of the children\u2019s book. \u201cWhen the suitcase was finally returned to her after 10 months, it had all of the security tags of where it had traveled. So, I got the idea to write the book from the suitcase\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nThe book lacked proper editing at the time, she said. \u201cThe problem with \u2018Casey,\u2019 although it was a great idea, was that it was never edited,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller, not an editor. Therefore, although well received, the writing had that flaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have written several other children\u2019s books since, but am still working on illustrations and they have not yet been published,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past eight years, she has moved into longer-form novels. \u201cThe Factory in the Crooked Hollow,\u201d published in 2016, was her first attempt at horror, she said. At the time, Kincaid wanted to distinguish her children\u2019s books from her adult books and changed her pen name to T.S. Kincaid. \u201cIn the meantime, I discovered there is another author by the name of Tracy Kincaid, so I decided to be T.S. Kincaid from now on. Although \u2018Factory\u2019 had been edited, I feel I did more telling than showing in this novella.\u201d\n\nFast forward a few years, and Kincaid dipped her toes into the novel pool again. \u201cAfter much research and soul searching, I decided to write \u2018I\u2019m Timmy,\u2019\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cThis book is the first in a series, with the next book being \u2018I\u2019m Klara,\u2019 which I am currently writing. I am very excited about this series because so far it has been well received and I feel I have finally mastered the craft of storytelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Timmy\u201d was self-published in September 2024 and is currently available at booksellers such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble. She will also have it on hand for $10 (normally $14.99) at the Oak Hill event. \u201cI decided to self-publish my \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 series due to the fact that I am older (I\u2019m 61), and wanted to get my stories out into the world instead of waiting to be picked up by a traditional publisher, which may or may not happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I work on my writing and illustrating full time.\u201d\n\nWhat prompted her to move into the horror genre? \u201cMost of the ideas that I get for writing my scary stories are from dreams that I have. I love horror stories and feel comfortable writing this genre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost of my books have an educational element to them,\u201d she continued. \u201cWith my children\u2019s books, I cover subjects like geography, math, a lot of imagination and a little bit of humor.\n\n\u201cWith my horror stories, I try to give the reader a new perspective and something to think about. Explaining the paranormal in ways that perhaps they had not thought about.\u201d\n\nTo complement her writing, Kincaid also has a \u201cwhisper room,\u201d or \u201cpod\u201d as she calls it, in her home in a sound-proof room built for her by her husband.\n\nThere, she \u201ccan do voiceovers and audio books,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cI have a background in theater and I love recording and bringing written books to life.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI recorded the audio book for \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 with sound effects and music. That audio book was recorded in a professional studio in Sevierville, Tenn. by Lions Creative. It is due to be released soon.\n\n\u201cMy hopes and dreams for my writing, of course, is to be a best seller one day. However, I am perfectly happy writing stories that people enjoy reading and is something they will remember long after they have laid the book down. \u2018I\u2019m Timmy\u2019 is a dark and sad paranormal story and not for everyone, but it is an easy read and, once the reader is engaged, it is hard to put down.\u201d\n\nKincaid is available for lectures and to discuss the book with reading clubs, and is open to any questions from readers through her website, www.tskincaid.com."

In the clip, they recreated a vintage photo from when they were younger and were filming the show.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still just kids,\u201d they captioned the post.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, Dobrev, Graham, and King made their on-screen debut together. Although Dobrev left the program at the end of season six, he reappeared for an appearance in the series finale. The Vampire Diaries ran for eight seasons before ending in 2017.\n\nThe romantic triangle between teenage Elena and two vampire brothers, Stefan Salvatore (Wesley) and Damon Salvatore (Somerhalder), was the focus of the popular program, which also starred Paul Wesley and Damon Salvatore.\n\nHowever, peril and catastrophe trailed behind them, drawing Elena and her companions into the paranormal realm of Mystic Falls, Virginia, which was teeming with werewolves, witches, vampires, and more.\n\nOther former cast members of Vampire Diaries also attended the Covington fan conference, in addition to Dobrev, Graham, and King. Additionally present were Wesley, Somerhalder, Zach Roerig (Matt), Arielle Kebbel (Lexi), Michael Malarkey (Enzo), and others.\n\nShowrunner Julie Plec reflected on the series she co-created with Kevin Williamson and how it spawned a supernatural franchise that includes The Originals and Legacies earlier this year, in honour of the show's 15th anniversary of premiere.\n\nDuring her chat with The Hollywood Reporter, she recalled wanting to \u201ctell a really emotional story that was sexy and romantic and scary and all the things,\u201d while also creating \u201csomething that felt timeless, that could live on and continue to feel like anybody, any generation at any time can connect to it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Recently, Amazon announced a multi-year partnership with Orbital Materials to use their \u2018proprietary AI platform\u2019 to develop new materials that help decarbonise data centres. Orbital is synthesising, testing and designing advanced materials for data centre-integrated carbon removal and cooling technology.\n\n\u201cTogether, AWS and Orbital will evaluate the scalability and performance of these new technologies in removing carbon and increasing efficiency,\u201d said Amazon in the report.\n\nOrbital, like any other materials science lab using AI, said that the development of new materials has \u2018traditionally been a slow process of trial and error in the lab,\u2019 and generative AI has significantly improved the timeframe for discovering these materials.\n\n\u201cOrbital has achieved a 10x improvement in its material\u2019s performance through the use of its AI platform\u2014an order of magnitude faster than traditional development and breaking new ground in carbon removal efficacy,\u201d the startup announced. The company also plans to deploy and test these carbon removal technologies by the end of 2025.\n\nOrbital\u2019s claims of a \u2018radical\u2019 improvement in the speed of material discovery are also backed by research findings from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), suggesting we\u2019re living in a golden age of material discovery.\n\nThe Golden Age of Materials Science?\n\nRecent research from MIT outlines the potential of AI technologies and their assistance to scientists, specifically those working on materials science. The author revealed statistics after handing over \u2018new materials discovery technology\u2019 to 1018 scientists in an unnamed \u2018R&D lab of a large US firm\u2019.\n\nThe data showed a 44% increase in new material discovery, a 39% increase in patent filings, and a 17% increase in product prototypes that incorporated these newly discovered materials.\n\n\u201cTrained on the composition and characteristics of existing materials, the model generates recipes for novel compounds predicted to possess specified properties,\u201d said Aidan Toner-Rodgers.\n\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that 82% of scientists reported a reduced level of satisfaction with their work, as they found that leveraging AI decreased creativity and skill underutilisation.\n\nThe advent of AI revolutionising materials science began last year, when Google DeepMind released research titled \u2018Scaling deep learning for material discovery\u2019, where they discovered 2.2 million new crystals, equivalent to 800 years of work of knowledge. Out of which, 380,000 materials were stable materials.\n\n\u201cFor example, 52,000 new layered compounds similar to graphene have the potential to revolutionise electronics with the development of superconductors,\u201d said DeepMind in the announcement.\n\nGoogle DeepMind went beyond discovery and also published another research stating that 41 out of 58 selected materials were successfully synthesised in just 17 days.\n\nMeta marked its foray into material size by releasing a massive data set called Open Materials 2024, or OMat24. The dataset contains over 118 million examples of material simulations and structures, focusing on a wide range of inorganic bulk materials to improve AI-enabled material discovery.\n\nNew Materials, Really?\n\nDeep learning has amplified materials research and discovery for a few years now. However, if there\u2019s one way AI can save humanity, it lies in not just discovering new materials, but also finding ways to synthesise and manufacture them in commercial capabilities.\n\nWhen Google Deepmind made the announcement last year, the company did not take long for contradictory results to come into the picture, where a researcher said that many of the materials discovered weren\u2019t truly novel and were just minor variations of known compounds. It also said that Google Deepmind mostly focused on the stability of the materials, overlooking functionalities that are required for practical applications.\n\nMoreover, Google\u2019s claim of synthesising these newly discovered materials using an autonomous lab is also facing scrutiny, thanks to a study from Princeton University. The researchers here outright deny Google Deepmind\u2019s claim. They said that none of the materials produced by the autonomous lab were new and that the majority were misclassified.\n\nThe authors also say that a majority of the synthetic products were wrongly characterised. It failed to distinguish between materials with random and organised atomic arrangements. In short, the authors said that AI can generate predictions but will struggle to interpret experimental results accurately.\n\nWhen Do I Use It\n\nPresuming these challenges are overcome in discovering and synthesising new materials, but when can we hold these new materials?\n\nIt is indeed a very long journey. Benjamin Reinhardt, CEO at Speculative Technologies, puts it best in his work: Getting materials out of the Lab.\n\n\u201cYou can think of lab-scale materials as the most artisanal products in the world, painstakingly handcrafted by people with advanced degrees. Like any artisanal product, lab-scale materials are expensive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTrying to mass-produce these materials by simply increasing the number of fume hoods, test tubes, and pipette wielders would make them cost billions of dollars per kilogram.\u201d\n\nMass-producing or scaling these newly discovered materials remains a challenge. From analysing the materials\u2019 failure modes in controlled conditions to setting up an industrial-scale factory, following regulations, and justifying the choices to investors and customers, one is surely set to turn into Sisyphus.\n\nScientists, mostly working in universities, have strong incentives to focus on novelty and one-off demonstrations because these can lead to publications and positive media attention.\n\n\u201cStart-ups commercialising a new material face many headwinds, including often-unavoidable relationships with larger companies, trade-offs between speed and profit margins, and capital constraints,\u201d said Reinhardt.\n\nMoreover, newly discovered materials need to go through a lot of testing, and the world has seen quite a few tragedies when they\u2019re put out in the real world. For instance, carbon fibre, and composite materials are all the rage. We don\u2019t need to look far behind in the history books. In the recent OceanGate\u2019s tragic implosion, the Titan submersible was using an \u2018experimental carbon fibre composite hull\u2019. It was the first instance of the material being used in a submersible.\n\nAn investigation revealed that the hull may have been prone to micro buckling and delamination under deepsea pressures. Small manufacturing imperfections in carbon-fiber material could amplify such issues.\n\nIn 2017, the Grenfell Tower fire in London, claimed 72 lives owing to the building\u2019s exterior cladding. It was made of aluminium composite panel panels with a polyethylene core and flammable insulation materials. The combination led to a rapid spread of fire, and investigations revealed that manufacturers exploited loopholes in regulation.\n\nTherefore, there will be an increased sense of caution before these materials come to life. In the essay, Reinhardt also provided a dataset that visualises the timeline from when materials were discovered and fully commercialised.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. The next time it seems exciting when AI has discovered new materials, it\u2019s time to give ourselves a reality check. There\u2019s no doubt AI has the potential to speed up the manufacturing process as well, but we\u2019re yet to see how.\n\n[This story has been read by 511 unique individuals.]\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Kevin Weil showed no sign of the heat when he took to the stage at the Marriott Marquis in downtown San Francisco on an unseasonably sweaty early October morning.\n\nTrim and tan, outfitted in the de rigueur Silicon Valley uniform of a slim-fit gray tee, stonewashed blue jeans, and an Apple Watch Ultra, the chief product officer of OpenAI talked easily about the ambitious artificial intelligence-powered future his red-hot employer was building.\n\n\"You could imagine a world where you ask it a hard question about how you cure some particular form of cancer, and you let it think for five hours, five days, five months,\" Weil prophesied in response to a question about the \"reasoning capabilities\" of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither he nor his onstage interlocutor, Anyscale cofounder Robert Nishihara, ever acknowledged the elephant in the room: Weil wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nThe event, the AI infrastructure conference Ray Summit, had originally booked OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, to speak. Just days before, the high-profile executive had abruptly quit, prompting the last-minute swap. Murati's exit added to a long list of recent departures from OpenAI, one of the world's most valuable and hyped startups, even as it closed a historic $6.6 billion funding round on the day Weil spoke.\n\nIf Sam Altman is the starry-eyed visionary of OpenAI, Weil is its executor. He leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services it can sell, putting him at the center of a philosophical rift that has caused spectacular upheaval at the company, which was recently valued at $157 billion.\n\nIn two years, OpenAI went from a nonprofit lab nominally working to develop digital intelligence for the public good to a world-famous startup that puts out shiny new products and models every few months. The company is now attempting to become a for-profit operation to lure would-be backers to write bigger checks, which it needs to scale its business. Altman recently announced that the company's flagship product, ChatGPT, now has 300 million weekly users, triple the number it had a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with this astronomical growth, OpenAI has succumbed to a brain drain: Its chief research officer, head of AGI readiness, co-lead of its video-generation model Sora, and the list goes on. While this has sparked alarm bells in some corners of the tech industry, it has also elevated the profile of the senior leaders who have remained. That includes Weil, a relative OpenAI newcomer who joined in June and rapidly became one of its most notable ambassadors.\n\nAt a point when employee voices of dissent were growing louder, 41-year-old Weil arrived as a steady-handed product guru with a Midas touch. He was a longtime Twitter insider who created products that made the social media company money during a revolving door of chief executives.\n\nAt Instagram, he helped kneecap Snapchat's growth with competitive product releases such as Stories and live video. (Not everything he touched turned to gold, though. Weil also led Facebook's headlong charge into financial services as a cofounder of Libra, its ill-fated stablecoin.)\n\nWeil declined to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with five former senior colleagues, four of whom spoke on the record, and his past public interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter and Facebook were no strangers to chaos and scandal, but even their most challenging times are rivaled by OpenAI's workplace turmoil. There was a failed coup last year, bitter feuds among some workers, and an ongoing existential arms race to build \"digital gods.\"\n\nWeil's peers are certain he's the man to promote harmony. He's spent the better part of 15 years cranking out products that mostly delighted users and made money. He also has something his new employer desperately needs: The ability to pursue the company's best interests and balance human emotions at the same time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKevin Weil isn't a household name. But for those in the know in Silicon Valley, he's something better: \"He's the get-shit-done guy,\" said James Everingham, who worked with Weil at Instagram and Facebook.\n\nSarah Friar, OpenAI's new head of finance, has long admired Weil's product chops. Former Twitter boss Adam Bain called Weil \"Twitter's secret weapon\" for driving ad revenue. Everingham also described Weil as a workhorse who never shrank from a deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He brings that stamina, that dogged focus on the outcome,\" said April Underwood, a venture capitalist who worked closely with Weil on Twitter's ad products.\n\nWeil's relentless work ethic and people skills are recurring themes among former colleagues. At Facebook, two colleagues said he would often badge into the office first and fire off messages late into the night.\n\nOne colleague from Planet, a satellite imagery company where Weil worked as president until May of 2024, recalled how he started each week by posting in Slack the top three things on his mind. According to Everingham, Weil's a rare breed of product manager who codes almost as well as he writes memos. That endeared Weil to the engineers he needed to build products.\n\nWeil shrugs off the pressures of work with long runs and Diet Mountain Dew. Every birthday, he runs his age in miles and, in June, marked his 41st year with a 41-mile jaunt near his home in the posh California suburb of Portola Valley, according to a public Instagram post. Weil lives with his venture capitalist wife, Elizabeth, and three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a little bit superhuman in just the sheer amount that he works and works out,\" said Ashley Johnson, chief financial officer and now president of Planet.\n\nFormer colleagues say Kevin Weil was key to turning Twitter into a crucial arena for advertisers. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWeil set aside a Stanford doctorate in theoretical particle physics to cave out a path in tech, according to a 2017 speech he gave at his alma mater. In 2009, Weil landed at Twitter as a data scientist. At the time, Twitter had little revenue, never mind profit, to show for its many millions of users. That left investors wondering how Twitter would translate its popularity into money.\n\nWhen Twitter began developing ads a year later, Weil stepped up to lead it. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who overlapped with Weil at Twitter, said employees debated how to show ads in a way that didn't degrade the user experience, pitting engineers against marketers. Weil threaded the needle. Under his oversight, Twitter launched ads that looked like tweets inside the feed. AdAge reported in 2011 that hundreds of brands had embraced the format, helping to establish the cash flow that made Twitter's IPO possible in 2013.\n\nThen, in early 2016, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom asked Weil to dinner as Snapchat was nipping at the Facebook-owned photo app's heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram needed to get users, especially teens, to post more; Systrom wanted a pinch-hitter to get new features designed and added to the app and into the hands of Instagram users. Weil told CNBC in 2017 that he had already resigned from Twitter with plans to train for a 50-mile ultramarathon snaking the American River in California's Central Valley. He took the Instagram job and, a month later, finished fifth in the race.\n\nThe product leader wasted no time in the photo-sharing battle. In just a few months, Instagram rolled out a feature similar to Snapchat's disappearing photos and videos, then added popular face filters and also introduced a feed-ranking algorithm to highlight more relevant content. According to Instagram, its user base doubled within two years of Weil's arrival, reaching 1 billion monthly users by 2018; Snapchat's earnings statements during the same period indicated that its user growth had flatlined.\n\nEveringham, his former colleague, recounted how when Systrom identified Stories as Instagram's killer feature, Weil assembled a nimble team of engineers under the CEO's supervision to execute it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He had this clarity of thinking I haven't seen in anyone else,\" said Everingham, now an engineering leader of developer infrastructure at Meta.\n\nWeil's tenure at Instagram was defined by a controversial strategy: borrowing liberally from the competition. The features that became Instagram staples had their genesis in a rival's playbook, which neither Systrom nor Weil denied in interviews with Vox and TechCrunch over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy is particularly poignant as Weil steps into his new role at OpenAI, a company navigating a thicket of copyright lawsuits. New outlets, authors, and celebrities have sued OpenAI over using their work to train its large language models.\n\nThat's far from the only struggle the product chief faces. He's positioned as one of Altman's top lieutenants at a time when OpenAI's famed brain trust is leaving in droves, often to start competitor companies that may threaten OpenAI's early dominance in the space.\n\nFormer OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded Anthropic, one of OpenAI's most notable competitors, in 2021. Former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised $1 billion for his new venture, Safe Superintelligence. Ex-researcher Aravind Srinivas is working on an AI-powered search engine, Perplexity. In early December, Murati, the former CTO, told Wired she was \"figuring out\" what her new venture would look like, though it's unclear if her startup will directly compete with OpenAI.\n\nMira Murati's move follows a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI this years. Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images\n\nAnother threat comes from open-source AI models championed by the likes of Meta. If these free-to-use systems prove good enough for most users, it will make it far harder for OpenAI to effectively monetize its AI models and, ultimately, turn a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause with over $20 billion funding, according to PitchBook data, and only an estimated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024 plus losses of $5 billion, according to leaked documents obtained by The New York Times in September), OpenAI still faces a long road to prove that it can deliver a return on the unprecedented volumes of capital plowed into the company. And that's without even getting into the growing concern that improvements in AI models are slowing.\n\nOnstage at the Ray Summit in October, Weil shrugged off the threat of competition. When asked about whether the current gap in quality between open-source models and OpenAI's premium AI products will shrink, he quipped: \"I mean, we're certainly going to do our best to make it grow.\"\n\nIn theory, a proven leader like Weil could help guide the operation past the power struggles and talent losses toward a more steady state. By all accounts, he's a deft conciliator who can empathize with the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\"He's somewhat of a diplomat,\" said Jacobs Stanton, his former Twitter colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Facebook, where Weil helped develop a stablecoin backed by a basket of international currencies, he had to mediate between crypto natives, the product purists who wanted to take a more user-friendly, less decentralized approach, and policymakers, according to two former Facebook colleagues. The project ultimately couldn't overcome regulatory roadblocks and an exodus of corporate partners; Meta shuttered the project in 2022, selling $182 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.\n\nKevin Weil leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services OpenAI can sell. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nHow Weil's experience maps onto his current role remains to be seen. With its several thousand employees, regulators scrutinizing its every move, and 300 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI is more complex than any company Weil's stepped into before. In just six months since his arrival, OpenAI has rolled out a large language model that can solve more complex problems via a process the company calls \"reasoning,\" and a search engine within ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI launched a voice mode to talk to ChatGPT, which Weil personally tested as a \"universal translator\" during recent trips to Seoul and Tokyo. Reflecting on the release, Weil shared on LinkedIn, \"It feels normal to me now, but two years ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible.\"\n\nLast week OpenAI announced an ambitious \"12 days of shipmas,\" a festive product sprint likely to keep Weil working long hours. While he's managed to keep the proverbial plates spinning in his professional life, there's been one noticeable casualty: his workout routine. App data from Strava shows that he's been logging fewer hours of cycling and running each month since he joined OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Weil's exercise, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said Weil recorded 96 minutes of physical activity a day in November. \"I would say he's doing quite alright,\" Felix said.\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, covering startups and venture capital.

Learn More.\n\nOpenAI awarded a $1 million grant to a Duke University team of researchers seeking to explore AI algorithms capable of predicting people\u2019s moral judgment. The grant invests in academic research into \u201cAI morality\u201d as debates on the ethical use of artificial intelligence continue to gain steam in public discourse. Duke has been researching the use of AI to aid people in exercising ethical decisions, producing resources on ethics involving the latest AI technologies.\n\nThe study, \u201cMaking Moral AI,\u201d is being conducted by Duke\u2019s Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB) and led by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, professor of practical ethics and the project\u2019s principal investigator. Co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg of the Social Science Research Institute joins him on the project.\n\nMADLAB is an interdisciplinary laboratory designed to understand various factors that shape and influence people\u2019s \u201cmoral attitudes, decisions, and judgments.\u201d Researchers have been trying to understand the role of AI and how it can be used as a \u201cmoral GPS\u201d to help people make better judgments guided by ethical standards and traditions, drawing on \u201ccomputer science, data science, philosophy, economics, game theory, psychology, and neuroscience.\u201d\n\nAbout the OpenAI Grant\n\nOpenAI\u2019s grant will be used to \u201cdevelop algorithms that can predict human moral judgments in scenarios involving conflicts among morally relevant features in medicine, law, and business,\u201d according to a Duke press release. Information about the research grant has not been publicized, but it would be a good start for OpenAI to invest in such an effort. Ethics is highly nuanced. It\u2019s still a long shot for current technologies to grasp the nuances of moral judgments\u2014especially when human emotion also plays a crucial role.\n\nAI models are trained to calculate and compute data and statistics. Large language models mostly rely on patterns in language and reasoning to generate predictions. Various fields are involved in morality research, including philosophy, sociocultural studies, and psychology. Combining these disciplines with AI, computer science, and data science would be an enormous task. It also takes time to fully integrate social sciences and philosophy insights into AI algorithms.\n\nRead our guide to navigating AI\u2019s ethical challenges or our look at the ethics of generative AI models to learn more."

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought.

            "article_content": "The latest Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics just dropped, and it is filled with goodies ranging from new missions to plans for space weather.\n\nThe report comes from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and it outlines top priorities for space agencies and affiliated institutions in better understanding the solar system in the next decade. The report draws on 450 papers from the science community as well as other events including presentations and town halls.\n\nDecadal surveys are important; they outline science objectives for a wide array of scientists. In 2021, the academies outlined finding Earth-like exoplanets, understanding the universe\u2019s densest objects, and improving understanding of the birth and growth of galaxies as top astronomical priorities.\n\nThe following year, the report dedicated to planetary science and astrobiology concluded that a Uranus probe should be the highest priority mission. Last year, a report from the academies put a sustained human presence off-Earth on the docket.\n\nThis year\u2019s report covered the gamut of solar and space physics, including how to better track the dynamic environment of our solar system and better understand the star at its heart.\n\nThe report called for NASA to pursue a mission that would launch a constellation of satellites that would observe the space environment near Earth and a spacecraft that would image the Sun at its poles. The report identified the National Science Foundation\u2019s Next Generation Global Oscillations Network, a solar observatory network, as the highest-priority large construction project.\n\nFuture modeling of space weather systems should also make use of artificial intelligence, according to the report. Specifically, machine learning-driven models of the surface of the Sun could better anticipate eruptions from the surface of the star, and data assimilation could be done swiftly by AI programs, hastening the pace of discovery. The report also recommended that the NSF develop a strategic plan for space weather , that NOAA establish a program for it, and partner with the Department of Defense to develop predictive space weather models. The report also called for NASA to grow the spaceflight element of its Heliophysics Space Weather program; the Parker Solar Probe\u2019s dive into the Sun comes to mind, as an ambitious endeavor that yielded new insights into space weather.\n\n\u201cLack of progress in solar and space physics over the next decade could have devastating consequences to society, in part because it would inhibit our ability to predict and mitigate against potentially harmful space weather impacts,\u201d said committee co-chair Stephen Fuselier, acting vice president of the Southwest Research Institute\u2019s space science division, in an academies release.\n\n\u201cWhile making substantive progress will require modest additional investments from the government, research into these areas is of paramount importance,\u201d Fuselier added. \u201cThis report helps provide a window into the future of the field and safeguard a growing range of industries here on Earth, and enables humanity to become a true space-faring civilization.\u201d\n\nSpace weather is a dynamic phenomenon that even affects those of us on Earth; our planet was hit by several intense geomagnetic storms this year, causing auroras around the world and some electronic disruptions. But in space, such weather events can be severe for equipment that, albeit shielded, is not within the relatively safe cocoon of our planet\u2019s magnetosphere.\n\n\u201cThe solar and space physics field is at a pivotal point right now, and we have the opportunity in the coming years to pursue some really exciting science\u2014both for science\u2019s sake and to achieve major improvements to our understanding of things like space weather,\u201d said Robyn Millan, an astronomer at Dartmouth College and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report, in an academies release.\n\nAs we Earthlings ramp up exploration of our solar system (and, dare I say, beyond?), it\u2019s crucial for governing bodies to outline the types of missions and the funding required to take those ambitious next steps sooner rather than later. The report provides a north star for those goals, and gives the public something to get excited about."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents The Bluetooth battle Broad support Going beyond Bluetooth\n\nI hate Bluetooth in Windows. Add it to the list of gripes I have, but no matter how many times I go through the process of pairing and re-pairing different controllers on my PC, I always seem to run into issues with dropped connections and pairing failures when I go to play games with a controller on my PC. This $20 accessory solves that issue.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the . It\u2019s a little $20 dongle that I\u2019ve used for years at this point, and it\u2019s become such a staple of my PC setup that I rarely even think about it. If you\u2019re looking to pad the stocking of a PC gamer in your life, it\u2019s one of the most inexpensive accessories that can benefit nearly any PC gamer.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Bluetooth battle\n\nAt a high level, the Wireless USB Adapter 2 is just a Bluetooth adapter. You plug it into your PC, hold down a tiny button until the light starts blinking rapidly, and pair your controller of choice, be it from Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, or even 8BitDo itself. I\u2019ve gone through the pairing process literally hundreds of times with the adapter, and I\u2019ve never once run into an issue. I can\u2019t say the same with Bluetooth in Windows.\n\nOnce a controller is paired, it\u2019ll automatically reconnect to the adapter whenever you turn on the controller, giving off a little rumble to let you know it has paired successfully. I mainly use an Xbox Series X controller for PC gaming, but I\u2019ll occasionally pop over to the DualSense for Sony\u2019s first-party games or an for retro games. All of them work flawlessly.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nYou\u2019d have a hard time finding a PC these days that doesn\u2019t support Bluetooth, and that prevalence should make an accessory like the Wireless USB Adapter 2 obsolete. But it doesn\u2019t. Although basically any PC has Bluetooth connectivity, the quality of the connection varies wildly. Some PCs combine Bluetooth and Wi-Fi into a single chip, others have separate chips, and if you built your own PC, you might not have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth at all depending on your motherboard.\n\nThe bigger issue is range, however, which is why I sought out the Wireless USB Adapter 2 in the first place. This is dependent on your PC, but for me, I constantly experienced missed inputs and lagging performance when using my PC\u2019s built-in Bluetooth, particularly if I leaned my chair back while playing. Bluetooth has a very limited range, but I\u2019ve never had an issue with connectivity with the USB Wireless Adapter 2.\n\nBroad support\n\nI use three main controllers on a Windows PC, and the Wireless USB Adapter 2 supports all of them. But it goes far beyond just what I use the adapter for. You can connect nearly any controller to nearly any modern system, and with the full features of the controller intact.\n\nAs for what you can plug the Wireless USB Adapter 2 into, it supports Windows, macOS, Android, SteamOS, Switch, and Raspberry Pi. Short of the Xbox and PlayStation, it works with nearly any device you\u2019d want to play games on. Controller support is even better. Of course, any 8Bitdo arcade stick or controller works, as do Xbox controllers from the Xbox One or Xbox Series X.\n\nBeyond that, you can pair a PlayStation controller from the PS3 up to the PS5, as well as the Switch Pro, Joy-Cons, Wii U Pro, and Wiimote controllers. With Switch controllers, the adapter supports 6-axis motion controls, and you get rumble support on Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation controllers.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t cover any controller, but it\u2019s close. Basically any controller that supports Bluetooth will pair up without issues, and for most modern controllers, you can still access all of their features \u2014 assuming they work with the game you\u2019re playing in the first place.\n\nGoing beyond Bluetooth\n\nIf broad support and hassle-free pairing isn\u2019t enough, the Wireless USB Adapter 2 offers more. If you\u2019re using one of the big three controllers \u2014 Switch Pro, PS4/PS5, or Xbox Series/One controller \u2014 you can use 8BitDo\u2019s Ultimate software. It works with 8BitDo\u2019s own controllers, too, though that shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise.\n\nThe Ultimate software is extremely powerful, offering a level of customization that you normally only find with the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller. It allows you to customize nearly every aspect of the controller, from button mappings to stick dead zones, and you can store all of the customization in a profile that\u2019s easy to recall later.\n\nMy personal use case for the Ultimate software is pretty simple. I have the vibration, trigger sensitivity, and joystick dead zones tuned for each of the three controllers I mainly use, and I swap between them as needed. You can go much deeper with the software if you want, though. You can swap the sticks or triggers, for example, and you can remap the face buttons on something like a Switch Pro controller to line up with the Xbox/PlayStation layout.\n\nBeyond full remapping support, you can program macros, including adjustable timing and support for eight-way inputs on the D-pad, which is very useful for pulling off tricky combos in fighting games. And with all of these settings, you can save them in a profile to easily swap over to if you don\u2019t want to leave your controller with a wonky layout all of the time.\n\nThe Wireless USB Adapter 2 is a simple accessory that\u2019s surprisingly powerful. It gets around the issues with Bluetooth in Windows, and it makes your controller more powerful through the Ultimate software. If you have a PC gamer in your life, you don\u2019t need to take out a second mortgage buying more PC hardware or play the guessing game with the next title they want to play \u2014 the Wireless USB Adapter 2 is a perfect stocking stuffer that nearly any PC gamer will appreciate."

Photograph: Bakr Alkasem/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA coalition of opposition groups in Syria, headed by the Islamist faction Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has upended Syria\u2019s civil war after a long stalemate. Their lightning offensive, taking over several key cities in the space of days, is the most direct challenge to president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s power in years and may signal the end of his 24-year rule.\n\nThe Syrian civil war started 13 years ago, during the Arab Spring, and escalated into a bloody, multifaceted conflict involving domestic opposition groups, extremist factions and international powers, including the United States, Iran and Russia. More than 500,000 Syrians have died, and millions more have fled their homes.\n\nWhat is the situation on the ground?\n\nIn just over a week, Syrian rebel forces seized much of Syria\u2019s northwest from the government in a fast-moving attack. First, the rebels seized Syria\u2019s largest city, Aleppo, then days later blazed through Hama and the strategic city of Homs. On Sunday, they reached Syria\u2019s capital, Damascus.\n\nWho is fighting?\n\nThe Syrian government, led by Assad, was central to the protracted and devastating civil war that began in 2011. Assad, who took power in 2000, is part of the family that has run Syria since a 1970 coup. They are Alawites, a minority sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSyria's president Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. Photograph: Philip Fong/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAssad initially portrayed himself as a modern reformist, but he responded to peaceful protests during the Arab Spring with brutal crackdowns, sparking a nationwide uprising.\n\nAfter several years of war, the Assad government clawed back much of the territory it lost to rebels with the help of Iran, Russia, and Lebanon\u2019s Hizbullah militia. But those allies have recently been decimated or distracted by other conflicts.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), whose name means Organisation for the Liberation of the Levant, began to form at the beginning of Syria\u2019s civil war, when jihadis formed the Nusra Front to fight pro-Assad forces with hundreds of insurgent and suicide attacks.\n\nThe group had early links to the Islamic State group, and then to al-Qaeda. But by mid-2016, the Nusra Front tried to shed its extremist roots, banding together with several other factions to establish HTS. The United States and other western countries still consider it a terrorist group.\n\nThe group\u2019s leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has said his primary goal is to \u201cliberate Syria from this oppressive regime\u201d. He has tried to gain legitimacy by providing services to residents in his stronghold of Idlib.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) jihadist group's chief Abu Mohamed al-Jolani (L) checks the damage following an earthquake in the village of Besnaya in Idlib province. Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPublicly, US officials have been cautious about HTS. But inside the US government, some officials believe the group\u2019s turn toward pragmatism is genuine, and that its leaders know they cannot realise aspirations to join or lead the Syrian government if the group is seen as a jihadi one.\n\nKurdish Forces, from a Syrian ethnic minority, became the United States\u2019 main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces. After the extremist group was largely defeated, Kurdish-led forces consolidated control over towns in the northeast, expanding an autonomous region they had built there. But Kurdish fighters still had to contend with their long-time enemy, Turkey, which regards them as being linked to a Kurdish separatist insurgency.\n\nThere are also many other Syrian militias fighting with their own agendas and allegiances.\n\nAre foreign powers involved?\n\nSince the beginning of the civil war, Turkey\u2019s military has launched several military interventions across the border into Syria, mostly against Syrian Kurdish-led forces. Turkey now effectively controls a zone along Syria\u2019s northern border.\n\nTurkey also supports factions such as the Syrian National Army, a coalition of armed Syrian opposition groups. Analysts say it probably gave tacit approval to the offensive led by HTS.\n\nProtesters outside the Turkish embassy in Tehran, Iran denounced Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s support of Syrian rebels and Israeli prime minister Binyamin Neanyahu's treatment of Gaza. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday issued a qualified approval of the rebel advance. \u201cIdlib, Hama, Homs, and the target, of course, is Damascus,\u201d he told reporters in Istanbul, according to Turkish state media. \u201cThe opposition\u2019s march continues. Our wish is that this march in Syria continues without incident.\u201d\n\nThroughout Syria\u2019s civil war, Russia has been one of Assad\u2019s most loyal foreign backers, sending Russian troops to support his forces and jets to bomb his enemies. It has maintained a strategic military presence in Syria with air and naval bases, which it uses to support military operations in the region.\n\nBecause of the grinding war of attrition in Ukraine, analysts say Russia has been unable to support Syria\u2019s government as forcefully as it has in the past. Russian air strikes that attempted to slow the rebel advance have been relatively sparse.\n\nSyria is a core part of Iran\u2019s \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d a network of countries and groups that includes Hizbullah, Palestinian militant group Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen that hopes to destroy Israel and reduce American influence in the Middle East.\n\nIran smuggles weapons to Hizbullah across Iraq and Syria. Iran and Hizbullah have repaid the favour by sending thousands of militants to fight on Assad\u2019s side during the civil war. On Friday, Iran began to evacuate its military commanders and personnel from Syria, according to regional officials and three Iranian officials, in a sign of its inability to help Assad hold power.\n\nThe US role in the Syrian civil war has shifted several times. The Obama administration initially supported opposition groups in their uprising against the government, providing weapons and training, with limited effect.\n\nAfter the rise of the Islamic State group in 2014, US forces fought the terrorist group with air strikes and assistance to Kurdish forces, and then stayed in northeastern Syria to prevent a resurgence. In 2019, then-president Donald Trump withdrew many of those forces, but the US still maintains about 900 troops, based in Kurdish-controlled oil-drilling areas in the northeast and a garrison in the southeast near Syria\u2019s borders with Iraq and Jordan.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military activities in Syria have been mostly focused on air strikes against Hizbullah and Iranian targets, especially senior military personnel, weapons production facilities and the transport corridor that Iran uses to send weapons to Hizbullah.\n\nFighters for the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham make their way through a trench on the front lines near the town of Maaret al-Nasaan, Idlib Province, Syria. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/New York Times\n\nAn Enduring Conflict\n\nThe Syrian war began in 2011 with a peaceful uprising against the government and spiralled into a complex conflict involving armed rebels, extremists and others.\n\nThe conflict began when Syrians rose up peacefully against the government of Assad. The protests were met a violent crackdown, while communities took up arms to defend themselves. civil war ensued.\n\nAmid the chaos, Syria\u2019s ethnic Kurdish minority took up arms and gradually took territory it saw as its own. The Islamic State group seized parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 and declared that territory its \u201ccaliphate,\u201d further destabilising the region.\n\nAssad has received vital support from Iran and Russia, as well as Hizbullah. The rebels were backed by the US and oil-rich Arab states such as Saudi Arabia. Turkey also intervened to stop the advance of Kurdish militias.\n\nThe war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Forces loyal to Assad have committed by far the most atrocities. The regime has turned to chemical weapons, barrel bombs and starvation to force Syrians into submission.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n2024 The New York Times Company"

Its shares were trading up 12.1% at 13.2 euros by 1445 GMT.\n\nReason for the buyout talks\n\nThe buyout talks come as some minority shareholders, including AJ Investments, have been pushing for either a take-private or a sale of Ubisoft to a strategic investor amid the stock price plunge, as previously reported.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it cut its outlook on weaker-than-expected sales and postponed the launch of \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed Shadows.\u201d.\n\nThis week it announced it would discontinue development of its gaming title XDefiant and, as a consequence, close its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka and ramp down production in Sydney.\n\nUbisoft is run by the Guillemot family, which owns 15% of the firm, followed by Tencent, which owns just under 10%, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe family held about 20.5% of Ubisoft\u2019s net voting rights while Tencent owned 9.2% as of the end of April, as per the firm\u2019s latest annual report."

            "article_content": "Explore Valve's evolving strategy for Steam Machines, from their initial launch to the impact of the Steam Deck, and what the future holds for living room PC gaming.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long and winding road for Valve\u2019s Steam Machines. First announced in 2013, these pre-built gaming PCs, designed to bring PC gaming to the living room, were met with a mix of excitement and skepticism. After a somewhat underwhelming launch and years of relative silence, many wondered if Valve had abandoned the project altogether. However, recent developments suggest that Valve\u2019s grand vision for Steam Machines might finally be coming into focus, albeit in a different form than initially imagined.\n\nThis article delves into the history of Steam Machines, exploring their initial goals, their struggles, and how Valve\u2019s evolving strategy, particularly with the success of the Steam Deck, might be the key to finally realizing their initial ambition: to make PC gaming more accessible and widespread.\n\nThe Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Steam Machines\n\nWhat were they? Steam Machines were pre-built gaming PCs designed to run Valve\u2019s SteamOS, a Linux-based operating system optimized for gaming. The idea was to offer a console-like experience with the openness and flexibility of PC gaming.\n\nWhy did Valve create them? Valve aimed to bridge the gap between PC and console gaming, offering a user-friendly experience with access to the vast Steam library. They wanted to challenge the dominance of consoles in the living room.\n\nWhat went wrong? Several factors contributed to the lukewarm reception of Steam Machines:\n\nLimited game compatibility: SteamOS, being Linux-based, initially struggled with compatibility issues, limiting the number of games available.\n\nHigh price point: Early Steam Machines were often more expensive than comparable gaming consoles.\n\nLack of marketing: Valve didn\u2019t heavily promote Steam Machines, leading to low consumer awareness.\n\nCompetition from consoles: The PS4 and Xbox One offered strong competition with established game libraries and exclusive titles.\n\nWhere are they now? While Steam Machines never truly took off, the underlying technology and vision behind them continued to evolve. The Steam Controller, initially designed for Steam Machines, found a niche audience. More importantly, the development of Proton, a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Linux, significantly expanded the SteamOS game library.\n\nThe Steam Deck: A Turning Point\n\nThe release of the Steam Deck in 2022 marked a significant shift in Valve\u2019s strategy. This handheld gaming PC, powered by SteamOS, proved to be a massive success, showcasing the potential of Valve\u2019s gaming ecosystem beyond traditional desktops.\n\nHow the Steam Deck changed the game:\n\nPortable PC gaming: The Steam Deck demonstrated the viability of portable PC gaming, attracting a new generation of gamers.\n\nProton\u2019s success: The widespread adoption of the Steam Deck highlighted the effectiveness of Proton, making Linux gaming a reality for many.\n\nSteamOS refinement: The Steam Deck pushed Valve to further refine SteamOS, improving its performance and user experience.\n\nThe Steam Deck\u2019s success has reignited interest in Steam Machines. With a mature SteamOS, a vast library of compatible games thanks to Proton, and a proven hardware design, the stage seems set for Valve to revisit the living room PC gaming concept.\n\nValve\u2019s Master Plan: An Evolving Ecosystem\n\nValve\u2019s approach to Steam Machines seems to have shifted from dedicated hardware to a more holistic ecosystem approach. They are no longer focused on selling specific devices but rather on expanding the reach of SteamOS and making it the go-to platform for PC gaming across various form factors.\n\nEvidence of this shift:\n\nSteamOS 3 open source release: Valve made SteamOS 3 available to the public, allowing manufacturers to create their own Steam Machines.\n\nFocus on software and services: Valve is investing heavily in Proton, SteamOS features, and cloud gaming services, strengthening the overall Steam ecosystem.\n\nCommunity involvement: Valve actively encourages community contributions to SteamOS development, fostering a collaborative environment.\n\nThis strategy allows Valve to leverage the success of the Steam Deck while enabling other manufacturers to contribute to the hardware side. This could lead to a diverse range of Steam Machines, catering to different needs and price points.\n\nThe Future of Steam Machines: What to Expect\n\nWhile Valve hasn\u2019t officially announced any new Steam Machines, the pieces are in place for a potential resurgence. Here are some possible scenarios:\n\nPartnerships with manufacturers: Valve could collaborate with hardware partners to release new Steam Machines, leveraging their expertise in design and manufacturing.\n\nFocus on niche markets: Steam Machines could target specific segments, such as living room gaming, portable gaming, or even competitive esports.\n\nIntegration with other Valve hardware: Valve\u2019s strategy could be tightly integrated with other Valve hardware, such as the Steam Deck and Index VR headset.\n\nCloud gaming integration: Steam Machines could leverage Valve\u2019s cloud gaming capabilities, allowing users to stream games from their existing PC libraries.\n\nThe success of this renewed approach will depend on several factors, including the continued development of Proton, the performance and affordability of new Steam Machines, and the overall growth of the PC gaming market.\n\nMy Personal Take\n\nAs a long-time PC gamer and someone who eagerly followed the initial Steam Machine announcement, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about their future. The Steam Deck has proven that Valve can deliver a compelling gaming experience on a Linux-based platform. With the advancements in Proton and the growing SteamOS ecosystem, I believe Steam Machines have the potential to finally carve out a space in the living room.\n\nI remember being excited about the prospect of a console-like PC gaming experience, but the initial Steam Machines fell short of expectations. Now, with the Steam Deck paving the way, I\u2019m hopeful that Valve can learn from the past and deliver a truly compelling Steam Machine experience that bridges the gap between PC and console gaming.\n\nValve\u2019s journey with Steam Machines has been a rollercoaster ride. While the initial launch didn\u2019t meet expectations, Valve\u2019s persistence and strategic shifts, particularly with the success of the Steam Deck, have breathed new life into the concept. With a more mature SteamOS, a vast library of compatible games, and a thriving ecosystem, the future of Steam Machines looks promising. Whether they will become mainstream remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Valve\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of PC gaming is unwavering."

            "article_content": "Gaming laptops aren\u2019t built for the same heavy use as desktops, and their lifespan can be even shorter without proper maintenance. This guide details how I have kept my gaming laptop running at peak performance for years \u2013 and how you can too.\n\nKeep Heat as Low as Possible\n\nHardware degradation over time is inevitable, but heat can significantly speed up the process \u2013 or even cause the components to fail. I don\u2019t just mean overheating issues, as you should try to minimize heat as much as possible. Try to always keep the temperature below 176\u00b0F (or 80\u00b0C) for both the CPU and GPU. Use dedicated apps to check the CPU and GPU temperatures.\n\nImage source: Vecteezy\n\nAlthough there are many ways to decrease PC temperature, using a cooling pad and regularly renewing thermal paste has done wonders for me.\n\nImportance of a Cooling Pad\n\nCooling pads are often recommended for overheating issues, but I believe they are also beneficial for regular use with gaming laptops. Gaming laptops commonly hit temperatures over 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C). Although these temperatures are considered safe, they still contribute to overall component degradation. Cooling pads help further bring down the temperature for even safer use.\n\nThey also offer great support for the laptop by elevating it from the surface, allowing even better airflow compared to using it on a table. You can easily use it on your lap without any discomfort from heat. You don\u2019t need anything fancy, as a quiet cooling pad, like the Kootek Cooling Pad, is enough.\n\nRenewing thermal paste\n\nDon\u2019t wait for the laptop to start showing overheating signs \u2013 renew thermal paste on the CPU and GPU on a set schedule. Recommended laptop maintenance suggests changing the thermal paste every two to three years. However, I prefer to renew it within two years to not risk the laptop running for even a short period without proper thermal transfer. In fact, I have renewed thermal paste four times in the last seven years \u2013 most recently this week.\n\nRenewing thermal paste is an easy process that many people can do on their own. You can bring it to a PC repair shop and have them to help you change the thermal paste for a low fee too.\n\nPerform Regular Maintenance to Keep Laptop Clean\n\nBoth the laptop\u2019s external body and internal components collect dust, crumbs, and grime. Not only are they bad for aesthetics, but they can also lead to heating issues and even short circuits in rare cases.\n\nImage source: Freepik\n\nFollow this maintenance routine to ensure your laptop stays clean both inside and out:\n\nWeekly Cleaning Routine\n\nFirst, tilt your laptop upside down, and gently shake (lightly pat on the back if needed) to remove loose crumbs/debris. A microfiber or a soft lint-free cloth is all you need to clean the laptop. Use the cloth to clean the exterior of the laptop, including the keyboard and the screen. Avoid pressure when cleaning the screen, and clean in a circular motion.\n\nThis is just some light weekly cleaning, so there is no need to worry about hard-to-reach spots \u2013 just clear the visible dirt to prevent it from building up over time.\n\nMonthly Cleaning Routine\n\nYou\u2019ll need a can of compressed air with a fine nozzle for this. Once a month, use the compressed air to blow bursts onto the keyboard and fan vents. Also, use a soft-bristled brush to clean around the vents and eliminate any debris on the keyboard. A soft paintbrush works, but I prefer makeup brushes, as they are softer and more puffy to clean quickly.\n\nIf you are following the weekly routine, you won\u2019t need to do anything special for the screen. However, if there are any stubborn smudges, lightly dampen the microfiber cloth in distilled water to clean it.\n\nYearly Cleaning Routine\n\nYou can do this every six months, but yearly works fine for me, as I strictly follow the weekly and monthly routines. Furthermore, if you are not comfortable with messing around with laptop internals, you can utilize the cleaning service from a PC repair shop.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to open the laptop to get access to all the internals. I recommend following our step-by-step guide on fixing an overheating laptop from the internals. It has all the info to both open and clean the laptop. Personally, I only clean what is visible in front, so there is no need to unscrew and access hidden components. Keep your focus on the fan blades and any dirt on the motherboard.\n\nSave Resources When Playing Games\n\nJust because your laptop can, doesn\u2019t mean you need to run everything at max performance. This will just put extra strain on components, decreasing overall life. Try to optimize your setup with these suggestions to only use the resources you need.\n\nUse Balanced performance mode\n\nBalanced performance is enough for most games and will save resources while running most games that should be capable on your laptop. Go to Windows Settings -> System -> Power & battery, and select Balanced next to Power mode.\n\nMatch game FPS and laptop screen refresh rate\n\nYou should also make sure your game FPS matches the laptop screen refresh rate. Your laptop screen can\u2019t show the FPS beyond its refresh rate, so the extra FPS goes to waste while still using resources. You can use V-Sync or G-Sync/FreeSync (if supported) to force the laptop to sync FPS and the refresh rate.\n\nDisable Turbo Boost whenever possible\n\nFor less CPU-demanding games, I like to disable the turbo boost technology, reducing much of the unnecessary stress on the CPU. Although it can be done from BIOS, I prefer using the Throttlestop app to enable/disable it quickly. Just check the Disable Turbo option.\n\nYou can also check out how to improve the gaming experience on laptops to find more ways to reduce strain on your laptop components for a longer life.\n\nTake Care of the Battery\n\nThe laptop component with the shortest life is the battery, and there is a good chance you\u2019ll have to replace it at least once before other components start showing their age. However, you can still increase the laptop battery\u2019s lifespan with careful maintenance.\n\nIf your laptop supports smart charging that stops charging at 80%, take advantage of it. Access the BIOS and enable it under battery configuration settings, or use the laptop manufacturer\u2019s software.\n\nIf your laptop doesn\u2019t have a smart charging feature, try to keep it between 20% and 80% when not gaming by unplugging it manually. Additionally, don\u2019t let the battery frequently drop to 0%, as it can affect overall battery health.\n\nAs mentioned before, heat is bad for your laptop, especially the battery, as it speeds up the chemical reactions within the battery cells. Make sure you follow the above steps to keep heat to a minimum.\n\nDon\u2019t Try to Go Beyond the Laptop\u2019s Limits\n\nIf you prioritize your laptop\u2019s lifespan over performance, don\u2019t do experimental stuff that the laptop isn\u2019t meant to do. Yes, I am talking about overclocking, whether you are overclocking the CPU, RAM, or GPU.\n\nOverclocking is especially a problem on laptops, due to the limited options to get rid of the extra heat that is generated. On desktops, you can just get some new fans, but that won\u2019t work for laptops. Not only will the overclocking process stress the components, but the extra heat generation will surely speed up the degradation process.\n\nFurthermore, even gaming laptops aren\u2019t built to handle continuous use, unlike desktops. I usually have two- to three-hour gaming sessions, with occasional four- to six-hour sessions. Try to take breaks between sessions, even if it means closing the game and doing light web browsing.\n\nThese maintenance methods will surely extend your gaming laptop\u2019s life and ensure it keeps giving peak performance. Read on to learn about optimizing Windows for gaming performance, as freeing up resources reduces component stress and slows down wear and tear.\n\nImage credit: Vecteezy.

            "article_content": "Machine learning played a prominent role at Amazon Web Services' (AWS) annual in-house exhibition re:Invent \u2013, including when it comes to new hardware. The focus was on the EC2 UltraServers powered by Trainium2 chips and EC2 instances, which are now available. According to AWS, the new Trn2 instances offer 20.8 petaflops of computing power per instance and an up to 40 percent better price-performance ratio compared to the GPU-based EC2 P5 instances.\n\nAnzeige\n\nA Trn2 UltraServer consists of four Trn2 instances that are connected to each other via a NeuronLink connection. This architecture is designed to scale computing power up to 83.2 petaflops to reduce training and inference times for the world's largest AI models. Models with up to one trillion parameters could thus be processed with improved latency.\n\n\"Project Rainier\" for AI clusters\n\nAWS also announced \"Project Rainier\", which combines hundreds of Trainium2 UltraServers into an EC2 UltraCluster, enabling an increase in cluster size compared to existing solutions. These UltraClusters are used in organizations such as Anthropic to train AI models. Anthropic uses them, for example, to optimize Claude models for Amazon Bedrock on Trainium2. This infrastructure should enable customers to efficiently train models with trillions of parameters and use them in real time.\n\nRead also Amazon releases new AI model family \u2013 Nova\n\nAWS emphasized that it is not enough to increase the size of clusters to improve performance. Instead, the new architecture of Trainium2 UltraServers improves data distribution and resource allocation. This reduces the overall training time without encountering traditional network limits.\n\nNew instances with Nvidia Blackwell and outlook\n\nIn addition to the Trainium2 solutions, AWS presented the EC2 P6 instances. They are based on the next generation of Blackwell GPUs from Nvidia. Compared to the current generation, AWS promises up to 2.5 times higher performance and optimization specifically for compute-intensive generative AI applications. AWS sees the P6 instances primarily for applications that require fast response times and high scalability.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAWS has also already announced the upcoming Trainium3 chip as the successor to Trainium2. This will be manufactured using a 3-nanometer process. Compared to its predecessor, it is said to be more energy-efficient and four times more powerful. This will allow customers to iterate models faster and use them in real time. Trainium3 is expected to be available in later versions of the UltraServer.\n\n(nie)"

            "article_content": "The storied Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.28%) is one of the oldest and most reputable stock market indexes. The 30 Dow components are industry-leading blue chip stocks representing their respective stock market sectors. But the Dow has undergone major transformations over the last five years.\n\nThe two latest changes came this year, with Amazon (AMZN 2.94%)replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance in February and Nvidia (NVDA -1.81%) replacing Intel in November.\n\nAmazon and Nvidia wasted no time proving their value in modernizing the Dow, with both components outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.25%) and Dow indexes year to date. But investors care more about where a company is going than where it has been.\n\nHere's why Nvidia stands out as a better buy than Amazon for 2025, and some factors to consider when buying leading growth stocks at all-time highs.\n\nSucceeding together\n\nBefore getting too far into our discussion, it's worth mentioning that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a major customer of Nvidia. So there's certainly a scenario where both companies thrive and post market-beating gains, or slowdowns at AWS trickle down to Nvidia.\n\nOn Dec. 3, Nvidia announced that its latest tech, including its Blackwell architecture for generative artificial intelligence (AI), was coming to AWS. A new computing platform available through AWS Marketplace Private Offers will allow enterprises to build AI models with the support of Nvidia experts. AWS has developed liquid-to-chip cooling across its data centers with a new solution that offers air- and liquid-cooling capabilities for powerful AI supercomputer systems like the Nvidia GB200 NVL72.\n\nNvidia is the undisputed leader in chips for hyperscalers, and AWS is the leading hyperscaler -- commanding roughly the same market share as Microsoft Cloud and Alphabet-owned Google Cloud combined. According to a Nov. 1 report from Synergy Research Group, AWS holds a 31% market share over the cloud market compared to 20% for Microsoft and 13% for Google.\n\nHowever, AWS doesn't have nearly the dominance in cloud as Nvidia does in chips for data centers.\n\nThe better business model\n\nOver its history, Amazon has been a remarkably flexible company, branching into different end markets and enduring several periods of economic uncertainty. The company's network effects, leading cloud position, growing e-commerce business, and combination of diversification and disruption are valid reasons to buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\nAWS' operating income comprised 62% of Amazon's total operating income for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2024. Compared to the same period last year, AWS revenue increased by $12.22 billion, but its operating expenses only increased by $479 million, so nearly all of that revenue gain translated to operating income growth. However, without the contribution from AWS, Amazon simply isn't growing very quickly.\n\nAWS has expanded Amazon far beyond e-commerce and made it a better business, but not in the same way that chips for data centers have been a game changer for Nvidia.\n\nIn Nvidia's recent quarter, which was third-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 27), Nvidia reported $30.77 billion in revenue consisting of $27.64 billion from compute and $3.13 billion from networking. Operating income from the compute and networking segment came in at $22.081 billion -- giving the segment a ridiculously high operating margin of 71.8%. For context, Amazon -- as a whole -- booked $17.41 billion in operating income in its recent quarter. And AWS' margins aren't nearly as high as Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia's gaming and AI PC, professional visualization, and automotive and robotics segments combined for $4.22 billion in revenue. The graphics segment earned just $1.502 billion in operating income.\n\nIt's hard to believe, but five years ago, Nvidia's data center business was smaller than its graphics segment. Whereas today, data center makes up over 85% of Nvidia's revenue and over 90% of its operating income. In the quarter, Nvidia said that cloud service providers made up around 50% of its data center revenue, while the remainder consisted of consumer internet and enterprise companies. These customers (like AWS) are some of the highest-quality customers in the world. They are the exact kind of customers Nvidia wants because they have the financial means to invest through market cycles.\n\nNvidia went from a chip company for graphics to a chip company for data centers. In contrast, Amazon still does many different things, but the best part of its business is AWS. Nvidia has better margins and more growth potential. It has a more commanding market share. And it is a more pure-play investment thesis on data center growth, whereas Amazon's investment thesis crosses more industries and is more complex.\n\nNvidia has a fair valuation\n\nNvidia's biggest risks are a slowdown in AI capital spending or competition coming along and eroding margins. But so far, that hasn't happened. Nvidia has so far been an earnings-driven story. In fact, earnings growth has outpaced the growth in the stock price.\n\nEventually, Nvidia's growth will probably slow down. But until that happens, it's hard to call Nvidia a bubble because the business is delivering real, bottom-line results. This isn't a company that has the potential to do amazing things in the future; rather, it is delivering unbelievable results right now.\n\nBecause Nvidia has been an earnings-driven story, its valuation remains reasonable. Nvidia has a higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and forward P/E ratio than Amazon. But as you can see in the chart, the gap between the valuations of both companies could narrow if Nvidia continues to grow its earnings at a faster pace.\n\nOnly buy Nvidia if you have a long-term mindset\n\nNvidia and Amazon are excellent companies that stand to benefit from higher AI spending. However, competition or a cyclical slowdown could quickly make both companies look more expensive, leading to a steep sell-off.\n\nWhen buying industry-leading growth stocks at all-time highs, it's important to understand that the factors contributing to the record highs could be the same ones leading to a sell-off. Wall Street will waste no time downgrading a stock based solely on its near-term growth prospects. However, the good news is that individual investors don't have to get caught up in the noise and, instead, can focus on the long-term investment thesis.\n\nInvestors interested in Nvidia should continue to monitor its pace of technological advancements and ability to monetize those improvements. Currently, Nvidia is out-innovating its competition, so it can still charge top dollar for its products. Furthermore, its customers are doing so well that they can afford to pay pretty much whatever Nvidia is charging.\n\nNvidia is at the top of its game, and there has yet to be any concrete reason to believe it will change. But if the cycle does turn, there will be signs from Nvidia's top customers like AWS and Meta Platforms. The stock price continues to be driven by earnings growth, which should continue next year.\n\nIn sum, Nvidia has a simpler and more effective business model than Amazon and much better growth, making it the better buy now."

            "article_content": "The patient\u2019s guardian has filed a lawsuit against the boarding home owner. Arlington police say they are investigating.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 Diana Aycox grew up on Maryannes Meadow Drive in Fort Worth and inherited the tidy brick home from her parents.\n\nShe spent her life taking care of other people\u2019s children. When dementia took hold in 2021, a doctor concluded she was mentally incapacitated and unable to care for herself. As a result, she needed to be taken care of by others.\n\n\u201cShe was just really sweet and confused,\u201d her neighbor, Deanna Torres said.\n\nThat\u2019s how Aycox came to live in an Arlington boarding home run by Ireka Hamilton.\n\nHamilton\u2019s name is well known to state regulators. Records show the state sued her after regulators repeatedly found her caring for clients in homes that should have been licensed as assisted living facilities. Two families filed lawsuits \u2013 which were recently settled \u2013 alleging she neglected their loved ones.\n\nNow there are questions \u2013 and a probate court battle \u2013 over how Hamilton came to own Aycox\u2019s home. Advocates say the allegations point to the larger problem of the state failing to adequately protect vulnerable people from financial exploitation.\n\n\u201cYou have unscrupulous actors who realize and capitalize on the fact that people who live in board and care homes are vulnerable to exploitation,\u201d said DJ Maughan, a public health expert and professor at Oklahoma State University.\n\nFor decades, Aycox was a fixture in this neighborhood of small brick homes. She was active in her church\u2019s choir and Bible study group.\n\nIn September 2021, not long after she ended up in the hospital and diagnosed with dementia, she signed a document giving her church pastor the power to make medical decisions.\n\nCourt records show he found the home operated by Hamilton and placed her there. Soon after, he resigned as power of attorney.\n\n\u201cHer church friends were initially of the understanding that she was getting good care and Ireka was helping her,\u201d Andrea Casanova, who later became Aycox\u2019s court-appointed guardian, told WFAA.\n\nIn February 2022, Hamilton filed what\u2019s known as a \u201csuggestion of need\u201d in Tarrant County probate court.\n\n\u201cShe has been deemed mentally incapacitated and cannot take care of herself,\u201d Hamilton wrote.\n\nHamilton also noted that Aycox owned a house, and she was \u201cunable to pay for both her care and her mortgage.\u201d She checked a box stating that she was Aycox\u2019s \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nCasanova told WFAA that those court records showed that Hamilton knew that Aycox lacked the mental competence to make financial decisions such as selling her house.\n\nIn filing a suggestion of need, Hamilton triggered the court\u2019s oversight, which would later lead to the discovery that she had come to own Aycox\u2019s home.\n\nThe court appointed an investigator to investigate Aycox\u2019s situation. In August 2022, the court appointed attorney Bob Leonard to be Aycox's guardian ad litem. He met with Aycox and began to negotiate with her lender and discussed selling the property, according to court records.\n\nOn Aug. 30, 2022, he got word that the house had been sold for $120,000. He\u2019d soon learn Hamilton bought it.\n\nAccording to the seller\u2019s closing statement, about $76,300 went to pay off the existing loan on the property. Aycox was to receive about $42,000.\n\nLeonard quickly filed paperwork with the county to prevent Hamilton from selling the house.\n\n\u201cDiana did not know what she was signing,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cI do not even know if she knew to read the contract.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 12, 2022 -- 13 days after buying the house -- Hamilton put the home up for sale for $225,000, records show.\n\nRecords show Leonard told the court he researched Hamilton\u2019s history. He found that she had multiple lawsuits, including suits for foreclosure where she had lived, one for breach of contract and two separate filings for bankruptcy.\n\nThat same month, Leonard filed paperwork asking that a guardian be appointed. He suggested that Casanova be selected as that guardian.\n\nIn carrying out her duties, Casanova told WFAA that she went to see Aycox at the boarding home.\n\n\u201cThe staff originally did not want to let us enter the home even though we had a court order,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cI was able to visit with Diana for about maybe 10 minutes at the most until they came back in, and they wouldn't let me speak with her privately.\u201d\n\nThe court also appointed an attorney to represent Aycox. That attorney told the court that Aycox had given power of attorney to Hamilton so that she could \u201ctake care\u201d of her property and finances. He told the court that she \u201cfeels she is being taken care of and has people like Ms. Hamilton to help her.\u201d\n\nIn October 2023, the probate judge appointed Casanova as Diana\u2019s temporary guardian. Casanova said Aycox was there during the hearing.\n\n\u201cYou could see, she didn't even understand that she was being taken advantage of, that every piece of personal and sentimental property she owned was gone, and that her only asset that could actually pay for her care was taken away from her by a predator,\u201d Casanova said.\n\nCasanova said she got an emergency order removing Aycox from Hamilton\u2019s care.\n\nThe attorney then asked Hamilton for an accounting of Aycox\u2019s finances and requested that she turn over Aycox\u2019s property.\n\nHamilton sent a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $42,000, which records show was the amount Aycox was to have been paid on the house.\n\nCasanova said when she tried to cash it, she found the cashier\u2019s check had been canceled.\n\nIn February, Casanova sued Hamilton on behalf of Aycox, alleging fraud. Court records show that constables have not been able to locate Hamilton to serve the lawsuit. In one case, she told a deputy constable over the phone that she did not want to \u201creceive the papers without her attorney\u2019s approval.\u201d However, she would not provide the attorney\u2019s information, the deputy constable wrote.\n\nAround the same time that Casanova filed the lawsuit, neighbors saw activity at the home. People were moving in.\n\n\u201cI noticed there were a lot of medical vans, elderly people being pushed in wheelchairs,\u201d said neighbor Derrick Moon.\n\nAnother neighbor said she was told by the people moving in that the \u201cproperty is now a group home.\u201d\n\nCasanova got a restraining order, and Hamilton agreed to move the tenants out.\n\nCasanova told WFAA that Hamilton denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cShe denies that this was financial exploitation of an elderly person and (said) that Diana did it of her own free will,\u201d Casanova said, referring to the sale of the house.\n\nWFAA reached Hamilton by phone. She declined to answer our questions.\n\nThere are similar questions about another boarding home operator named Regla Becquer.\n\nShe\u2019s under criminal indictment on a murder charge in the overdose death of a client. She\u2019s also charged with endangerment over allegations that she neglected another client. Her bail has been set at $1.5 million.\n\nRecords show she and her family gained control of the homes, cars and accounts of several clients.\n\nIn one case, Karen Walker signed over her \u201centire estate\u201d to Becquer. That\u2019s according to a one-paragraph will dated only 19 days before Walker died of heart disease.\n\nBecquer inherited an estate worth $331,00 that included Walker\u2019s Arlington home, money and car, court records show.\n\n\u201cThese predators see the vulnerable population as an easy target and they really are a perfect victim,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cThey can't remember what they said, what they did. They're completely reliant on these people to provide them safe shelter, food.\u201d\n\nCasanova reported the fraud allegation to the Arlington Police Department.\n\nPolice told WFAA the case remains open and they\u2019re investigating.\n\n\u201cThis is a community issue,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cIt can happen to any one of us any one of our families, any one of our grandparents, and it's a prevailing issue, and it shouldn't have to happen.\u201d\n\nThis past October marked three years since Aycox lived in the home on Maryannes Meadow.\n\nHamilton still legally owns the home, Tarrant County records show.\n\nAycox, now 76, lives in a memory care unit in Tarrant County. Her care is being paid for by Medicaid.\n\nThe house sits empty while the legal battle over the house continues."

            "article_content": "We have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nRead More: NASA report finds no evidence that UFOs are extraterrestrial\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off."

At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

            "article_content": "Dec. 7\u2014The arcane red light reportedly throbbed in the sky above Albuquerque's South Valley for about an hour in October 2023, caught on camera by a bewildered man who says, \"I've never seen a light that bright.\"\n\nA solid, bright orb drifted with angular elegance in February over Jal, near the state's southern border, startling an observer. As the nighttime scene unfolded near a Lea County oilfield, the observer reported feeling like the air was astir with a leaden static.\n\nVideos of these episodes of stargazing turning bizarre in a state known for enigmatic nighttime occurrences are among those catalogued by a popular UFO reporting platform and cellphone app operated by Enigma Labs. The company, founded in 2020, has issued a new report naming New Mexico its top state for sightings per capita, with several strange videos submitted this year showing lights over Albuquerque.\n\n\"New Mexico is a focal point for UFOs,\" said Alejandro Rojas, a consultant for Enigma Labs. \"But it's really interesting that New Mexico has really popped up in our data lately as being heads above the leader when it comes to submissions per person.\"\n\nThe data set comes as an obsession with unidentified flying objects continues nationwide, even after a congressionally mandated Pentagon report released in February found no evidence the federal government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and no evidence UFO sightings are signs of aliens visiting Earth.\n\nA Pentagon office, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, was created in 2022 to track what the government calls UAPs \u2014 unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 with 757 reported to the office between May and June of this year, according to a November report.\n\nStill, people continue to see things.\n\nIn the fast-paced digital age, Enigma Labs provides an online trove of oddities \u2014 an endless proliferation of sights and sounds.\n\nThe private company offers a website and cellphone app allowing UFO enthusiasts \u2014 and regular people who believe they have encountered the anomalous \u2014 to upload videos and photos with descriptions, aggregating and crowdsourcing the data.\n\n\"Like millions of ants crawling around us,\" the individual who spotted something in Jal said in the Enigma post.\n\n\"I hate to say it. Those are ships!\" gushed a man who claimed he was witnessing alien plasma ships in Gallup near the Arizona border.\n\nAll told, the Land of Enchantment's rate of 12.2 Enigma entries per 100,000 people is far higher than the next closest states of Nevada and Arizona, which boast submission rates of around 9 per 100,000 residents, according to the company.\n\nUFO researchers have theories about the large volume of entries here, citing how alien mythology and lore have been woven into the state's cultural fabric for decades. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, 1,708 sightings have been reported in New Mexico, most of them since 2000.\n\n\"We have a relatively small population, but the one thing we do have, and I think this factors into your question, is a preponderance of military operations areas and scientific development areas \u2014 Los Alamos [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] \u2014 a rich history of sightings,\" said David Marler, a longtime UFO researcher who lives in the Albuquerque area and serves as the executive director of a new UFO records center in Rio Rancho.\n\nWhile the Roswell incident has long been a dominant talker, Marler said there are many other intriguing reports of encounters over the last 75 years in New Mexico: April 1964, Socorro; April 1964, La Madera; March 1950, Farmington; November 1957, Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nA prevalent state for sightings\n\nEnigma Labs runs a New Mexico page that archives and cataloging sightings, rating and categorizing videos.\n\nAs of late November, the company had received 278 New Mexico sightings directly, according to an email from Rojas. Combined with publicly available sources, it has 3,531 total sightings in New Mexico archived.\n\n\"When you go back and look at early magazine reports and military reports going back to the 1950s, there were magazine articles showing maps where a lot of UFO sightings. One of the most prevalent states was New Mexico,\" Marler said.\n\nA fascination with the unknown has long gripped New Mexico. It's a state renowned \u2014 thanks to its dry climate, low population density and sprawling deserts \u2014 for its night sky viewing.\n\n\"One of the most spectacular reports is from last August. A witness said they were watching TV when they caught this weird object out of the corner of their eye. They were able to get a few seconds of video before it disappeared behind nearby trees,\" Rojas said of video footage taken in Chaparral, a Southern New Mexico community near El Paso.\n\nThe video shows a floating gray object with a television heard in the background.\n\nNew Mexico sightings logged into the Enigma Labs database break down like this: Albuquerque, 754; Las Cruces, 159; Roswell, 143; Alamogordo, 107; and Deming, 95. Rojas said eight sightings have been reported to Enigma from Santa Fe and one in Los Alamos.\n\nTwo friends were driving along San Mateo Boulevard in Albuquerque late one night in February when a moving craft in the sky lit up with lights flashing in a diagonal pattern.\n\nIn an episode that lasted about a minute, \"it went from a long craft to a triangle shaped craft with only 3 lights, and then to something that resembled a helicopter with one light, and quickly disappeared,\" states the caption on the for the video posted to Enigma Lab's site.\n\nNew records center in Rio Rancho\n\nTens of thousands of case files, among the earliest dated in 1947, are housed in Rio Rancho. They relay the stories of witnesses, couched in the diction of reports written by law enforcement officers or members of the military as far back as 70 years ago.\n\nThe files can be pored over at the new National UFO Historical Records Center, a facility that recently opened and can be visited by appointment.\n\n\"It's the largest historical archive ever assembled on the history of the subject in the history of the United States,\" said Marler, the director.\n\nThe volunteer-operated research center, at 1301 Nicklaus Drive SE, opened in October.\n\nIt holds rolls of decades-old microfilm, hundreds of thousands of audio recordings, an exhaustive library of foreign and domestic magazines, newsletters and periodicals \u2014 all dealing with reports of mysterious craft spotted from Earth. Some 2,000 books line the shelves, along with an interminable supply of UFO investigations and intrigue, with tales and testimony for those who believe.\n\n\"It's really set up for academics and for the general public who have a serious interest in the subject. It's not for the casual enthusiast per se,\" Marler said.\n\nThe center has files from the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, records kept by the largest citizen organization in the U.S. devoted to cataloguing UFO reports from 1956 until 1980, the year the group published its final newsletter. The center is currently digitizing the files for the first time ever.\n\nAlso in its possession are collections from the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, once based in Alamogordo, with tens of thousands of case files \u2014 as well as collections from the UFO Research Committee of Akron, especially active in the 1950s in Ohio.\n\n\"We're literally getting these holdings in from all different points of the globe,\" Marler said.\n\nWell-documented cases beyond Roswell\n\nAcademics of unexplained phenomena have descended on the Land of Enchantment for a beloved UFO festival in Roswell. But the mythic narratives don't go dry there.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. That always dominates the conversation and there are better, more well-documented cases on file,\" Marler said, referring to the 1947 crash of a craft near the Southern New Mexico city. While many believe it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft, the federal government has said it was a secret military balloon aimed at detecting Soviet atomic bomb tests.\n\nMarler said many New Mexicans aren't aware of other cases within their own state.\n\nIn November of 1957, a UFO was tracked on radar and \"violated\" the perimeter of the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, hovering around restricted sites, according to reports Marler has reviewed. He said the Rio Rancho records center has the original case file on it from \"Project Blue Book,\" the Air Force name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969.\n\n\"Two Air Force personnel were observing it with binoculars at night. They described it as looking like a car standing vertically on end with a white light emanating out of the bottom. The object had the ability to hover, to rapidly accelerate, to move slowly,\" Marler said.\n\nThe Socorro incident in April 1964 \u2014 unresolved in the Air Force investigations that transpired at the time and widely reported by New Mexico news publications \u2014 was observed by local police Officer Lonnie Zamora, who claimed he witnessed two humanoids beside a shiny, egg-shaped object that later rose into the air from an arroyo as flames belched from the rising craft.\n\nMarler said he had believed the Socorro case was an isolated one. In the last year, however, he received the APRO files and came across an account published in the Santa Fe New Mexican of a similar report four days after the Socorro incident from La Madera, a remote community north of Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County.\n\n\"Eyewitness Recounts Passage of 'Thing' Burning in Sky,\" reads a headline in the April 28, 1964, edition of The New Mexican.\n\n\"It talks about Socorro, but it talks about a landing in La Madera ... and it described an egg-shaped object,\" Marler said. \"... New Mexico State Police [investigated and] drew a detailed diagram of the landing site and took pictures and colored photographs.\""

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought. It challenges researchers to question established theories and explore new paradigms. This shift in thinking could lead to revolutionary discoveries across various fields, from astrophysics to quantum mechanics.\n\nTo illustrate the potential impact of this paradigm shift, consider the following table :\n\nScientific Field Current Understanding Potential Paradigm Shift Cosmology Big Bang Theory Multi-dimensional universe models Particle Physics Standard Model Unified field theories Quantum Mechanics Copenhagen Interpretation Many-worlds interpretation Astrophysics Dark Matter/Energy Modified gravity theories\n\nAs scientists continue to probe the mysteries of the universe, unexpected discoveries are reshaping our understanding of reality. From new types of materials that could change our lives to fundamental questions about existence itself, the frontiers of science are expanding rapidly.\n\nThe paradox of the universe\u2019s existence serves as a humbling reminder of how much we have yet to learn. It invites us to embrace uncertainty, question our assumptions, and continue exploring the cosmic tapestry that surrounds us. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the Higgs field and primordial black holes, we may uncover truths that reshape our understanding of reality itself."

ToW, which is a part of the foundation set up by Anil Pradhan, a civil engineer, currently operates in Odisha and Telangana.\"Once children are exposed to advanced topics, only then will they be able to think big,\" feels Nihar, who said there were no such facilities in his childhood.Among the practical projects exposing rural children to science are satellite launch, 3D printing and town planning, among others. At least 1,200 students from Satyananda High School, Radhanath Bidyapith, Radhanath ME School, all in Soro, Maudamani High School and Banka Bihari Nodal ME School in Barahapur, and Gopinath High School, Kudei. \"The project was easy to implement as we got a cluster of schools within a 5-km radius,\" said Nihar.For the children, the vehicles are a big attraction as they are being taught in stages. \"First, we had an introductory class and teachers in the vehicle explained about electricity and cleared our doubts,\" said Archana Jena, a Class IX student of Gopinath Govt High School.In-charge headmistress, Laxmi Kumari Agarwal, said children don't have to memorise science concepts as the teachers on the vehicles are explaining it to them. \"Also, the school does not have to spend on such infrastructure. Children are happy that they are getting practical knowledge, and many want to participate,\" said Agarwal.A finale will be held later this month in which children will demonstrate a science project made by them. \"After coming to know about the tinker vehicles, more schools in the locality want to participate. I am planning to expand the initiative before the finale,\" said Nihar."

            "article_content": "By Amal Noureldin\n\nDriving through downtown Dallas, you might see a striking banner hanging at the U-turn bridge, near the Walnut Hill exit on Central Expressway (US 75): \u201cStop Fluoridation!\u201d Below it, other banners demand action and warn of supposed dangers.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time fluoride has been at the center of public debate.\n\nSince 1951, fluoride has been added to community water supplies in many countries to prevent tooth decay. Fluoridation started as an observation, then an idea that ended as a scientific revolution 50 years later.\n\nFluoridation is the controlled careful addition of a precise amount of fluoride to community water systems to enhance dental health, ensuring it remains safe without causing systemic health side effects.\n\nThe practice has been hailed as one of the \u201c10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nBut with Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a vocal opponent of fluoridation of water supplies, being tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, this progress is under threat.\n\nI am a clinical professor specializing in caries management, with over 30 years of experience in preventing and treating early decay. In my view, it is crucial to rely on evidence-based practices and research that have consistently shown fluoride to be a cornerstone of dental health, benefiting millions without adverse effects.\n\nFluoride in the water supply\n\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in water, soil and even certain foods. Its role in oral health was first recognized in the early 20th century when researchers observed lower rates of tooth decay in communities with naturally high levels of fluoride in their water.\n\nIn 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first city in the world to intentionally fluoridate its water supply. This decision came after thorough discussions with Dr H Trendley Dean, head of the dental hygiene unit at the National Institutes of Health at the time, and other public health organizations. The Michigan Department of Health approved adding fluoride to the public water supply the following year.\n\nThe city was chosen due to its low natural fluoride levels, a large population of school-age children, and proximity to Muskegon, which served as a control city. After 11 years, the results were remarkable: Cavity rates among children in Grand Rapids born after fluoridation began dropped by over 60%. This scientific breakthrough transformed dental care, turning tooth decay into a preventable condition for the first time in history.\n\nBy 2008, over 72% of the U.S. population \u2013 over 200 million Americans \u2013 using public water systems had access to fluoridated water.\n\nThis scientific breakthrough transformed dental care, turning tooth decay into a preventable condition for the first time in history.\n\nFluoride is naturally present in most water sources, but typically at concentrations too low to prevent tooth decay. By adjusting the fluoride level to the recommended 0.7 milligrams per liter, equivalent to about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel, it becomes sufficient to strengthen tooth enamel.\n\nBenefits of fluoride for tooth health\n\nThe science is simple: Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel, the protective outer layer of teeth, by promoting remineralization. It also makes teeth more resistant to the acids produced by bacteria in the mouth. This helps prevent cavities, a problem that remains widespread even in modern societies.\n\nFluoridated water has been extensively studied, and its benefits are well documented. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, water fluoridation reduces cavities by about 25% across all age groups. It\u2019s a public health measure that works passively \u2013 every sip of water helps protect your teeth, without requiring you to change your behavior.\n\nThis is especially important for vulnerable populations. Low-income communities often face barriers to accessing dental care or fluoride products like toothpaste. By fluoridating water, communities provide a safety net, ensuring that everyone benefits regardless of their circumstances.\n\nEconomically, it\u2019s a smart investment. Research shows that for every dollar spent on fluoridation, communities save about $20 in dental treatment costs. These savings come from fewer fillings, extractions and emergency visits \u2013 expenses that disproportionately affect low-income communities.\n\nOpposition to fluoridation\n\nDespite its benefits, water fluoridation is not without controversy. Opponents often argue that it infringes on personal choice \u2013 after all, most people don\u2019t get to opt out of drinking community water. Others raise concerns about potential health risks, such as fluorosis, bone issues or thyroid problems.\n\nFluorosis, a condition caused by excessive fluoride exposure during childhood, is often cited as a reason for alarm. However, in most cases, it manifests as mild white spots on teeth and is not harmful. Severe fluorosis is rare in areas with regulated fluoride levels.\n\nWhat about other health risks? Decades of research, including large-scale reviews by expert panels from around the world as well as the World Health Organization, have found no credible evidence linking fluoridation to serious health problems when fluoride levels are kept within recommended limits. In fact, the fluoride concentration in drinking water is carefully monitored to balance safety and effectiveness.\n\nThe CDC oversees the monitoring of fluoride levels in community water systems across the United States. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency establishes a safety standard of 2 milligrams per liter to prevent mild or moderate dental fluorosis.\n\nStill, the debate continues, fueled by misinformation and mistrust in public health initiatives.\n\nIt\u2019s important to separate legitimate concerns from unfounded claims and rely on the overwhelming body of evidence supporting fluoridation\u2019s safety.\n\nFluoride alternatives\n\nFor those who prefer to avoid fluoride, there are alternatives to consider. But they come with challenges.\n\nFluoride-free toothpaste is one option, but it is less effective at preventing cavities compared with fluoride-containing products. Calcium-based treatments, like hydroxyapatite toothpaste, are gaining popularity as a fluoride alternative, though research on their effectiveness is still limited.\n\nDiet plays a crucial role too. Cutting back on sugary snacks and drinks can significantly reduce the risk of cavities. Incorporating foods like crunchy vegetables, cheese and yogurt into your diet can help promote oral health by stimulating saliva production and providing essential nutrients that strengthen tooth enamel.\n\nHowever, these lifestyle changes require consistent effort and education \u2013 something not all people or communities have access to.\n\nCommunity programs like dental sealant initiatives can also help, especially for children. Sealants are thin coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of teeth, preventing decay in high-risk areas. While effective, these programs are more resource-intensive and can\u2019t replicate the broad, passive benefits of water fluoridation.\n\nUltimately, alternatives exist, but they place a greater burden on people and might not address the needs of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nShould fluoridation be a personal choice?\n\nThe argument that water fluoridation takes away personal choice is one of the most persuasive stances against its use. Why not leave fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash, giving people the freedom to use it or not, some argue.\n\nThis perspective is understandable, but it overlooks the broader goals of public health. Fluoridation is like adding iodine to salt or vitamin D to milk. These are measures that prevent widespread health issues in a simple, cost-effective way. Such interventions aren\u2019t about imposing choices; they\u2019re about providing a baseline of protection for everyone.\n\nWithout fluoridated water, low-income communities would bear the brunt of increased dental disease. Children, in particular, would suffer more cavities, leading to pain, missed school days and costly treatments. Public health policies aim to prevent these outcomes while balancing individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nFor those who wish to avoid fluoride, alternatives like bottled or filtered water are available. At the same time, policymakers should continue to ensure that fluoridation levels are safe and effective, addressing concerns transparently to build trust.\n\nAs debates about fluoride continue, the main question is how to best protect everyone\u2019s oral health. While removing fluoride might appeal to those valuing personal choice, it risks undoing decades of progress against tooth decay.\n\nWhether through fluoridation or other methods, oral health remains a public health priority. Addressing it requires thoughtful, evidence-based solutions that ensure equity, safety and community well-being.\n\nAmal Noureldin is Clinical Professor of Cariology, Prevention and Restorative Dentistry, Texas A&M University.\n\nThe Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/water-fluoridation-helps-prevent-tooth-decay-how-growing-opposition-threatens-a-70-year-old-health-practice-230504\n\n\u00a9 The Conversation"
