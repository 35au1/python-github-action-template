            "article_content": "When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica's film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \"Avatar\" franchise and the \"Quiet Place\" movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \"nonhuman\" sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they're now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it's easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they've seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Florida using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government's official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America's alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nYou may also like: What Medicaid acceptance looks like at Florida substance use treatment centers\n\nIgorZh // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

            "article_content": "Google, Apple, Samsung, and practically every other big tech firm are promising a future where AI will take over your phone and computer. However, as it currently stands, newfangled AI assistants aren\u2019t as intelligent as their name suggests. Anthropic\u2014the makers of the Claude chatbot\u2014has a new tool that promises to give any assistant access to any app. If the future truly is based on \u201cagentic AI,\u201d then this model may be the way that Apple Intelligence or Gemini will collect the data from any of your devices\u2019 apps.\n\nThe tool is called the Model Context Protocol, which Anthropic said on Monday it was making open source and free to use for any developer. This protocol will create an information channel between a data source, even app data, and an AI assistant. This is designed for use by AI agents like Anthropic\u2019s Claude desktop app. Anthropic said this connection is \u201csecure,\u201d since\u2014instead of exposing their app\u2019s data\u2014third-party developers can instead build a \u201cMCP client,\u201d AKA a separate AI application, to connect to their private servers.\n\nWhile this ostensibly could be used by companies to allow any AI to access internal data more easily, it may also offer a new standard for how apps offer up their prized data to AI assistants. So far, AI apps like Google\u2019s Gemini on both Android and iOS can access the tech giant\u2019s own Workspace apps, so long as users give it permission. This means it can dig through your Gmail to surface some lost missives or turn any text reservations into an event on Google Calendar. Currently, Gemini doesn\u2019t have access to third-party apps except through extensions.\n\nAnthropic head of Claude relations, Alex Albert, claimed that developers would normally have to work directly with Google or any other AI assistant developer to create a custom connection between the AI and its data. MCP proclaims it solves that issue by enabling a free protocol that could work between the AI assistant and any app or data source.\n\nAlbert demoed Claude working directly with GitHub to make a new repository using MCP. He claimed that with MCP, it took \u201cless than an hour\u201d to build the AI-to-app integration. The company shared some repositories of sample MCP servers that it claims should help developers get started.\n\nHere's a quick demo using the Claude desktop app, where we've configured MCP: Watch Claude connect directly to GitHub, create a new repo, and make a PR through a simple MCP integration. Once MCP was set up in Claude desktop, building this integration took less than an hour. pic.twitter.com/xseX89Z2PD \u2014 Alex Albert (@alexalbert__) November 25, 2024\n\nWhile the protocol is open source, Anthropic still promoted how the most recent Claude 3.5 Sonnet model was better for creating these data channels between servers and the AI. Otherwise, Anthropic said this tool will replace today\u2019s \u201cfragmented\u201d integrations with something more \u201csustainable.\u201d So far, Anthropic said coding software companies Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have onboarded MCP for its AI integrations.\n\nApple has promised similar cross-app AI functionality for Apple Intelligence, eventually. That feature, alongside a rejuvenated Siri, could arrive in early spring next year. The Cupertino, California company\u2019s famously secure walled garden may not have a place for MCP, but other, smaller AI agent developers may be eyeing this or any other similar protocol.\n\nEither way, the major AI developers will be putting pressure on app makers to incorporate ways for AI assistants to access app data. While Apple claims its private cloud compute will keep all your personal data safe, we\u2019ll have to see if any of this open-handed data transfer proves yet another privacy SNAFU."

Announced on November 25, Teleport by Varjo is a mobile app that uses AI to construct high-resolution 3D scans without specialized equipment. The company claims the app is the first to allow the VR scanning with just a smartphone.\n\nThe Teleport app uses generative AI built with NVIDIA GPUs to create virtual reality content from a smartphone. In an interview with Digital Camera World, the company explained that the app uses AI to create a representation from a series of images. The app doesn\u2019t require LiDAR, but iPhones with the technology can use it for enhanced results, Varjo noted.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe app walks users through scanning a location, creating 3D scenes that can then be viewed on a computer, smartphone, or with a virtual reality headset. At launch, the app is available for iPhone and iPad and requires iOS 17 or later.\n\nUnlike Apple\u2019s spatial video, the Teleport photos shared by Varjo allow viewers to move within the space, looking between objects and taking in the room from different viewing angles. Spatial video, on the other hand, captures some depth but leaves the viewer \u201cstanding\u201d in the same spot.\n\nAccording to Varjo, scanning a scene in 3D took around five to ten minutes in beta testing. The company says that 2,000 professionals helped test the beta version of the Teleport app, creating a library of online Teleport scans. The app both reduces the time and complexity involved with full 3D captures, Varjo says, with commercial uses like construction, inspection or training as well as personal applications like saving a view of your wedding venue to relive in VR later.\n\nThe scans also allow for measuring the space from the 3D scans, including a rescaling tool for more accurate measurements. The company notes the measuring option isn\u2019t designed for high-precision engineering, but can prove helpful for applications like design.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile the app aims to create a lower entry into the field of VR and 3D scans, the Teleport app requires a subscription that starts at $30 / \u20ac24 / AU$ 46. Still, the cost is significantly lower than the price of pro-grade 3D VR cameras, or the cost of Canon\u2019s unique dual optics for the R mount. The app, however, is designed for scanning places, where VR cameras can also capture 3D video.\n\nWhile pro-grade VR 3D equipment isn\u2019t new, the growth of the technology has arguably been slow, as the VR headsets that deliver the most full experience are far from as widespread as smartphones and laptops. The high cost of the cameras required for such scans also likely played a role, which means a lower entry point like the Telephoto app could potentially spark some growth.\n\nNot a fan of AI?

You can opt out anytime. See all of our newsletters\n\nThis sophisticated new suite of features includes the Art Basel Companion and the Art Basel Lens, marking the first application of Microsoft\u2019s A.I. computer vision technology at a global art fair. Visitors will be able to scan artworks to get instant information about the pieces, the artists and the galleries showcasing them, and the app will additionally connect to their social networks so they can share their thoughts, impressions and hot takes as they browse. It\u2019s a step into the future of storytelling\u2014one that potentially expands the possibilities of user-generated content for the mega-fair.\n\nWhile a slew of startups have mostly fizzled out in their efforts to integrate data analysis, A.I. tools and real-time user feedback into art fairs and gallery visits, this partnership between two giants of their respective industries promises to squash any remaining competition. One streamlined platform will cover it all, according to the fair: transparency, interactivity and access to art\u2014at the Art Basel fairs, that is.\n\nThis artificially intelligent art fair companion will launch as a pilot in Art Basel Miami Beach\u2019s Nova and Survey sectors, which are the fair\u2019s hotspots of ultra-contemporary art and historical presentation, respectively. The goal? To make it easier for collectors to discover new voices and delve into museum-quality research presentations with a digital nudge in the right direction.\n\nWhen Observer asked how the app would improve the experience of the fair for visitors and how, at the same time, it could support galleries, Art Basel CEO Noah Horowitz said Art Basel Lens would let people on both sides navigate the fairs and shows across the associated cities in a much more dynamic, intuitive, and interactive way. \u201cIt is aligned with our efforts to continuously enhance the experience for established collectors and regular fairgoers, but also to create entry points for audiences who may be new to our platform,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s also about creating more opportunities to elevate our galleries and their artists and helping them reach untapped audiences.\u201d\n\nThe new app also includes personalized itinerary planning and Calendar Sync\u2014features that will let users RSVP to Art Basel events with the app and sync them with to their personal calendars. It also aims to simplify the exploration of partner benefits and offers during the show, making the whole experience a little more fluid.\n\n\u201cOur partnership is not just about technology,\u201d Microsoft VP Steve Clayton added. \u201cIt\u2019s about unlocking opportunities for deeper connections with artists and galleries\u2014and providing unique insights and discoveries for attendees.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Flickers of light dance within the fireplace of the Sparkford Inn\u2019s dining room, the warmth overshadowed by rumors of ghosts lingering in the shadows. A team of paranormal investigators arrive one misty March evening to search for a giggling boy whom many guests have reportedly seen darting around the bar, across the dining room, and playing in the pool room. Witnesses have described him as about seven years old, dressed in scorched rags, and bearing burn marks\u2014features that suggest he is no ordinary child. He is, they claim, a ghost.\n\nCaroline McKendrick, lead investigator at Somerset Paranormal Investigators UK (SPI UK), a group that has been probing paranormal phenomena since 2012, says that reports of the boy often coincide with unexplained events. \u201cSeveral objects were mysteriously knocked off the kitchen counter, and the dishwasher switched on by itself, even when no one was nearby,\u201d McKendrick says. For years, staff and guests alike have reported strange occurrences: whispers in empty rooms, objects moving on their own, and other ghostly figures, including a domineering man and a woman who frequents Room No. 6.\n\nThese accounts, along with a local urban legend about the Inn\u2019s haunted past, convinced the six members of SPI UK to investigate. Tucked away in the small village of Somerset in southwest England, the Sparkford Inn dates back to the late Middle Ages. Over the centuries, it has served as a stopover for horse-drawn coaches, a popular lodging place for visitors, and a meeting point for local hunters. Today, it\u2019s a cozy hotel and pub. McKendrick and company arrived here with the goal of not only cataloging these apparitions, but proving they\u2019re full-bodied spirits, which are interactive entities that can produce physical effects and respond to human contact.\n\nFor the investigators, the stakes are high. The popularity of shows like Ghost Hunters and Paranormal Witness have fueled a fascination with the supernatural. But for SPI UK, it\u2019s more than a trend, it\u2019s a pursuit for real answers. Tracking down the elusive ghosts at the Sparkford Inn will put their skills and equipment to the test. Capturing tangible evidence of the paranormal would be a major breakthrough, advancing ghost hunting as a legitimate field of study\u2014far beyond mere entertainment or pseudoscience.\n\nFollowing McKendrick through the Inn\u2019s dimly lit corridors, the investigators are carrying large cases of technical equipment. Their toolkit includes electromagnetic field meters (EFMs) and thermal imaging cameras. While none of the team members are formally trained scientists, they bring many years of hands-on experience to their investigations, approaching cases with what they consider to be scientific rigor. Paranormal investigations, they say, follow a structured process that includes on-site visits, interviews with witnesses, and data collection. Afterward, the team analyzes the data for patterns and anomalies, like reviewing audio recordings for electronic voice phenomena.\n\nAlamy\n\nTo investigate the boy spirit, the team relies on their tried-and-tested methods, tuning their approach to encourage communication. They\u2019ve brought a teddy bear, play balls, and a toy clock to lure the young boy ghost into contact.\n\n\u201cYou communicate with the child\u2019s spirit the way you would with living children,\u201d says Donna Lalla, a paranormal investigator on the SPI UK team. Lalla is cordial and soft-spoken with short silver-gray hair and glasses. She tries to bring a nurturing energy to the team, especially for investigations involving children. \u201cYou encourage play, you start a nursery rhyme. You start singing \u201cRing-Around-the Rosie\u201d and wait for the young ghost to pick up the rhyme,\u201d Lalla continues. She begins to hum the tune, hoping the young ghost joins in.\n\nEveryone waits.\n\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf\n\nDespite their best efforts, the team has yet to find convincing proof of a ghost. They partly blame their equipment, which is powerful, but not exactly designed for paranormal investigations. Electromagnetic Field detectors (EMFs), for example, detect electrical-wiring issues in the workplace or at home, and thermal-imaging cameras identify heat signatures in construction and firefighting. Still, the investigators persist, optimizing the tools they have, hungry for a breakthrough.\n\nThe idea of a realm between life and death\u2014where spirits linger and interact with the living\u2014has fascinated humankind across cultures and centuries. This belief in ghosts, spirits, and the supernatural has deep roots in ancient cultures, with references found in Egyptian tomb texts, Greek epics like The Odyssey, and early Chinese ghost stories.\n\nIn 1882, paranormal investigations took on more scientific undertones when a group of scholars and intellectuals, from physicists to journalists, founded The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London, the first organization dedicated to the scientific study of paranormal and supernatural phenomena. The SPR aimed to apply scientific methods and principles to the study of paranormal and supernatural phenomena, covering telepathy, mediumship, and apparitions.\n\nThen the American Society for Psychical Research emerged in 1884 when physicist Sir William Barrett persuaded authoritative scientific figures and intellectuals\u2014such as the Scottish-born American inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, and William James, the father of American psychology\u2014that it was vital to apply the scientific method to psychical phenomena. James himself dove headfirst into investigating mediums, attending s\u00e9ances. His aim was twofold and conflicting by today\u2019s standards: to understand the depths of human consciousness and to explore the possibility that consciousness might transcend the physical body, potentially explaining life after death itself.\n\nAs these groups evolved, so did the tools they employed. Early ghost hunters relied primarily on observational methods and interviews . They would conduct s\u00e9ances, monitor mediums, and document irregular phenomena in detail\u2014for example table movements or unexplained sounds during s\u00e9ances. As technology advanced, investigators began incorporating new instruments and adapting them to suit their needs.\n\n\u201cSpirits need tremendous amounts of energy to penetrate the sphere of the living,\u201d explains Lalla, adjusting an EMF meter as the team prepares for the night\u2019s investigation. Today, at the Sparkford Inn, the SPI UK team brings a range of these tools into the field. They hope their handheld EMF devices will detect spikes in electromagnetic energy, which they believe might signal the presence of spirits.\n\nStav Dimitropoulos\n\nA few moments later in the dimly lit corridor, Lalla scans the room with a thermal imaging camera, looking for heat signatures that might suggest an unaccounted presence. Nearby, another team member positions motion sensors near an antique rocking chair that, according to reports, has mysteriously moved in the past. The faint buzz of a Geiger counter fills the air, its needle steady but poised to detect any spikes in radiation\u2014a phenomenon some link to psychic activity.\n\nDigital voice recorders capture potential paranormal voices, while body cams ensure every moment is documented. One investigator monitors an environmental device, noting fluctuations in barometric pressure and humidity. \u201cIf a spirit manifests, it could subtly alter the immediate environment,\u201d she explains, pointing to the screen.\n\nBut these tools are only as effective as the investigators who wield them.\n\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf\n\nThe feeble light from the hallway barely reaches the edges of Room No. 6 as the SPI UK team gathers around their equipment, their whispers blending with the creaks of the old floorboards. \u201cAsk her something specific,\u201d McKendrick says to Lalla, who is adjusting the settings on something called a spirit box. The device rapidly scans through radio frequencies, generating white noise that ghost hunters believe spirits can manipulate and communicate through. The spirit box crackles to life, its static filling the room as the investigators lean closer, straining to hear. Suddenly, a faint, almost imperceptible whisper cuts through the noise. The sound is fleeting, but it\u2019s enough to send a ripple of energy through the team.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d McKendrick asks, her voice a mixture of agony and elation. The team exchanges wide-eyed glances, the room suddenly electric with possibility.\n\nFor a moment, no one moves, ears straining for any follow-up. Lalla tilts her head toward the spirit box, her expression intent. \u201cWas that her?\u201d McKendrick finally murmurs. \u201cThe woman from Room No. 6?\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe team replays the recording, each straining to interpret the faint response. Could it have been a \u201cyes\u201d or a soft hum of agreement? The ambiguity only deepens the mystery.\n\nLater, McKendrick reflects on the moment with tempered excitement. \u201cWe caught a couple of incomprehensible voices in response to questions during callouts,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut they were more like uh huhs and mmms. If it had been clearer, I would have had the sound enhanced with an audio expert.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly did the team hear? Was it an eerie whisper from beyond or something more prosaic? The equipment ghostbusters rely on\u2014tools like spirit boxes and EMFs\u2014can pick up far more than just spirits. Static interference, stray radio signals, or even the voices of nearby people can all masquerade as spectral activity.\n\nSkeptics like Christopher French, a British psychologist and head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London, argue that such tools often mislead investigators. \u201cTo check whether allegedly paranormal phenomena are occurring, it\u2019s crucial to consider all possible explanations,\u201d French says. He suggests that whispers like those heard at the Sparkford Inn might simply be quiet noises from living people nearby, misinterpreted as ghostly communication, or random background noise amplified by eager imaginations.\n\nFrench also highlights a broader issue: the lack of rigorous data collection across time, which he argues is essential for true investigations of the unknown. Without such scientific scrutiny, the accuracy of instruments in paranormal use cases remain dubious.\n\n\u201cThese people want to give the appearance that they are doing science, but they really aren\u2019t,\u201d French says. \u201cTo check whether allegedly haunted locations have unusual patterns of electromagnetic activity, for example, you need to collect vast amounts of data in three dimensions across time. Without such scientific appraisal, the accuracy of instruments in paranormal use cases remains highly questionable. \u201cThose phantom outlines appearing on your thermal camera are usually specks of dust,\u201d French says.\n\nIn the case of the voice on the team\u2019s spirit box, French also has a theory. \u201cMost probably they inadvertently recorded living people speaking to each other that they didn't realize were in the area. Or sometimes even random background noises,\u201d he says.\n\nGetty Images\n\nLalla, however, disagrees. \u201cI just sit in a dark room, waiting,\u201d she says, estimating that up to two-thirds of her investigations produce no evidence at all. But her team never forces results. Take the scene with the toys, for instance. The teddy bear remained untouched. The toy clock never ticked, and no giggle or playful knock ever broke the silence. The lull of waiting is both part of the challenge and the mystery of their work. Lalla hums a nursery rhyme, but the room stays eerily still\u2014a subtle reminder that the paranormal often chooses its own time to speak, if at all.\n\nFrench acknowledges that while some teams are sincere in their mission, others may embellish evidence for sensational results. For many, French adds, the appeal lies in the social aspect and the status of being a paranormal investigator just as much as the search for real evidence. Still, the allure of the unexplained keeps investigators returning to allegedly spirit-infested places, where the line between ordinary and extraordinary occasionally blurs.\n\nAbout six months after their March investigation, McKendrick and her husband, who is also on the SPI UK team, visited the Sparkford Inn once again and met the new assistant manager. She shared a peculiar incident from early September that left her quite distressed. She was near the pool table when, suddenly, a pool ball came flying toward her through the hatch in the bar area. Startled, the manager approached the players at the pool table, jokingly admonishing them to keep their balls on the table. But all of their balls were accounted for; it was a spare. To add to the enigma, no one was near the bar area at the time who could have thrown it.\n\nOn another day, several staff and patrons witnessed a two-liter bottle of vodka fall from the wine rack and shatter on the ground. SPI UK investigators argue that the sheer number and variety of bizarre occurrences reported at the Inn make it difficult to simply dismiss them as coincidences or explain them away with skepticism. They vow to return again, armed with more high-tech tools and unflinching determination.\n\nIf there is a passage linking the living and the deceased, these apparition chasers believe they have the patience\u2014and the technology\u2014to uncover it. In their world, the world of the paranormal, every creak of time-worn wood, every shadow\u2019s fleeting waltz slipping past the awareness of the casual observer might be a potential scientific breakthrough and a gateway to a story untold."

            "article_content": "Guillermo del Toro\u2019s paranormal experience watching \u2018The Wire\u2019 in a hotel room: \u201cCompletely inauspicious conditions\u201d\n\nIf there is any director in Hollywood who most people would expect to be a believer in the paranormal, it\u2019s Guillermo del Toro. After all, he has spent his career telling visually astonishing tales of monsters, demons, and the evils of man that echo through the ages. He\u2019s dealt directly with ghosts in two films, The Devil\u2019s Backbone and Crimson Peak. Amazingly, though, del Toro considers himself a sceptic despite revealing he once had a paranormal experience in a hotel room that would make even the most optimistic believer\u2019s blood run cold.\n\nWhen del Toro made The Devil\u2019s Backbone in 2001, he created a definition of a ghost that spoke to him deeply. In his story of a young boy in a Spanish orphanage being haunted by the ghost of a dead boy, he describes spirits as akin to an insect in amber or something left forever unfinished. As he told Little White Lies, a ghost is \u201can awful sealed thing\u2026like a photograph, like the loop of a movie.\u201d\n\nThe Nightmare Alley helmer subsequently revealed that, in his life, he\u2019d had two paranormal experiences despite being dubious about the existence of ghosts. In fact, despite being such a fan of the macabre and the monstrous in fiction, when it comes to real-life proof of terrifying forces beyond our comprehension, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe.\u201d Essentially, in fiction, del Toro is Fox Mulder, but in reality, he\u2019s Dana Scully.\n\nDespite this, del Toro couldn\u2019t explain away his experiences as some trick of the brain or the creaking of an old building. He claimed, \u201cTwo times I have heard ghostly, disembodied voices, very, very clearly. And they were very scary at the time.\u201d\n\nDel Toro\u2019s most bone-chilling experience came when he was scouting locations for The Hobbit in New Zealand \u2013 ironically, a film he wound up not making. He explained, \u201cWe came to\u2026 a place called Waitomo, and I had read that there was an old hotel which had a haunted room.\u201d Even though the director and his scouts had arrived during the tourist off-season and the hotel was closed, the management agreed to open it, especially for them. Feeling curious, del Toro asked, \u201cCan I get the haunted room?\u201d but he would soon regret that request.\n\nWhile del Toro sat in the room and idly watched The Wire on DVD, he heard something that made him turn white as a sheet. He revealed that the sound was unmistakable: \u201cA woman shrieking for about five minutes, horrible blood-curdling shrieks. And then a man sobbing and sighing with great regret.\u201d\n\nThe terrified director estimated that the screaming lasted for five minutes and the remorseful weeping a full ten minutes more. He did some sleuthing and figured out where the noises were coming from. He claimed, \u201cI was able to actually track the sounds to the bathroom. I tracked them to a vent above the toilet, which went down into the cellar.\u201d\n\nDel Toro was adamant that nothing about the evening had primed him to think he was encountering the spirit realm. He clarified, \u201cI was not in the middle of s\u00e9ance, and it wasn\u2019t a stormy night,\u201d and added, \u201cIt was completely inauspicious conditions for a ghost apparition.\u201d All he was doing was watching high-quality crime drama to wind down after a long day of looking at potential locations.\n\nNaturally, the experience freaked del Toro out. He admitted that as soon as he realised the noises were coming from the cellar, he quietly returned to bed and put on his headphones. All he wanted was to be completely enveloped in the sound of Baltimore\u2019s war on drugs instead of that awful, disembodied screaming. Unsurprisingly, he didn\u2019t sleep a wink for the entire night."

            "article_content": "Skysong\n\nC.A. Wright\n\nPantera Press, $32.99 Fairytale adapted into a full-length fantasy novel best describes C.A. Wright\u2019s Skysong. This book takes inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s The Nightingale \u2013 one of the brighter flights in that author\u2019s oeuvre, though still spiked with folly and mortality. We follow Oriane, who lives in a remote village with a mystical legacy inherited from her mother. She can transform into a skylark, with the power to call the sun each morning. Curiosity leads Oriane into the dangers and intrigues of the royal court, where she\u2019s worshipped as a goddess but effectively imprisoned in the role. Her maid, Andala, also has a secret and as a schism erupts in the kingdom, it transpires that our heroine is not alone as she thinks. Wright\u2019s tale takes the possessiveness and failure to appreciate beauty in Andersen\u2019s original, and the motif of deception leading to feminine freedom, and builds a fantasy world in which the magical bird becomes an unwitting pawn in a political and religious struggle.\n\nThe Dream of A Tree\n\nMaja Lunde, trans. Diane Oatley\n\nScribner, $34.99 The final book in Norwegian author Maja Lunde\u2019s Climate Quartet, The Dream of A Tree takes us to the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard in 2110, where the Global Seed Vault is kept. Cut off from the world for years, Tommy and his brothers and their grandmother, the current Seed Keeper, tread lightly and at one with nature in their isolated home. When their tiny community faces disaster, they are suddenly alone and fighting not just to survive but to preserve the wonders of the Vault. Meanwhile, Tao, still grieving a son lost to starvation in a distant land, must lead an expedition into the Arctic, searching for the seeds that might save her people from famine. I only recall having read Lunde\u2019s The History of Bees, so I\u2019m uncertain how the Climate Quartet hangs together. Still, the books are written to be read as standalones, and this bleak cli-fi survival story is more imaginative in describing Tao\u2019s expedition than the trials on Svalbard itself.\n\nNON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK\n\nMean Streak\n\nRick Morton\n\n4th Estate, $35.99 When robo-debt was inflicted on Centrelink recipients by a ruthless coalition government, it was as though the infamous, automated debt calculation scheme was authored by Franz Kafka, in collaboration with George Orwell. In this searing, forensic and moving investigation of the whole tragic fiasco, Rick Morton, senior reporter with the Saturday Paper, calls it the \u201clabyrinth\u201d. For good reason. Seven people took their own lives, thousands lost their jobs and others developed mental illness. Morton, in measured writing fuelled with rage and sorrow in equal measure, walks us through one of the most shameful episodes in recent Australian politics, taking in prime ministers, pressured public servants, a whistleblower and case studies of the poor sods who were hunted down by their own government. A morality tale for our times.\n\nGreat Game On: The Contest for Central Asia and Global Supremacy\n\nGeoff Raby\n\nMUP, $34.99 In the original Great Game \u2013 a 19th-century imperial contest between Britain and Russia over India \u2013 the threat from Russia was more imagined than real, says Raby (our Chinese ambassador, 2007-2011). Likewise, the United States\u2019 fears of China and Vietnam. His examination of the new Great Game, prompted by his observations of the chaotic US departure from Afghanistan and Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, examines in lively detail the rise of China in Eurasia and its implications for the US, Russia and the world, while also putting events in detailed historical context. Has Putin demonstrated there is no such thing as a quick, decisive victory and will this affect China\u2019s options regarding Taiwan? Has he opened the way for China in Eurasia? Aimed at the general reader, this is a seriously informed study of the major players in these \u201cinteresting\u201d times.\n\nAustralian Ghost Stories\n\nJames Phelps\n\nHarper Collins, $15.99 Everybody loves a good ghost story and there are hauntings aplenty in this record of paranormal activity in Oz. Phelps bookends his collection with tales of the Hydro-Majestic Hotel in the Blue Mountains, especially the case of June Clemenger, who was strangled at the hotel in 1934 by an ex-lover, and who now stalks the place attempting retributive strangulation. Not only did Conan-Doyle conduct seances at the hotel, Sir Edmund Barton died there and has also been spotted floating around. In between, we hear believers\u2019 tales of a prison ghost watching black-and-white movies, families in haunted houses smelling phantom cigarette smoke, a Casper-like friendly ghost and ghost whisperers who have the happy knack of detecting the paranormal and \u201ccleansing\u201d the house of it. Get out the Ouija board, dim the lights, and get spooked."

            "article_content": "I\u2019m always surprised that people still want to talk about it,\u201d says Lorraine Bracco, with an air of smouldering bemusement. \u201cI go out, I go to dinner and it always, always comes back to Goodfellas and The Sopranos.\u201d There\u2019s good reason for that. As Karen Hill, wife of Ray Liotta\u2019s ascendent mobster in Martin Scorsese\u2019s genre-defining 1990 crime classic, Bracco secured her own small but eternal place in film history. And as Dr Jennifer Melfi, the shrewd, erudite psychiatrist to James Gandolfini\u2019s Tony in The Sopranos, she did the same on TV.\n\nIt\u2019s ostensibly neither of these projects that I\u2019m speaking to Bracco about today, over the phone as she sits at home in Bridgehampton, New York. But her two landmark roles can\u2019t help but work their way into our conversation. It\u2019s true what they say, the mafia really does have its fingers in everything.\n\nBracco, now 70, is instead here to talk Monster Summer \u2013 a Stranger Things-esque throwback of a movie that follows a group of teens in a small American town investigating a series of paranormal occurrences. The adult cast also includes Mel Gibson and a drawling, cowboy-hatted Kevin James; Bracco plays Miss Halverson, an enigmatic older woman whose arrival to the town coincides suspiciously with the supernatural threat. Her character is, \u201cas Hitchcock would say\u2026 the McGuffin\u201d, she laughs.\n\nBracco\u2019s voice, fibrous and distinctive even in her youth, has taken on a sandpapery decadence in recent years \u2013 still, though, her laughter breaks into a high giggle. Comparing Monster Summer to inspirations such as The Goonies and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Bracco explains: \u201cThe script felt old school\u2026 kids on their bike in the summer, playing baseball, and all of a sudden everything goes crazy and scary. I like that!\u201d\n\nHer co-star Gibson is a notoriously controversial figure, ever since a series of scandals in the 2000s, which included domestic violence allegations and antisemitic remarks. The Lethal Weapon actor was \u201clong gone\u201d by the time Bracco arrived to shoot her scenes in Monster Summer, but she has nothing but good things to say about him. \u201cHe\u2019s lovely, smart, beautiful\u2026 really, very handsome. And a great director. Braveheart \u2013 it\u2019s a magnificent movie.\u201d\n\nFor Bracco, Monster Summer mostly involved working with the film\u2019s child stars (including The Black Phone\u2019s Mason Thames, and Broadway\u2019s Julian Lerner). It\u2019s familiar territory. She mentions, for example, the 1992 film Radio Flyer, which saw her star opposite then-child actors Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello. \u201cOn a human level, I always took the kids out for lunch or dinner, so they would feel that I was more of a friend-mom kind of thing, than an actor,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSo, I always broke that mould a bit \u2013 and then they react to me as Lorraine.\u201d\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, meanwhile, was only 19 when Bracco played his mother in 1995\u2019s addiction drama The Basketball Diaries. \u201cHe was a baby when I worked with him!\u201d she laughs. \u201cWhen they first gave me the script, it was like five lines, and I said, \u2018Leo, what do you want me to do with this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Anything you want. I\u2019m game, let\u2019s do it.\u2019 And we really created that relationship on the set. It\u2019s impressive, trust me. He\u2019s still impressive.\u201d Their mother-son bond was the film\u2019s emotional epicentre \u2013 summed up in that famous scene staged across two sides of a closed door, as Bracco is confronted with DiCaprio\u2019s hysterical breakdown.\n\nWitch hunt? Lorraine Bracco in \u2018Monster Summer' (Signature Entertainment)\n\nBracco herself didn\u2019t start acting until relatively late, by industry standards. The daughter of an English mother and Italian father, she grew up in Long Island, before moving to France and working as a model throughout her twenties. She was 25 when she landed her first film role, a part in the French film Duos sur canap\u00e9, but it would be another decade \u2013 and some rigorous technical training from, among others, legendary acting coach Stella Adler \u2013 before she properly had a stab at making it in Hollywood.\n\nBy the time of Goodfellas, Bracco was 36, and a mother. It made her perfect for the spiky, compromised Karen Hill. Think of the timeless scene in which Liotta wakes up to find Bracco straddling him, a gun aimed squarely at his face. An ing\u00e9nue wouldn\u2019t have cut it. \u201cWhen you become a huge star at the age of 16, 17, 18\u2026 it\u2019s very confusing \u2013 all that fame and money and trust issues,\u201d Bracco says. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that goes on with any of these young actors. I was already a mother of two kids. I was still making oatmeal when [Goodfellas] came out! So I was very grounded.\u201d\n\nI love Ray Liotta. Loved, loved, loved him. He was really my partner in crime on \u2018Goodfellas\u2019\n\nGoodfellas \u2013 along with the rest of Scorsese\u2019s oeuvre \u2013 has been magnetised to critical discourse down the years. Recently, Nicole Kidman had a (rather benign) dig at the director, saying she\u2019d love to work with him \u2013 \u201cif he does a film with women\u201d. When I mention this to Bracco, she is diplomatic. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been strong women roles \u2013 one role \u2013 in each of his movies. In Raging Bull you had Cathy Moriarty, Sharon Stone in Casino\u2026 but the only woman-driven movie I think he really made was with Michelle Pfeiffer [The Age of Innocence]. Other than that, he\u2019s very male-driven. That\u2019s who he is! That is his theme. That and religion.\u201d\n\nBut she understands where Kidman is coming from. \u201cMaking Goodfellas, I was surrounded by 10 guys,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were all surrounded by men \u2013 and men that [Scorsese] uses all the time. So, there\u2019s a huge shorthand between a director and an actor.\u201d Was that not intimidating? \u201cYes \u2013 and the only saving grace I had was Ray Liotta,\u201d she says. (Liotta was also a Scorsese first-timer.) \u201cI love Ray. I loved, loved, loved him. He was really my partner in crime on that movie.\u201d\n\nPartners in crime: Liotta and Bracco in \u2018Goodfellas\u2019 (Warner Bros)\n\nBracco is nonetheless fulsome in her tributes to Scorsese, whom she deems \u201cone of the 10 greatest directors of our generation\u201d. She says the same of Ridley Scott, who directed her in 1987\u2019s Someone to Watch Over Me. \u201cThat film wasn\u2019t a big success, but I learnt so much from Ridley,\u201d she says, \u201cand he was so beautiful in guiding me and teaching me and believing in me. Beautiful, beautiful. You know, here\u2019s the thing about Ridley: as much as he does all the Gladiator, and Alien, \u2018cause he loves all that scary stuff\u2026 I think one of the most beautiful parts of Ridley is that he loves women.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something irrepressibly charming about Bracco\u2019s enthusiasm for cinema. She loves movies, and her answers constantly pull in old classics, famous actors, filmmakers; she seems to have met just about everyone. Curiosity, then, gets the better of me: I ask who else makes her Top 10. The answer is enjoyably eclectic \u2013 names from Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood to George Lucas and Pablo Larra\u00edn. (Again, she mentions Gibson.) Bracco says she\u2019s never had a mental checklist of directors she wants to work with \u2013 unusual, perhaps, for an actor \u2013 but seems to have nevertheless worked her way through a decent chunk of her own personal pantheon.\n\nWhen it comes to television, The Sopranos sits more or less atop every pantheon out there. One of the welcome side-effects of the undying interest in the show is, says Bracco, the chance to learn things she never knew during its production. She mentions the \u201cbrilliant\u201d recent documentary Wise Guy: David Chase and the Sopranos, produced to mark the series\u2019 25th anniversary. \u201cI discovered all these things I didn\u2019t know about [creator David Chase] and the actors\u2026 because I really only worked with Jim [Gandolfini]. I was not really privy to a lot of what went on on set, except for what went on with Jim and I in Melfi\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nAnalyse this: Bracco provided a psychoanalytical foil to Tony Soprano in the hit drama (HBO)\n\nShe speaks warmly and bittersweetly of Gandolfini, who died of a heart attack in 2013, and indeed of Dr Melfi \u2013 the sort of rich, layered character any actor would dream of. \u201cOne of the things that was very important \u2013 and unusual \u2013 was that she was this very educated Italian woman,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never see that! So that was something that propelled me in creating her.\u201d\n\nBracco has her own issues with the somewhat anticlimactic way Melfi\u2019s storyline ended. \u201cI never did like the way he ended our session together,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was very abrupt. They spent years together! I think she was fond of him. She wanted to make him better.\u201d\n\nShe brings up her character\u2019s most controversial storyline: the episode in which Dr Melfi is raped, and ultimately decides not to seek revenge via Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cI was very, very upset with that,\u201d she says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand it at all in the beginning. In fact, I read half the script and called David, and I said, \u2018Why are you hurting her? Of all people, why would you do this?\u2019 I said, I\u2019m so upset. I couldn\u2019t even finish the script.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, could you finish it and then call me back?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was annoyed to death,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd then when I got to the last word, it really made me stop and think, \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And I realised it was the fork in the road of morality for Dr Melfi. And I called David back. I said, \u2018OK, I thought about it. I get it. Goodbye.\u2019 And that was that.\u201d\n\nThat, I suppose, is Bracco in a nutshell: forthright, self-possessed \u2013 but savvy and flexible when it comes to her own creative choices. \u201cI have no complaints. At 70 years old I feel like I\u2019m still eight \u2013 I still wanna do things,\u201d she smiles. That said, she is grateful for the things she\u2019s already done. \u201cI think the thing that kills me is that people are still talking about The Sopranos \u2013 and still watching it,\u201d she adds. There are certainly worse things to be remembered for.\n\n\u2018Monster Summer\u2019 is available on digital platforms now. Distributed by Signature Entertainment"

            "article_content": "The more exciting, transformative, and revolutionary a science result appears, especially coming out of nowhere, the more likely it is to be dead wrong. So, approach science headlines with a healthy amount of skepticism and patience\n\nIn 2014 astronomers announced a whopper of a discovery: primordial waves from the earliest moments of the big bang. The South Pole telescope results validated the long-standing but still-shaky hypothesis of cosmic inflation, the scenario where the extremely early universe underwent a period of massively accelerated expansion. News reports went wild, as did the scientists involved in the study, in a celebratory news conference.\n\nBut it was all just a bunch of dust. Literally, dust. The team did not properly account for the impact of interstellar dust in their analysis. With proper calibration, the paradigm-shifting result disappeared.\n\nOr remember Tabby\u2019s Star? In 2015 astronomers speculated that its strange light pattern might be the product of alien megastructures. Cue media circus, high-profile talks, the works. Further analysis revealed that it was \u2026dust, again.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nMore recently, a group of astronomers claimed to find phosphine in abundance in the Venusian atmosphere, proposing that there might be some form of exotic life floating in the cloud tops. After the media hype died down, other researchers found significant flaws in the original analysis (at least it wasn\u2019t dust this time).\n\nIt\u2019s not just astronomy. Neutrinos can travel faster than light. Mozart makes your kids smarter. Dyeing your hair gives you cancer. Smartphones make us stupid.\n\nVery, very stunning. But very, very wrong.\n\nThe strong correlation between flashiness and wrongness comes from several factors. First, much, if not most, scientific research is wrong. That\u2019s why it\u2019s research; if we knew the answers ahead of time, we wouldn\u2019t need to do science. Many scientific papers are speculative, dependent on hyperspecific assumptions of controlled parameters, or just crazy ideas shot into the dark. It\u2019s through this constant bubbling of ideas and results and studies that we poke and prod at nature\u2019s workings, hoping to tease out some glimmer of deeper understanding.\n\nSecond, scientists endure perverse incentives to publish as much as possible\u2014to \u201cpublish or perish\u201d\u2014and to get their results in top-tier journals as much as possible. Since the biggest ones only take on the most impactful research, there is tremendous pressure in academia to inflate results and make big, bold claims, increasing the chances that their tenuous results will not hold up to further scrutiny.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s the modern-day hype machine. While many journalists respect scientists and want to faithfully represent the results of scientific research, publishers face their own incentives to capture eyeballs and clicks and downloads. The more sensational the story, the better.\n\nTrust in science continues to decline, reports the Pew Research Center, falling to only 57 percent of survey respondents viewing it as more positive than negative for society. I believe that\u2019s in part due to flagrant overinflation of scientific results. The more times that the public sees science contradict itself, the less likely people are to believe the next result that makes headlines. And the more times that scientists are loudly, publicly wrong, the more ammunition antiscience groups have in their fight against trusted experts.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that science results can\u2019t be both interesting and right. The discovery of gravitational waves from merging black holes in 2015 was supremely fascinating, and exactly right. The release of the mRNA vaccines to fight the coronavirus pandemic were nothing short of miraculous\u2014and they did the job.\n\nThe vast majority of the time, though, from my experience in the worlds of science and science communication, if a result is interesting, it\u2019s probably wrong. And let me be clear here. I\u2019m sure you find most, if not all, scientific research absolutely fascinating\u2014as do I. But the more interesting a result is to the wider community, with more headlines, chatter, attention and raised eyebrows, the more likely it is to be worthy of a bit of healthy skepticism.\n\nJust peruse the latest batch of articles from your favorite science journal. Once you get past the technical jargon, you\u2019ll find that many papers are, in a way, boring. Not boring in the sense of not worth reading or exploring further, but boring in the sense that they would not make the pages of a high-impact journal, let alone your local newspaper. Most scientific papers are small steps, methodological techniques or slightly-off-the-beaten-path theoretical detours. Most scientific results come slowly, incrementally and with little fanfare.\n\nOnly a slim fraction of science results makes it from the journals to the newspapers, and even fewer make global headlines. The broad public only gets to view science through a highly filtered lens, and what makes it through that filter has a greater chance of being wrong.\n\nThe best approach to take with science results, news, and headlines is the same approach scientists use themselves: healthy skepticism.\n\nFirst, look at the timeline. Amazing results can be right, but they\u2019re usually backed by years, if not decades, of consistent, steady progress in those directions. It took a quarter century of effort before gravitational waves were found, and the roots of the mRNA vaccines go back to the 1990s. A big, successful result is usually the final step of a slow and steady slog.\n\nSecond, look at the scope. Bigger claims, with more far-reaching or broad conclusions, usually don\u2019t hold up. Good individual studies usually have carefully crafted limitations and clearly stated caveats; it takes a comprehensive effort from a community of scientists to build up a general consensus. Climate change proved true over time, black holes were a fringe possibility that added up in repeated observations, and exoplanets were searched for over decades before the first one was finally spotted in 1992.\n\nLastly, just be patient. Science is in part organized skepticism, and the first group of people to rigorously attack a new idea will be other scientists. New studies may rebuke, reaffirm or revise an existing result. Only time, and countless hours of work, will reveal if a conclusion holds up to scrutiny and the ultimate judgment of evidence.\n\nBeware big headlines; don\u2019t believe everything you see. But when study after study comes out, building up an interconnected latticework of theory and experiment, allow your beliefs to shift, because that\u2019s when the process of science has likely led to an interesting and useful conclusion. It\u2019s ironically through this process of healthy skepticism that trust in science can be regained. By viewing science results through a scientific lens\u2014initially skeptical but allowing beliefs to shift along with the weight of evidence\u2014we can develop the intuition we need to reject sensational headlines but know when a new result is right.\n\nIn the meantime, just remember that if it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s probably wrong.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "Researchers drilled down around 6,600 feet below the ground and identified more than 40 veins of gold ore.\n\nScientists in China have uncovered a \"supergiant\" deposit of high-quality gold ore hidden near some of the country's existing gold mines. The vast reserve, which could be the largest single reservoir of the valuable metal left anywhere on Earth, is worth billions of dollars and caused the global price of gold to skyrocket to near-record highs.\n\nThe new deposit was uncovered at the Wangu gold field in the northeast of Hunan province, representatives from the Geological Bureau of Hunan Province (GBHP) told Chinese state media on Nov. 20 . Workers detected more than 40 gold veins, which contained around 330 tons (300 metric tons) of gold down to a depth of 6,600 feet (2,000 meters). However, using 3D computer models, mining experts have predicted that there could be up to 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tons) of gold \u2014 roughly eight times heavier than the Statute of Liberty \u2014 hidden at depths of up to 9,800 feet (3,000 m).\n\nIf true, the entire deposit is likely worth around 600 billion yuan ($83 billion), GBHP officials said.\n\nOfficials revealed that the maximum quality of the new deposit was 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, which is relatively high compared with most other gold mines around the world . \"Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,\" Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert with GBHP, told state media.\n\nMore gold was also found during test drills around the new site's \"peripheral areas,\" suggesting there are more large deposits waiting to be tapped in the future, experts said.\n\nRelated: Why is gold so soft?\n\nMining experts believe that the new deposit contains up to 1,100 tons of gold. (Image credit: Alamy/Xinhua)\n\nIt is hard to keep track of the amount of gold left in the various mines across the world due to fluctuations in the rate of extraction at each site and a lack of transparency in reporting results. However, as of 2022, the largest known remaining gold reserves on Earth are found in South Africa's South Deep gold mine, which has around 1,025 tons (930 metric tons) of gold, according to Mining Technology . This means the new deposit could be the largest known natural stockpile of gold on the planet.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nNews of the discovery sent ripples through the mining community and the wider global economy. The price of gold jumped to around $2,700 per ounce ($95,240 per kilogram) \u2014 just below a record high set earlier this year, according to CCN.com .\n\nChina is already the biggest producer of gold in the world, accounting for around 10% of global output in 2023, according to Reuters . However, the country still uses more gold than it can produce, consuming around three times as much of the precious metal as it can dig up. As a result, China relies heavily on importing gold from countries like Australia and South Africa.\n\nChina currently mines around 10% of the world's newly dug up gold every year. (Image credit: Alamy/Xinhua)\n\nThe new gold deposit could help alleviate this issue but will not solve the problem completely. Based on current consumption rates, the entire deposit would only supply the country's needs for around 1.4 years.\n\nBy the end of 2023, an estimated total of 234,332 tons (212,582 metric tons) of gold have been dug up in human history, with more than two-thirds of this being extracted since 1950, according to the World Gold Council ."

            "article_content": "Establishing a tech startup involves careful planning and execution, especially in a dynamic city like Dubai. Known for its robust economic environment and strategic location, Dubai has become a global hub for technology and innovation. The influx of international venture capitalists and a supportive government framework make it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs. This guide walks you through essential aspects of launching your tech startup in Dubai, emphasizing the steps to navigate its promising ecosystem successfully.\n\nUnderstanding Dubai\u2019s Business Environment\n\nRapid growth, diverse industries, and substantial investment opportunities characterize Dubai\u2019s business environment. The UAE government offers numerous startup incentives, including tax exemptions and streamlined registration processes. Its policies foster innovation and make it easier for entrepreneurs to launch new businesses. Companies operating in free zones enjoy complete ownership and benefits such as relaxed regulations.\n\nAdditionally, industry-specific free zones enable startups to tap into niche markets, enhancing their competitive edge. Conducting thorough market research is crucial to understanding the local landscape. This knowledge allows you to identify gaps and opportunities in the market, guiding your business strategy. When setting up a business in Dubai, engaging with local business consultants significantly assists in navigating regulatory obligations and logistical challenges. Their expertise can streamline your entry into the market and provide insights into local consumer behavior. Overall, understanding the business environment in Dubai is foundational to establishing a successful startup.\n\nCreating a Solid Business Plan\n\nA well-structured business plan acts as a roadmap for your startup\u2019s growth. This document defines your business objectives, target market, financial forecasts, and marketing strategies. Begin by clearly outlining your product or service and what differentiates it from competitors. An effective business plan should also highlight your unique value proposition, effectively addressing customer pain points. Financial projections play a vital role in attracting investors and securing funding. Detail your anticipated expenses, revenue models, and break-even analysis to present a compelling case.\n\nComplying with Legal Requirements\n\nComplying with Dubai\u2019s legal requirements is a critical step toward a successful startup launch. Securing the necessary licenses and permits depends on your business type and the industry in which you operate. The Dubai Department of Economic Development (DED) plays a crucial role by issuing essential licenses to local and foreign enterprises. The types of permits include commercial, industrial, and professional categories, each requiring specific approvals. Alongside business registration, understanding local labor laws and regulations is vital for managing employees effectively. Dubai\u2019s employment laws govern contracts, wages, and worker rights, ensuring you adhere to the legal framework.\n\nBuilding a Network and Community\n\nEstablishing a solid professional network is essential for any startup. Dubai hosts various tech events, expos, and networking platforms, presenting numerous opportunities to connect with industry leaders and potential investors. Participating in these events allows you to showcase your startup, gain feedback, and forge valuable relationships. Collaborating with fellow entrepreneurs can lead to mentorship opportunities and even partnerships that strengthen your business. Moreover, exploring online platforms such as LinkedIn can expand your reach beyond physical events. Engaging with groups focused on technology and startups allows you to share ideas and trends while learning from peers. Overall, networking creates a robust ecosystem vital for startup success in Dubai.\n\nSecuring Funding for Your Startup\n\nFunding is often one of the most significant hurdles for entrepreneurs. Fortunately, Dubai\u2019s vibrant startup ecosystem features various funding sources, including angel investors, venture capital firms, and government grants. Exploring these avenues lets you find the proper financial support that aligns with your business vision. Local banks and financial institutions also offer loan programs tailored to startups, making it easier to access capital. Participating in business competitions and startup accelerators can provide funding, mentorship, and exposure. These platforms often offer seed funding in exchange for equity, allowing you to validate your business model under expert guidance. Proactively seeking funding sources will play a significant role in your startup\u2019s sustainability.\n\nLeveraging Technology in Your Startup\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-evolving landscape, leveraging technology can give your startup a competitive advantage. It can enhance efficiency, streamline processes, and facilitate scalability. Start by integrating cutting-edge tools and software that align with your operational needs, such as project management, customer relationship management (CRM), and data analytics tools. Furthermore, focusing on digital marketing strategies is essential for reaching a broader audience. Social media, email marketing, and SEO will elevate your online brand presence. Enhancing security protocols and data protection measures safeguards customer information and fosters trust. Regular training sessions for personnel on technology updates are also crucial, ensuring that your team remains proficient with the tools available. By prioritizing technology, your startup will be better positioned to adapt and grow in the competitive market.\n\nMaking informed decisions is essential to aligning your business with evolving customer needs, and embracing a mindset of improvement positions your startup for long-term viability and success. Establishing a tech startup in Dubai requires a blend of strategic planning, compliance, and community building. Each step is crucial in ensuring your business is well-positioned for growth in this thriving ecosystem. By understanding the local landscape, creating solid plans, complying with legal requirements, and fostering relationships, you set your startup on a path toward success."
