            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOne of the leading figures in the world of UFO investigation, Dr. Steven Greer, warns that the recent spate of mysterious drone reports are a smokescreen for something far more nefarious. After all, Greer is the founder of the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI), so he knows of what he speaks.\n\nIt has been over two weeks since the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an alert banning drones from flying over a large portion of New Jersey. The reason for the unusual action was explained as being for \u201cspecial security reasons.\u201d Around that same time, the FAA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense issued a joint statement addressing the many questions the drone sightings created.\n\nNone of those government agency alerts or statements truly shed any light, however, on exactly what was going on, where the drones came from, or what they were doing.\n\nOne UFO expert, Carl Nally of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), claimed the mysterious drone sightings could, in fact, be a precursor to an alien invasion. Dr. Steven Greer, on the other hand, says, not so fast.\n\nGreer believes these drones, according to a report by the Mirror, \u201care part of a staged operation designed to trick the public into believing an alien invasion is imminent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Newsmax\u2019s Rob Finnerty, Dr Greer predicted that the situation will escalate \u201cin the next 30 days or so\u201d. He believes the supposed \u201calien invasion\u201d is a cover-up to hide the real truth about extraterrestrial encounters, which he alleges have been happening for several decades.\n\nSupposedly, according to Greer, U.S. weapons manufacturers have gotten their hands on alien technology and all of these drones sightings are part of an operation to conceal their actions.\n\nDr. Greer, the man who inspired Demi Lovato to begin communicating with aliens, also says that he believes the drone situation is going to escalate \u201cin the next 30 days or so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a team of about six different black sites that have been running illegal projects related to so-called UAPs and UFOs,\u201d he said. \u201cComing forward in the next 30 days or so, they will bring forth positive evidence of this and the fact that these programs have been run illegally and outside of constitutional oversight.\u201d\n\nGreer isn\u2019t alone in his doomsday-like prediction. Ross Coulthart, an Australian investigative journalist and author who believes governments are covering up their knowledge of UFOs, has also gone on record as saying \u201call hell is going to break loose\u201d in early 2025."

            "article_content": "I spent an entire day of CES wearing a little yellow bracelet. To the unsuspecting nearby humans, it probably looked like a fitness tracker. But the whole time, this yellow Pioneer wearable from Bee AI recorded everything around me. It wasn't storing audio like a typical recorder app, but it processed my conversations, then gave me personalized to-do lists and readable summaries of my in-person chats.\n\nA few days before the trade show, I spoke with the founder of another new company, Omi, which was officially unveiled for the first time today. Guess what it does? Record everything around you to create an activity log, and then have AI disseminate the information to give you actionable insights and tasks from your day, almost like a personal assistant. Omi's wearable can go around your neck, but it is best worn stuck to your forehead near your temple\u2014it has an electroencephalogram inside, and Omi claims that if you think specifically about talking to the wearable, the device will understand and perk up to receive your request.\n\nThis is the new world we're in, with artificially intelligent wearables continuously recording the world around us. Voice assistants\u2014which first landed in speakers and on our phones, but quickly moved to our wrists and faces\u2014at least required active engagement like a tap or a wake word to activate their ability to eavesdrop. But the next wave of hardware assistants, which also includes the forthcoming Friend pendant, can absorb information passively and work in the background. They are always listening.\n\nThe wearable hardware leading this space is often cheap\u2014Bee AI's watch is just $50, and Omi's stick-on bead is $89\u2014but the real magic is in the software, which often requires a subscription as it taps into multiple large language models to analyze your conversations.\n\nBee AI\n\nBee AI's yellow wearable listens to your interactions, then provides text transcripts in a mobile app. Photograph: Tristan deBrauwere\n\nBee AI was founded by Maria de Lourdes Zollo and Ethan Sutin. Both previously worked at Squad (Sutin was the founder), which enabled media screen sharing in video chats so people could remotely watch the same movie or YouTube video together. The company was acquired by X (back when it was called Twitter), and the pair both joined briefly to work on Twitter Spaces. Zollo has previously worked at Tencent and Musical.ly, which subsequently became TikTok.\n\nSutin says he explored the idea of a personal AI assistant back in 2016 when chatbots were all the rage, but the technology wasn't there yet. That's not the case anymore. The company launched its Bee AI platform last February in beta, with an active community providing feedback. It only just began selling its Pioneer hardware a little more than a week ago. (The \u201cBee\u201d name plays with the idea of ambient computing, as if something is buzzing around and taking in information.) You don't need the company's hardware to use Bee AI\u2014you can just interact with the AI via the iPhone app\u2014but Zollo says the wearable offers a richer experience as it can record continuously all day. An Android app is on the way at the end of the month.\n\nThe wearable is simple. It has two microphones for noise isolation, and Sutin says that if you can hear the person you're speaking with in a busy environment, the wearable should be able to hear both parties as well. It can be worn as a band on the wrist or clipped to your shirt. There's an \u201cAction\u201d button in the center; pressing it once mutes the mics, and pressing it again enables them again. You can press and hold the button, and this action is user-configurable, so that can trigger things like processing the current conversation or awakening the \u201cBuzz\u201d AI assistant to ask it a question. (There's no speaker on the wearable, so answers will be spoken out through your phone.) When the mic is muted, there's a red LED. When it's recording, you'd think the green LED would be lit up, but there's nothing to indicate that this wearable is picking up everything around you."

He does leave things open when cautioning, \"I think it's possible that there are ghosts.\"\n\n\"Energy can't be destroyed,\" adds Hambel, who rhetorically asks, \"When it leaves the body, where does it go?\"\n\n\"There's dimensional elements to it, I think, that maybe we don't comprehend,\" concludes Schuler before embarking on an unnerving ghost hunt.\n\nAbout Paranormal Prison\n\nLoudwire has teamed up with Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents to bring you 12 brand new episodes of Paranormal Prison!\n\nWe invite you and your favorite artists inside Ohio State Reformatory, where Ohio's most violent criminals lost their lives, but some of their souls still remain.\n\nSeason 2 of Paranormal Prison will air each Wednesday at 1PM ET on Loudwire's YouTube channel.\n\nParanormal Prison: Season 2, Episode 9 - Biohazard\n\nIn this episode, the crew explores one of the most haunted areas of the prison \u2014 the attic.\n\nApril 21, 1930, a fire ignited by criminals at the maximum security Ohio Penitentiary killed 322 inmates and hospitalized another 230 in one of the deadliest fires in American prison history.\n\nThe 300 surviving inmates were relocated to Mansfield Ohio State Reformatory and locked in the attic every night for safety, where violence and murder reigned.\n\nClear voices from the other side answer prompts and the Biohazard bandmates later seem convinced that there is paranormal activity running rampant after seeing something that wound up not being there after all...\n\nWatch Episode 9 directly below.\n\nREAD MORE: Rockers Tell Their Wildest Tattoo Stories\n\nAbout Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival and Danny Wimmer Presents\n\nInkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.\n\nConstruction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.\n\nFans are already looking forward to the 2025 installment, which takes place July 18, 29 and 20.

            "article_content": "Have you ever been alone at home and something odd, like an unexplained sound or movement, happened? Your brain probably jumped to one of these conclusions \u2013 someone broke in, or there\u2019s a ghost.\n\nNow, imagine if there was actually a ghost and you had to live there knowing there was a spirit roaming around. Well, people in this list don\u2019t have to imagine it \u2013 they actually lived through it (or lied about it convincingly). So, let\u2019s dive in to read about their experiences. Just beware, after reading these stories, the next unexplained sound in your house might feel a lot scarier.\n\nMore info: Reddit\n\n#1\n\nI lived in a house once where the previous owners wife died there. He left a bunch of furniture including a rocking chair with a matching rocking leg rest.\n\n\n\nSo one night I came downstairs for a late night snack had to been after midnight and I was the only one down there, and there is this rocking chair and leg rest just rocking away all by themselves in sync.\n\nImage credits: Sniped_Yuh\n\n#2\n\nMy grandparents house has a ghost of an old lady that literally sits in the corner of the guest room and knits. I've only seen her twice and both times only frightened me because I never expect to see her.\n\nImage credits: seth_window26\n\n#3\n\nI was staying in an apt over an old theatre in a mining town.\n\nApt was easily 60' above the street.\n\nWoman, blue hued, in long dress... just appears in my peripheral vision. I turn to look.... And she does the same. We meet eyes while she pauses there watching me. She then walks across the room and out the front wall of the apt over the street. I look out the window and nothing.\n\n\n\nI'm like \"I need sleep\".\n\n\n\nI mention this to owner and he explains there was a balcony there but it was lost in a fire decades ago where a woman died trying to escape said fire. Now it's a solid wall where a doorway was. He just added \"long blue dress?\"\n\n\n\nLike bro..things you could have mentioned in the housing ad!\n\nImage credits: Syst0us\n\nOne of the most iconic sub-genres of horror movies is those about haunted houses, like The Changeling (1980), The Innocents (1961) and The Uninvited (1944), which Entertainment Weekly dubbed as three of the best movies of this sub-genre, where a ghost (or some other kind of supernatural creature) haunts a house and usually its residents. So, just the topic of haunted houses continues to interest people.\n\nWell, at least some people from this Reddit thread, where a netizen asked about their haunted house experiences, believe this phenomenon is real (or they\u2019re good liars).\n\n#4\n\nI live in a house where 3 people died. Mostly, its the doors opening and closing on their own. Its not even scary anymore, just frustrating. That and the footsteps coming from my attic, which is pretty terrifying when its like 2 AM and you hear footsteps above you. Especially when there is no way a human can get up there and walk around.\n\nImage credits: crimsonbaby_\n\n#5\n\nMy Dad was [taken from us] before I was born. When I was still in elementary school, I would feel someone tightening the cover on my bed at night. I would look around the room and didn't see anyone. When I told my Mom, she told me it was my Dad tucking me in. She said that he wanted me to be a girl. Also sometimes I would be out flying in the sky like the birds on his back. He would bring me back home when it would get dark. Then I would wake up and look around the room, and go back to sleep. It didn't scare me.\n\nImage credits: Thick_Curvy83\n\n#6\n\nHouse not too old (1950s) but haunted. After I moved in, I used to walk into my room and smell fresh flowers - I'm no gardener so dont have any in the house. Heard a man's voice call my name one night - no one knew my name in my town and the house next door was empty. Heard slippers scuffing up the hallway on carpet - that I'd just removed. It all felt pretty peaceful, just an older couple keeping an eye on things.\n\n\n\nOne night I heard a man cough in my lounge - it felt sinister and freaked my dog out so I smudged and crystalled. Nothing since.\n\nImage credits: kimikupkake\n\nWhile reading through these stories, you might think that some of them sound like scenarios from horror movies, like the ones we mentioned earlier. Well, the media a person consumes tends to affect their worldview. From opinions about world events to critical thinking and creativity, the media has influence over it all.\n\nSince horror movies are one of the most popular genres, a person likely watches at least one horror movie in their lifetime. Then, there are urban legends that are spread from person to person about hauntings, unexplained phenomena, and things like that. So, when you are aware of stories like that, it\u2019s natural to jump to conclusions that a certain event in your life is also due to the paranormal.\n\n#7\n\nCurrently live in \u201chaunted\u201d house, and we have had the usual happen: doors opening/closing by themselves, voices when no one is around, shadow people. The one thing that takes the cake though is the goddamn pizza! We were having dinner and watching television when a slice of pizza lifted up and flipped over toppings down and then flipped back over the other way! I\u2019m still scratch my head at how or why this happened.This sounds like a bad joke but trust me it isnt.\n\nImage credits: retailzombie87\n\n#8\n\nParents moved into a house where they believe the previous owners practiced witchcraft. The bought a house in New Hampshire and one of the rooms was painted red so they repaint, but my mom would hear things and the worst night was when my older sister who was like 4 at the time called my mom into her room and said \u201c look, there\u2019s a ghost over there!\u201d they moved out of that house a month after I was born. My mom blames my addiction to horror movies on that house.\n\nImage credits: elisejones14\n\n#9\n\nI moved into a house built in the 1890s several years ago. A few weeks after moving in, before meeting any neighbors, I heard heavy footsteps coming down the attic steps outside my bedroom. I then heard footsteps on the staircase for the first / second floor, and someone say my name. My husband was 30 miles away, nobody in town knew me or had access to my house, and there was nobody outside at the time. I grabbed my baby, phone and keys, and ran outside to wait. We searched the house top to bottom and never found anything, but I've heard the footsteps multiple times. We have no upstairs plumbing or hvac, so it remains unsolved.\n\n\n\nI've also heard music playing downstairs, talking to previous owners this was common. It's just commonplace now, and we don't always have stuff going on. A lot of major remodeling has been done, so I guess maybe that's why it's happening. Honestly the repairs are scarier than anything else.\n\nImage credits: ILuvMyLilTurtles\n\nGranted, we\u2019re not saying that all the stories shared in this list are made up. We\u2019re just pointing out that sometimes when an individual experiences something odd and nothing logical can explain it, their mind tends to fill in the gaps themselves. Especially, since the human brain tends to catastrophize (jump to the worst-case scenario), and let\u2019s admit \u2013 the haunting doesn\u2019t seem so fun.\n\nPlus, many reports of hauntings later get proven to be based on incorrect, misrepresented science, manipulation, assumption, and things like that.\n\nFor instance, in some cases, the houses that were claimed to be haunted were later found to have carbon monoxide leakage. So, the residents weren\u2019t being taunted by a ghost, they were simply experiencing CO poisoning symptoms like hallucinations, blurred vision, and feelings of dread.\n\n#10\n\nA light in my house kept coming back on when I had turned off-couple who formerly had that room were dead\n\n\n\nFelt Someone brush past me in condo, former tenant had died\n\n\n\nSaw a mans face with long hair and old style clothes on my TV, realized the TV was off\n\n\n\nHad a problem with my son, saw him in front of me on a sofa smiling at me, that spooked me!\n\n\n\nWhen my oldest brother died, I was not able to attend his funeral, he appeared, smiling in a blue shirt. He was buried in a blue shirt. Was very comforting to me\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\nI dont know why I see and dream things.\n\nImage credits: Chance-Ad-9111\n\n#11\n\n100 year old farmhouse.\n\n\n\nI used to hear a odd bell like noise once in a while.\n\nImage credits: anon\n\n#12\n\nI don't live in an old house, I live in an apartment building that is 11 years old. There's a ghost in my apartment. Don't experience it very often but on occasion it will turn on my iPod. Occasionally there will be scratching coming from the craft room door. And every now and then you will hear a growl. Once saw what seemed to be a small white dog dash behind my sofa; I checked and both of my doggos were sleeping on a chair on the other side of the room.\n\nImage credits: eatyourdamndinner\n\nOf course, sometimes there is some evidence that might suggest paranormal activity, like pressure, magnetic or temperature variations, maybe even some inexplicable photo, video, or audio data. Yet, there\u2019s a possibility that, again, there\u2019s nothing paranormal, and it\u2019s just some other cause that science hasn\u2019t been able to discover yet.\n\nOr maybe there are actual ghosts, but they\u2019ve managed to stay under our science\u2019s radar. So far, who knows what the future holds?\n\n#13\n\nWe live in a 150 year old farmhouse. The first week we lived here, my iPhone was sitting 5 or 6 feet away from me, hadn't been touched in a while (like 20 minutes or more) and Siri just said \"You are in my realm\". There was no history of the phone saying this, or of any activity.\n\n\n\nA few months later, my cat woke my up, waited at the foot of my bed and kept meowing until I got out of the bed. She went to the top of the stairs, and waited until I followed. Followed her downstairs and she just sat in the middle of the room. I checked a few things to make sure something hadn't caught fire or whatever, while she just sat in the middle of the room looking up the staircase. The house was SO quiet it was eerie and disturbing, usually something makes a noise in this place. I turned around to go upstairs, and thought I stood in something wet and bent over to check, but it was just a weird spot that was so cold, I thought my socks were wet. When I stood up, I felt a hand on my right shoulder. Nobody was there.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoors occasionally open, and TV remotes constantly go missing. We've lost I think 5 now, and have never found one. Every single piece of furniture has been removed from the TV room during renovations, so it's not like something ended up in a void under the couch.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, I was at a flea market and bumped into a former co-worker I hadn't seen in quite a while (who ended up living just around the corner). She pointed at a couple and said to go introduce myself, as they lived in our house in the 80s. I introduced myself, said I live in their old house and they immediately asked how the ghost was doing! Apparently it had a thing for TV remotes back then as well.\n\nImage credits: bandi53\n\n#14\n\nMy sister and I were just reminiscing the other day about this house we grew up in. We lived in a townhouse in a complex of low income rental homes for most of our childhoods. Very bad vibes in general, none of the three of us kids were ever alone in any part of the house at any time because we were dead terrified to be. I peed the couch once because my mother refused to accompany me upstairs to the washroom, and I was too scared to go alone. The house was built more upwards that outwards so it was a long tall steep staircase and long hallways. The bathroom was at the end of the hallway, and you had to cross the hall at the top of the stairs to turn on the hall light.\n\n\n\nWe've collectively experienced a few events ranging from bad feelings, recurring nightmares, strange occurences, to apparitions. Strange events include my sister sleep walking to the top of the stairs and screaming at the top of her lungs that I was going to die. She never did sleep walk again and to her chagrin I am alive and well. Apparitions include the man sitting at the dining room table the morning of my birthday, and the child in the stairwell window that had no landing to stand on beneath it. That was the only time we saw our parents acknowledge we had a problem, because we were looking at it from outside the house. We were the driveway, all 5 of us and our dog in the car after a camping trip. We stayed with family friends that night.\n\nImage credits: NastyLittleHobbitses\n\n#15\n\nMy house and my house before this, both were very old, my best friend's great grandpa lived in my current one. I'll just say what happens here. Everyday, at 2:30PM to 3:00PM, I'll hear banging underneath my floorboards as if someone is under the house and trying to get help/trying to get me underneath to [end] or kidnap me. I constantly feel watched through my windows as if my neighbor is looking at me while I'm dancing or getting dressed or anything. My dogs will be walking out of my room and just randomly look down the hall as if someone is walking there, but nobody would be in that vicinity/would be home with me. And just last night, I put my hand near the edge of my bed and something that wouldn't move if my hand moved had moved and touched the palm of my hand.\n\nImage credits: I_Like_Tamakis_Ears\n\n#16\n\nWhen my mom was about 8 months pregnant with me, my parents were trying to decide on my name (they weren\u2019t sure whether I\u2019d be a boy or girl). So in my house, built in the 1800s, there\u2019s a mini room through this coat closet that has a window overlooking the creepy basement stares. Basically, this house is super wacky.\n\n\n\nMy two older siblings, both less than 5 at that point, were unable to write their own names at this point in life (important to the story). They would play in this weird room. My mom would clean up the room pretty regularly because of my siblings.\n\n\n\nMy mom and dad finally decided on the names \u201cjulia\u201d or \u201cgrace\u201d for if I was a girl. However, one day, my mom went in the room to clean, and \u201cJulia Grace\u201d was written on the wall. My mom swore there were ghosts in our house, but this felt like it confirmed everything. She panicked, painted over the names, and named me something else entirely.\n\nImage credits: soopersecretformula\n\n#17\n\nWhen I was about 4 yrs/old? My parents lived in an farm house. My two older brothers shared a bedroom upstairs. I slept in my parents room (I believe) which was downstairs. Both of my parents, and both of my brothers, claim that the story is true.\n\n\n\nOn various nights, in the dead of night, the window in my brother's room would suddenly fly open. The room to their door would open and shut. Then there would be footfalls on the landing (think open walkway that looks down onto the living area) towards the stairs. The footfalls would then go down the stairs.\n\n\n\nWhen my parents heard my brothers scream, then the footfalls on the landing, they would rush towards the stairs just to see... nothing. The footfalls always ended at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\n\nWe didn't live there long and finally moved into another house.\n\nImage credits: valeran46\n\n#18\n\nSo this has been happening recently the first encounter happened when i was playing with my 2 year old brother and i was chasing him into our L shaped hallway and i saw him take a left and went into my sisters room and when i went there to get him he wasnt there but turns out he went into my mums room.\n\n\n\nThe second encounter happend at night randomly for 3 weeks where sometimes i was awake and sometimes i was outcold but the times i was asleep would wake up with objects that had no chance of of falling off my draw like my laptop or art books and when i was awake i would see something run across my dark room and nock off small things like controlers.\n\n\n\nThis may not be as scary as the rest of the storys but this is my experience.\n\nImage credits: MrGoose6969\n\n#19\n\nThere were poltergeists in the apartment where I was living. We were three flatmates, one guy that did not believe in anything paranormal, and me and my best friend. I started hearing noises at night, our two bedrooms were side by side and there was something knocking from her side, like something made of glass. We investigated, turned out it was the bottles she kept in her room shaking by themselves at night. Got worse later. Some of her clothes were teleporting to my room when we were outside together. One day I was spending a week alone there, I heard my keys shaking on the door when I was trying to sleep. The morning after, I found the strap (5 centimeters long?) of my keys completely and tightly wrapped around the ring that was holding my keys together. Same day, there was a black mass in the corridor and the curtain of the bathtub was moving by itself, I still remember the sound it was making on the metal pipe. Nearly got an anxiety attack, I called my best friend and she came back early from her holidays to stay with me. My dad called a medium and a lady to make a spiritual cleanse.\n\nImage credits: Successful_Pea_1492\n\n#20\n\nI lived in my parents guest house when I was younger one night my kids were crying in the other room and I got up to check on them and they were on a bunk bed when I went in their room 2 shadow figurs were leaning over them and turned to me I screamed and ran towards them grabbed them with the shadow figures beside me and ran out I never screamed like that or felt fear like that before.\n\nImage credits: BeckoningCube1\n\n#21\n\nI had the odd experience growing up that my sceptical adult brain could probably chalk up to a wild imagination or something now, but it's interesting how my mum agreed with me that there was a presence in the house when I shared it with her. She told me she feels a presence in her bedroom sometimes, like she feels completely fine before she goes into the room and then when she passes through the door there's a strange feeling like there's someone there. It's always at the top of the stairs near my room and my parents' room. One time we were having construction done at the bottom of the stairs, my Dad saw something at the top of the landing, Mum says he jumped like he'd seen a -well- he'll deny all knowledge of that if you asked him about it now. We're not sure what exactly he saw, we only know whatever he did see scared someone who's usually quite bravely inclined.\n\n\n\nBut anyway, my experience is the only one I can vouch for. It most definitely could have been a trick of the light, but I'll let you all make up your minds, it's fun to speculate. I must've been about 15-16, I was lying in bed and the door was slightly ajar, it wasn't nighttime, but I was sleepy so I decided to take some time out. It's worth noting that everyone in the house was downstairs and we had a baby gate at the bottom of the stair's because my brother's children were over, I definitely would've heard people coming up our old creaky stairs because my room is the one closest to them (and they're old and creaky). So anyway I'm lying in bed looking at the door and I see a tall shadow travel from the stairs into my mum's room, from what I remember I think it eclipses the door completely. I remember picking my head up and calling \"mum?\", I remember how confused I was because I didn't hear the footsteps. I got up and looked around, there was no one upstairs.\n\n\n\nIf we're entertaining this as an apparition I don't think it's harmful or malicious. I've never felt in danger, but there are constantly shadows in my parents' room that we can't explain, it looks like a head and shoulders and nothing seems to be casting it, very spooky. I have loads of other experiences, but again, it's all speculation isn't it.\n\nImage credits: L3guana"

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "There's some positive news in advanced battery science thanks to hydrogen ions, or protons.\n\nThese positively charged particles can work inside a power pack to carry energy, similar to lithium ions but sans the expensive supply chain and invasive mining needed to gather the metal, according to a lab report from Australia's UNSW Sydney.\n\nA linchpin to the invention is the development of an organic anode material called tetraamino-benzoquinone, or TABQ, which can store the protons.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen batteries operate, ions move between the anode and cathode through a substance called electrolyte.\n\n\"Using this material, we successfully built an all-organic proton battery that is effective at both room temperature and sub-zero freezing temperatures,\" professor Chuan Zhao said.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are effective and cleaner than dirty fuels. When powering an electric vehicle, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that the rides are cleaner during their lifespans than gas cars, even when considering the costly and dirty supply chain for the hard-to-gather power pack parts.\n\nBut alternatives, from potassium to salt, sometimes have cheaper, safer, and even better-performing potential in greater temperature ranges.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing hydrogen ions is among the latest innovations from an expert lab. The UNSW Sydney team touted its tech as addressing fast charge and even safety concerns; lithium-ion packs are susceptible to rare yet serious fire risks.\n\n\"To enhance the usage of renewable energies, we have to develop some more efficient energy integration technologies and our proton battery design is a promising trial,\" doctoral candidate Sicheng Wu, who helped to develop TABQ, said.\n\nShould the U.S. invest more in battery innovations?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nTABQ was found in testing to support \"rapid proton movement using hydrogen-bond networks.\" The motion bodes well for energy density, or storage capacity per pound, as well as power output.\n\nThe anode research started with tetrachloro-benzoquinone, or TCBQ, according to the experts. The team modified some of its chemistry to create the useful TABQ anode. They combined it with a TCBQ cathode, garnering great results. The battery is reported to be able to last for 3,500 charge-discharge cycles and is well-suited for renewable energy storage, per the experts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cost savings are set to be realized as the concept is commercialized.\n\n\"If you just look at the TABQ material that we have designed, it's not necessarily cheap to produce at the moment,\" Zhao said. \"But because it's made of abundant light elements, it will be easy and affordable to eventually scale up.\"\n\nStoring intermittent energy from the sun, wind, and waves is necessary to transition to a cleaner power system, a switch already well underway. In the United States, renewables generate more than 20% of electricity, according to the government. Leveling off and reducing planet-warming fumes impacts our future in many ways, including education. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed overheating and other concerns in a fact sheet about the climate and young learners.\n\nCooling things down can start at home with some simple changes. Unplugging unused chargers and devices can prevent air pollution and save you upward of $165 a year, as one example.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt UNSW Sydney, the team said its hydrogen-ion battery can also provide a way to ship hydrogen as stored protons, an improvement on other more difficult transport methods.\n\n\"Our discovery has made this concept a possible reality,\" Zhao said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "We\u2019re only one week into 2025, but, already, OpenAI is having a tough year. Here is everything that\u2019s gone wrong for the influential company in the last seven days, and a quick look at the potential frustrations and headwinds that it faces as it heads into the new year.\n\nSam Altman\u2019s sister sues him\n\nAnnie Altman, the sister of the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, has sued the executive, accusing him of sexual abuse. The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri on Monday, makes claims that Altman abused his sister when she was three years old and he was 12. The suit claims that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts of sexual assault,\u201d Annie suffered \u201csevere emotional distress, mental anguish, and depression, which is expected to continue into the future.\u201d The suit asks for damages in excess of $75,000, as well as a jury trial.\n\nThe allegations of abuse have circulated the web for over a year and first gained mainstream attention in the days after Altman was controversially ousted from OpenAI (he would later be reinstated). The litigation has obviously pushed the claims to a much wider audience. Were the case to head to trial, it could prove disastrous for OpenAI from a PR perspective.\n\nAltman\u2019s family released a statement Wednesday responding to Annie\u2019s litigation. \u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refused conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d The statement, which Altman shared on X, further characterizes Annie as mentally unwell and financially motivated. It states that though the family has financially supported Annie for years and she \u201ccontinues to demand more money\u201d from them.\n\nA former employee\u2019s family accuses the company of murder\n\nIn recent weeks, the company has also been subjected to conspiracy theories that allege it murdered a former employee. The death of Suchir Balaji on November 26th inspired immediate suspicion, despite the fact that the San Francisco Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has dubbed the death a suicide. That\u2019s because, in the months before his death, Balaji acted as a corporate whistleblower, making claims that the company was breaking U.S. copyright law. Only a few weeks before his death, Balaji penned an online essay in which he claimed to show that the company\u2019s approach to content generation did not fall under the U.S. definition of \u201cfair use.\u201d\n\nWhile police have said that there is \u201cno evidence of foul play\u201d in Balaji\u2019s case, his family has claimed that he was murdered by OpenAI and has demanded that the FBI investigate his death. In an interview with The San Francisco Standard, the Balaji family relayed that they \u201cbelieved their son was murdered at the behest of OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a $100 billion industry that\u2019d be turned upside down by his testimony,\u201d said Poornima Ramarao, his mother. \u201cIt could be a group of people involved, a group of companies, a complete nexus.\u201d The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy hasn\u2019t been made publicly available yet.\n\nThe Cybertruck bomber allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his attack\n\nTo top things off, it was recently learned that the guy who blew himself up in a Cybertruck outside of Trump Tower used ChatGPT to plot the attack. Las Vegas police recently revealed details to reporters at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis is the first incident that I\u2019m aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\u201d said Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill. \u201cIt\u2019s a concerning moment.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly something that OpenAI is going to want to include in its ad copy (\u201cUseful for planning terrorist attacks!\u201d just doesn\u2019t have a great ring to it).\n\nPolitical headwinds\n\nOpenAI doesn\u2019t just face a slew of bizarre, splashy scandals, it also faces the political realities of Trump\u2019s second presidency. Elon Musk, the company\u2019s former founder (and investor) turned worst enemy, notably helped Trump win and is now enjoying unparalleled access to the federal government\u2019s levers of power. At the same time that he\u2019s been dubbed America\u2019s \u201cco-president,\u201d Musk is also waging a legal war on OpenAI that, while having been dubbed \u201cfrivolous\u201d by OpenAI, shows no signs of going anywhere.\n\nThe lawsuit that Musk filed last year alleges that the company has betrayed its original mission in favor of pursuing a for-profit business model (OpenAI did recently announce it would be ditching its original, weird structure to pursue a more traditional business strategy). When last we checked in on that litigation effort last November, Musk had expanded the lawsuit to include other entities close to OpenAI, including its backer, Microsoft.\n\nAt the same time, while Musk is engaged in the legal battle, and may be able to manipulate federal policy in ways that could prove disruptive to OpenAI, he can also leverage the soft power of his media platform, X, to damage the company\u2019s reputation. Indeed, Musk and his affiliates have seized on some of OpenAI\u2019s recent controversies, openly spreading damaging conspiracy theories. The Standard notes that, after Suchir Balaji died, Musk and others close to him helped to spread the conspiracy theories surrounding the coder\u2019s death: \u201cWhen Ramarao (Balaji\u2019s mother) tweeted about hiring the private investigator, Musk replied: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nThe fraught economics of OpenAI\n\nOpenAI\u2019s biggest dilemma may be less political than economic. That is, the massive amounts of money that are being used to prop up the company have left many onlookers wondering: Is OpenAI\u2019s business model even sustainable? Last year, the company self-reported that it lost some $5 billion, while garnering substantially less money in revenue. OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will grow to some $11 billion by the end of this year and will continue to explode exponentially in the years to come.\n\nIndeed, OpenAI has claimed that its revenue will reach $100 billion by the year 2029\u2014a mere four years from now. Granted, as a company, OpenAI has grown at breakneck speed (its revenue jumped 1,700 percent in the space of a year, the New York Times has reported), though skeptics still see its projections as PR fantasies designed to draw in perpetual cash infusions from true believers in the venture capital realm. Blogger Ed Zitron, who has referred to OpenAI as an \u201cunsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company,\u201d notes that the company\u2019s own estimations of its future revenue capacity are \u201cfucking ridiculous.\u201d Firmly repping the doubter camp, Zitron writes:\n\n\u2026the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it\u2019s not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1.\n\nZitron notes that OpenAI seems to make a majority of its revenue from subscriptions to ChatGPT, which doesn\u2019t seem to be making enough money to make up for its ongoing losses. OpenAI also makes money by licensing usage of its algorithmic models for use in software products. As it is, it doesn\u2019t matter if their revenue increases if the cost of providing service remains so high. Sure, it could jack up prices, but OpenAI has competitors with deep pockets and similar benchmarks.\n\nIn short: OpenAI has its work cut out for it. Beset by powerful adversaries, ongoing lawsuits, and looming scandals that could prove disastrous for the company\u2019s brand, the company needs to prove that the media hype that carried it through the last few years can actually translate into cold hard dollars and cents. It\u2019s unclear, at this point at least, how it\u2019s going to do that."

            "article_content": "Great, here\u2019s the entitled journalist telling me that the $2,000 graphics card won CES 2025. I\u2019ve seen plenty of strong opinions about Nvidia\u2019s CES announcements online, but even ignoring the bloated price of the new RTX 5090, Nvidia won this year\u2019s show. And it kind of won by default. Between Intel\u2019s barebones announcements and an overstuffed AMD presentation that ignored what might be AMD\u2019s most important GPU launch ever, it\u2019s not surprising that Team Green came out ahead.\n\nBut that\u2019s despite the insane price of the RTX 5090, not because of it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nNvidia introduced a new range of graphics cards, and the impressive multi-frame generation of DLSS 4, but its announcements this year were much more significant than that. It all comes down to the ways that Nvidia is leveraging AI to make PC games better, and the fruits of that labor may not pay off immediately.\n\nThere are the developer-facing tools like Neural Materials and Neural Texture Compression, both of which Nvidia briefly touched on during its CES 2025 keynote. For me, however, the standout is neural shaders. They certainly aren\u2019t as exciting as a new graphics card, at least on the surface, but neural shaders have massive implications for the future of PC games. Even without the RTX 5090, that announcement alone is significant enough for Nvidia to steal this year\u2019s show.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nNeural shaders aren\u2019t some buzzword, though I\u2019d forgive you for thinking that given the force-feeding of AI we\u2019ve all experienced over the past couple of years. First, let\u2019s start with the shader. If you aren\u2019t familiar, shaders are essentially the programs that run on your GPU. Decades ago, you had fixed-function shaders; they could only do one thing. In the early 2000s, Nvidia introduced programmable shaders that had far greater capabilities. Now, we\u2019re starting with neural shaders.\n\nIn short, neural shaders allow developers to add small neural networks to shader code. Then, when you\u2019re playing a game, those neural networks can be deployed on the Tensor cores of your graphics card. It unlocks a boatload of computing horsepower that, up to this point, had fairly minimal applications in PC games. They were really just fired up for DLSS.\n\nIntroducing NVIDIA RTX Kit: Transforming Rendering with AI and Path Tracing\n\nNvidia has uses for neural shaders that it has announced so far \u2014 the aforementioned Neural Materials and Neural Texture Compression, and Neural Radiance Cache. I\u2019ll start with the last one because it\u2019s the most interesting. The Neural Radiance Cache essentially allows AI to guess what an infinite number of light bounces in a scene would look like. Now, path tracing in real time can only handle so many light bounces. After a certain point, it becomes too demanding. Neural Radiance Cache not only unlocks more realistic lighting with far more bounces but also improves performance, according to Nvidia. That\u2019s because it only requires one or two light bounces. The rest are inferred from the neural network.\n\nSimilarly, Neural Materials compresses dense shader code that would normally be reserved for offline rendering, allowing what Nvidia calls \u201cfilm-quality\u201d assets to be rendered in real time. Neural Texture Compression applies AI to texture compression, which Nvidia says saves 7x the memory as traditional block-based compression without any loss in quality.\n\nThat\u2019s just three applications of neural networks being deployed in PC games, and there are already big implications for how well games can run and how good they can look. It\u2019s important to remember that this is the starting line, too \u2014 AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all have AI hardware on their GPUs now, and I suspect there will be quite a lot of development on what kinds of neural networks can go into a shader in the future.\n\nMaybe there are cloth or physics simulations that are normally run on the CPU that can be run through a neural network on Tensor cores. Or maybe you can expand the complexity of meshes by inferring triangles that the GPU doesn\u2019t need to account for. There are the visible applications of AI, such as through non-playable characters, but neural shaders open up a world of invisible AI that makes rendering more efficient, and therefore, more powerful.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the sauce of CES. If you were to believe every executive keynote, you would walk away with literally thousands of \u201cground-breaking\u201d innovations that barely manage to move a patch of dirt. Neural shaders don\u2019t fit into that category. There are already three very practical applications of neural shaders that Nvidia is introducing, and people much smarter than myself will likely dream up hundreds more.\n\nI should be clear, though \u2014 that won\u2019t come right away. We\u2019re only seeing the very surface of what neural shaders could be capable of in the future, and even then, it\u2019ll likely be multiple years and graphics card generations down the road before their impact is felt. But when looking at the landscape of announcements from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel, only one company introduced something that could really be worthy of that \u201cground-breaking\u201d title, and that\u2019s Nvidia."

            "article_content": "Grain prices have gotten off to a positive start in 2025, continuing the vein of form they found in December.\n\nEuropean prices are seeing the main lift, while UK and US prices have seen some falls. US prices were positive this week.\n\nThe French wheat price for December 2025 was at \u20ac233.75/t on Wednesday afternoon this week. It was relatively steady since the end of last week.\n\nOn 20 December, that price was at \u20ac226.75/t. It increased to \u20ac230.25/t on 27 December and on 3 January moved to \u20ac232.75/t.\n\nThe Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) in the UK is not predicting any big move in prices in the coming months.\n\nCommenting on wheat prices this week, it said: \u201cUnfavourable weather in the US and Russia, plus maize concerns in Argentina, offer support to prices short term.\n\n\u201cBut harvest pressures in the southern hemisphere may limit longer-term price gains.\u201d\n\nMaize prices have remained up in Europe and have gone back up in the US.\n\nHigh maize prices are generally a good thing for grain prices in Ireland, as maize becomes less attractive in animal feed if it is more expensive than wheat or barley.\n\nThere are concerns about the maize crop in Argentina, but a large crop is expected from Brazil so this may offset losses.\n\nFeed barley prices in France had moved up over the Christmas period, but went back down this week to \u20ac202/t in some regions.\n\nThe FOB Creil price for spring malting barley is steady at \u20ac240/t. It looks like there is very little trading happening in that market at present.\n\nOilseed rape\n\nHigh oil prices may be helping rapeseed prices. However, a large soybean crop could affect the rapeseed price. However, hot and dry weather is reported to be damaging soy bean crops in Argentina.\n\nOn 20 December, the November French oilseed rape price was at \u20ac464/t.\n\nIt moved to \u20ac461/t on 27 December, but on 3 January had increased to \u20ac470/t. On Wednesday afternoon this week, it had moved up again to \u20ac477.25/t.\n\nNative prices\n\nAt home, prices have been rising slowly but steadily. In November spot barley was reported around \u20ac220/t to \u20ac225/t.\n\nIn December, it moved to \u20ac230/t and in early January it is now at \u20ac230/t to \u20ac235/t.\n\nSpot wheat is also reported to have increased to \u20ac245/t to \u20ac250/t. November prices are looking similar to these prices.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the AHDB reported a spot barley price of \u00a3201/t on 3 January and a forward price for February of \u00a3204/t. All of these prices are dried unless otherwise stated."

We may get a commission if you buy through our links.\n\nMicrosoft is starting strong the new year, pedaling hard on AI. According to a new blog post, the software giant is laying out the next big 6 trends that will shape the industry and workplaces by using AI agents.\n\nAI is poised for its next major leap. Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024, with organizations achieving a return of $3.70 for every $1 invested. AI is expected to contribute $2.7 trillion to Europe\u2019s GDP by 2030, as adoption accelerates, and businesses unlock value in as little as 13 months.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s predictions are mostly based on the latest IDC study cited in another blog post from the Redmont giant.\n\nHere are the key AI trends for 2025 according to Microsoft\n\n1. More capable and useful AI models\n\nMicrosoft believes that the AI models will continue to evolve into more capable version that will help solve a lot of complex problems in all areas including science, healthcare and even law. Generating code, executing workflows efficiently and comparing contracts will become the advanced tasks for the AI agents that will push forward the organization\u2019s productivity.\n\n2. The AI bots will redefine the work\n\nAn obvious prediction for AI agents is that they will take on the repetitive tasks that we don\u2019t want to deal with anymore. Microsoft mentions IT troubleshooting and workflow optimization, along with building workflows and writing code for developers that will only need to provide final touches to it. That makes a lot of sense, and we can already see a development in all those areas.\n\n3. AI agents will become our everyday companions\n\nAs you might have thought, Microsoft thinks that Copilot and its features such as Vision will become your new close buddy, providing all the information you need. Moreover, the bot will also discuss with you and disseminate the information to make things a lot more engaging and comprehensible.\n\nWhile we can see this going on in the future, probably 2025 is not the year this will suddenly happening. According to a Business of apps usage statistics, about 300 million people used AI apps in 2024. That includes all AI apps, not just Copilot.\n\nAccording to the same study, in October 2024, Copilot had 28 million active users and in September, the AI bot had 37 million visits. Those are hardly numbers to brag when we\u2019re talking about a solution becoming mainstream. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Copilot can\u2019t be your friend if you want to, but we can\u2019t talk about AI agents starting to be every day companions.\n\n4. AI development will become more sustainable\n\nRight now, AI models use a lot of power and water to cool down those servers and the next major prediction is that the AI business will become more sustainable.\n\nMicrosoft is advancing green AI, building data centers that use zero water for cooling and operate on carbon-free energy sources like wind, geothermal, nuclear, and solar power. By 2030, Microsoft aims to be a carbon-negative, water-positive, and zero-waste company.\n\nThe only scary thing in the Microsoft rhetoric is nuclear, mentioned as a carbon-free energy source. Knowing the basics about this power source from the 80\u2019s, although being efficient, the nuclear powerplants still generate a disturbing amount of waste that we didn\u2019t yet learn how to dispose of properly.\n\n5. AI will be better kept in check\n\nThe most important problem right now with AI is that it doesn\u2019t really have any serious guardrails. Microsoft is seeing a change in 2025 for that aspect and it\u2019s testing how to address AI inaccuracies and limit the potential destructive power of AI being used irresponsibly.\n\nAlthough Microsoft is taking that task upon themselves, there are AI bots out there that can be customized in any aspect possible, providing means for wrongdoers to perform cyberattacks and other destructive actions.\n\n6. AI models will lead to scientific breakthroughs\n\nWith AI being very effective in performing a lot of calculations, it\u2019s reasonable to think that the computational models already have an impact in science discoveries. Microsoft\u2019s point is that along with improved models new innovations in research will also follow. They mention climate change study and public health being the major domains for development.\n\nLastly, Microsoft envisions a new era between AI models and agents led by an improvement on how Ai models will be trained.\n\nWith Microsoft investing billions of dollars into AI, we will clearly see new advancements in AI models and research. Whether or not 2025 will mark a cornerstone for AI remains to be seen. However, users don\u2019t seem so enthusiastic about using it so far. Actually, Copilot with its Windows Recall might be one of the reasons why Windows 10 users are not so keen in upgrading to Windows 11 just yet.\n\nWhat do you think about Microsoft\u2019s AI predictions for 2025? Let us know in the comments below."

The young bull kill reduced by 11,585 head \u2013 almost a 10% reduction on the 2023 number.\n\nThe bullock kill was back by almost 2% or 12,556 head to 681,377.\n\nThe cow kill took an unexpected lift in 2024 with nitrates issues forcing disposals on some farms, especially in the south of the country.\n\nThe continued decline in the suckler herd also drove numbers. The cow kill finished up 7% or almost up 30,000 head on the 2023 number.\n\nCalf slaughtering dropped by almost 10,000 head in 2024, down 32% on 2023 to just over 20,000 head in 2024.\n\nNumbers of cattle moving north for slaughter have dropped off in recent weeks. There were just over 26,000 cattle exported for direct slaughter in 2024, with the current price differential expected to drive numbers in 2025 as well.\n\nBeef quotes across the water continue to improve, with quotes up 10p to 15p/kg from before Christmas. Some large feeders have been able to get \u00a35.65/kg (\u20ac7.18/kg incl VAT) for in-spec stock this week, which is a big improvement on pre-Christmas quotes. A gap of over \u20ac1/kg remains between the English and Irish beef price.\n\nNI comment\n\nQuotes are on 516p/kg (\u20ac6.51/kg inc VAT) for U3 cattle, although 530p/kg (\u20ac6.69/kg) is widely available as a starting price with 4p to 10p/kg more on offer depending on numbers. Good-quality cows are on 420p to 450p/kg (\u20ac5.30 to \u20ac5.68/kg)."

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Microsoft, the tech giant famous for innovation and its large workforce, has confirmed it will be reducing a small percentage of jobs in different departments based on performance.\n\nThis latest layoff is not a massive reduction but may signal a change in the strategy at Microsoft as it responds to the changing demands of the tech and AI competition.\n\nJob Cuts at Microsoft: The Details You Need to Know\n\nMicrosoft confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that less than 1% of its 228,000 employees will be affected by these latest job cuts. CNBC reports that sources familiar with the situation said layoffs are part of a broader performance evaluation strategy, aiming to optimize its workforce without major upheavals.\n\nFor context, this is the latest development in a round of layoffs coming after Microsoft's restructuring announcements. In early 2023, it made the news with a record layoff of 10,000 employees alongside office lease consolidation.\n\nWhen Microsoft post-acquired Activision Blizzard in January 2024, its gaming unit witnessed 1,900 job losses due to position overlap. Though the present layoff is small, they do draw attention in the context of Microsoft's overall performance.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Microsoft's Market Performance\n\nWhile Microsoft continues to record great financial performance, the stock performance of the company in 2023 trailed its tech peers. Although a near-record net income margin of 38%, its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft's stock only rose by 12% compared to 29% in the Nasdaq for the same period. It has triggered speculation on the company's future course and its potential to continue with growth in a competitive technology market.\n\nMicrosoft's Ties with OpenAI\n\nThe gargantuan rise of Microsoft's market cap last year was in significant part as a result of its relationship with the artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has invested over $13 billion into the firm and will now play a significant role in a new revolution in AI. At the close of 2024, there seems to be increasingly increasing tensions between the two.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently spoke on this \"cooperation tension\" in which he admitted OpenAI, an already formidable rival in its own right, had the potential to upset Microsoft's market position with its AI plays. The stakes are high and at a turning point for the company's AI strategy, considering the company's current role within the fast-moving AI sector.\n\nSlow Rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot Worrisome to Investors?\n\nOne area of focus for Microsoft's future growth is its Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which leverages OpenAI's technology to integrate artificial intelligence into the company's productivity suite. However, early feedback suggests that the rollout of Copilot has been slower than expected.\n\nAnalysts from UBS recently noted that Microsoft's presentation at its Ignite conference in late 2023 left them with the impression that Copilot's adoption in the business world had been \"underwhelming.\"\n\nAs businesses increasingly look for AI-driven tools to improve productivity, Microsoft's ability to scale Copilot and similar offerings will be critical to its long-term success.\n\nThe company is under pressure to prove that its AI investments will yield substantial returns, particularly as it faces growing competition from other tech giants.\n\nHowever, despite the obstacles, Microsoft looks at the bright side of things. Its finance chief, Amy Hood, stressed that revenue growth in its Azure cloud services will increase in 2024 because of the rise in the expansion of AI infrastructure capacity.\n\nAzure's cloud platform is an integral part of Microsoft's long-term strategy, and it's setting up for the speedy expansion of AI and cloud-based services in the years ahead.\n\nWhile the recent job cuts may be seen as a short-term adjustment, Microsoft's focus on AI and cloud services indicates that it is preparing for a huge transformation in the tech landscape."

            "article_content": "The cybersecurity industry is in a turbulent period. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly powerful, the threat landscape has been entirely transformed, as hackers, bristling with AI tools, constantly probe organizations for weakness.\n\nIn the face of these AI-wielding hackers, cybersecurity professionals have sought to fight fire with fire, using machine learning to detect, neutralize and prevent these threats. This strategy has enabled often under-funded and under-skilled corporate cybersecurity teams to plug the gaps and hold the line.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a creeping threat in this new AI-first cybersecurity era \u2014 one that risks slowly exposing companies to malicious actors without them even realizing it. As corporate cybersecurity experts clamor to integrate AI as comprehensively as possible, there\u2019s a genuine risk that the teaching and learning of foundational cybersecurity skills falls by the wayside, leading to a generation of under-skilled cybersecurity professionals.\n\nThe recent explosion of generative AI tools has been Christmas come early for hackers around the world. You now no longer need to be an expert coder or software developer to pump out phishing campaigns, deepfakes and malware at a rate unheard of only a few years ago, when the sheer volume of threats produced by hackers with AI-enabled tools threatened to overwhelm corporate cybersecurity completely.\n\nAI vs. Hackers: The New Cybersecurity Arms Race\n\nAs with any arms race though, innovation from one side breeds an adaptive response in the other. Cybersecurity professionals quickly recognized the oncoming tsunami of phishing, deepfakes and malware, and rapidly rolled out AI-powered defensive tools, such as detectors, watermarks and machine learning predictions.\n\nThis has, for now, protected most companies. There have been, of course, several high-profile breaches. But this has been a trickle, rather than a torrent. The flood defenses are holding \u2014 for now, at least.\n\nHowever, the foundation of these defenses is not the AI tools themselves \u2014 it's the underlying cybersecurity skills and principles behind them that guide their use. And it\u2019s these foundational skills that are being eroded away by an over-reliance and blind faith in the capabilities of AI to face down the new threats that corporations face.\n\nA root cause of this internal cybersecurity brain drain is one of the greatest promises of AI \u2014 \u201cefficiencies.\u201d Corporate decision makers across the world are looking to reorganize their businesses along AI\u2019s capabilities. While no bad thing in and of itself, when applied to cybersecurity, this inevitably means that fewer hard resources get directed where they need to be, and more skilled professionals with years of experience and knowledge are sacrificed at the altar of AI-driven efficiency.\n\nThe Hidden Cost of AI Reliance: A Decline in Cyber Expertise\n\nToday\u2019s security analysts, for example, rely on AI tools to flag suspicious login attempts. However, without the required foundational understanding of how algorithms function, they could easily fail to recognize false positives, or the worse flip-side of that, fail to recognize sophisticated threats posing as normal activity. Or incident response teams, a critical part of any organization\u2019s cyber defense, might refer to AI-driven recommendations without fully comprehending the wider context in which an attack takes place. This will lead to incomplete remediation and persistent vulnerabilities.\n\nSo corporate cybersecurity is left in a double bind: the more that we depend on AI, the less equipped we leave ourselves to handle its inevitable failures. The solution seems counterintuitive and anachronistic: in an age of AI, the path to organizational resilience is to double down on the human.\n\nFirstly, organizations must reinvest in cybersecurity training. For far, far too long, cyber training throughout the organization has meant a couple of annual compliance procedures where employees are shown what a phishing email looks like.\n\nThis is not enough. Whole organizations \u2014 from the shop floor, right up to the CEO \u2014 need to be taught robust, hands-on cybersecurity skills. Obviously, this includes phishing attempts, but it also means understanding the basics of things like network security, malware and response best practices.\n\nManagement at major corporations has been too happy to delegate cybersecurity to the CIO and a siloed team of experts tucked away in a dark, dusty office somewhere. The whole company needs to step up and think critically about what they encounter in the cyber realm.\n\nUltimately, this leadership must come from the top, with the CEO setting the tone by emphasizing that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility across the organization. C-suite executives must actively commit to upskilling themselves in this critical area, rather than leaving it solely to the IT team.\n\nSecondly, C-suite executives will have to roll out an active strategy to cultivate specialist cybersecurity expertise at their firms. They need to start hiring professionals with deep, domain-specific cybersecurity knowledge that AI can\u2019t replicate \u2014 skills like threat hunting, penetration testing and reverse engineering malware, are all critical to organizational resiliency but badly performed by AI. Executives need to implement a comprehensive recruitment and retention strategy to hunt out these experts, bring them under their roofs, and then keep them there.\n\nLeveraging AI to Enhance, Not Replace, Human Expertise\n\nFinally, corporate cybersecurity strategy needs to be based on the principle that AI enhances, rather than replaces human capacities. AI can and should be deployed to speed up repetitive tasks like log analysis. However, there should always be skilled professionals in the loop to review AI-generated insights and to ensure that decisions are made based on all the information available.\n\nThere\u2019s an optimum middle ground, where AI at the fingertips of skilled professionals enhances and complements cyber defensive capabilities \u2014 currently the pendulum has swung too far in one direction, and executives are happy to neglect conventional cyber skills in the blind faith that AI will solve all.\n\nAI is not a panacea. It is a hugely powerful tool that has the capacity to greatly shore up a company\u2019s cyber defenses. But it also has the potential to blind executives as they are sucked into the AI black hole where little else escapes. Corporate leaders need to wake up and ensure their company falls into the former category rather than the latter \u2014 or they\u2019ll likely find their organizations are the next to suffer a high-profile breach."

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said Thursday that more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war, with no end in sight to the 15-month conflict.\n\nThe ministry said a total of 46,006 Palestinians have been killed and 109,378 wounded. It has said women and children make up more than half the fatalities, but does not say how many of the dead were fighters or civilians.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. It blames Hamas for their deaths because it says the militants operate in residential areas.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians are now packed into sprawling tent camps along the coast with limited access to food and other essentials. Israel has also repeatedly struck what it claims are militants hiding in shelters and hospitals, often killing women and children.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting around 250. A third of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be dead.\n\nIn Lebanon, the parliament voted Thursday to elect the country\u2019s army commander, Joseph Aoun, as head of state, filling a more than two-year-long presidential vacuum.\n\nThe vote came weeks after a tenuous ceasefire agreement halted a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and at a time when Lebanon\u2019s leaders are seeking international assistance for reconstruction.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nLebanese parliament elects army commander as president\n\nBEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon\u2019s parliament voted Thursday to elect the country\u2019s army commander, Joseph Aoun, as head of state, filling a more than two-year-long presidential vacuum.\n\nThe session was the legislature\u2019s 13th attempt to elect a successor to former President Michel Aoun \u2014 no relation to the army commander \u2014 whose term ended in October 2022.\n\nThe vote came weeks after a tenuous ceasefire agreement halted a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and at a time when Lebanon\u2019s leaders are seeking international assistance for reconstruction.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAoun was widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need to ensure that Israel withdraws its forces from southern Lebanon as stipulated in the agreement and to fund the post-war rebuilding.\n\nDeath toll in Gaza surpasses 46,000, health ministry officials say\n\nMore than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said Thursday. The ministry said a total of 46,006 Palestinians have been killed and 109,378 wounded.\n\nIt has said women and children make up more than half the fatalities, but did not say how many of the dead were fighters or civilians.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Those ranked brigadier general or above can be identified, but must receive prior guidelines.\n\nAny filming in combat zones also must be approved by the military\u2019s legal department.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIsrael has barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza outside of embeds organized by the military.\n\nThe military recently warned soldiers against posting on social media after legal action over alleged war crimes was initiated against a soldier who was visiting Brazil.\n\nIsrael says it is operating in accordance with international law in Gaza and makes every effort to avoid harming civilians. But soldiers have posted dozens of photos and videos that appear to show them rummaging through homes and burning or blowing up residential buildings.\n\nThe military says it investigates and punishes any violations of military conduct. It says Hamas has built extensive military infrastructure in civilian areas, necessitating the demolition of buildings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe army says it is working on additional guidelines for soldiers on what they can post to social media.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza will attend Trump inauguration\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Family members of Americans being held hostage in Gaza are planning to attend President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration later this month.\n\nRepresentatives for the family members said they plan to meet with officials in the incoming Trump administration and members of Congress to urge them to prioritize the safe return of the hostages.\n\nSeven Americans are among the dozens of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nTrump has sent his incoming special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, to Qatar this week for additional talks to work on their release. The Republican president-elect has threatened Hamas by warning that \u201cAll hell will break out\u201d if the hostages aren't released."

            "article_content": "The leading PC manufacturer used the Consumer Electronics Show to showcase their latest line-up of AI PCs powered by neural processing units (NPU). HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer and Asus all demoed new AI PC offerings at the Las Vegas event.\n\nHP unveiled the Z2 Mini and ZBook Ultra, which the company claims enables users to engage in 3D design, render graphics-intensive projects simultaneously, and work locally with LLMs.\n\nThe new HP hardware is powered by AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO processor. HP said the ZBook Ultra offers features up to 16 desktop-class CPU cores, discrete-like integrated graphics, and up to 128GB of innovative unified memory architecture, and the ability to assign up to 96GB RAM to the graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nLenovo used the event to demonstrate the enhanced user experience available on the Intel Core Ultra-powered Lenovo AI Now and Lenovo Aura Edition PCs.\n\nLenovo AI Now on the company\u2019s flagship ThinkPad X9 offers what Lenovo calls \u201can advanced on-device AI assistant\u201d to deliver real-time intelligence to users. Built on a local large language model (LLM) using Meta\u2019s Llama 3.0, Lenovo AI Now stores and processes all user data locally, which Lenovo said safeguards user information while delivering powerful, real-time AI capabilities. Lenovo said it can be used to automate and simplify tasks such as document organisation and device management, supporting AI applications such as natural language queries across locally stored documents.\n\nThe company said it will be expanding Lenovo AI Now\u2019s capabilities with the ability to search for information across PCs and supported tablet devices, and an intelligent search capability for retrieving relevant information from selected portions of images or documents.\n\nDell has focused on simplifying AI development on PCs. Its new Dell Pro AI Studio offers an AI toolkit with validated tools, frameworks, templates and models, to help developers and IT administrators build and manage AI software independent of the underlying silicon. Dell claims this can reduce development and deployment time by as much as 75%, going from six months to as little as six weeks.\n\nAcer\u2019s new Copilot+ lineup includes the Swift Go 16 AI and Swift Go 14 AI laptops and the Aspire C AI AIOs. These are powered by AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors. The hardware uses the AMD XDNA 2 NPU architecture, which Acer said delivers up to 50 TOPS (tera operations per second) of AI performance and includes AMD Radeon 800M graphics. According to Acer, the new Swift Go AI laptops are able to run efficiently and reliably for all-day use with a battery life of up to 24.9 hours of video playback. It has also introduced the Intel Core-powered Aspire S AI and Revo Box AI devices.\n\nBeyond x86-based AI PCs, Asus unveiled its Snapdragon-powered Zenbook A14. This device uses the Snapdragon X Series Processors and offers up to 45W TDP performance along with a neural processing capability of 45 TOPS. Asus claims it offers up to 32 hours of battery life, which can be further extended or customised with MyASUS Battery Care Mode. The device includes 2 USB 4.0 ports, an audio jack, a type-A port and an HDMI port."

They litter the Old Testament and the New; once you start seeing them, you can\u2019t stop.\n\nA modern example of a short chiasm would be If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Jesus makes a pithy chiastic statement in Mark 2:27: \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nBut most chiastic structures are longer than one line, sometimes stretching across entire chapters, with a hinge point in the middle. Westerners are accustomed to a conclusion landing at the end, like the moral of the story or the punchline of a joke, but the ancient Near Eastern mind liked to embed the main idea dead center.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognize this structure as we read Scripture, from the Psalms to the words of Jesus, we risk placing the emphasis on the wrong point. As a Bible teacher, I see how chiasms honor the truism that repetition is the mother of learning. Chiasms are memory aids, God\u2019s kindness to past generations of worshipers who likely never held Scripture in their hands as well as to modern Christians in our distracted age. They are meant to help us remember.\n\nModern readers may wonder why this particular form of parallelism appealed so heavily to the ancient Near Eastern mind. I certainly did\u2014that is, until my mother died.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to take me to this appointment.\u201d I looked over at my diminutive 79-year-old mother, perched in the passenger seat, eyes apologetic, fretting with her purse.\n\nLike many in her generation, my mom found it difficult to accept even help that was easy to supply. \u201cYou are a person to love, not a problem to solve\u201d had become my mantra to her each time she expressed dismay at having interrupted my life in any way.\n\nBefore you begin to assume that my mother and I had an enviable relationship, let me say we did not\u2014but through much hard work, we found a real sweetness together in her final years. In December of 2021, her kids and grandkids moved her into an apartment five minutes from my home. We set up her antique furniture, hung her favorite pictures, and put out her favorite vase, the one with wisteria around the rim. I was excited to be able to drop in or run errands for her so easily.\n\nI planned a family dinner for her 80th birthday that January. Three days before it, she texted that she had a stomach bug and wasn\u2019t sure she would make it. She assured me she was fine. Please don\u2019t come over. But she was sicker than she thought.\n\nHer birthday passed in the ICU, and a week later she was placed on palliative care, coming home to my house for hospice. No more beeping monitors and sterile overhead lights. No more masks and visitor restrictions. Instead, a room flooded with sunshine, warm with color, and filled with loved ones.\n\nShe was, at this point, no longer communicative. But I knew if she could have spoken, she would have repeated the words she had strained to say again and again during her brief hospital stay: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to be a burden.\u201d\n\nMy brothers and I took our place at her bedside to keep a vigil familiar to many reading this. We listened as her breathing became more and more labored with each passing day. We witnessed the hard work of dying.\n\nOn the second day, the hospice nurse told me, \u201cYou know, you can coach her. Give her encouragement. Tell her she\u2019s doing well.\u201d I played her favorite hymns. I held her hand. I helped keep her clean and comfortable. I whispered a thousand times, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home. You\u2019re a person to love, not a problem to solve.\u201d\n\nAt last, she reached the end of her travail. A final deep exhale, a crashing silence.\n\nAnd it hit me: the marvelous and terrible symmetry of a long human life.\n\nEighty years earlier, hadn\u2019t she entered this world in a similar way\u2014through a great labor, with a deep inhale and a piercing wail? Had she not received much the same care in the hours after her birth that we provided in the hours before her death?\n\nI suspect the reason the ancients loved a chiasm was because it is the recognizable shape of the sweep of life. Perhaps God, in his kindness, designed it to be such. Bookends. Repetition. Symmetry.\n\nI reasoned that the other concentric layers of a human life could be mapped as well. Every human life is unique, but what might be the general pattern? I sketched out my thoughts.\n\nThe chiasm of a human life. The idea is not unique to me. I recall the saying that we are first children to our parents, then parents to our children, then parents to our parents, and finally children to our children.\n\nIf life is a chiasm, and if chiasms teach, what does the chiasm of life seek to teach us? If we become students of it, I believe it can \u201cteach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom\u201d (Ps. 90:12).\n\nRemembering that seasons of life follow a patterned order helps us inhabit the season we are in and prioritize how to use the time we are given. Since death announced its presence in Genesis 3, our days have been numbered. Perhaps God, in his infinite kindness, gave us a chiasm, a patterned measuring rod, to number those days rightly.\n\nKnowing that aging means the relinquishing of freedoms and abilities helps us embrace that process rather than hold onto self-reliance. It helps us to anticipate the next season, to savor the one we are in, and to be grateful for the ones we have already left behind.\n\nRecognizing that in some seasons we give care and in some we receive care helps us accept care when it\u2019s our turn to receive. We are not problems to solve in our extreme age any more than we were in our infancy. We are simply people to love, in a stage when others repay a debt of care they themselves received in their time.\n\nThe chiastic structure of life explains why we feel such shock when a life is cut short. We expect intuitively that human life should make a full arc. The asymmetry of a young or untimely death creates dissonance. No bookend. No parallel. No full circle. My mother\u2019s death was a good one by many measures, not least because of its blessed symmetry.\n\nBut if a chiasm puts the main point at the middle, how are our middle years noteworthy? Midlife offers a unique opportunity, a moment of perspective at the crossroads. If we have paid close attention to how we entered the chiasm, we will be better able to exit it with grace and submission. Looking back over the first half of life can help us anticipate the second half\u2014in both its losses and its gains.\n\nIf we focus just on our abilities and responsibilities, we see only gains in the first half of the chiasm of life and only parallel losses in the second. In a culture that values youth and vigor, we risk losing sight of what we learn over the years: wisdom. The wisdom of aging means that even as our bodies increasingly fail us, our internal lives grow richer and steadier. Bodies decline, but people develop.\n\nAt 55, I can already track the decline in my physical abilities. I am still in a stage where I am the supplier of help to others, but if the Lord grants me length of years, I will one day be only a recipient\u2014fed and clothed and cared for by someone else\u2019s hands and feet.\n\nThe days in which my body can yield help to others are numbered, and I want to number them rightly. My parents have helped me with the math. Watching them pass into old age has brought into focus for me the preciousness of the years I have left. My earliest caregivers have moved to receiving care. Their physical abilities grow more limited, but their insights are deepening.\n\nThey are the evidence to me that, while failing joints and heart valves and eyesight and hearing may increasingly unsteady our bodies, wisdom increasingly steadies our souls. Bodies decline, people develop. The lamp of wisdom burns brighter as the oil of life experience grows in supply.\n\nFor the believer, old age is an invitation toward burgeoning luminosity.\n\nIn my attic is a relic of days gone by: a cassette player my husband owned as a teen. In the living room is another relic\u2014the vase with wisteria trim. My mother\u2019s, passed on to me. It\u2019s not of enormous value, but unlike its electronic upstairs neighbor, its value is steadily growing with age.\n\nHere is where we bump into the problem with the way our culture views not just aging but also the elderly. My husband, Jeff, and I are affectionately called \u201cthe Olds\u201d by our kids, who thankfully still seek our advice and who regard us as a source of wisdom obtained through length of years. But our children are increasingly the exception.\n\nSo many cultural shifts have happened in so little time that many parents and children are estranged by their differing views. Whereas one\u2019s elders used to be seen as those increasing in wisdom with every passing year, they are now likely to be seen as increasingly obsolete (\u201cOkay, boomer\u201d). Less like a vase, more like a cassette player.\n\nWhen I listen to my 84-year-old father\u2019s advice, it occurs to me that he always waits patiently for me to end my question before responding. At 55, I often sit with a younger person to hear about their difficulty in marriage, parenting, or ministry; recognize a familiar pattern a few minutes into the telling; and, at the right moment, offer the same advice I have given on similar occasions.\n\nWe have a way of hitting the same roadblocks. If I have acquired a modest level of wisdom in middle age, how much more does my father hold at 84? There is godly wisdom, a gift God grants, but there is also the wisdom of age\u2014gained by sheer length of years and attention to those around us.\n\nThe wisdom of age is the basis for the fifth commandment\u2019s requirement to honor father and mother, a command given not to children, as we often assume, but to adults. (Note that the commands following it deal with the very adult sins of murder, adultery, theft, bearing false witness, and covetousness.)\n\nThe fifth commandment is intended to instruct adult children to show honor to elderly parents. The Puritans interpret correctly its greater implications in the Westminster Catechism, noting that it included showing honor to all who are our superiors in age and experience.\n\nPut succinctly: Honor the Olds. They know some things you don\u2019t. Their bodies are declining, but their personhood is ever developing. We can miss this so easily. I once heard a woman in her 30s gently reminding an audience of younger women that \u201colder Christian women are still valuable in the church.\u201d In accordance with the fifth commandment, I would offer a slightly altered wording. Those older than us are not still valuable. They are, rather, increasingly valuable.\n\nIn a culture that fetishizes youth and views aging as a journey into irrelevance and uselessness, God\u2019s family takes the view that people possess an ever-developing value, one that renders their contributions essential and indispensable.\n\nOur elders have much to offer us\u2014until they reach the stage in the chiasm of life when they don\u2019t. At some point, old age will take from them even the ability to think or communicate. And yet, they will still teach us. Aging requires a fortitude like nothing else. Caring for the aged grants unforeseen blessings to the younger generation. Those who hold the hand of the dying learn secrets to make them wise. They learn that the elderly are not an obligation but a sacred trust. My mother was luminous in her dying.\n\nThe grand symmetry of the human life can yield wisdom if we give it our attention. We move from the helplessness of birth to seasons of growth and possibility under the watchful care of our parents. We become caregivers to our children, then to our parents. We watch growth and possibility turn to decline and limited ability in our own lives. We return to helplessness. And we leave this life much as we entered. How kind of the Lord to give us a roadmap for aging until our last enemy, death, is defeated.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the lie that the first half of life is to be clung to. When we behold the arc from beginning to end, we learn to value all of it. We learn not just to number our days but to cherish them\u2014the days of our youth, the days of our twilight, and all the days in between.\n\nDon\u2019t let a youth-obsessed culture rob you of your sense of the value of all parts of life. We need our aging faces and slowing bodies to tell us the truth: that time is passing, and that it is exceedingly precious. Each season yields its own exquisite fruit. No need to cling to what was never meant to last. God is faithful in every season.\n\nJen Wilkin is an author, Bible teacher, and cohost of the Knowing Faith podcast."

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
