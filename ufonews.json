What if you were a high-profile politician? Would you admit it, or would you be silenced by the stigma that often accompanies such out-of-this-world tales?\n\nA lawmaker who would eventually become the 39th president of the United States reported his encounter, and the reaction may surprise you.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t know this, but the late former president Jimmy Carter saw a color-changing U.F.O. in Georgia back in 1969.\n\nHis willingness to discuss it leaves behind a unique legacy of openness about U.F.O. sightings.\n\nAmericans honor former President Jimmy Carter\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter\u2019s personal encounter happened outside a Lions club in Leary, Georgia. He was with a group of about two dozen witnesses who all saw a bright orb changing colors from blue to red to white. According to history.com., the orb moved toward and away from the crowd, stopped, and then disappeared behind pine trees. Carter said the object was self-illuminated and not solid in nature. It was in view for about 12 minutes before it passed out of sight.\n\nWhen Carter was governor in 1973, he filed an official report with the International U.F.O. Bureau. He spoke freely about the encounter and even promised, during his 1976 presidential campaign, to release all government information if elected.\n\nAccording to reports, he backed away from his pledge, citing security concerns and defense implications.\n\nA member of the Carter family did some research and decided it was likely from the release of a glowing chemical cloud produced by rockets launched from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Some of these sodium and barium chemical clouds were visible by the scattering of sunlight as far away as Leary, Georgia, appearing around the same time of the sighting. A copy of this report is at the Jimmy Carter Library.\n\nCarter is quoted as saying, \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ll never make fun of people who say they\u2019ve seen unidentified objects in the sky.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter left a message cast to the cosmos in 1977.\n\nUSA Today reports that in a message sent to space, along with recordings of Earth\u2019s music, languages, and images, Carter left a message on a golden record launched on the space probe, Voyager 1, saying, in part, \u201cWe hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations.\u201d The message continues to travel beyond our solar system today.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

            "article_content": "A UFO expert has lifted the lid on some of his wildest encounters as we reveal the top five hotspots in the UK.\n\nNick Pope, who previously ran the British Government\u2019s UFO Project, spoke about his experiences with extraterrestrial life in an exclusive chat with The Sun.\n\n4 Nick Pope is former head of the MoD's UFO research programme Credit: Chris Loomis / National Geographic\n\n4 Nick lifted the lid on some extraterrestrial mysteries\n\n4\n\nFor over two decades, Nick worked as a civilian employee at the MoD, with his most prominent role beginning in the early 1990s, where he ran the department's UFO program.\n\nNick was at the helm of the project, an initiative that monitored and investigated reports of unidentified flying objects to assess their potential impact on national security and aviation safety.\n\nAlthough the program was never formally named, it was often referred to as the \u201cUFO desk\u201d or \u201cUFO program\u201d by a number of media outlets.\n\nWhen looking at the distribution of these sightings across the UK, Nick and his team discovered that the hotspots were not necessarily the rural or remote locations that many assumed.\n\nNick told The Sun: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because when we mapped out the UFO sightings, they didn\u2019t necessarily occur in remote, rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe hotspots were often London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow \u2013 all the major cities and urban areas.\n\n\"The reason for this is simple - the more people there are in an area, the more likely someone is to spot something unusual in the sky.\u201d\n\nThese cities, with their dense populations, provided more potential witnesses.\n\nIt meant that if something strange appeared in the sky, the chances of someone witnessing it were far higher.\n\nNick also notes that other areas, like Warminster have been known for their frequent UFO sightings.\n\n\u201cPeople used to go up Cradle Hill and Flea Hill in Warminster, and even some 1960s pop songs referenced the place,\u201d he added.\n\nBonnybridge, in Scotland, saw a huge surge in UFO sightings in the 1990s, to the extent that local councillor Billy Buchanan lobbied the government for an inquiry.\n\n\u201cI ended up drafting the replies to Buchanan\u2019s letters, which were sent to the Ministry of Defence,\u201d Nick recalls.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t very happy with me because the government line was always to play down the significance of UFO sightings.\u201d\n\nDespite the official stance, Nick acknowledges that Bonnybridge was, indeed, a hotspot.\n\nPilots told they\u2019re \u2018cleared to manoeuvre to avoid the UFO\u2019 in eerie audio as \u2018strange\u2019 lights spark fears in Oregon\n\nHowever, Nick also cautions against confirmation bias, adding: \u201cWhen people go to these hotspots for sky watches, they may already be believers, which can affect how they perceive what they see.\n\n\"They may be more likely to misperceive something or to see what they expect to see.\u201d\n\nAnother factor is the issue of light pollution in cities, which can obscure the view of the sky.\n\nDespite this, urban areas remained UFO hotspots due to the sheer number of potential witnesses.\n\nEven more intriguing, Nick pointed out, was the fact that UFO sightings seemed to cluster around military bases, particularly air force bases.\n\nWhile some argue that these sightings are due to secret military aircraft or advanced aerospace technology, the fact remains that military bases are more heavily surveilled, and the likelihood of sightings there is higher.\n\nFrom Rendlesham Forest to Cosford, Nick has worked on some of the most high-profile cases in UFO history, all while trying to navigate the Ministry\u2019s official stance on the phenomenon.\n\nAnd according to Nick, the number of UFO sightings reported in the UK was far higher than most people realise with reports representing only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"We\u2019d get about 200 to 300 reports a year, and at its peak, that number went up to 700 or 800,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBut even that number is misleading because many sightings went unreported due to fear of ridicule or simply not knowing who to contact.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Nick believes the actual number of UFO sightings in the UK each year could be in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe MoD had a national reporting system for UFO sightings, with people reaching out to local police stations, military bases, and airports.\n\nHowever, sightings reported to the media or civilian UFO research groups were not always included in the official data.\n\nWhat to do if you spot a UFO? \u201cIf you see something, say something,\u201d Nick advises anyone who observes a UFO. He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

About 100-150 mph,\" Chiao told the Post.\n\nHe joked that if they had hit him, \"no one would have known what happened to me. They probably would attribute it to a bird strike or running into a big turkey buzzard or something.\"\n\nThe spacewalker repeated his military theory to The Hill but admitted \"It's hard to say.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I think whoever was operating the drone wasn't aware that I was there.\"\n\nChiao spoke out about his thoughts regarding the spate of drones seen flying over New Jersey recently, saying it is \"hard to believe\" the government does not know what is happening.\n\nHe called for more transparency saying, \"They could tell us what they know.\"\n\n\"If they really don't know, that's a little more disconcerting,\" he said of the objects spotted over New Jersey and various sensitive US sites.\n\nMetallic orbs like those seen by Chiao are the most commonly reported sighting logged by US military witnesses, according to the director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\nDr Sean Kirkpatrick told NASA's UFO advisory group last year that these orbs have been seen \"all over the world\" adding, \"we see these making very interesting apparent manoeuvres.\"\n\n\"In all my years of flying, nobody\u2019s ever saw a UFO or something weird,\" Chiao told The Post, later adding, \"If I had been looking the other way I wouldn\u2019t have seen \u2018em. Wouldn\u2019t have felt anything.\"\n\nCHINESE SPY BOTS?\n\nMeanwhile, a top US congressman has claimed that the mystery drones that swarmed over New Jersey are likely spy bots from China.\n\nMichael McCaul said he believes that at least some of the droves are malicious surveillance from the eastern superpower.\n\nThe chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee blasted Joe Biden's administration over the lack of information about the unusual activity.\n\n\"We want answers but the response I\u2019m getting is - we don\u2019t know what these drones are,\" the Republican fumed.\n\nMcCaul added that Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator had reports saying that the drones were the size of SUVs flying over \"military sites and bases\" suggesting they are \"adversarial\" rather than \"friendly.\"\n\nMcCaul concluded: \u201cI believe they\u2019re spy drones and the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] is very good at this stuff.\n\n\u201cWe know they bought land around military bases.\n\n\u201cThis would be very consistent with their policy over the past couple years.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting answers and I think it\u2019s because our government does not know who is behind them and that is very disturbing to me,\" he added.\n\nChina has not publicly commented on the accusations.\n\n6 Chiao said he only survived the incident with the two orbs thanks to 'dumb luck' Credit: Channel 4\n\n6 Chiao called for more transparency from the Pentagon regarding the bizarre sightings Credit: Reuters"

            "article_content": "> Space\n\nAfter calls with foreign leaders, rap sessions with lawmakers, and long classified briefings with advisers, President Jimmy Carter would often escape to the roof of the White House.\n\nThere his son Jeffrey had set up a tracking telescope, Carter said in his book, A Full Life. Feeling the weight of the world, he would gaze at the stars and contemplate his place among them.\n\n\"I recall one winter night going to the White House roof to study the Orion nebulae, but we could barely see the stars, their images so paled by city lights,\" he waxed in a poem.\n\nThat particular evening, on Dec. 18, 1977, the astrophysicist Carl Sagan joined him. They had just visited the U.S. Naval Observatory next to the vice president\u2019s mansion, where they discussed all things space \u2014 planets , stars, black holes , and astrobiology . Carter himself was a man of science: He studied engineering in college and did graduate work in nuclear physics .\n\n\"It was a welcome diversion from earthly concerns,\" he wrote in a thank-you note to Sagan.\n\nCarter, who died on Dec. 29, 2024 at 100, was an avid astronomer, with a profound curiosity for the cosmos, a part of his story that isn't well-known. It began when he was a lab assistant to an astronomy teacher his freshman year in college, and it continued as he learned celestial navigation in the U.S. Navy, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. One Christmas while on a ship with his family, he asked the captain if the crew had a sextant on board, a tool for measuring the angle between the horizon and an object in the sky. The captain proceeded to show him one, he said , displayed like a museum artifact in a glass case.\n\nBut politics often eclipsed the former president's appreciation for space. Though his first budget funded the program that became NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope, Carter was maligned for not supporting human spaceflight in the vein of the Apollo program, said Steven Hochman, former special assistant to the president at the Carter Center. He was a supporter of robotic exploration and research that could benefit people's lives, but when it came to the exorbitant cost of sending astronauts into deep space , he preferred spending on domestic concerns.\n\n\"NASA, I believe, has not given him the credit he deserves,\" Hochman told Mashable. \"I believe it is because he was critical of the Space Shuttle program and didn't provide funding for future missions to the moon or Mars.\"\n\nFor years political adversaries ridiculed Carter for having a tinfoil hat, stemming from an incident in 1969 that later circulated in the press. After a Lions Club meeting in Leary, Georgia, Carter and a few other men spotted something strange moving in the sky: a luminous object, first blue then red, the apparent size and brightness of the moon . About four years later, Carter reported the unidentified flying object to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma.\n\nThough Carter never claimed to have spotted aliens or a flying saucer \u2014 to him this was literally an unknown object in the air \u2014 people snickered and mistook his UFO sighting as such. Skeptics, who likely knew nothing of Carter's astronomy background, suggested he had merely seen Venus .\n\n\"It was not Venus,\" Carter said in a 2007 interview on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast.\n\nIn fact, his UFO sighting had taken on such mythic proportions, some had wondered whether it was the reason Carter wanted NASA to investigate UFOs in 1977. Despite a White House request expressing a need to address the general UFO \"public relations problem,\" NASA had, surprisingly, declined.\n\nThe subject prompted The Journal of Scientific Exploration to invite Richard C. Henry, the agency's deputy director of astrophysics during Carter's administration, to write an essay about it more than a decade later. Henry, a semi-retired professor at Johns Hopkins University today, came to no definitive conclusions on why NASA rebuffed the White House. But, in a postscript , Henry said he sent his draft to Carter before publication in 1988.\n\n\"The most important point that you could clarify, if you will, is whether you yourself were behind (the UFO panel proposal) letter of July 21, 1977, to NASA,\" Henry wrote.\n\nBeside the sentence, Carter jotted his reply in one word: No.\n\nYet buried within Henry's paper was a small window into Carter's passion for astronomy. In November 1977, the president and his son sent a message to NASA headquarters asking to borrow a seven-inch Questar telescope. Given that there were no telescopes at headquarters \u2014 just paper, Henry said \u2014 he tried to hunt one down at another NASA campus.\n\nIt turned out Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, had one.\n\n\"By great luck, a NASA plane was flying from Huntsville to Washington the next day ([Science adviser Frank] Press was emphatic that the President wanted no special flights or other waste of taxpayer dollars),\" Henry wrote.\n\nThe NASA official and his wife, Rita Mahon, picked up the Questar at Washington National Airport and promptly took it to the White House. They then unpacked the telescope from a large wooden crate and showed the Carters how to set it up on the Truman balcony overlooking the South Lawn. The night was cloudy, but they trained on the moon.\n\nThe president then proceeded to take the telescope with him to Camp David near Thurmont, Maryland, on Nov. 23, 1977, where he and his family spent Thanksgiving, according to his daily diary . He returned it about a week later.\n\nOne has to wonder if Carter brought a telescope with him again just 10 months later, when he invited Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to join him at the retreat. The renowned talks would result in the Camp David Accords , which later earned the Middle East leaders a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThere's an amusing irony to the false urban legend that Carter believed he was visited by aliens: He is, after all, the most likely person to make humanity's introduction to extraterrestrials.\n\nSome 15.5 billion miles away from Earth, hurtling through the cold, uncharted abyss, is NASA's Voyager 1 probe. It is the farthest spacecraft from home, having left the solar system in 2012. Soaring through interstellar space at 38,000 mph , it carries a gold-plated record produced by Sagan, with a melange of sounds from the planet.\n\nCrickets. Wind. Greetings in 55 languages, from Akkadian to Wu. A mother kissing her child. These and a letter from Carter are among the recordings on the disk.\n\nThe odds of making contact with aliens, if they exist, are slight, if not insurmountable. Galaxies are spinning away from each other into the infinite unknown. The speed at which space is expanding far outpaces our technology to overcome it. It's as if the universe were contrived to keep its inhabitants apart.\n\nBut should some other intelligent life forms encounter Voyager \u2014 or Voyager 2 , which carries a duplicate record \u2014 thousands or even billions of years into the future, they will discover Carter's words:\n\n\"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings,\" he wrote. \"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\"\n\nMany knew Carter's intimate relationship with his faith. He grew up Southern Baptist, the son of a farmer in the boomtown of Plains, Georgia. He referred to himself as a born-again Christian. Long after his presidency, he attended regular church services and taught Sunday School .\n\nBut how his evangelical beliefs squared with his thoughts on the universe aren't clear. He wrote in a poem, titled \"Considering the Void:\"\n\nWhen I behold the charm / of evening skies, their lulling endurance; / the patterns of stars with names / of bears and dogs, a swan, a virgin; / other planets that our Voyager showed / were like and so unlike our own, / with all their moons, / bright discs, weird rings, and cratered faces; / comets with their streaming tails / bent by pressure from our sun; / the skyscape of our Milky Way / holding in its shimmering disc /an infinity of suns / (or say a thousand billion); / knowing there are holes of darkness / gulping mass and even light, / knowing that this galaxy of ours / is one of multitudes / in what we call the heavens, / it troubles me. It troubles me.\n\nWhat exactly was haunting Carter? Was he expressing a collision of faith and science in what lies beyond? An existential crisis of never knowing the big picture?\n\nPerhaps, as he wished, humankind will survive this time so that we may live to know more."

            "article_content": "Adam Spatacco\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWithout question, semiconductor stocks have been some of the biggest winners amid the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. While stars such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom fetch the most attention, investing in the chip sector at large during the past two years has yielded market-beating returns.\n\nAs of market close on Dec. 20, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF had gained 39% in 2024 \u2014 handily topping the returns of both the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nNevertheless, not all semiconductor stocks have fared so well. Take Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), for example \u2014 with shares up a piddling 6% in 2024, investors might think this particular chip stock is a bust.\n\nSmart investors know that looking at the return of a stock is just one variable when assessing an opportunity. Below, I'm going to dig into what has influenced Micron's price action throughout the year and make the case for why 2025 could be a rebound year for the company.\n\nMicron stock just got smoked\n\nThe chart below illustrates movement in Micron shares throughout 2024. The peaks and valleys depicted in the graph make one thing abundantly clear \u2014 Micron is pretty volatile. In particular, the last six months have been abnormally rocky with shares dropping by about 38% since June.\n\nMy take on what's causing Micron shares to experience so much volatility comes down to one thing: expectations. When businesses such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom and many others exhibit robust growth on a consistent basis, investors tend to apply these trends to other companies in the same industry.\n\nAlthough I understand the psychological factors behind these parallels, it's imperative for investors to understand that such a notion is rooted in faulty logic. Not all chip companies manufacture the same products or serve the same purpose, and for that reason, each business is going to experience its own set of unique headwinds and catalysts.\n\nMicron's position in the AI realm focuses on memory and storage applications. Although the company has had impressive top-line growth that's augmented by rising profitability, Micron's forecast for a big miss in its 2025 fiscal second quarter spooked investors.\n\nAgain, I don't necessarily see this as a reason to sell the stock. Below, I'll dig into why Micron's latest plunge is unwarranted.\n\nThe shares could rebound in 2025\n\nSince AI emerged as the world's next megatrend about two years ago, one product in particular has become the technology sector's holy grail: graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nCompanies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices develop chipsets known as GPUs that are capable of running complex algorithms at extremely high speeds, and it's this hardware that powers myriad generative AI applications. Taking this a step further, Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures GPUs for Nvidia and AMD while Broadcom supplies a host of network infrastructure equipment needed to power data centers where these GPUs are housed.\n\nWith all of that in mind, doesn't it seem natural that those specific businesses have experienced abnormally high growth during the past two years?\n\nIn my eyes, Micron just hasn't had its moment yet, but I think it's coming. Considering investments in AI infrastructure are expected to be in the trillions of dollars during the next several years, I think it's safe to say that demand for GPUs and data center services isn't going to slow.\n\nAt a more granular level, this means that training and inferencing workloads are going to become more sophisticated and mission critical as competition in the AI arms race intensifies. It's this dynamic that should result in a greater need for memory and storage protocols \u2014 and Micron is extremely well-positioned to capture that demand.\n\nThis isn't just lofty theory, either. Per Micron's 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended Nov. 28), the company's data-center revenue increased by a staggering 400% year over year and reached a record level. Furthermore, the company's data-center segment now accounts for more than 50% of the business. To me, these trends underscore the need for Micron's memory chips and I expect the tailwinds to carry into next year and beyond.\n\nAlthough the company's near-term outlook may not have lived up to expectations, I think the long-term narrative is still very much in focus. According to management, the total addressable market for high bandwidth memory is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030 \u2014 more than six times what it is today. Considering Micron's trailing-12-month revenue is in the ballpark of $29 billion, I think the company has significant upside.\n\nIs Micron stock a buy right now?\n\nValuing Micron is a daunting task. Even though the company generates positive earnings, it has only recently transitioned to a profitable enterprise and so using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seems a little out of place, in my opinion.\n\nInstead, I'll use the PEG ratio to assess an investment in Micron. The PEG ratio looks at analyst forecasts for earnings growth over several years. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, the stock could be seen as undervalued. Right now, Micron's PEG ratio is just 0.23.\n\nIn my opinion, Micron's low PEG suggests that investors could be overlooking the need for memory and storage chips as AI workloads become larger and more complex. Over time, however, I think the need for Micron's services will become increasingly obvious. To me, buying Micron right now is a bargain opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nAdam Spatacco has positions in Nvidia.

Within it lies a combination lock, unopened for more than 50 years. The man who set it is dead.\n\nOn its own, the lock is unremarkable \u2014 the kind you might use at the gym. The code, a mnemonic of a six-letter word converted into numbers, was known only to the psychiatrist Dr. Ian Stevenson, who set it long before he died, and years before he retired as director of the Division of Perceptual Studies, or DOPS, a parapsychology research unit he founded in 1967 within the University of Virginia\u2019s school of medicine.\n\nDr. Stevenson called this experiment the Combination Lock Test for Survival. He reasoned that if he could transmit the code to someone from the grave, it might help answer the questions that had consumed him in life: Is communication from the \u201cbeyond\u201d possible? Can the personality survive bodily death? Or, simply: Is reincarnation real?\n\nThis last conundrum \u2014 the survival of consciousness after death \u2014 continues to be at the forefront of the division\u2019s research. The team has logged hundreds of cases of children who claim to remember past lives from all continents except Antarctica. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only because we haven\u2019t looked for cases there,\u201d said Dr. Jim Tucker, who has been investigating claims of past lives for more than two decades. He recently retired after having been the director of DOPS since 2015."

            "article_content": "New breakthroughs in gene editing mean that cures for genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis could be developed in the near future.\n\nGene editing technology has advanced significantly recently, off the back of a 2012 discovery.\n\nOn this week\u2019s Show Me The Science podcast, Professor Luke O\u2019Neill said that the ability to edit genes began with the discovery of CRISPR technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCRISPR was discovered by two scientists, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier... They won the Nobel Prize for this discovery, it was discovered in 2012,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe CRISPR mechanism was first seen in bacteria \u2013 often, scientists use different organisms to study things.\n\n\u201cWhat these two people discovered was the bacteria make an enzyme that can attack viral genes.\n\n\u201cNow, virus infect bacteria \u2013 virus affect all of us, of course.\n\n\u201cOur while life on Earth is affected by viruses and have genes \u2013 and it turns out bacteria have a defence mechanism against viruses.\n\n\u201cSo, the virus goes into the bacteria - the bacteria makes this thing called CAS - CAS locks onto the viral DNA and edits it, chops it out basically.\u201d\n\nProf O\u2019Neill said that this discovery can be used to clip and correct genes in various ways.\n\nAccording to Prof O\u2019Neill, the first approval for a CRISPR gene editing therapy was handed out in the UK in November for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia, which limits the body\u2019s supply of haemoglobin.\n\n\u201cPeople with this disease, it\u2019s awful, very painful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen, the severe end, you can die from it, right? So, the question became, could you correct that broken gene?\n\n\u201cThe gene is broken \u2013 you're getting broken haemoglobin and now these sickle cells are there and they can\u2019t carry oxygen and you get sickle cell disease.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a second disease called transfusion dependent beta thalassemia \u2013 and again, that\u2019s a dodginess in the gene for the haemoglobin as part of this as well.\n\n\u201cThe CRISPR people thought, can we correct the haemoglobin? And indeed we can.\n\n\u201cWhat they do here is they correct the broken gene and now you get a normal haemoglobin and then you\u2019re fine and you don\u2019t have sickle cell disease anymore.\u201d\n\nHowever, Prof O\u2019Neill said that with this method, there had been a concern that the wrong gene could be hit.\n\nNew breakthrough\n\nNow though, Lithuanian scientists have come up with a new technology which massages the gene instead of chopping it out.\n\n\u201cIt relaxes the DNA double helix and now the gene doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t get expressed,\u201d Prof O\u2019Neill said.\n\n\u201cIf you take it away, the gene goes back to normal. So what we have here is a reversible way to do this.\n\n\u201cJust in case something untoward happens, you can withdraw the therapy, and so therefore it\u2019s likely to be a bit safer \u2013 this is the idea.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prof O\u2019Neill, this new development could help to treat a range of genetic diseases in the near future.\n\nFeatured image: Split image showing Luke O'Neill (L) and red DNA strands (R)."

The outage began on December 26th, 2024 at 10:40 AM and was mostly resolved by 3:11 PM, except for except ChatGPT which was 100% recovered by 6:20 PM.\n\nThe following services were impacted:\n\nChatGPT\n\nSora video creation\n\nAPIs: agents, realtime speech, batch, and DALL-E\n\nCause of OpenAI Outage\n\nThe cause of the outage was a cloud provider data center failure which impacted OpenAI databases. While the databases are mirrored across regions, switching over to a backup database required manual interaction on the part of the cloud provider to redirect operations to a backup datacenter in another region. The manual intervention was cited as how the outage was fixed but the given reason for why it took so long was the scale of the project.\n\nA failover is an automated process for switching to a backup system in the event of a system failure. OpenAI announced that they are working toward creating infrastructure changes to improve responses to future cloud database failures.\n\nOpenAI explained:\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, we will embark on a major infrastructure initiative to ensure our systems are resilient to an extended outage in any region of any of our cloud providers by adding a layer of indirection under our control in between our applications and our cloud databases. This will allow significantly faster failover.\u201d\n\nSignificant ChatGPT Outage\n\nOpenAI\u2019s said the ChatGPT outage was due to a regional cloud provider database failure but the effect was global, evidenced by user reports on social media from across Europe and North America.\n\nGoogle Trends, which tracks search volume, indicates that this may have been the largest such event, with more people searching for information about it than for any previous outage.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/lilgrapher"

            "article_content": "On a university level, what makes for a good computer science curriculum?\n\nOne of the most common career paths for a computer science major is as a software developer. An effective university curriculum must prepare computer science students with the skills needed to be successful in their careers as developers.\n\nThe field of software development, however, changes faster than the Boston weather. A curriculum focused on current industry trends risks becoming obsolete before students even graduate. So how can Northeastern teach students skills that will stand the test of time? The university, which recently announced it would completely overhaul its curriculum, must carefully and thoughtfully consider this question.\n\nA good computer science curriculum must emphasize fundamental principles that are widely applicable, enabling students to easily adapt to new technologies in the field they are entering. It must teach students how to think about software and how to problem-solve.\n\nThis is exactly what Northeastern\u2019s current curriculum strives to do. Fundamentals of Computer Science, or \u201cFundies,\u201d as it is popularly known, teaches systematic program design through the design recipe, which provides a consistent formula for tackling unfamiliar problems. The design recipe breaks down a problem into small, achievable steps, of which the first few require students to think carefully about the problem before writing code to solve it. Core classes such as Fundies 1, Fundies 2, Object-Oriented Design and Software Development focus on training students to reason about code, rather than to mindlessly write it.\n\nOf course, the curriculum is not perfect; no curriculum will ever be. But students\u2019 criticisms of these courses often fundamentally misunderstand their purpose.\n\nI have often heard computer science students complain that Fundies 1 teaches Racket instead of a \u201cuseful language\u201d like Python. But the point of Fundies is not to teach Racket \u2014 it is to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language. Racket is just the tool it uses to do so. A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language. And with how fast the tech industry changes, is it really worth having a course that teaches just Python when tomorrow, some other language might dominate the industry? Our current curriculum focuses on timeless principles rather than fleeting trends.\n\nBut now, during the worst tech job market in over two decades, Khoury College of Computer Sciences plans to abandon the approach that has consistently equipped its graduates for success. The college\u2019s proposed overhaul will phase out Fundies 1, Fundies 2, and Object-Oriented Design, replacing them with entirely new courses.\n\nThe new courses will primarily teach Python, and the college claims it is an added bonus that Python \u201cis currently the most requested language by co-op employers.\u201d But we should not teach a language simply because it is currently popular in industry \u2014 we must choose a language with real pedagogical merit. Racket was chosen because it has \u201cteaching languages\u201d that can gradually introduce features as students are taught the relevant design principles. While the new curriculum begins in Pyret, which is similarly designed for teaching purposes, it will quickly transition to Python in the first course. Python does not have anything similar \u2014 students must be taught complex features upfront, before they learn the design skills to cleanly and effectively use those features.\n\nAdditionally, Khoury said students will be allowed to place out of the new courses with AP Computer Science credit. The current curriculum does not allow this for a good reason: The AP courses do not teach systematic design skills and thus are not equivalent to our introductory courses. Fundies 1 and 2 provide practice applying design principles to small problems, preparing students to design larger pieces of software in Object-Oriented Design and Software Development, as well as on co-op. If students are allowed to skip the introductory courses, they will struggle to succeed in more advanced courses and in their career.\n\nTaken together, the announced changes make it clear that while Khoury may pay lip service to the design recipe, it is not committed to maintaining systematic program design as a central aspect of the curriculum. This is a grave mistake. The program design skills that our current curriculum emphasizes are \u201cwhat distinguishes a garage programmer from a serious software developer,\u201d in the words of the Fundies 1 textbook. If Khoury abandons its design-oriented curriculum, it will fail in its duty to properly prepare students for their careers as serious software developers.\n\nIt seems a major impetus for this change is a desire to make the core curriculum easier. I know one professor who has been telling students that the college wants to reduce the number of students who withdraw from Fundies 2 and Object-Oriented Design. While this is an understandable sentiment, it would be a mistake to remove the most important parts of the curriculum to do so.\n\nAs a former teaching assistant, or TA, for Object-Oriented Design, I have seen many students struggle through the class. But I have also seen those same students become better programmers because of what they learn in that class. The \u201ccode swap\u201d at the end of the semester, where students are required to build upon other students\u2019 code, is one of the assignments students struggle most with \u2014 but it teaches them how to work in a codebase written by someone else, which they will have to do throughout their careers. Additionally, for many students, the class provides their first experience working on a large software project, much like those they will work on during their co-ops. Watering down the curriculum would not benefit these students. Is the purpose of a university to hand out grades or to educate students?\n\nAt the very least, Khoury administrators should consult with experienced teaching assistants about any planned changes to the core curriculum. TAs have a unique perspective \u2014 we have taken these courses ourselves and have also helped other students succeed. We know firsthand what works, and we can help ensure the core principles are not compromised while allowing for changes that benefit students.\n\nI love Northeastern and have never regretted my decision to attend college here. But if Khoury abandons the valuable principles of the current curriculum, I will not be able to recommend in good conscience that prospective computer science majors apply here. I will not be able to recommend in good conscience that employers hire software developers from here. If Khoury makes these changes, it will be the beginning of the end of Northeastern\u2019s computer science program.\n\nDerek Kaplan is a fourth-year computer science major.

That's the idea behind its new e-bike that's part bike, scooter, and motorcycle, all in one.\n\nIt's called, simply, One. And according to the specs provided by Owlet, this thing can get up and move in a hurry.\n\nThe One's 3,000-watt hub motor can generate a whopping 180 newton-meters of torque. For comparison's sake, the Specialized Turbo Levo, the benchmark for high-quality and powerful e-mountain bikes, produces \"only\" 90 newton-meters of torque. It also requires pedaling.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot so with the One.\n\nThe One is shaped like a telescope tube with a reverse-swooping rear triangle and a suspension fork hidden by cool-looking angular panels. It also folds so it can fit in a trunk or the hallway of a small apartment.\n\nIt boasts big, visible lighting too. The front beams are provided by two small circles that look a bit like eyes. The rear light is a bright red circle that can't be missed by drivers approaching from behind.\n\nOnce out on the road, you flip the collapsible foot pegs into go-mode, hit the throttle, and you're off \u2014 going up to 30 miles per hour. Owlet says the battery is good for up to 60 miles per charge. It takes about 3.5 hours to fully charge it, according to New Atlas, so it's a dream commuter rig. You could even charge it at work putting in just half a day.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis kind of transportation option has the potential to reshape urban commuting. With a top speed of 30 miles per hour, it can zip along with, or faster, than traffic in congested cities and compact towns. It's remarkably efficient, as you could likely go days without charging \u2014 unless you're joyriding around town.\n\nAnd that fun is a huge selling point. Why drive a car or use a ride-share service when you can just hop on your One and zip off quietly, quickly, and with an ear-to-ear grin plastered across your face? Imagine the possibilities of a much quieter, cleaner, and more fun cityscape, with commuters whizzing around on silent e-bikes.\n\nWould you be more likely to use a rideshare service that offers EV rides?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nThe Owlet is projected to cost just under $3,000 when it goes on sale, according to New Atlas. Pre-orders are sold out on the company's website, but good things come to those who wait. Keep an eye out for this little wonder; it shouldn't be hard to spot.\n\nTo New Atlas, the design team behind the One said it creates \"not just vehicles but pieces of art, exemplifying a perfect blend of form and function.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "date": "25m",
            "source": "TechCrunch",
            "article_content": "A new year brings with it hope for a better tomorrow \u2014 kind of, at least. In the world of venture capital, nothing is quite predictable. The number of firms in the U.S. has taken a sharp dip as risk-averse institutional investors splash money on only the biggest names in Silicon Valley, as reported by the Financial Times. AI is the only category that seems to matter, and that doesn\u2019t look to be changing anytime soon. But the new year has just started, and perhaps so has the impetus for change.\n\nWe spoke to some VCs to gather their predictions on the new year \u2014 the good, the bad, and what might end up being the unexpected.\n\nTheir responses have been edited and shortened for clarity.\n\nWhat are your good and bad venture predictions for 2025?\n\nNekeshia Woods, managing partner at Parkway Venture Capital\n\nThe good: As wealthy individuals lower their return expectations for fixed income and cash equivalents, they will look more aggressively to private markets for outsized returns. This channel is expected to invest over $7 trillion in private markets by 2033. In response to this expected influx of capital, we have seen large wealth and asset managers use venture capital as a differentiating strategy among their private market offerings. These institutions have positioned venture to be a strategy where they can offer access to the best deals while capturing a portion of the $7 trillion expected to be invested in private markets through net new flows. Fund managers will simultaneously partner with these institutions to gain access to a new set of LPs that create a new, consistent, and long-term capital stream for their funds.\n\nMore good: We expect the AI field to start seeing consolidation, primarily through acquisition, in areas where AI can become a commodity, like large language models. The AI companies that will make it to be leaders in their field are opening new market segments and owning proprietary data.\n\nGabby Cazeau, partner at Harlem Capital\n\nThe good: The IPO market will fully reopen, and we\u2019ll see some big-name IPOs bring much-needed liquidity. That\u2019s a win for everyone. On the early-stage side, investment pacing will pick up, maybe not to 2021 levels, but certainly more than 2022-2024. It feels like 2025 will be a banner year for venture and hopefully the official start of the next bull run.\n\nThe bad: 2025 will be a make-or-break year for AI startups selling to enterprises. A lot of AI startups have grown quickly but are still stuck in the \u201cexperimental\u201d phase, living on innovation budgets instead of being part of core software spend. Many won\u2019t make the leap, leaving a number of startups on the chopping block as churn and slow growth take over.\n\nTriin Linamagi, founding partner at Sie Ventures\n\nThe good: The emergence of solo GPs and angel funds will drive increased investment into earlier-stage companies \u2014 a much-needed evolution for the venture capital ecosystem.\n\nWe\u2019ll see more specialized and well-defined investment approaches, with industry-specific, knowledgeable investors providing meaningful value to founders. This shift is not only beneficial for startups but is also likely to deliver better returns for investors. Capital allocation to diverse founding teams will continue to grow, particularly in sectors like sustainability and healthcare, where diverse perspectives can drive innovation and impact.\n\nThe bad: Meaningful M&A or IPO activity is unlikely until late 2025 as market conditions remain challenging. Limited partners will remain hesitant to deploy capital, waiting for improved distribution to paid-in capital metrics before committing to new funds.\n\nMichael Basch, founder and general partner at Atento Capital\n\nThe good: Long-awaited increased liquidity for LPs with an opening of the IPO and M&A markets. More funds and companies taking secondaries as well. A reset of expectations of the zombie companies that are profitable not going to have the outcomes the VCs on the cap table underwrote, selling at a more grounded price to private equity. Consolidation and roll-ups in oversaturated spaces (e.g., GLP-1s).\n\nThe bad: Continued falling unicorns that have significant reset in valuations due to market resizing and growth expectations resetting.\n\nAustin Clements, managing partner at Slauson & Co.\n\nThe good: IPO markets will reopen following the success of Service Titan, as will M&A activity for private companies. Finally realizing these gains will increase liquidity for the LPs behind many venture capital firms. This will lead to LPs committing to more new funds \u2014 more venture funds than in years past.\n\nThe bad: [LPs] may be more reluctant to commit to new fund managers after seeing a lot of undisciplined behavior in the last cycle. The unfortunate side effect is that some of the most innovative strategies will have a lot of trouble getting funded.\n\nWhat are some trends that you think will remain? Which ones will go?\n\nWoods\n\nWhat will stay: Dealmaking will remain favorable to investors with dry powder. Investors will continue to move away from looking at products using [the] \u201cnumber of users\u201d as a key consideration and move toward booked revenues, client pipeline, and costs as key considerations prior to investing. The pace of investing will also maintain this investor-friendly environment. We do not expect venture firms to return to the frenzied pace of investing experienced for the past couple of years but instead continue with a balanced approach.\n\nWhat will go: The outlook for IPO activity is moderately positive. Founder-renewed confidence in the public markets and comps coupled with dwindling cash runways and those high-valued companies that have survived the recent fundraising constraints, have right-sized their valuations to align more closely with the market. We believe that the consumer is also prime for investing in small-cap stocks, given the mega-cap technology stocks that have moved U.S. indexes into all-time highs and returned tremendous shareholder value. While there are still a number of companies whose valuations are not yet tracking to the market there are some, primarily in the tech space, that are ready for the public market.\n\nCazeau\n\nWhat will stay: Small teams scaling revenue. We\u2019re seeing teams of just one to three people hitting $2 million+ ARR using AI tools \u2014 doing more with less and doing it better than ever. This kind of growth was unheard of before 2024 and highlights how much startups are automating internally with new software tools. The big question now is how these teams will scale and build strong organizations, but it\u2019s impressive to see such growth with such a lean setup.\n\nWe\u2019ll also see a resurgence in investment around reskilling \u2014 platforms addressing talent shortages in skilled trades, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare, and other areas that software can\u2019t automate away.\n\nLinamagi\n\nWhat will stay: AI is here to stay. The widespread deployment of AI in 2024 marked a significant shift, and I believe this momentum will only grow. While it offers immense opportunities \u2014 such as enhancing decision-making, improving deal sourcing, and streamlining operations \u2014 it also presents challenges. For instance, human intuition and experience remain vital, particularly when evaluating founding teams and their dynamics. This evolution will require LPs to think more critically about how they select managers and construct their portfolios.\n\nWhat will go: The spray-and-pray investment approach. I expect we\u2019ll see fewer deals but with greater diligence and meaningful value-add from investors. This trend, already evident in 2024, signals the end of the growth-at-all-costs mentality. Instead, investors will prioritize paths to profitability and sustainable business models, which will continue to be the hallmark of attractive opportunities.\n\nBasch\n\nWhat will stay: [The] perceived short list of winners in the AI space will continue to command significant investor attention at premium valuations. [There will be a] continued trend of VC-backed companies shuttering as capital markets [become] more selective in terms of funding [and the] continued trend [of] VCs, especially seed stage, [being] unable to raise new funds due to rough performing 2020 or 2021 vintages.\n\nClements\n\nWhat will go: The last cycle was a deep shift to more investors backing enterprise SaaS companies and fewer backing consumer applications. I think this will start to reverse as AI creates more applications for consumers that just weren\u2019t possible a few years ago. Consumer tech will make a welcome comeback in 2025.\n\nWhat is something unexpected you think could happen in 2025 in the world of venture and startups?\n\nCazeau\n\nWe could see mergers or even closures of some big-name unicorns, many of which have been industry darlings for years. These companies have just enough cash to make it to 2025, but not enough growth to go any further. We\u2019re already seeing some consolidation, and this will likely accelerate into 2025.\n\nLinamagi\n\nA significant climate-related disaster, geopolitical conflict, or economic shock has the potential to fundamentally reshape the startup and VC landscape.\n\nBasch\n\nA surge in venture dollars looking at hard technology, as software becomes commoditized due to generative AI. Hard tech as defined by bio, tech, hardware, other forms of deep tech taking center stage. [There will also be] a significant increase in companies raising only a seed round and having a sub-$100 million exit in sub-three years of existence \u2014 revealing a new math that could potentially work for founders and the VCs due to companies with distribution quickly acquiring top products that will complement their existing offering.\n\nClements\n\nSomething unexpected is that OpenAI could convert to a for-profit entity just for Microsoft to be able to acquire it in the largest acquisition ever."

            "article_content": "A recent article in the journal Nature described the new Google-backed artificial intelligence tool GenCast, which can significantly outperform conventional weather forecasting \u2014 with implications for saving money and lives by improving preparations for extreme weather.\n\nAnnounced in early December, GenCast is a machine-learning model that boasts \"better forecasts of both day-to-day weather and extreme events\" than existing systems.\n\nThe technology, developed by the Google-owned company DeepMind, based in London, improves forecasting accuracy for up to 15 days into the future \u2014 a time frame that traditional models have found problematic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a big deal,\" Kerry Emanuel, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor emeritus, told The New York Times.\n\nThe newspaper explained that Emanuel and colleagues argued in 2019 that extending the time for reliable forecasts from 10 days to 15 days could help people avoid the worst of extreme weather and reap \"enormous socioeconomic benefits.\"\n\nAs the Times detailed, the \"chaotic nature of Earth's atmosphere\" has historically put limits on how far into the future forecasters can peer accurately. GenCast achieved higher accuracy in tests using historical data against a current standard-bearer, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\n\nAccording to the Times, the new model also \"ran circles\" around its DeepMind predecessor, released in late 2023. \"It's like we've made decades worth of improvements in one year,\" R\u00e9mi Lam, who worked on both models, said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother improvement: GenCast is a \"probabilistic\" model rather than a \"deterministic\" one \u2014 meaning that it gives probabilities for outcomes rather than just yes/no predictions. This is the difference between a forecast with a percent chance of precipitation and a forecast that simply gives a best guess of whether it will rain at a particular time and place.\n\nGenCast can also use smaller computers and produce results faster than conventional forecasting methods. Yet it still relies on traditional meteorology. The new tool uses AI's ability to pick out patterns from data and create something new, but it's anchored by 40 years of real-world data and current-day measurements, the Times reported.\n\nLam pointed out how this makes GenCast's results less susceptible to some fallacies of other AI products that train on the internet's chaos of facts and fictions. \"We have a ground truth,\" Lam told the Times.\n\nAmong other concerns, AI has been criticized for its massive energy needs. This is particularly a problem if the energy comes from sources that release heat-trapping gases that in turn cause planetary warming and amplify extreme weather.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeepMind has argued that its application of the technology will help people deal with the consequences of changing weather patterns.\n\n\"Weather impacts all of us,\" GenCast's announcement stated. \"As climate change drives more extreme weather events, accurate and trustworthy forecasts are more essential than ever.\"\n\n\"... Consider tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes and typhoons. Getting better and more advanced warnings of where they'll strike land is invaluable.\"\n\nThe DeepMind researchers highlighted how GenCast could also help the field of clean energy, such as by better predicting the reliability of wind power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith DeepMind opening its models to the public, the world may not need to wait long for it to have influence.\n\nForecasters are interested in using the model. Matthew Chantry, a machine learning coordinator at ECMWF, told the Times that his center was already incorporating aspects of the tech.\n\n\"We are eager to engage with the wider weather community,\" two of DeepMind's lead researchers wrote in their blog. They acknowledged that such collaborations \"are critical to our mission to apply our models to benefit humanity.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "When I was planning my reporting trip to Africa this past June, I knew I wanted to visit Bamenda, Cameroon. I\u2019d heard about an archdiocesan-wide push to have an adoration chapel in every parish and had been impressed with the local leader, Archbishop Andrew Nkea.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know, at least not until just weeks before my visit, was that I would be walking into a literal warzone.\n\nBamenda is in the epicenter of the Cameroonian Civil War, which pits English-speaking separatists against the Francophone-dominated government. Since 2017, the conflict has killed roughly 8,000 people.\n\nLearning about the war definitely gave me second thoughts about visiting Bamenda. At the same time, it also put the archdiocese\u2019s push for Eucharistic adoration in a new, more dramatic light. And in the end, my conviction that this story needed to be told won out.\n\nThe daylong visit to Bamenda had its share of hair-raising moments, including an episode where our jeep got stuck on a muddy backstreet \u2014 even my host, a local monsignor, said he was scared in that moment.\n\nBut by God\u2019s grace, I left Bamenda unharmed and with many powerful encounters with local Catholics. I hope that my story\u2019s portrayal of their complete and total reliance upon the Lord in the midst of the ongoing conflict will inspire other Catholics to renew their own Eucharistic devotion \u2014 because I know it inspired me."

Apart from the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), the principal organiser, it is notable that Barbados and the Maldives co-hosted the forum alongside China. The forum, themed \u201cFuture of the Blue Indian Ocean\u2014Development Practice of the Global South,\u201d featured, for the first time, a dialogue between governments and enterprises. Representatives from Chinese and international governments, as well as companies, discussed multi-stakeholder engagement in international development cooperation, paving the way for broader international collaboration by involving multiple stakeholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZhao Fengtao, Deputy Director of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), said, \u201cNext, we are willing to deepen opening-up and cooperation with other countries to jointly create a \u2019new engine\u2019 for the blue economy. We will consolidate consensus on sustainable marine development to build a \u2019new space\u2019 for blue development. Maritime dialogue and consultations will be strengthened to seek a \u2019new model\u2019 for blue governance. We will also promote mutual learning among maritime cultures with other countries to create a \u2019new chapter\u2019 of maritime civilisation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Wang Yong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, mentioned that the \u201cconstruction of a maritime community with a shared future\u201d is evolving from a Chinese initiative into a shared international goal. China aims to enhance partnerships in maritime transport, biomedicine, renewable energy, infrastructure, and marine science and technology, Wang added.\n\nAt the third forum, a \u2018Global Development Project Pool Information Management System\u2019 was launched, along with the inauguration of the \u2018China-Indian Ocean Region Centre for Maritime Cooperation and Training Centre\u2019. Agreements were signed for the creation of a low-carbon demonstration zone in Seychelles and the development of projects for early warning and response to climate-induced disasters in Pakistan and the Maldives.\n\nAccording to CIDCA, which organised the event, \u201cChina has established normalised cooperation mechanisms with 17 Indian Ocean region countries, and cooperation is being carried out in fields including remote sensing, maritime monitoring and research, biodiversity, and disaster reduction.\u201d The forum prominently featured topics such as ocean-based infrastructure, digital empowerment for the blue economy, cultural exchange for marine tourism, automated port projects, automated warehouses, and distribution centres. Additionally, Chu Yili from China Communications Construction Company Ltd highlighted opportunities for joint development in marine new energy and deep-sea resource exploration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Maritime Community with a Shared Future\u2019 represents China\u2019s broad vision for ocean-based economic development, through which it seeks to lead global oceanic and fisheries governance. Under this vision of a \u2018shared future\u2019, China aims to establish diverse mechanisms with a heightened focus on multi-tiered ocean governance in the Indian Ocean Region. To achieve these objectives, China advocates for maritime peace, joint governance of oceans, cooperation in fisheries management, support for marine technologies, and the development of information-sharing mechanisms.\n\nIt is worth recalling the deliverables outlined in the joint statement at the second China-Indian Ocean Region Forum on Development Cooperation (2023). These include establishing the China-Indian Ocean Region Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Alliance; building and initiating the China-Indian Ocean Region Blue Economy Think Tank Network; inaugurating the China-Africa Cooperation Centre on Satellite Remote Sensing Application in Beijing (July 2023); launching the Blue Talent Program; and proposing a New Energy Indian Ocean Initiative, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe China-Africa Cooperation Centre on Satellite Remote Sensing Application stands out as a significant initiative, with clear potential for expansion in the coming years. Notably, China has launched the first satellites for its \u2018GuoWang\u2019 mega constellation (GuoWang meaning \u201cnational network\u201d), intensifying the race for space-based broadband internet services both domestically and internationally. The project is managed by China Satellite Network Group Co. Ltd., a state-owned enterprise established in 2021 under the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet.\n\nThe newly launched satellites mark the first batch of the GuoWang broadband mega constellation in low Earth orbit (LEO), which is planned to consist of nearly 13,000 spacecraft upon completion. Additionally, another Chinese broadband mega constellation, Qianfan (\u201cThousand Sails\u201d), is also under development. Qianfan is expected to feature a similar scale, and to date, 54 Qianfan spacecraft have been launched across three missions conducted this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO) is particularly well-suited for all types of remote sensing, ranging from high-resolution Earth observation to scientific research. Thanks to technological advancements, various types of remote sensing satellites can operate in one of three orbits: polar, non-polar Low Earth Orbit (LEO), or Geostationary Orbit (GEO). The high number of satellites planned by Beijing allows for complete global coverage.\n\nUnderstanding China\u2019s Civil-Military Fusion (CMF) policy is key to recognising that advancements in LEO connectivity have not only enhanced civilian applications but have also triggered a paradigm shift in military communications. Orbiting at lower altitudes, LEO satellites offer low latency, enabling near-instantaneous connectivity for troops. This capability is a game-changer for personnel in the field, at sea, or even in the air, allowing them to make video calls, access critical data, and engage in seamless communication with minimal delay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina\u2019s approach to the \u2018blue economy\u2019 reflects a convergence of geopolitical, economic, ecological, technological, and legal perspectives, presenting emerging challenges for global ocean governance. These challenges arise from China\u2019s integration of the blue economy development concept with its Maritime Silk Road initiative, through which it seeks to shape governance rules to align with its strategic interests. China views the ocean as an integral part of its maritime economy, positioning it as a driver of innovation to advance its goal of becoming a great maritime power. This vision aligns with the broader objectives of the Chinese Dream and national rejuvenation.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping, China aims to enhance maritime trade with the rest of the world, ensure food and energy security, and increase Chinese investments in port and ocean economy-related infrastructure globally. This culminated in the announcement of Beijing\u2019s Vision for Maritime Cooperation in 2017. Since then, China\u2019s Blue Economy concept has evolved into a core component of Beijing\u2019s broader strategy to become a \u201cglobal maritime great power\u201d.\n\nThese efforts give China\u2019s approach a global dimension and connect it to a broader Chinese discourse, linking outward-facing policies such as its claim of being a \u201cnear-Arctic state\u201d in its Arctic policy. It also extends the One Belt and One Road Initiative (BRI) to include projects like the Health Silk Road, Space Silk Road, Arctic Silk Road, and Digital Silk Road, among others. Such discourses have reinforced China\u2019s hardened positions in its maritime disputes with neighbouring countries in the South China Sea, including the Philippines, Vietnam, and others, positions that are widely regarded as unfounded and illegal.\n\nNext, areas like cultural exchange and maritime tourism, though prominently discussed, need to be approached with caution. They create favourable conditions for China to exert influence and strategically position itself. This can lead to a more dominant Chinese presence and may pressure the respective governments to approve Beijing-initiated infrastructure plans with minimal resistance. In return, this facilitates China\u2019s efforts to consolidate the presence of its companies in these regions.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of State Security (Guoanbu) has consistently prioritised cultural soft power and people-to-people exchanges to maintain open channels of communication. In the past, it has devised plans to engage foreign personalities from academic, think tank, and cultural sectors to promote a vision of a benign China\u2014one that poses no threat and positions itself solely as a development partner, aligning with the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). China\u2019s efforts to develop new forms of ties, such as cultural diplomacy, should also be viewed through the lens of the United Front Work Department\u2019s involvement. This CCP organ, known for its overseas influence operations, often operates under the guise of diplomatic channels.\n\nInitiatives like the China-Indian Ocean Region Forum and the China-South Asia Cooperation Forum (CSACF) are part of Beijing\u2019s soft power approach beyond military engagement, focusing on civil-diplomatic efforts to achieve preferred outcomes. Both of these initiatives exclude India, and China uses tools such as aid, capacity building, and advancements in science, technology, and innovation to strengthen its connections with countries in the Indo-Pacific and deepen its influence. In doing so, China also incentivises these countries to reduce their ties with India.\n\nChina relies on a safe, secure, and stable Indian Ocean to achieve its foreign policy and domestic objectives. Its interest in the region is clear, and the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) to China will only continue to grow. This can be seen as part of a new role that Beijing seeks to play in the IOR. These international activities and aspirations are expected to expand in the future.\n\nThe writer is the Head of Strategic Studies Programme at the Centre for National Security Studies (CNSS), Bengaluru.

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nGraphics are a huge part of the PC gaming experience. Unfortunately, not every computer is built for the best games on the market. Laptops and pre-built PCs don't always ship with the best possible specs. And if you built your computer, it can be very expensive to update the internal components.\n\nIf you want to play the latest and greatest games, but aren't sure if your PC can handle them, you'll need to know what graphics card you have installed. Once you have this information, you can then compare it to the minimum requirements for the game you want to play. Here's how to figure it out.\n\nOur Top-Rated Graphics Cards\n\nWhat's a Graphics Card?\n\nWhen you turn on your computer, the images that appear on the screen\u2014whether it's a simple Word document or a complex 4K gaming experience\u2014are generated by a graphics processing unit (or GPU). These chips can range from simple \"integrated graphics,\" which are part of the motherboard or processor, to larger, more powerful expansion cards that have their own fan system.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese cards\u2014often called \"discrete\" or \"dedicated\" graphics cards\u2014can usually perform more powerful tasks than integrated graphics, like better 3D gaming, accelerated video rendering, or even certain non-graphical jobs like mining Bitcoin. This extra utility comes at the expense of higher power usage, increased heat, and more space in your computer, which is why you won't find dedicated graphics cards in ultra-thin laptops.\n\nThere are two main components of a graphics card: the chip that does the work, and the card (which includes other hardware like the cooler, voltage regulation module, and so on). There are two main chip manufacturers today: Nvidia and AMD (though Intel's Arc line has also hit the market). There are many card manufacturers\u2014Asus, EVGA, MSI, Gigabyte\u2014that use these chips, adding their own tweaks to set themselves apart. One manufacturer's version may have better fans, can come overclocked, or have a better warranty.\n\nKnowing what graphics card you have can be confusing, since the chip itself has its own model number that's separate from the card's model number. So when you're looking up what graphics card you have, you'll need to decide whether knowing the chipset is enough (for example, the \"Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060\") or whether you need the actual manufacturer and model of the card (such as the \"EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 Superclocked,\" which uses Nvidia's chipset). The former is very easy to find in Windows, while the latter is a bit more complicated.\n\nJust like any other computer component, graphics cards can become outdated over time. The card you bought in 2015 is unlikely to play 2025's AAA games at high settings, so if you're ever unsure whether a game like Elden Ring will run on your PC, you'll want to compare its minimum or recommended requirements to the hardware you currently have.\n\nFind Out What GPU You Have in Windows\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out what graphics card you have from the Windows Device Manager. Type \"Device Manager\" into the Start menu and press Enter to launch the Control Panel. Click the drop-down arrow next to Display adapters, and it should list your GPU. If you aren't sure which company designed the chip, right-click on it and choose Properties to see the manufacturer\u2014AMD, in my case. (Note that Device Manager uses your graphics drivers to determine what GPU you have, so if you suspect the wrong drivers may be installed, skip to the next section.)\n\nOnce you have the GPU name, you can compare it to the minimum requirements on the game you want to play. Usually, a higher number denotes a better card\u2014so a game that requires an RX 580 may not run well on an RX 480, which is less powerful (though there are sometimes ways around that). If you're comparing two cards that use different naming schemes\u2014like AMD's RX 580 and the more powerful RX Vega 56\u2014you may have to do a little research to see which card is more powerful. Information like release year and price can usually give you the answer.\n\nFind the Manufacturer and Model Number\n\nIf, for some reason, you need to know exactly what model video card you have, you'll have to do a bit more work. The manufacturer is easy enough to find with a third-party app called Speccy. Download the free version, start it up, and click the Graphics option in the sidebar. Scroll down and look for the Subvendor entry, which should tell you who made the card in your PC. (You'll also be able to see how much video RAM your card has, among other specs.)\n\nUnfortunately, this won't tell you the exact model number, which you'll need for, say, warranty claims or tech support. (Asus makes a few different RX 580 cards, and they'll need the exact model number to help.) For that, you'll need to search your email for the receipt (if you bought the card online). Otherwise, you'll need to open the PC up. In this case, find the graphics card, remove it, and look at the sticker on the side\u2014it should have the model number you need.\n\nMake sure to write this information down somewhere so you don't need to crack your PC open next time\u2014you never know when you might need it!"

            "article_content": "Krishna specializes in designing and implementing hybrid cloud architectures for highly regulated sectors, such as the healthcare industry.\n\nGopi Krishna\n\nIntegration design becomes a key component of innovation in the fast-paced field of information technology, where systems need to communicate with each other and data flows need to be optimized. Through this discipline, organizations can solve complex problems, improve operational efficiency, and satisfy constantly changing business demands by bridging the gap between disparate systems. A strategic enabler that propels innovation by coordinating technological solutions with organizational objectives, integration architecture is more than just a technical framework. For Gopi Krishna, a specialist in cloud architectures and middleware solutions, this field offers a special nexus of strategic vision and technical precision. Krishna has a career that includes notable accomplishments in sectors like healthcare and logistics. His journey highlights the transformative power of careful integration architecture in resolving challenging IT issues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKrishna specializes in designing and implementing hybrid cloud architectures for highly regulated sectors, such as the healthcare industry. The two requirements of cost-effectiveness and compliance in this field demand solutions that strike a balance between strict data security and operational scalability. This equilibrium is best demonstrated by Krishna's work, especially in the way he incorporates cutting-edge encryption techniques, safe access controls, and compliance with laws like HIPAA. By taking these precautions, sensitive medical data was protected, and the solutions were scalable to accommodate future organizational requirements.\n\nIn the same way, his contributions to the logistics industry emphasize how important integration architecture is to supply chain optimization. Through the integration of cloud platforms and on-premise systems, Krishna created robust infrastructures that improved the accessibility of real-time data. The effectiveness of order processing and delivery systems was greatly increased by this work, illustrating the direct influence that strong middleware solutions can have on organizational performance.\n\nThe progression of Krishna's career from engineer to middleware architect highlights his dedication to lifelong learning and flexibility. Having earned certifications from AWS and Oracle, he has continuously kept up with the latest developments in technology. Projects like improving the backbone for telecom operators, redesigning the middleware architecture of TelePacific Systems, and developing a unified IT platform for the City of Tshwane in South Africa are just a few examples of his technical proficiency. Krishna's ability to use creative IT solutions to address intricate, systemic inefficiencies is demonstrated by the latter, a massive project to digitize and integrate government operations.\n\nIn his current role, Krishna has produced quantifiable effects at the organizational level. For example, his efforts in internal application security have doubled the system's order handling capacity, resulting in 50% shorter processing times and a 100% increase in transaction rates. Improved service delivery and cost savings are directly correlated with this efficiency. Likewise, his hybrid cloud designs for medical devices guaranteed adherence to international regulatory standards while protecting against data breaches.\n\nHowever, Krishna's career has been fraught with difficulties. For example, integrating legacy systems with contemporary platforms necessitated creative approaches to data processing and security. He maintained their relevance in an age of rapid technological advancement by ensuring smooth communication across disparate systems through the use of tools like RESTful services and API gateways.\n\nThe significance of proactive planning and resilience in IT architecture is highlighted by Krishna's predictions about future trends. He promotes integrating modern technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve operational dependability and security. Moreover, his emphasis on continuous training for IT professionals reflects his recognition of the dynamic nature of security threats and compliance requirements.\n\nReflecting on his experience, Krishna asserts, \u201cIn IT architecture, the key to solving tomorrow\u2019s challenges lies in anticipating them today. Innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies but designing systems that are secure, adaptable, and prepared for the unexpected. This idea acts as a compass for businesses attempting to negotiate the intricacies of integration architecture in a digital environment that is changing quickly.\n\nKrishna has shown through his work that innovation and successfully tackling IT challenges depend heavily on careful design and strategic foresight. As industries continue to change, experts like him establish the benchmark for excellence in integration architecture, helping businesses to accomplish their strategic and operational goals."

He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"
