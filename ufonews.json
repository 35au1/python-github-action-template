        "article_content": "I love diving into gaming history, playing old games and keeping those experiences in my mind for when I play new ones. There\u2019s a whole new world of insight you can access when you come into something armed with context of what came before. Even in my short time at Shacknews I\u2019ve pushed things like preservation because capturing, holding onto, and sharing knowledge feels like an important and underserved piece of criticism in games. UFO 50, a collection of retro-styled games from Mossmouth, feels as much like validation for those principles as it does a new, original work. It\u2019s a fictional portfolio from a long-lost video game studio that celebrates not just games themselves, but the value of going back and unearthing art from the past to both enjoy it and learn from it.\n\nReal games, fictional context\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 doesn\u2019t narrate its story to you, but there\u2019s still a compelling framing device that bleeds into the game\u2019s nuts and bolts. You\u2019re playing a set of 50 games developed by UFO Soft, a company that developed and published games on its series of LX consoles. The games were made throughout the 1980s, and you literally wipe the dust off each cartridge when you play them for the first time. In the main menu each title has a little synopsis, as well as a sentence or two adding some kind of additional historical context. Perhaps it\u2019s an anecdote about a game\u2019s inspiration, such as from a poster in the studio\u2019s bathroom. Other times you\u2019ll get something like how Night Manor, a point and click-style horror game, was UFO Soft\u2019s only game featuring required warning text.\n\nDespite only being a few paragraphs of text in total, there\u2019s a real sense of UFO Soft being a real company that existed in UFO 50\u2019s imagined world. You can feel the vibe that this was a small group in an era when games could be pumped out based on singular ideas, then iterated on in further sequels and other new projects, enough to sustain a company and build not just a library, but an identity. Each little snippet of context feels like reading through old gaming magazines and building a picture in your mind of what it may have looked like to work in gaming in the 1980s.\n\nA complex collection\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s deliberate or not, considering how in interviews the folks behind this game didn\u2019t initially view this project as a single package. But the ways in which the games in UFO 50 follow a sort of evolutionary path is fascinating. If you play each game in order you can map out the trajectory in your mind, especially when you come across sequels and spinoffs of what seem to be UFO Soft\u2019s core IPs. It\u2019s actually wild to think about how the real-life developers plotted out the fictional devs\u2019 progress and laid it out across these titles, rather than simply making each individual game as \u201ccomplete\u201d with all the lessons we\u2019ve collectively learned as devs and gamers in 2024. You\u2019ll see an idea introduced in a game early in the list, then grow and improve over time as you move through the years until there are games towards the end that feel like several ideas and learned lessons culminating into bigger, more elaborate productions.\n\nThat being said, not every game on this list is going to be a certified banger for every player. There\u2019s a wide selection of genre, as well as complexity and that mythical force we refer to in shorthand as \u201cpolish.\u201d There are games here I booted up, played for a couple minutes, and moved on from. I probably won\u2019t play Bug Hunter ever again, for example. But there are other games like Grimstone, a full-by-god wild west JRPG, that I will absolutely go back to and see all the way to the end. It almost feels like I\u2019ve gone back to my formative years playing around with emulators and huge ROM lists, going through and finding what resonated with me while taking in little pieces of everything. Fist Hell felt like a bad version of River City Ransom, while Valbrace is a strange hybrid of Wizardry and Punch-Out that feels like nothing I\u2019ve ever played before. It\u2019s an eclectic mix, and each individual piece contributes to the overall bigger picture of UFO Soft as an entity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that as fun as these games can be, there's a sort of line being toed between authenticity and approachability. A lot of the games in the collection are tough even by the standards of their era, mostly because a lot of them give you one life and no continues. If you die, you simply start right back at the beginning. Other games that are more substantive may offer multiple lives or chances, but it's still a harsh Game Over when you use them up. Features like rewind or unlimited continues may clash with the idea that you're literally cleaning up and playing old cartridges in the narrative, but some kind of compromise would have made trying to really dive into and complete each game a more appealing venture. To UFO 50's credit, the longer games (especially the RPGs) do have auto-saving and checkpoint systems. But having auto-save kind of invalidates the earlier remark about authenticity, so there's a little inconsistency there anyway.\n\nSource: Mossmouth\n\nUFO 50 is like stumbling across a time capsule and discovering a wealth of lost knowledge inside. And yet, it\u2019s entirely a singular work of fiction. That by itself is deeply fascinating and makes this thing worth playing. Even if you pass over most of the games and only find a few that stick with you from a fun perspective, the depth on a conceptual level is absurd and gratifying to simply think about. We\u2019re living at a time in which older games are vanishing from both physical reality and our sort of collective cultural well at an increasing rate, when remakes are seen as replacements for original work and curiosity to seek out history is dwindling unless there\u2019s a purchasable remaster. UFO 50 is fun to play and take at face value, but it also highlights how age really isn\u2019t a detriment to having a great time and engaging with games.\n\nUFO 50 is available now for PC. The game was purchased by Shacknews for this review."

        "article_content": "With 8 Silent Hill 2 endings in the Remake, working out how to get them all - especially when some of them are locked behind obscure puzzles or player actions - is tricky. Whether you want to earn the original endings - Leave, In Water or Maria - or the stranger ones like UFO, Dog or Rebirth, or if you want to see the new endings added in the Silent Hill 2 Remake like Stillness and Bliss, there's a lot of options. All but the first three are gated behind New Game Plus, so players will have to go through the game at least once to see any of the latter ones, but if you're willing to go through it, we'll show you how to get all the endings in the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as well as discuss which of them is the best ending.\n\nAll Endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThere are 8 possible endings to the Silent Hill 2 Remake, all of which we've laid out below, as well as whether you'll be able to unlock them on New Game Plus or your first playthrough.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Ending Requires New Game Plus? Leave No In Water No Maria No Rebirth Yes Dog Yes UFO Yes Bliss (new to Remake) Yes Stillness (new to Remake) Yes\n\nAs mentioned, the last two of these - \"Bliss\" and \"Stillness\" - are unique additions to the Remake, and did not appear in the original game. However, all the others are recreations of possible endings in the 2001 version.\n\n\n\nThe first time around, you'll be able to complete the game and get any of the first three endings - Leave, In Water or Maria - while in subsequent playthroughs of New Game Plus, you'll have the option to unlock all eight of them, including the first three. Below, we'll go through the requirements to unlock them all, without spoiling what those endings actually include.\n\nHow do the endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake work?\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nIt's worth explaining that the \"Leave\", \"In Water\" and \"Maria\" endings in Silent Hill 2 work on a behind-the-scenes points system, or at least something similar to that idea.\n\nThe Remake is constantly judging your actions in-game, with the idea being that Silent Hill 2 is trying to work out how James is feeling about himself and his situation based on the actions you make him take, both in and out of combat. Some endings are based on him caring about the people he meets (or not), whereas others are based on how much he works to defend himself physically or how much self-preservation he exhibits.\n\nIt can be pretty hard to read and is always a little esoteric, but we'll lay out the basic steps that are being measured, and what they contribute to in all the related, relevant guides.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Leave ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"Leave\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal frequently throughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.\n\nthroughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.

Don't go out of your way to protect Maria from threats or stay close to her when she's following you.\n\nThe goal here is to meet two criteria: have James show a high level of self-preservation, while also seeming uninterested in focusing on either Maria or Mary. Healing frequently is the easiest way to ensure this - don't spend a lot of time in low health, and you should be fine, even if you break some of the other rules.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake In Water ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"In Water\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal yourself rarely throughout the game so James spends as much time as possible at low health.\n\nthroughout the game so James spends as much time as possible at low health.

Don't go out of your way to protect Maria from threats or stay close to her when she's following you.\n\nThis time around, you need to complete the game while showing James as somebody with low self-preservation and self-regard, while also focusing on Mary - but NOT Maria.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Maria ending\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe \"Maria\" ending in Silent Hill 2 is achieved by completing the game normally (it does not have to be NG+), under the following conditions.\n\nHeal frequently throughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.\n\nthroughout the game so James spends as little time as possible injured.

After meeting Maria in Rosewood Park, follow her obediently and DO NOT deviate from the pathways she suggests until you reach the hospital (this means don't go looking for the Silent Hill 2 Remake Garage Jack lever).\n\nThe goal here is to show high self-preservation (James wants to live), while also making Maria look like a high priority, but not Mary. This is probably the trickiest of the three \"first playthrough\" endings to achieve, as keeping Maria safe and happy is pretty fiddly, especially when something as minor as bumping into her can have a negative effect.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Rebirth ending\n\nThe Rebirth ending can only be achieved on New Game Plus, and rather than something you do through choices, this time you have to find four special items to add to your inventory throughout the game.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Crimson Ceremony is found in the cemetery where you first meet Angela, on a grave by the lakeside.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe White Chrism is on a table outside of Baldwin Mansion after you first solve the Silent Hill 2 Remake motel safe code puzzle with Maria.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Obsidian Goblet is inside the Historical Society you enter after the hospital, inside an alcove on the wall.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nThe Lost Memories book is in the \"Lost and Found\" on 1F of LakeView Hotel. Breaking a wall in the cafe will allow you to access this.\n\nOnce you have all these four items, completing the main story will automatically trigger the \"Rebirth\" ending, regardless of what choices or actions you've made along the way. This can only be cancelled by triggering the specific conditions for the endings that are listed after this one.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Dog ending\n\nThe legendary \"Dog\" ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake is also specific to New Game Plus, and is unlocked through the following means:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nFind the Broken Key Part 1. This is on top of a desk in the backroom of the Pet Center in the South Vale, which you can explore while fixing the Silent Hill 2 Remake jukebox.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nFind the Broken Key Part 2. After going through the locked gate in the Motel with Maria, turn right three times to find a doghouse in a dead-end path. The second key part is there.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nCombine both key parts in your inventory to make the Dog Key, then use it to open the Observation Room on 3F of the Lakeview Hotel. This will trigger the Dog Ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake UFO ending\n\nAnother ending specific to NG+, the UFO ending in the Silent Hill 2 Remake is achieved through the following method:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nGet the Blue Gem. This is in the window of a jewellery store North of Big Jay's when you're doing the Jukebox repair. Just crack the glass of the store to take the gem. \"Investigate\" the Blue Gem in your inventory at the following locations throughout the game (there'll be a symbol on an eye drawn somewhere nearby to mark you're in the right spot):\n\nThe Rooftop of Saul Street Apartments (while fixing the Jukebox)\n\nThe Pier to the Northwest of Rosewood Park after meeting Maria.\n\nThe dock at the South of LakeView Gardens you moor at after rowing over the lake.\n\nRoom 312 of LakeView Hotel, before you watch the Video tape.Empty list\n\nFulfil all these criteria and the last time you investigate the Blue Gem, in room 312, it should immediately trigger the UFO ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Bliss ending\n\nA new ending created specifically for the Remake, the \"Bliss\" ending is also specific to NG+. Here's how you get it:\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nIn the Northwest corner of the 1F Hospital Garden, while solving the puzzle of the Silent Hill 2 Remake Director's Office hand, you'll find a Small Chest if you crawl through a hole.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nIn Pete's Bowl-O-Rama, just South of the Historical Society after the Hospital, there's a safe you can open with the code 1887 to get the Rusted Key. Combine the Key and Chest in your inventory to get the White Claudia. Progress through the game until you reach room 312 of the Hotel. Select the White Claudia from your inventory to drink it. Watch the video tape, and this time you'll get an alternate ending.\n\nHow to get the Silent Hill 2 Remake Stillness ending\n\nThe last ending, \"Stillness\" is another of the two new finales concocted specifically for the Remake of Silent Hill 2, and specific to NG+. Here's how you get it.\n\nGet the Chainsaw at the very beginning of NG+ (our guide to the Silent Hill 2 Remake weapons will show you how).\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nAfter leaving the Ranch, smash the window of the green car on Wiltse Road to get the Key of Sorrow.\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nLater in the game, after watching the video in Room 312, go to the Manager's Officer on 1F and use the key (and the code 314) to open the safe and get the Toluca Postcard. Inspect the postcard in your inventory at least once. Complete the rest of the game to get the Stillness ending.\n\nWhat is the Silent Hill 2 Remake best ending?\n\n(Image credit: Konami)\n\nWarning: this section of the guide has spoilers for the plot of Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nThe Silent Hill 2 Remake has no best ending as we understand it, it's largely a matter of opinion, and harder to break up into black and white \"good/bad\" binaries. Still, some endings do seem darker than others: the \"Maria\" ending has James not only still ignoring the worst elements of what he did to Mary, it implies the awful events may repeat themselves, with Maria coughing on the way back to the car and James telling her to get that sorted in an ominous tone of voice.\n\n\n\nThe best ending is largely a matter of opinion - and what ultimate fate you think James deserves for what he did. Discarding the comedic UFO and Dog endings, in some finales he lets go of his guilt, but in those he can't, James ends up either destroying himself or potentially going down bleak paths (such as the occult resurrection in the \"Rebirth\" ending). There is no truly clean ending to a game as complex as Silent Hill 2 - and there probably shouldn't be.\n\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+. Not to be reproduced without permission"

        "article_content": "Sahan de Silva wanted more from his budgeting app than it could give him. PocketSmith tracked his monthly cash flow, but what he really needed was help making spending decisions in real time.\n\n\"I have this bad habit of going to cafes too much,\" de Silva said.\n\nChecking his budget before popping into a cafe could help him keep that habit in check, but he found the experience frustrating. \"I had to open PocketSmith, sometimes log in again and then go to my budget page. There was no way that I was gonna do that on the go to check something.\"\n\nDe Silva was already using the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT throughout the day to look up information and ask questions about a variety of topics. So he thought it might be able to help him with this, too.\n\nHe created a custom ChatGPT thread and gave the generative AI tool his budgeting data using PocketSmith's application programming interface, a tool that allows one app to \"talk\" to another. (Finding this API just took a quick Google search.) From there, he could ask ChatGPT questions about his spending, from basic information like whether he could go for lunch that day to post-analysis like which days he tended to spend more on eating out.\n\nHe could even snap a photo of a pair of sneakers he wanted to buy and ask ChatGPT if he could afford them. The chatbot recognized the image, deduced that it belonged in the \"Appearance\" category in his budget and then ruled that, yes, he had the money to get the shoes.\n\nPretty awesome, right? For nearly two years now, OpenAI's ChatGPT has been wowing us with its lightning-quick ability to process what we ask it to do for us: It can write eloquent emails, help plan meals for the week and free up time in our weekly schedules. It also set off a profusion of similar tools, including broad-ranging chatbots like Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot and Anthropic's Claude, as well as more specialized apps. Hardly a month goes by without a leap forward in AI's abilities.\n\n\"[AI apps] are really interesting, shiny new tools that provide really good power. But most people don't know what question to ask.\" Arman Hezarkhani, CEO, Parthean\n\nBut generative AI is hardly perfect. The large language models that underlie those chatbots make educated guesses about how to string words together, often with delightful, satisfying results. At the same time, they can whip up responses that may sound convincing but that miss the point or even get things just plain wrong.\n\nSo it's important to approach gen AI tools with care, mixing a healthy skepticism into an appreciation of all the things they can do well \u2014 and how they can be truly useful resources. The same applies to any finance software you might use, AI-powered or otherwise.\n\nFor de Silva, gen AI does enough right that he finds it helpful in how he manages his money \u2014 something many of us struggle with.\n\nYou don't need to know what \"API\" means to benefit from it. Budgeting app developers are finding creative new ways to harness the latest AI technology to provide actionable, easy-to-understand guidance customized to your personal financial situation. With financial education decidedly lacking in the US and a plethora of conflicting money advice out there, this guidance can be invaluable.\n\nDe Silva likens how he uses ChatGPT with PocketSmith to having a personal CFO to approve his spending or calling a friend to run a decision past them. \"It does all the heavy lifting,\" he said.\n\nAI has plenty of potential to help you make better financial decisions and build your money smarts \u2014 without having to wade through a ton of information or rely on a pricey adviser. However, it also has its limitations, and knowing how to avoid them is key to evaluating AI tools and their advice to make sure they're guiding you in the right direction.\n\nYou may already be using AI to manage your money\n\nGetty Image/ Zooey Liao/ CNET\n\nAI may seem like a fairly recent development, and it's certainly becoming more sophisticated by the day. But it's been a part of many financial tools since the early 2000s.\n\nArtificial intelligence enables computer systems to do tasks that typically require human intelligence. In its basic form, it can gather and analyze large amounts of data, spot patterns and perform automated tasks. If you use a budgeting app, there's a good chance you're already using this kind of AI.\n\nPopular budgeting apps like Rocket Money and YNAB use AI to do some of the tedious work of budgeting for you. These apps connect with your bank and other financial accounts to import your data, organize it and analyze it using predefined criteria. For example, they can pull in your checking account transactions, sort them into categories like \"groceries\" and \"utilities,\" and provide basic insights like how much room is left in your budget and whether you're on track to reach your savings goals.\n\nTheir capabilities are often limited beyond that. If you want to dig deeper \u2014 say, to figure out why you keep going over budget or whether your savings goals make sense \u2014 it's up to you to analyze your data in the larger context of your personal situation, then scour resources like financial websites, books and podcasts to try to determine which of the conflicting words of wisdom you should follow. I've written about personal finance for over a decade, including testing numerous budgeting apps, and even I find this kind of legwork overwhelming and exhausting.\n\nBut help from AI is on the way. The next generation of budgeting apps \u2014 some already released, some in development \u2014 employ sophisticated generative AI abilities like machine learning (which enables computers to learn from data without human instruction) and natural language processing (which enables computers to understand and interpret human language) to provide this extra layer of guidance and support.\n\nPocketSmith, for instance, has introduced a new feature called AI Tasks. Currently in beta testing, it allows you to interact with ChatGPT from within the app's interface to ask for insights into your money. The company is looking to determine what people want most from AI, but ultimately, says CTO and founder James Wigglesworth, it hopes the app can \"deliver immediate, timely personalized financial insights directly to you, like a personal financial assistant.\"\n\nHere's a look at some more of these apps, how they're taking money management to the next level and what you need to know to use them wisely.\n\nApps that build a personal relationship with you\n\nGetty Image/ Zooey Liao/ CNET\n\nGen AI tools such as ChatGPT can do many things, but forming a personal connection with people isn't usually one of them. And when it comes to something as emotionally fraught as finances, that connection can make a big difference. The budgeting app Cleo aims to differentiate itself by doing just that.\n\nCleo's chatbot sounds more like a friend than a robot. She \u2014 the company refers to Cleo as though she's a real person \u2014 is witty, sassy and pull-no-punches. When you ask her how your spending is doing, she might tell you to \"Treat yo' self, but maybe slow down a bit?\" When you ask how to stress less over money, she might begin by responding, \"I hear you. This sh*t is real and it's tough.\" Sometimes, she'll send you a meme. It feels like texting with a brutally honest but loving friend.\n\nPart of this personality comes from human writers with a comedy background, who help develop features like Cleo's \"modes\" \u2014 special chat experiences you can enable to encourage you (Hype Mode), deliver some tough love (Roast Mode) or frame your spending in terms that speak to your favorite fandom (Taylor Swift Mode).\n\n\"We're really trying to build bespoke features. We understand that how people manage their money is different.\" Roxanne Nejad, brand strategy director, Cleo\n\nBut another part comes from Cleo's LLM, or large language model. LLMs use natural language processing to analyze vast datasets to generate writing and speech that sound like human communication. They're the engine that enables AI chatbots to hold a logical, text-based conversation with you. Cleo drew from its origins as a Facebook Messenger app when it trained its LLM. By reviewing and analyzing what people asked the app, the LLM was able to hone how it classified and responded to those questions and create customized answers in a smooth, conversational style.\n\nCleo's personality can make money management more approachable and fun. But it can also inspire a level of trust and comfort that helps people get real about financial struggles they've been uncomfortable addressing.\n\n\"People don't trust their banks and are disillusioned with the information they might find online, and they feel scared or embarrassed to have a conversation with their friends and family about their financial situation,\" said Roxanne Nejad, Cleo's brand strategy director. \"That's where we feel Cleo is the perfect solution. Cleo is not going to judge you. There's no judgment here because she's not a person.\"\n\nAnd from the feedback Nejad has seen, people truly appreciate Cleo's personal touch. \"Users have typed into Cleo over 30,000 times, 'I love you, Cleo,' and proposed to Cleo over 2,000 times,\" Nejad said.\n\nI tried it myself out of curiosity. Cleo said she loves me too, but she isn't ready for that kind of commitment, so we should just focus on my finances.\n\nApps that give you customized advice\n\nGetty Image/ Zooey Liao/ CNET\n\nThere are basic rules of thumb for smart money management, like spending less than you earn, building savings and paying down debt. But how you apply those rules \u2014 and which should you focus on \u2014 depends on your unique situation and goals.\n\n\"There is not a one-size-fits-all approach,\" said Jannese Torres, money coach, founder of the Yo Quiero Dinero podcast and CNET Expert Review Board member. \"There are so many different things that we have to factor into when we're creating our own personal finance goals. \u2026 Somebody who is a fresh graduate out of college \u2014 who is trying to get their first apartment and wants to save up a security deposit \u2014 is going to have a very different plan of action than somebody who's in their mid-30s and has two kids.\"\n\nTendi, a budgeting app currently in beta testing, aims to address this need with what it calls \"financial personas.\" According to John Kalanakis, Tendi's founder, the app uses machine learning to observe a person's transactions, identify patterns over time and assign them a financial persona, such as Busy Professional, Frugal Parent or Thrifty Student.\n\n\"These personas aren't just labels; they help the platform create recommendations and challenges to best match someone's specific financial situation and goals,\" said Kalanakis. \"A 'Frugal Parent' might receive suggestions focused on maximizing savings for family expenses, while a 'Thrifty Student' might receive advice on managing limited income while balancing education-related costs.\"\n\n\"Once Tendi learns about someone's passions, the platform makes more relevant financial suggestions.\" John Kalanakis, founder, Tendi\n\nYour persona also allows Tendi to create a customized budget based on your spending patterns. It generates about 30 to 50 potential budgets for your persona, then uses generative AI to see how well these budgets would work for you based on your past transactions and goals. The \"winning\" plan is the one you'll see. For instance, your budget recommendations may differ if you want to reduce debt versus if you want to boost your savings.\n\nYou're free to tweak your recommended budget however you like, but this starting point could be a game-changer for people who've struggled to set a realistic budget in the past. Most budgeting apps require you to set your own spending limits or, if they offer any recommendations, they're based on how you've spent your money in the past \u2014 not what's in your best interest moving forward.\n\nIn addition, Tendi monitors how well you stick to your budget and where you tend to overspend. This information helps it gauge how well its recommendations serve each persona and adjust these recommendations moving forward.\n\nCleo also monitors your spending and savings behavior to spot areas for improvement, then suggests challenges that can help you do better. For instance, if Cleo notices you always go over your shopping budget, she might suggest you trim your spending this month for the store you visit most often. She then provides several options to do this \u2014 like making fewer visits or only spending a certain amount \u2014 so you can choose the one that works for you.\n\n\"We're really trying to build bespoke features,\" Nejad said. \"We understand that how people manage their money is different.\"\n\nApps that acknowledge your priorities\n\nGetty Image/ Zooey Liao/ CNET\n\nA budget that leaves no room for the things you value is often a budget that's doomed to fail. Knowing what you prioritize and finding a way to afford it can make it easier to stick to your goals without suffering the frugal fatigue that can derail your budget.\n\n\"One of the things that I always tell my clients is, 'My budget is not gonna look like your budget.' I hate cooking, so I budget for DoorDash delivery,\" said money coach Rita Soledad Fern\u00e1ndez Paulino, founder of Wealth Para Todos and a CNET Expert Review Board member.\n\n\"When I see content like, 'Stop eating out. That's how you have more money,' I'm like, 'No, no one wants to cook three times a day, seven days a week. That's exhausting. And then the cleanup. No, no, no, no.'\"\n\nThis is something that strictly by-the-numbers apps often overlook. Kalanakis says Tendi is exploring how to address this by allowing people to connect their social media accounts, such as Facebook or Instagram, to the app so it can get a sense of what matters to them. For example, if someone regularly posts about travel, fitness or concerts, Tendi can factor this into the recommendations it gives them.\n\n\"Once Tendi learns about someone's passions, the platform makes more relevant financial suggestions,\" said Kalanakis. \"So, if they are passionate about travel, Tendi might suggest setting up a travel savings fund or recommend ways to cut back in other areas to afford future trips. The idea is to align the financial advice with their passions to produce a better budget that users are more likely to engage with and follow.\"\n\nThe app studies social media posts and uses natural language processing to analyze the content, sentiment analysis to identify whether the emotion behind each post is positive or negative and keyword extraction to identify recurring themes. Tendi is also exploring how image analysis \u2014 similar to what de Silva used for his sneaker purchase \u2014 can identify themes in the pictures users post. The goal is to create an app that works with you, not against you.\n\n\"People have passions, and you've got to respect those passions and at the same help them achieve their goals,\" Kalanakis said. \"If someone loves sports and they spend every last dime on sports, you can't just say, 'Just stop that.' We've got to help them understand, 'Well, maybe go to every other game, or maybe we can help find a balance here.' And that's where we're trying to apply AI to really personalize that information.\"\n\nApps that teach you as you go\n\nWhen we asked AI financial app creators what their mission was in creating their products, boosting financial literacy was a recurring theme. It's hard to manage your money wisely if you don't understand the basics. Unfortunately, many of us enter adulthood poorly (if at all) prepared to make the best decisions for our money.\n\nGetty Image/ Zooey Liao/ CNET\n\nFinancial education is sorely lacking in the US, with many students receiving little to no education on topics like budgeting, investing and money management. In a 2023 report, the Center for Financial Literacy at Champlain College evaluated each state's financial literacy curriculum for grades K through 11 and assigned a letter grade from A (financial education course required to graduate) to F (no financial education requirements or offerings). Nearly half (45%) of the states received a C grade or lower.\n\nIn a recent study by TIAA and the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center, Americans were only able to correctly answer an average of 48% of questions on financial literacy topics like savings, income, investing and retirement. A quarter (24%) of respondents got seven or fewer of the 28 questions right.\n\nFinancial literacy is crucial when it comes to successfully managing your money. According to a 2022 report by the FINRA Foundation, respondents with higher financial literacy were more likely to live within their means, have a three-month emergency fund saved up and have a retirement account. They were also more likely to avoid costly credit card fees and alternative borrowing sources like pawn shops and payday loans.\n\nA lack of financial literacy can make it harder to navigate financial decisions and make the one that's best for your current needs and long-term goals.\n\n\"[AI apps] are really interesting, shiny new tools that provide really good power,\" said Arman Hezarkhani, CEO and founder of the financial app Parthean. \"But most people don't know what question to ask. \u2026 A big portion of a financial adviser's job is to identify the questions that the client doesn't know to ask and then provide those answers proactively.\"\n\nParthean's AI monitors key indicators of a person's financial situation, like spending habits and credit card usage, to serve them tips customized to their needs. For instance, if it notices you spend most of your income at the beginning of the month, it may send you a quick budgeting tip, which you can ask the AI to explain further if you want to learn more. Parthean also delivers a daily newsletter with information applicable to your personal finances, like market news about the stocks in your investment portfolio.\n\nOne of Parthean's goals is to make financial education more accessible by providing what Parthean's head of curriculum, Catie Hogan, calls \"just-in-time knowledge.\"\n\n\"We're providing people knowledge about [their] finances as it's relevant,\" Hogan said. \"You can talk all day long about Roth IRA and backdoor Roths and this, that and the other thing. But unless it's specifically relevant to that person at that time, they're not going to really retain that information or be interested in that information.\"\n\nBy delivering the insights people need in the moment, in an easily digestible manner, apps like Parthean make it easier to boost your money knowledge and make smart financial decisions without becoming overwhelmed.\n\nAI doesn't always get things right\n\nGetty Image/ Zooey Liao/ CNET\n\nIn a July 2023 study conducted by Qualtronics on behalf of Intuit Credit Karma, nearly half (43%) of respondents said they would be willing to use AI to manage their money if it would solve their money problems. But in a FINRA study released in June this year, only 5% of respondents said they turn to AI to make financial decisions. (Note: This measures whether they knowingly turn to AI. A quarter of respondents said they use financial apps, and some of these may have an AI component they don't know about.)\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to AI adoption is distrust. And this distrust is wise. AI is prone to \"hallucinations\" \u2014 making answers up out of thin air, even if the question you ask is clear.\n\nThese errors can be amusing in some situations. Most people can spot the silliness in AI telling them to put glue on their pizza or eat a rock a day for vitamins and minerals. But when it comes to your hard-earned money, inaccurate or misleading guidance is no laughing matter. And these errors may not be as obvious to spot.\n\n\"You need to gut-check the information that you get [from AI tools].\" Natalie Taylor, certified financial planner\n\nSurprisingly, one thing AI isn't always the best at is numbers. The company behind popular budgeting app Monarch Money learned this when it launched a beta version of its AI Assistant in January.\n\nSince Monarch connects to a person's financial accounts, the company hoped that integrating an AI chatbot into the app would allow people to ask questions pertinent to their own situations. But it discovered that while AI Assistant was able to answer broad financial questions and provide advice, its computational skills were subpar. Those underlying LLMs focus on holding logical conversations rather than running mathematical computations the way a calculator might.\n\n\"Ironically, it was pretty good at some of the more advanced, nuanced, human-type questions like, 'Hey, give me some tax advice,' or 'What should I consider in this situation?'\" said Val Agostino, Monarch co-founder and CEO. \"But then when somebody asked it more quantitative questions like, 'How has my spending on groceries changed over the last three months?' even though we at Monarch had all that data, we found that it was very inconsistent and often wrong \u2014 probably 15 to 20% of the time.\"\n\nNot wanting to present people with an unreliable product, Monarch decided its AI Assistant wasn't ready for prime time and disabled it as a default feature on the app. You can still enable this feature in your account settings if you wish, but Monarch has a clear disclaimer that its advice isn't meant to be a substitute for professional financial advice.\n\nEven when the math is right, AI still may not take into account the larger context. When CNET contributor Amanda Smith asked ChatGPT for debt payoff advice, it didn't seem to fully understand the assignment. It told her to overpay one card by $1,000, didn't consider that some cards would be paid off before others and recommended payment amounts that pushed her budget into the red. Clarifying her goals with additional prompts didn't help much. In the end, she wound up moving ChatGPT's numbers over to Excel and adjusting them the old-fashioned way: manually.\n\nThe possibilities are exciting\n\nDespite the pitfalls and drawbacks, the future is bright when it comes to potential uses for AI in personal finance.\n\nConsider George Cockerill, who created a daily podcast about money \u2014 his money. This podcast updates him on his spending, identifies areas for improvement and suggests tips to do better. He isn't a money expert, and he isn't even a podcaster \u2014 he doesn't write episode scripts, record himself or edit the audio. It's all done by AI.\n\nCockerill's process isn't something the average person is likely to do \u2014 he's a user experience designer who came up with a fun project to teach himself about AI. But recent developments have made it increasingly possible for the average person to create their own podcast using AI. (More on that in a moment.)\n\nFor those interested in the nitty-gritty, here's what Cockerill's process looked like: He used a combination of ChatGPT and Python code (a programming language) to analyze his budget data from PocketSmith's API and create a 2-minute podcast script. He then used OpenAI's API to convert this script to speech and turn it into an MP3 file. Next, he created a custom image for the podcast episode using StabilityAI \u2014 a text-to-image generator \u2014 and used Python to upload the episode to his RSS feed, which he added to his podcast player. Now he can open his podcast player and get a quick update on his money.\n\nThe final product was far from perfect. The AI-generated voice was flat, and the tips it gave weren't always applicable to Cockerill's personal situation. But what he was able to do speaks to the myriad ways AI could be used in the future to create customized tools that give you the financial information you need in whatever way works best for you. And AI's capabilities are evolving rapidly.\n\nGoogle's new podcasting tool Audio Overview is already enabling average people to create their own AI-generated podcasts based on information they provide, without all the technical steps Cockerill took. These podcasts are hosted by two AI hosts who have a conversation about the topic you've requested \u2014 something Cockerill expressed interest in doing when we spoke.\n\nHow to use AI smartly for money management\n\nSo how can you use AI to manage your money better while avoiding the pitfalls?\n\nFirst, research any AI tool you're considering. Look up news and reviews of the app, and check out user ratings on the App Store and Google Play to see what people are saying about their experience with it. This can tell you a lot about what the app promises versus what it actually delivers.\n\nGetty Image/ Zooey Liao/ CNET\n\nFor example, WallyGPT billed itself as \"the world's first GPT-powered personal finance app,\" and it seemed promising when it launched in the summer of 2023. But when I went to review it for CNET's best budgeting apps list earlier this year, I wasn't able to register an account after downloading the app. Today, the WallyGPT site isn't even available.\n\nIt's unclear why; we reached out to multiple people at WallyGPT for comment and have not heard back. But clues may lie in its poor App Store and Google Play reviews, which cite issues such as bad transaction categorization, miscalculations and a chatbot prone to errors \u2014 including simply not responding to prompts at all.\n\nIn addition to reading customer feedback, don't look to AI apps as your sole source of financial guidance. Consider it one tool in your toolbox, but also seek guidance from reputable financial websites, books, coaches or financial advisers to build the foundational understanding you need to vet the AI's advice.\n\n\"You need to gut-check the information that you get [from AI tools],\" said Natalie Taylor, a certified financial planner, financial technology consultant and company adviser for Monarch Money. \"The words they use and the way that it's phrased sounds like it's correct, but I think AI sounds just as good giving good advice as it does giving bad advice.\"\n\nFinally, don't take a \"set it and forget it\" approach to AI financial tools. Your needs may change over time as you encounter life events like job loss, marriage or the birth of a child. Consider any AI tool a good starting point, but review your strategy regularly to see if it needs adjusting. The goals you originally set may no longer fit, or you may realize over time that the app's guidance isn't giving you the results you hoped it would.\n\n\"I never want folks to take their foot off the gas and let stuff go on autopilot because you just never know,\" Torres said. \"You could discover down the road that this isn't actually doing what [you] needed to do, but because you put so much faith in it in the beginning, now you have to retrace your steps and figure out what the heck happened. So I say, trust but verify. That's my relationship with AI.\"\n\nUltimately, you're in the driver's seat when it comes to your financial success, but AI tools can help make the journey easier. If you've been struggling with money management, AI is certainly worth exploring -- as long as you keep its limitations in mind.\n\n\"I think that people should be wary,\" Hezarkhani said. \"But it shouldn't keep them from trying.\"\n\nVisual Designer | Zooey Liao\n\nSenior Motion Designer | Jeffrey Hazelwood\n\nCreative Director | Viva Tung\n\nVideo Producer | Mike Viney\n\nVideo Executive Producer | Andy Altman\n\nProject Manager | Danielle Ramirez\n\nDirector of Content | Jonathan Skillings\n\nEditor | Corinne Reichert"

        "article_content": "India's AI Advantage: Building Applications on LLMs\n\nShare on:\n\nBy Rediff Money Desk, New Delhi Oct 16, 2024 12:22\n\nIndia emerges as a global AI hub, leveraging engineering talent and vast data to build innovative applications on top of LLMs, transforming industries like SaaS and IT services.\n\nIllustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com\n\nNew Delhi, Oct 16 (PTI) In 2023, the world's early AI applications and large language models (LLMs) emerged primarily from the Bay Area, driven by highly specialised PhDs in deep learning. India then lagged in terms of access to these expert resources. A year later, the India story has changed dramatically.\n\n\n\nThe year 2024 will go down as a turning point with engineers in India beginning to develop innovative AI applications across various verticals, without needing deep learning PhDs. The number of AI startups building solutions on top of LLMs has since surged significantly.\n\n\n\n\u0093India is rapidly becoming a global hub for AI applications,\u0094 says Shekhar Kirani, a partner at global venture capital firm Accel.\n\n\n\nHe points to specific examples that demonstrate India's unique advantage in AI. A Bengaluru-based engineering team, for instance, built an AI application that automates 10-Q filings for US companies. Traditionally handled by accounting firms, the process took several days. However, the team trained a deep-learning model on top of open-source LLMs, reducing the time needed to generate these filings to under an hour.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kirani, India's vast services sector\u0097encompassing call centres, accounting, healthcare management, IT, and document processing\u0097offers access to a rich dataset for training AI models. \u0093India is a goldmine for trainable data, and our engineers are perfectly positioned to build industry-specific AI applications.\u0094\n\n\n\nLEVERAGING PROPRIETARY DATA FOR AI INNOVATION\n\n\n\nA standout example of India's growing expertise in AI is CareStack, a dental practice management software company in Accel's portfolio.\n\n\n\nCareStack's engineers in Kerala developed an AI application that records voice annotations from dentists and automates data entry into patient management systems. This solution, built on OpenAI's LLM, was made possible because the company had amassed a large dataset of voice samples from its dentist customers.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Zenoti, another Accel-backed company, developed an AI-powered front-office management system for spas and salons. The AI agent handles appointment scheduling, cancellations, and customer queries in real-time. These examples, says Kirani, illustrate how Indian companies are combining proprietary datasets with existing LLMs to create solutions that are transforming industries.\n\n\n\nINDIA'S EDGE IN BUILDING AI APPLICATIONS ON LLMS\n\n\n\nIn Kirani's view, India's combination of engineering talent, industry expertise, and access to trainable data gives the country a clear advantage in building AI applications on top of LLMs.\n\n\n\n\u0093We are seeing small, young teams\u0097engineers just three years out of college\u0097creating phenomenal AI applications,\u0094 he explains.\n\n\n\nKirani predicts that India will lead the way in developing middleware and application layers for LLM engines, integrating and personalising AI to meet enterprise needs.\n\n\n\nHowever, he also acknowledges that India faces significant competition in building the core LLM engines. \u0093The West is investing billions of dollars in this space. It's unlikely that India will outpace these global players in LLM engine development in the short term.\u0094\n\n\n\nInstead, India's strength lies in its ability to adapt and integrate these engines, making them work for specific enterprises and personalising AI applications for users.\n\n\n\nAI'S IMPACT ON INDIA'S SAAS AND IT INDUSTRIES\n\n\n\nAccording to Kirani, the fusion of AI with India's services and SaaS industries presents a massive opportunity. India's USD 250 billion IT services industry is already partnering with SaaS startups to offer AI-powered solutions on an outcome-based pricing model. AI is not just revolutionising SaaS startups but is also reshaping the rules for the services industry.\n\n\n\n\u0093Much like the disruption we saw in global telecom prices that fuelled the growth of India's services companies, we are now witnessing AI's ability to elevate Indian SaaS companies to the next level,\u0094 Kirani explains.\n\n\n\nHe believes that India's engineering talent, combined with the right business model innovation, could make the country a shining global leader in AI productized services over the next decade.\n\n\n\nA NEW WAVE OF TECH DISRUPTION\n\n\n\nKirani predicts that the next wave of tech disruption is just beginning. Companies that fail to adapt to this new reality will perish, while a new generation of startups will emerge to ride the AI wave.\n\n\n\n\u0093At Accel, we are betting big on this wave, investing heavily in AI-based productized services. The future is bright for Indian startups that embrace the fusion of AI and services,\u0094 Kirani says.\n\nDISCLAIMER - This article is from a syndicated feed.

        "article_content": "This is the most haunted place in CT, according to Thrillist\n\nAs a state filled with history, Connecticut is home to many colonial inns, and one of them was just named the most haunted place in the state by Thrillist.\n\nThrillist, a travel publication focused on inspiring travel plans where exploration meets culture, just released their 2024 list of the most haunted places in every state. With disturbing hotels, abandoned hospitals and horror movie sets, their list of America's most haunted places gives suggestions for the best year-round haunt in each state.\n\nThis year's list names the most haunted place in Connecticut as 1754 House, a historical inn nestled in the Naugatuck Valley.\n\nWhy is 1754 House haunted?\n\n1754 House's original building was constructed as a family home by Rev. Anthony Stoddard in 1734. Since then, it has operated as an inn under multiple different names, most notably the Curtis House Inn.\n\nToday, dozens of ghosts are believed to haunt the inn. While no identities are known for certain, the entities are rumored to be spirits of former inn guests, owners and employees, ranging in everything from young girls to old Confederate soldiers. According to Thrillist, paranormal happenings include disembodied voices, mysterious footsteps and unwelcome bedfellows.\n\nWhat Thrillist said: \"Gordon Ramsay once featured Connecticut\u2019s oldest inn on his appropriately-titled reality show Hotel Hell, bringing a paranormal investigator to corroborate what locals and visitors have been claiming for centuries: The joint\u2019s haunted. Ramsay\u2019s unsettling difficulty exiting his room during a five-day stay could have been due to faulty hardware, but try telling that to the guests who\u2019ve reported disembodied voices, mysterious footsteps, and unwelcome, otherworldly bedfellows throughout the inn\u2019s 260-plus-year history. \"\n\nMore: Murdered wives? Former jails? 5 of the most haunted restaurants to visit in CT\n\nHow to visit 1754 House\n\nGuests at the 1754 House can stay in beautiful historical rooms full with modern comforts. Those who want to experience some paranormal action but do not wish to stay the night can visit one of the inn's contemporary American restaurants. Flat Five Blues Tavern is open Wednesday-Saturday from 5-10 p.m., and the 1754 Dining Room is open Tuesday-Thursday from 4-9 p.m., Friday-Sunday from 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m. and Sunday from 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.\n\nThe 1754 House is located at 506 Main St. South in Woodbury, CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Patriot Ledger: 1754 House most haunted place in CT, per Thrillist.

        "article_content": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 To understand what the future holds for the Pittsburgh Steelers at quarterback, you have to look back to before the season began.\n\nOn Aug. 28, coach Mike Tomlin named Russell Wilson his starter. But with the next breath, Tomlin promised Justin Fields would have an opportunity to contribute in certain packages that showcase his outstanding mobility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s important to remember now, after Tomlin said Tuesday that Wilson will be \u201cin contention\u201d to play and potentially start Sunday night against the New York Jets. Many viewed this as Tomlin turning away from Fields \u2014 or to put it more bluntly, benching the former Bear.\n\nBut this is far from the end for Fields. He could still claim the starting job, if not this week then later this season. Even if he doesn\u2019t, as long as Tomlin sticks with the original plan he laid out six weeks ago, the answer to this quarterback question might be closer to \u201cboth\u201d than any kind of benching.\n\nGO DEEPER Steelers coach Mike Tomlin says Russell Wilson 'in consideration' to start Sunday\n\nWhen Tomlin was asked what Fields, who went 4-2 as the starter, has to improve to keep the job, he said, \u201cJustin has been really good. We\u2019ve been really good at times \u2014 but not to be confused as great. This is a competitive league. We\u2019re trying to position ourselves to be that team.\u201d\n\nIf Tomlin is expecting great, not just good, quarterback play, then Wilson should be held to the same standard. There\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll be an obvious upgrade after two tumultuous seasons in Denver. He\u2019ll need to prove himself, especially as a passer, and as a catalyst for the offense \u2014 knowing Fields is waiting in the wings, with the benefit of extensive experience with the first-team offense.\n\nIn that way, the so-called competition that was staged during training camp might not be complete. Maybe it\u2019s just beginning. For the first time really since OTAs, Wilson will get extended playing time with the first team. It\u2019s also worth noting that offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has heaped praise upon Fields and has found ways to get the former No. 11 pick to play his best football in the NFL.\n\nHow the Steelers manage this unique dynamic will be critical for them continuing their playoff push and, possibly, snapping the postseason win drought that dates back to 2016. The key will be to lean into each player\u2019s strengths to spark an offense that has been inconsistent.\n\nGO DEEPER Steelers film room: The good and bad of Justin Fields through 2 games\n\nWith Wilson, the Steelers would be getting a more polished veteran quarterback who can lean on his experience in his 13th season. Set to turn 36 in November, Wilson does not have the same mobility he had in his youth, especially as he returns from that lingering calf injury. Twice over the past five seasons, he led the league in sacks. With an injured and inexperienced offensive line, the risk of sacks setting the Steelers back is real.\n\nRussell Wilson led the NFL in sacks taken twice over the last five seasons. That's one of the biggest risks in playing him over Fields, especially as Russ comes back from a calf injury. The Jets have 20 sacks on the year, third most and the fifth-highest pressure rate (39.8%). \u2014 Mike DeFabo (@MikeDeFabo) October 15, 2024\n\nWilson also leaned on his mobility in his younger days to extend plays and create outside of structure. The Steelers should not expect him to be this type of passer and will need to evolve the offense accordingly.\n\nThat said, Wilson still has a live arm. His trademark is his moonball, and he can still sling it. For an offense that wants to be run-first and sometimes run-second, the formula is going to be a heavy dose of ground-and-pound with the hope that Wilson can add the necessary spark through the air via well-timed, play-action deep shots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson is also a much more accurate passer. That helps with a receiving corps that has struggled to create separation and needs a quarterback willing and able to fit the ball into tight windows. Even things like checkdowns and screens should open up with Wilson behind center, as Fields has often been erratic on these throws.\n\nNow, you could also argue that the Fields is the Steelers\u2019 most dynamic weapon on offense. His speed and deceptiveness are like a cheat code in the red zone. His scrambling ability has saved the offensive line from several sacks. His 4.4 speed has allowed Smith to get creative with the quarterback in the running game. Each week it seems the Steelers are installing a new wrinkle to the run game as a way to feature Fields\u2019 legs, including this week when Smith unveiled a speed option.\n\nGO DEEPER Steelers followed their blueprint vs. Raiders, but the elephant in the room remains\n\nIt might seem on the surface like the Steelers would be taking that element out of the offense if they start Wilson. However, done right, Pittsburgh could actually find ways to feature Fields as a runner even more. There is less need to protect Fields if he\u2019s not the starting quarterback. By consistently utilizing the Fields package, the Steelers would make it more challenging to game plan against them and prepare for possible surprises in the QB run game.\n\nTomlin knows this. He declined to say how reps will be split up between the QBs in practice, or when he\u2019ll decide who will start, or how the offense would change if Wilson plays.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen,\u201d he said, adding with a smile, \u201cand I think that\u2019s one of the cute things about this discussion.\u201d\n\nThe best-case scenario here is that Wilson comes in, takes care of the football like he has throughout his career and adds the missing dimension through the air. Then, if the Steelers can play Fields enough, they would still have an explosive threat in the run game who can be a game-breaker in the right situations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this eliminates the possibility of Fields \u2014 who, like Wilson, is in the final year of his contract \u2014 becoming the starter in the long term. Before the season, Tomlin said he was hopeful that Fields could learn from being in the same QB room as Wilson. As long as the Steelers keep Fields engaged through this process, there\u2019s still potential for him to prove enough to be the guy next season.\n\nIt\u2019s also not out of the realm of possibility that if the offense struggles in a game with Wilson behind center, the Steelers could pivot in-game to use more of the Fields package and produce a spark. Without ever naming Fields QB1 or formally saying he\u2019s benching Wilson, Tomlin could simply say he felt that particular package was more effective on that day.\n\nThis situation is sure to evolve as the season continues. But nothing is off the table right now, and you can bet this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ve heard from Fields.\n\n(Photo of Russell Wilson, right, and Justin Fields: Kevin C. Cox / Getty Images)"

        "article_content": "The automation marketplace has changed vastly from what it was 30 years ago, but many trends persist and intensified during this time. The first is the increasing emphasis on software and services. Rapid advances in processing capability launched the decade of industrial, artificial intelligence (AI). Cloud computing, edge data processing, virtualization, containerization, Open Process Automation (OPA) and time-sensitive networks (TSN) have transformed the world of control systems. Suppliers continue to beef up their software capabilities, as we saw in 2022 with Emerson buying a majority stake in AspenTech, and Schneider Electric\u2019s acquisition of industrial software giant Aveva that closed in January 2023. ARC Advisory Group keeps reporting this in just about every Control/ARC Automation Top 50 article in recent memory, but software is the driving force behind today\u2019s market, and AI is now the tip of the spear. Suppliers know this, and will continue expanding and honing their software expertise and industrial AI solutions.\n\nGet your subscription to Control's tri-weekly newsletter.\n\nApproaching the Control/ARC Automation Top 50 global and North American automation suppliers is a unique exercise because we must keep one eye in the rearview mirror and the other on the road ahead. According to our standard methodology, ARC has a strict definition and scope of the automation marketplace that you can read about here. We examine supplier performance based on calendar-year revenues. ARC uses publicly available data in addition to information from our own database that we\u2019ve developed during more than 30 years of following the automation marketplace, the overall operations technology (OT) space, and the key end-user trends that drive them.\n\nHardware and services\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean hardware isn\u2019t important. The influx of commercial, IT-based solutions began in the automation marketplace more than 30 years ago, too, with the adoption of commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) operating systems and computing components. The industrial sector debated the benefits of Ethernet for years, until the dam finally burst, and just about every control network available today is based on Ethernet technologies with a few modifications. Today, this trend is accelerating faster than ever, with demand for industrial, edge-based systems and cloud-based automation architectures soaring. Computing requirements for industry will increase exponentially over the next decade, with AI again leading the way. Ethernet Advanced Physical Layer (APL) networking was also introduced in 2023, and will bring the benefits of Ethernet down to the device level and hazardous locations.\n\nAveva and AspenTech aren\u2019t the only recent software acquisitions, though they are substantial. In 2023 alone, ABB acquired a majority stake in Swedish AI startup Viking Analytics; Emerson acquired National Instruments (NI); PTC announced its acquisition of pure-systems; Belden acquired edge-software provider CloudRail; Rockwell Automation acquired OT cybersecurity provider Verve Industrial; and the list goes on. ARC expects more acquisitions as suppliers continue to strength their AI and cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the services business for all of these automation suppliers that continues to grow at the fastest rate. Almost universally, supplier service revenues are increasing faster than either their hardware or software businesses. Suppliers continue to differentiate themselves based on their deep understanding and engineering knowledge of specific industrial and customer requirements, and are striving to create lifelong partnerships with their clients where they provide a continuous stream of value-added lifecycle services. Many of these services are increasingly tailored to help users get more value out of their sustainability and digital transformation programs.\n\nSupplier performance in 2023\n\nOn a year-over-year (YoY) basis, consolidated supplier revenues grew by 8% worldwide and by more than 3% in North America during 2022. This continues the post-COVID-19 growth trend that we\u2019ve seen since 2021, when the market sharply rebounded from the pandemic. In typical fashion, the discrete manufacturing markets were the first to contract and the first to bounce back, while the process industries lagged slightly behind.\n\nIn typical fashion, the overall market leaders haven\u2019t changed significantly, though some smaller suppliers gained ground during 2023. It\u2019s worth noting that changes in relative position on this list don\u2019t necessarily indicate the strength or competence of any supplier, and could be due to other factors, the most obvious being merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. This list will give you an idea of who the market leaders are, but any evaluation of suppliers should obviously be more in-depth than their positions in the Control/ARC Top 50 rankings. With the rapid changes taking place in the automation market, it\u2019s also a good time to reevaluate supplier selection criteria.\n\nBig acquisitions fortify positions\n\nEmerson\u2019s acquisition of NI cemented its number-one position in North America with total revenues close to $8 billion. NI\u2019s consolidation into Emerson also removed it from the list, affecting the relative positions of other suppliers.\n\nThe same happened with Schneider Electric, which now wholly owns Aveva. It likewise cemented its number-four position worldwide, and moved up the list in North America to the number four position, placing it very close to ABB. In North America, Hexagon gained some ground to reach the eighth slot by acquiring several software suppliers concentrated in the digitalization, optimization and AI spaces.\n\nAutomation market hitting a wall?\n\nAfter robust growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, the global and North American automation markets remain strong, but they\u2019re also facing some serious headwinds and signs of softening in several sectors. We expect an overall slowdown in growth, but not a market contraction. Uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and mounting geopolitical conflicts and tensions also contribute to future market uncertainty.\n\nFor example, ARC\u2019s Automation Index declined in 2Q24, which was the first time since the post-pandemic recovery. The automation markets had experienced growth since 3Q20 (past 12 consecutive quarters). Demand for automation products continued to expand in the U.S. market, but at a slower pace. The YoY growth cycle started showing a decline since late 3Q23, and shows further decline through 1Q24. Many of the leading automation suppliers in North America have also increased prices to keep pace with rising production and distribution costs.\n\nMany of the key automation suppliers in North America are reporting strong backlogs, which they plan to work through in 2024. ARC is seeing a shift in growth from converting backlogs to new orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excess inventory. Supply-chain issues have also eased since our last report, and because of this, we\u2019re witnessing improved lead times.\n\nNew energy and decarbonization activities also remain strong, as we'll discuss later in this report. Aside from obvious investments in renewable energy, sustainability is also driving investments in automation for hydrogen infrastructure and its frequent counterpart, carbon capture and storage. Investment in plastics and other recycling technologies, such as wind turbine blade recycling, are increasing. Electrification, utilities, data centers and infrastructure (rail, port and marine) sectors are all experiencing strong growth.\n\nHowever, automotive growth remains weak as automotive manufacturers focus on near-term profitability amid a slowdown in demand for electric vehicles. In addition, semiconductor growth remains weak as manufacturers face several different challenges, including excess memory capacity and workforce shortages. Despite these signs of softening, our outlook remains positive for continued growth in both North America and worldwide through the end of 2024.\n\nHow AI is transforming industry\n\nAI has revolutionized the way we approach problem-solving and decision-making in various industries. Often described as prediction machines or inference engines, AI systems are designed to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions about future events or outcomes. This predictive capability is central to AI's value proposition, enabling businesses to anticipate trends, optimize processes, and make informed decisions. For instance, in the industrial sector, the most widely deployed AI use case involves predicting equipment failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.\n\nThe surge in investment in AI infrastructure is a testament to this technology's transformative potential. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have highlighted the rapid growth in AI investment since the breakthrough of Generative AI (Gen AI) with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5, with projections indicating a global spend nearing $200 billion by 2025.\n\nOver the longer-term, AI-related investment could peak as high as 2.5% to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. and 1.5 to 2.5% of GDP among other major AI leaders, if Goldman Sachs Research\u2019s AI growth projections are fully realized. This investment is driving down the cost of AI solutions, making them more accessible, and enabling broader adoption across industrial sectors. They\u2019re hungry to apply the technology to address growing skills gaps, control spiraling energy costs, and meet demand for more sustainable products and services with more resilient supply chains.\n\nAI and the data explosion\n\nThe industrial sector's challenges aren\u2019t just about volume, but also involve the complexity and fragmentation of data generated by sensors, machines and smart factories. This data is often disconnected and scattered across various applications, making it difficult to harness for insights and decision-making. Many end-users find it necessary to build a better framework for managing data when implementing new technologies like AI, and this is driving growth in industrial IoT platforms like Honeywell\u2019s Forge, Siemens\u2019 MindSphere, ABB\u2019s Ability, Rockwell Automation\u2019s FactoryTalk InnovationSuite, and Schneider Electric\u2019s EcoStruxure. Other suppliers like Yokogawa are implementing their own industrial AI platforms that allow connections between operational assets and the enterprise.\n\nEach industrial AI use case requires specific datasets, and may necessitate different tools and techniques. For instance, predictive maintenance relies on sensor data to forecast equipment failures, while generative design uses parameters like materials and cost constraints to create product designs.\n\nSustainability drives digital transformation\n\nThe real question is how all this technology is applied and what its business case is. Energy transition and sustainability are being woven into the core business strategies of most of the world\u2019s largest industrial companies, which now have a mandate and opportunity to not only to tackle environmental and social challenges, but also take advantage of the commercial opportunities and competitive advantages that sustainability offers.\n\nFor several years, sustainability issues were approached as something to be dealt with cautiously in reaction to increasingly stringent regulations. However, massive commercial opportunities have emerged beyond just regulatory compliance. Many companies are discovering that ramping up digital transformation initiatives can help reach their sustainability goals. Sustainability can provide business value across several dimensions, including increased energy efficiency, new processes for carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen production and transportation.\n\nSpending on sustainability increases\n\nFor instance, Bank of America (BoA) reports that, prior to COVID-19, the U.S. spent about 0.4% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy, while Germany spent 0.5% or more, and the EU\u2019s other member nations spent more traditionally. Today, the U.S. spends 0.8% of GDP on sustainability-related industrial policy thanks to passing its $1.8 trillion stimulus package. The most recent stimulus is structured quite differently from what the U.S. did before. It doesn't peak until 2026, and will run until 2031. The stimulus was designed so that many projects are in \u201cred states,\u201d and $2.4 trillion is needed to meet net-zero emission targets laid out for the U.S. over the next five years, according to BoA\u2019s research.\n\nMost companies are enhancing energy efficiency and switching to clean-energy sources. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) facilities have also been growing significantly. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, Section 45 Q tax credits for capturing carbon have increased to $85 per ton, and most companies can do this at a much lower cost. This makes CCUS extremely profitable, which is why we see so much activity in it, including ExxonMobil\u2019s acquisition of Denbury, Occidental\u2019s acquisition of Carbon Engineering and others.\n\nEdge computing push intensifies\n\nIndustrial, edge-computing solutions can overcome limitations such as latency, reliability and security by extending the cloud into OT environments, while also reducing cloud-input data volumes and egress costs. Data at the edge of networks can be aggregated and contextualized to deliver summary information and insights directly to the cloud, ultimately reducing cloud-based, data-storage costs. Edge functionality has likewise expanded digital transformation\u2019s reach into remote, hazardous and other distributed environments, simultaneously addressing potential lacks of reliable network connections and skilled IT personnel in the field.\n\nCustomers and suppliers alike are aligning their edge strategies to take advantage of the cloud\u2019s centralized management, security and scaling capabilities, while preserving operational integrity by marrying these with onsite, edge capabilities. The descent of cloud-native, containerized architectures to the edge is simplifying deployment and management of edge applications, a key edge value driver, by providing a lightweight and portable way to package software and its dependencies. Industrial data can be pre-processed at the edge, sent to the cloud for analytics or model training, and then redeployed at the edge in lightweight software containers.\n\nIndustrial automation and cloud-native architectures are coming together, while industrial automation itself is increasingly software-defined. The data sought by edge and cloud-based solutions resides in the logic, process and motion controllers sold by traditional automation suppliers, which are typically large players with deep domain knowledge that closely integrate their edge offerings with their higher-level, software-based solutions.\n\nThese products typically focus on domain-specific use cases that relate to their core automation competencies. Early offerings look to apply analytics to monitoring and maintenance applications focused on reduced downtime and asset utilization objectives. Automation suppliers are also taking advantage of existing edge technology and ecosystems, and partnering with and/or investing in complementary infrastructures, open-source and multiple cloud providers."
