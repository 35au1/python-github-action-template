The UFO \u2015 which the U.S. government now called UAPs, or unidentified aerial phenomena \u2015 had no engine and no thermal signature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\u201d\n\nBarber said it was later confirmed to him that the object was from a \u201cnonhuman intelligence,\u201d but doesn\u2019t know what it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he also picked up what he called an \u201ceightgon,\u201d which he described as \u201ca flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections.\u201d Barber described feeling \u201codd\u201d and growing more emotional as he got closer to the \u201ceightgon\u201d object.\n\n\u201cI felt like something connected with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.\u201d\n\nNewsNation also said it independently obtained footage of an egg-shaped object being moved by helicopter:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile few details can be seen, the object isn\u2019t dissimilar to some of those seen in flight in prior videos from other whistleblowers, footage later confirmed by the Pentagon as authentic.\n\nOne, called the \u201cTic Tac\u201d because of its similarity to the mint candies, shows a white object with no visible wings or engines moving rapidly through the sky as pilots react in awe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been no clear answer as to what the objects are, but some observers have noted that there are more down-to-earth explanations for them, such as drones or balloons, in some cases of potentially foreign origin and with advanced \u2015 but not alien \u2015 technology."

            "article_content": "It will be a close encounter of the informative and entertaining kind when a local paranormal investigator shares his experiences at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library in Gardner.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, who starred on the \"Expedition Bigfoot\" series on the Discovery Channel for several season and appears regularly on \"Paranormal Caught on Camera\" the Travel Channel, will discuss the phenomena of unidentified flying objects in New England at the library on Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLeBlanc, who lives in Leominster and is the author of two \"Monsterland\" books, said he had been unaware that Central Massachusetts had been such a hotbed of UFO activity until he began doing research for his first book.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, a renowned Leominster-based paranormal investigator, will discuss \"UFOs in New England\" at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

            "article_content": "An extraordinary video supposedly showed a crashed alien craft being recovered by a US Air Force helicopter has been released by a whistleblower.\n\nThe clip, which leading UAP pundit Ross Coulthart claims was secretly recorded by a member of the Pentagon\u2019s secret UFO crash retrieval team, shows a 20-foot \u201cegg-shaped\u201d object suspended in a sling, apparently beneath a helicopter.\n\nThe footage chimes with a description given to Coulthart by former US Air Force mechanic Jacob Barber, who claims to have taken part in the retrieval of a similar craft. Barber says that he left the Air Force shortly after September 11, 2001, and established a \u201ccover\u201d identity as a civilian contractor.\n\nBarber told Coulthart: \u201cA lot of the work we did was on what I call \u2018The Range,\u2019 where the US government and its private partners used to test all kinds of things \u2014 weapon systems and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft \u2014 and so you see a lot of exciting things.\u201d\n\nBut, although he witnessed tests of numerous advanced military aircraft prototypes, nothing could prepare him for his encounter with an anomalous craft that seemed to have no wings, windows, or propulsion system. \u201cJust visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was not human,\u201d he said.\n\nBarber says he was tasked with the retrieval of this strange object, and deployed a sling from his helicopter on the end of a 150-foot \u201clong line\u201d to carry it. His description of what he recovered that day sounds like no known type of aircraft.\n\n\u201cI saw an egg, a white egg,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no engine. There was no thermal signature. I was operating at night when I finally came in to pick it up. So, I\u2019m working under night vision goggles at the time, and it was quite clear. I flipped them up, flipped them down and looked at it a couple of different ways.\u201d\n\nImage: Sky News Australia) Sky News Australia)\n\nFollowing his experience, Barber says that it was confirmed to him by his superiors that the mysterious white \u201cegg\u201d was a craft built by \u201cNHI,\u201d (nonhuman intelligence). He went on to encounter several other apparently alien craft during his service with the USAF.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThere was another object. One was the egg, the other is what I called an \u2018eightgon.\u2019 The eightgon was essentially a flying disc with what looked like eight delineated sections when looking down.\u201d\n\nHe says that he only ever saw the object from above, because his task was solely to pick them up from \u2018The Range\u2019 and deliver them top a secret USAF research facility. He has no concrete information on what the USAF was doing with these objects, but describes seeing \u201ctrans-medium\u201d craft that appeared to be able to fly through the air but also to pass through solid matter.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nBarber went on to say that some USAF personnel had been trained in a form of telepathy that enabled them to control these aircraft. \u201cIn the program, there was certainly a desire to explore the idea that perhaps UAP could be summoned, could be communicated with, could be controlled and could be persuaded to land, all by deploying people with psionic abilities to interface and communicate with the UAP,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThese \u201cpsionic\u201d phenomena around the UFOs affected Barber directly. On one occasion, he says, he had a quasi-religious experience while en route to pick up another one of the strange craft: \u201cI felt like something connected with me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. It was so overwhelming that I began to cry.\u201d\n\nImage: AP) AP)\n\nHe adds that he began to fear for his life after seeing just how far Pentagon officials would go to maintain the cover-up of their contact with extraterrestrials. Asa result, he says, he has met with US senator Marco Rubio \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s incoming secretary of state \u2013 to share what he knows in hope of getting some protection.\n\nThe footage itself, shown by Coulthart in a News Nation special over the weekend, has divided viewers. Some suggested that the \u201cegg-shaped object\u201d was simply an egg, and that the entire clip was an elaborate hoax.\n\nWith Donald Trump promising to lift the lid on other long-running conspiracy theories, such as the truth about the 1963 Kennedy assassination, the truth about Barber\u2019s experiences could very soon be revealed."

            "article_content": "The general hype around all things AI is not lifting all boats: certain startups continue to struggle and are looking for exits. In one of the latest developments, TechCrunch has heard from a reliable source that Metropolis, an AI-powered parking platform, is buying Oosto, the controversial computer vision company that used to be known as AnyVision. The source tells TechCrunch that the deal is valued at $125 million \u2014 just one-third of the $380 million that the startup had raised from investors over the years \u2014 and likely a fraction of its peak valuation.\n\nMetropolis buying Oosto for $125 million are details that are also being reported in Israeli press. Last week, Globes broke the news that Oosto was up for sale. We understand that the two companies had already been working together prior to this deal, and that a large part of the transaction involves shares. We have reached out to both Metropolis and Oosto for further information and will update this post as we learn more.\n\nIf it completes, the sale will cap off a turbulent several years for Oosto.\n\nAs AnyVision, the company was one of a wave of computer vision startups building technology being used in controversial surveillance applications. Over the years, there were reports exposing which organizations were quietly using its technology and how the Israeli government tapped it to spy on Palestinians; other reports shed light on just how much data the company was able to collect. The bad publicity led to the company losing Microsoft as a key strategic investor, although other investors were ready to double down. In 2021, AnyVision, pitching itself as an ethical AI company, raised a whopping $235 million led by SoftBank and Eldridge. Other backers of the company have included Lightspeed and Qualcomm, per PitchBook data.\n\nJust months after the big SoftBank raise, AnyVision rebranded to Oosto and looked to pivot to more enterprise applications as it inked a research partnership with Carnegie Mellon. But it seems that the difficulties continued, with rounds of layoffs and Oosto parting ways with the university. Today\u2019s report in Calcalist noted that it was not making more than $10 million in annual revenues.\n\nIt\u2019s worth wondering whether some of Oosto\u2019s problems might have been a question of timing. The last couple of years have seen big geopolitical shifts; AI entering the mainstream of public consciousness; and a new wave of AI companies like Anduril and Helsing that seem to be breaking through many taboos on building military, defense and (more euphemistically) \u201cresilience\u201d technology.\n\nWould AnyVision (or Oosto) have appeared as controversial today as it did five years ago? Regardless, the rise and fall of Oosto can be seen as a memento mori for the newer wave of AI companies that are being funded today on very high hopes, but perhaps not very high revenues (let alone profits).\n\nThat brings us to Metropolis. It, too, is focused on computer vision, but focus is perhaps the operative word here: its square aim is to build AI-based systems for parking, automatically tracking cars when they enter or leave a space and charging accordingly. In 2023, Metropolis raised $1.7 billion in financing and other investment, most of which was used to make a $1.5 acquisition of another parking technology specialist called SP Plus. Whether it will be using Oosto to continue building out that business, or to extend into a wider range of mobility and other applications, remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cTech-wise this acquisition makes the perfect sense,\u201d Avihai Michaeli, an investment banking advisor based in Tel Aviv, told TechCrunch. \u201cBoth Metropolis and Oosto (formerly known as AnyVision Tech) are key players in the AI-driven computer vision and security solutions space, with applications that enhance urban management, public safety, and automation. Both companies focus on leveraging cutting-edge technology to create safer, smarter, and more efficient environments through artificial intelligence and data analytics.\u201d He added that the current war in Israel right now has made it challenging for some Israeli companies looking to raise money or do other business, which could have also played a role here."

The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

(WVVA) - The Campbell-Flannagan-Murrell House was built in the late 1800s, serving as a home for generations of a Hinton family, as well as as a general store for a time.\n\nNow, it stands as a museum, and a part of Summers County history. On Jan. 18, the museum partnered with Appalachian Ghosts Tours to offer a unique experience of history, culture, and potentially paranormal spirits with guided tours and an investigation.\n\nAttempting to encounter spirits can require some technology, and as the Executive Director of Appalachian Ghost Tours, Mark Covey, explained, special equipment as well as ordinary objects can get the job done.\n\n\u201cWe have EMF meters that will go off if, like, an electric spike gets near you. We have REM pods that basically do the same thing, but they stay in a stationary area and they will make a lot of noise,\u201d said Covey. \u201cWe have cat balls that, you know, you wouldn\u2019t think would be anything, but they will just be sitting in there on something solid and they will start to light up.\u201d\n\nAlthough the house is simply a museum by day, even those familiar with the home have experienced unexplained happenings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve been in this house by myself and heard footsteps and nobody\u2019s been in the house, so yeah, I think that there\u2019s something going on, but I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s malicious in any way,\u201d said Carol Jackson, President of the Board of Trustees over the Campbell-Flannagan-Murrell House Museum.\n\nThis event is part of an ongoing effort for more paranormal tourism in Appalachia, bringing attention to smaller communities that are rich with folklore and paranormal history.\n\n\u201cSouthern West Virginia is absolutely overflowing with the haunted stories, the paranormal, there is an energy here like no other and there is a history here like no other,\u201d explained Pamela Huff, a member of Appalachian Ghost Tours.\n\nFor more information on the museum, you can view their website or Facebook page, and to keep up to date with Appalachian Ghost Tours, click here.\n\nCopyright 2025 WVVA.

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking discovery that sounds like science fiction but is absolutely real, researchers have found that your eyes contain hidden signals that could predict your risk of having a stroke. This revolutionary finding isn\u2019t just another medical study, it\u2019s a potential game-changer in how we approach stroke prevention and early detection.\n\nThe incredible science behind retinal fingerprints\n\nScientists have identified 29 unique vascular indicators in your retina that serve as warning signs for stroke risk. These tiny blood vessels in your eyes create patterns as unique as your fingerprints, and their condition can reveal crucial information about your overall health. Within these indicators, 17 are density-related markers that can increase your stroke risk by up to 19% when altered. These changes are like tiny red flags waving in your eyes, signaling potential danger before other symptoms appear. The remaining indicators focus on the size and twistedness of blood vessels, with changes potentially raising stroke risk by nearly 20%. Think of these vessels as tiny roads in your eyes, their condition reflecting the health of your entire cardiovascular system.\n\nWhy this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing\n\nTraditional stroke risk assessments often involve invasive procedures and expensive tests. But this new method requires nothing more than a specialized photograph of your eye. The implications are enormous, especially for communities where access to advanced medical testing is limited or cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe beauty of this breakthrough lies in its simplicity. During a routine eye exam, doctors can capture detailed images of your retina and analyze them for these crucial indicators. It\u2019s painless, quick, and could potentially save countless lives through early detection.\n\nThe fascinating connection between your eyes and brain\n\nYour retina isn\u2019t just a window to your soul, it\u2019s actually an extension of your brain. Every tiny blood vessel in your eye tells a story about the health of your brain\u2019s blood vessels. This connection explains why changes in your retinal vasculature can predict stroke risk with remarkable accuracy.\n\nWhat makes this discovery revolutionary\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 45,000 participants. This massive study revealed that retinal analysis combined with basic demographic information could predict stroke risk as accurately as traditional methods.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly remarkable is how this technology could transform preventive healthcare. Imagine walking into your local eye clinic and getting a comprehensive stroke risk assessment during your regular eye exam. This isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s revolutionary for global health care accessibility.\n\nThe global impact of this breakthrough\n\nThis discovery could dramatically change how we approach stroke prevention worldwide. In regions where advanced medical facilities are scarce, a simple eye scan could become a lifesaving tool. The technology could help identify at-risk individuals years before they might experience a stroke, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.\n\nHealthcare providers are particularly excited about implementing this technology in primary care settings. It could become as routine as checking blood pressure, but with the potential to reveal much more detailed information about cardiovascular health.\n\nWhat this means for the future of healthcare\n\nThe implications extend far beyond stroke prediction. Researchers believe similar retinal analysis could help predict other conditions like heart disease and dementia. This opens up endless possibilities for early detection and prevention of various diseases through simple eye examinations.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, we might see artificial intelligence systems analyzing these retinal images in real-time, providing instant risk assessments and recommendations. This could revolutionize how we approach preventive healthcare, making it more accessible and effective than ever before.\n\nThe discovery of retinal vascular fingerprints as predictors of stroke risk isn\u2019t just a scientific breakthrough, it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of medicine. It shows us that sometimes the most powerful diagnostic tools are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be understood and utilized. As this technology develops and becomes more widely available, it could transform how we approach disease prevention and ultimately save countless lives through early detection and intervention."

Recent discoveries have revealed ancient crust hidden deep within the mantle. This \"sunken world\" challenges our understanding of the planet's dynamic processes. What lies beneath could redefine geological history.\n\nNew Method Unveils Hidden Mantle Anomalies\n\nScientists have identified unexpected sections of Earth's crust deep inside the mantle. Using advanced seismographic imaging, researchers mapped these anomalies in unprecedented detail. The study, published in Scientific Reports, highlights unknown structures under areas with no tectonic activity.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nOne key discovery was beneath Easter Island, where sunken crust sections were detected. Researchers believe these anomalies could be remnants of the mantle's creation. Alternatively, they might contain dense material formed over millions of years.\n\nRead More: 'Moon at risk of huge damage': Earth's natural satellite added to endangered heritage list; here's why\n\nDoctoral candidate Thomas Schouten from ETH Zurich said, \"With the high-resolution model, we see anomalies everywhere. But their true nature is still unclear.\"\n\nRevolutionary Techniques Offer Clearer Insight\n\nUnlike traditional methods using isolated earthquake data, this research combines global seismographs into a cohesive model. Full-waveform inversion, the technique used, required the Piz Daint supercomputer in Switzerland to process vast datasets.\n\nCo-author Thue Fichtner likened the discovery to medical imaging breakthroughs. \"It\u2019s like finding a new artery in an unexpected location,\" Fichtner said.\n\nDespite similarities to known subducted slabs, the anomalies raise new questions. Further research will delve into their composition and origins. Scientists hope these findings will unlock deeper insights into Earth\u2019s evolving structure."

            "article_content": "Precision medicine has gone far beyond a buzzy phrase and is now a reality in the treatment of certain diseases including cancer and a range of other chronic diseases. Personalising treatment through genetic profiling and data analysis, where treatments are tailored to an individual, should achieve the best possible outcomes for patients. However, this requires the fusion of many technologies and skill sets. RCSI\u2019s state-of-the-art Masters programme in Technologies and Analytics in Precision Medicine (MScTAPM) aims to address this skills gap and produce the biological data scientists that the pharmaceutical industry say are vital if precision medicine is to become the norm.\n\nLeading RCSI's master's degree programme is Dr Sudipto Das, the programme director, deputy dean of AI, Digital and Connected Health and senior lecturer in the school of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences\n\nThe full time Masters course fuses the latest in genetic and genomics research with data analytics and computational biology, including programming, to give graduates the ability to analyse and interpret healthcare data. Graduates will also learn the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning on drug discovery and the broader healthcare sector, as well as how to employ these tools and techniques to identify patterns in biological data sets. \u201cThese patterns will help us diagnose patients earlier, predict treatment response and tailor therapy accordingly,\u201d says Dr Sudipto Das, programme director, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences (PBS) at RCSI.\n\nThese critical skill sets are in high demand across an industry that is undergoing an evolution. The significant growth in the programme is in direct response to the demand for these skills, Das says.\n\nAccording to Das, the sheer magnitude of this growth area cannot be understated as the health sector finally begins to utilise the breadth of data that is available. The market size for precision medicine was $102.17 billion (\u20ac99.40 billion) in 2024 but it is already projected that this will grow to $119 billion (\u20ac116 billion) in 2025.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nWith this exponential growth comes a deficit in the core skill sets that are required to make precision medicine a reality. The biological data scientists are the individuals who will analyse and interpret healthcare data to ultimately fill that gap between biological data collection and actual clinical decision-making, Das explains.\n\nDublin city centre campus of RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences\n\n\u201cThe question asked nowadays on precision medicine is, \u2018will this drug work in person A or person B?\u2019 If you can identify this, then you can save the person unnecessary treatment and potential side effects, as well as costs to patients and the wider healthcare system,\u201d he says. \u201cSome patients will respond, others won\u2019t and some might even develop adverse drug reactions. The reason for this disparity in response comes from the fact that everybody is unique.\u201d\n\nThis makes clinical decision-making significantly more difficult but ultimately will lead to a better outcome, Das points out. \u201cThe gap must be filled by someone who understands the data, can analyse it and interpret it and effectively predict why they think \u2018drug x\u2019 may not work on a particular patient. This is the role of the biological data scientist and the master\u2019s programme is aiming to give participants the skills to do exactly that.\u201d\n\nThese newly-emerging experts will be pivotal in driving innovation in the coming years, says Das. \u201cThey will be identifying new ways of stratifying patients to tailored therapies and identifying biomarkers to determine response before we even commence treatment.\u201d He also notes that course participants will learn to handle a wide variety of data types, not just that coming from biological samples, but also data from wearables and gadgets. \u201cDigital and connected health is now huge. These biological data scientists will be sitting at the intersection of biology, computer sciences and statistics and playing a pivotal role.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a diverse range of graduates have entered the programme since its inception \u2013 from biology and science graduates to experts in computer science and data analysis.\n\nA group of students graduate from the Masters Programme in Technologies and Analytics in Precision Medicine at RCSI\n\n\u201cThe computer science graduates know how to analyse data and do the number crunching that is required but they don\u2019t understand the biology so they come with their skill sets of coding and data analytics, but they then learn about the biological significance of this data and how to interpret it accordingly,\u201d Das explains. \u201cSimilarly, the biological science graduates understand the health aspects but need to learn coding and data analysis. It is a pivotal programme in this sense, allowing post graduates to take their skill set and combine it with another for a high demand career.\u201d\n\nHe adds that this role also carries a huge amount of purpose \u2013 analysing data with the end goal of improving patient outcomes and saving lives. \u201cThere is a huge translational aspect to this programme, in that we are putting the patient at the centre and that aligns with RCSI\u2019s own ethos as a patient-centric health sciences university,\u201d he explains.\n\nThe footprint of the pharma industry in Ireland continues to grow at a blistering pace with new biotech start-ups emerging, and long-established multinational pharma companies expanding their presence and investing heavily in their Irish sites. Das says graduates are already in high demand in an industry that is undergoing a significant shift in terms of innovation and drug discovery. \u201cThis is a future-focused programme in that the graduates will emerge ready to deal with these changes that are rapidly emerging in the healthcare landscape.\u201d\n\nRichard Kennedy global vice president and medical director of Almac Diagnostic Services\n\n\u201cPrecision medicine and data analysis is the future of the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d states Kennedy unequivocally.\n\nRichard Kennedy is global vice-president and medical director of Almac Diagnostic Services, which is headquartered in Northern Ireland and has laboratory facilities across Europe, North America and partnership labs in APAC. He explains that he and his colleagues at Almac have worked closely with RCSI on the development of the MSc, helping to guide the topic selection for the curriculum and ensure it is \u201chighly relevant\u201d to industry. The organisation also offers industry project opportunities for the MScTAPM students.\n\n\u201cPrecision medicine and data analysis is the future of the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d states Kennedy unequivocally. \u201cIt\u2019s also increasingly important from an economics point of view that we give the right treatments to the people who will respond best to them. This means people coming out of university now need to be able to analyse patient data, including biomarker test results, and apply artificial intelligence techniques that can better guide treatments. This will be huge in the next decade, so knowledge of it will be crucial.\u201d\n\nPeople with this specific skill set are currently in short supply across healthcare, adds Kennedy. \u201cWithin the industry at the moment there is definitely an unmet need for people who can understand and analyse these data as they pertain to health.\u201d\n\nAn in-person open day for the MScTAPM programme will be held at RCSI, St Stephen\u2019s Green, on February 1st, 2025.

            "article_content": "WhatsApp, with its billions of users worldwide, has become a major target for scammers seeking to exploit its popularity. Understanding the various types of scams and learning how to avoid them is essential to protect yourself and your personal information.\n\nHow to Stay Safe on WhatsApp\n\nTo protect yourself from WhatsApp scams, it\u2019s crucial to adopt a healthy level of skepticism. Be cautious when interacting with unknown contacts, especially if they are requesting money or personal information. Avoid clicking on unsolicited links, scanning random QR codes, or downloading suspicious files. Always verify the identity of anyone who contacts you unexpectedly, and enable two-step verification on your WhatsApp account for extra security.\n\nThis article will explore some of the most common WhatsApp scams and provide tips on how to stay safe from these fraudulent schemes.\n\n1. Fake Donation Schemes\n\nIn this scam, fraudsters pose as charitable organizations or individuals in need of donations for personal or community causes. Once you send the money, the \u201ccharity\u201d disappears, and the scammer pockets the funds.\n\nAlways verify the legitimacy of charitable organizations before making donations. Reputable charities don\u2019t rely on random messages through WhatsApp to solicit donations. If you\u2019re inclined to donate, go through official websites or established fundraising platforms.\n\n2. Two-Step Verification Scams\n\nSome scammers may message you, claiming they mistakenly sent their two-step verification code to your phone number and ask you to forward it to them. This is an attempt to hijack your WhatsApp account by tricking you into providing the code they need to gain access.\n\nIf you receive such a message, do not share the verification code. Instead, secure your account by enabling two-step verification within WhatsApp settings and regularly updating your PIN. This adds an extra layer of protection to your account, making it harder for scammers to take control.\n\n3. Romance/Catfishing and Prostitution Scams\n\nSome scammers take advantage of people looking for relationships by pretending to be interested in romance. Over time, they build trust before inventing a crisis and asking for financial help. Similarly, you may be approached by someone offering illicit services, which is often just a way to get you to click on phishing or malware links.\n\nTo avoid falling for romance scams, be skeptical of people you meet online, especially if they avoid meeting in person or making video calls. Check their social media presence, and use tools like reverse image search to verify their photos. If someone asks for money early in the relationship, it\u2019s likely a scam.\n\n4. Fake Family or Friend Emergency\n\nIn this scam, someone poses as a friend or family member, claiming to be messaging from a new phone number due to an emergency. The scammer engages in conversation before eventually asking for money or personal information. These tactics often exploit the urgency of the situation to trick people into acting without verifying the identity of the sender.\n\nTo prevent falling for this scam, ask the individual for specific details that only the real person would know, such as their old phone number or personal details not readily available online. If the person cannot provide this information, it\u2019s likely a scam. Always double-check before sending any money or sharing sensitive information, and contact the real person through other methods if you have doubts.\n\n5. Free Gift Cards or Vouchers\n\nA common scam that continues to circulate on WhatsApp involves messages claiming that you\u2019ve won a free gift card or voucher, often from major retailers. These messages usually contain links that direct you to phishing sites or download malware onto your device.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid this scam is to remember that reputable companies do not give out free gift cards or vouchers through random messages. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always verify the legitimacy of any offer by visiting the company\u2019s official website directly rather than clicking on any suspicious links.\n\n6. Fake Tech Support or Account Verification\n\nIn this scam, someone pretends to be from WhatsApp or another tech company, asking you to verify your account details or provide sensitive information. They might direct you to a phishing website or attempt to hijack your account.\n\nTo avoid this, remember that WhatsApp will never contact you directly through the app to ask for verification details. If you need to verify your account, this process will typically happen through a phone call or SMS. Never provide personal information or passwords through in-app messages.\n\n7. WhatsApp Gold Scam\n\nOne of the oldest WhatsApp scams is the \u201cWhatsApp Gold\u201d hoax, where users receive an unsolicited message offering a supposed upgraded version of WhatsApp with exclusive features. The message includes a link to download this non-existent app, which often leads to phishing attempts or malware downloads.\n\nTo avoid falling victim to this scam, always be skeptical of unsolicited messages offering upgrades or special versions of apps. Official app updates come directly from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, so ensure that any downloads are from these legitimate sources. If the message contains a URL that doesn\u2019t look like it comes from an official app store or WhatsApp website, it\u2019s best to avoid it altogether.\n\n8. Fake Lotteries and Giveaways\n\nAnother scam involves messages claiming you\u2019ve won a lottery or giveaway. To claim the prize, you\u2019re instructed to click on a link or provide personal information. These scams usually result in phishing attacks or malware.\n\nLegitimate companies do not notify winners of contests or lotteries via WhatsApp. If you receive such a message, do not engage with it. Instead, research the company or promotion to verify whether it\u2019s real before taking any action.\n\n9. Cryptocurrency and Investment Scams\n\nWith the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, scammers often prey on people\u2019s desire to invest and make quick profits. Scammers might message you, promising large returns for a small investment or offering secret investment tips in exchange for money.\n\nBefore making any investments, always do thorough research.

            "article_content": "Claudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall. The six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d She and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said. They're not alone. Surging auto insurance premiums, driven by the rising cost of claims and other factors, have led to a record number of consumers shopping for cheaper policies, experts said. Analytics company LexisNexis Risk Solutions ranked New York third among the states with the largest annual increases in shopping growth in the third quarter of 2024, reporting a 58% jump. The most expensive auto insurance in 2024 in Nassau County \u2014 and on Long Island \u2014 was in an Inwood ZIP code, 11096, where the average annual premium was $4,464 last year, 52% higher than a year earlier, according to The Zebra, an insurance comparison company. The second-highest premium was in a Valley Stream ZIP code, 11581, where the 2024 average was $4,436, a 53% hike from the 2023 price. Nassau County's average insurance rates are higher than Suffolk County's, partly due to Nassau's higher wages and its proximity to heavily congested New York City, which has the state's highest premiums. (The most expensive car insurance in the state last year was in a Brooklyn ZIP code, 11212, which had an annual average premium of $7,799, according to The Zebra.) But Suffolk car owners are still feeling the pinch. The highest auto insurance rate in Suffolk County was in a Brentwood ZIP code, 11717, where the average annual premium in 2024 reached $3,653 \u2014 a 43% increase compared with 2023, according to The Zebra. A Central Islip ZIP code, 11722, ranked second with a $3,640 average premium in 2024 \u2014 also a 43% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, last year, the statewide average rose 50% to $2,526 and the national average increased 19% to $2,189, according to The Zebra\u2019s \u201c2025 Auto Insurance Trends Report.\u201d The rising costs are leading some car owners to make difficult decisions, experts said. An increasing number of motorists are going uninsured, said David Seider, chief commercial officer at The Zebra, which is based in Austin, Texas. \"The trend is totally understandable, as Americans have grappled with how to manage basic household spending amidst rapidly inflating costs on everything from groceries to rent,\" Seider said in an email. Driving without car insurance is illegal in New York and almost every other state, and can come with stiff penalties, including driver's license suspensions, steep fines and even jail time. Car insurance prices are rising for several reasons, including an increase in the number of car accidents and their severity, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a Malvern, Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that represents the insurance industry. The number of drivers on the road has returned to the levels that existed before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the driving behavior that led to the high losses has not improved, institute spokeswoman Loretta L. Worters said in an email. \"More accidents \u2014 a lot caused by distracted driving, texting while driving, etc. \u2014 with severe injuries and fatalities have driven up claims and losses in terms of both vehicle damage and liability, while attracting greater attorney involvement and legal system abuse,\u201d she said. Also, cars are being built with more advanced technology, which saves lives but also makes repairs more costly, she said. Wildfires, flooding and other weather disasters also are a factor in insurers raising rates to account for financial losses, according to The Zebra report, which cited the 24 separate billion-dollar weather events last year in the United States, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton on the East Coast. While the rising costs of parts and labor to repair cars contribute to higher insurance premiums, a bigger factor is the greed of insurance companies whose rate hikes have exceeded the nation\u2019s overall rate of inflation, argued Michael DeLong, a research and advocacy associate at the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. \u201cAnd most of the [states\u2019] insurance regulators are letting them get away with it,\u201d he said. Insurers seeking to raise premiums in the state must get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, but there are exceptions. The state has a \u201cflex rating\u201d law that allows insurers to raise premiums by an average of less than 5% in a 12-month period without seeking department approval. \u201cAll auto rates, whether prior approval or flex rating, must be actuarially justified and cannot be excessive, inadequate, destructive of competition, or detrimental to the solvency of insurers,\u201d according to the agency, which said that it reviews applications individually. Insurance companies consider several factors when calculating auto premiums, including consumers\u2019 driving records, education, occupations, credit scores, ages and genders. They also consider ZIP codes, which take into account the prevalence of auto insurance fraud, costs of medical care and weather in the area. New York, California, Georgia, Hawaii and Massachusetts have banned insurance companies from considering consumers\u2019 education and occupations when setting auto policy rates, DeLong said. While the price of auto insurance is surging in New York, the number of insured vehicles is declining. Registration suspensions for uninsured vehicles increased by 25,959, or 7%, to 406,051 statewide between 2022 and 2024, according to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. The number of tickets that police wrote to drivers operating uninsured vehicles in the state grew by 5,711, or 9%, to 70,733 between 2022 and 2023, according to the DMV. The 2024 ticket data is not available yet, but the number is expected to be a few thousand higher than the amount in 2023, the agency said. The DMV cannot definitively attribute the increase in registration suspensions and tickets for uninsured vehicles to the rising costs of auto insurance, according to the agency. The rate of uninsured driving is increasing in some states by as much as 30%, according to an email from Shannon Martin, insurance analyst at Bankrate, a Manhattan-based consumer financial services company. But driving without insurance is a risk that should be avoided, she said. \u201cAllowing car insurance to lapse due to non-payment can trigger a range of issues, including state fines and higher insurance rates when the policy is reissued,\u201d Martin said. Not only does driving uninsured put car owners at grave risk of having to pay for damages or injuries they cause, but the practice also helps drive up insurance costs for motorists who do have coverage, DeLong said. Instead of dropping insurance, drivers should discuss with their insurers removing unnecessary coverage, or consider switching to a usage-based insurance policy, Martin said. Stony Brook resident Lee Chaconas, 67, was able to apply discounts to her Geico policy for her 2019 Honda Accord, she said. A retired Geico personal-injury claims adjuster, Chaconas pays $789 for a six-month premium, with a 10% discount because she is a member of the insurer\u2019s credit union and an additional 10% discount for taking a defensive driving course every three years, she said. But with her premium increasing $20 to $30 annually, \u201cwhich adds up,\u201d she doesn\u2019t plan to ever buy another car if she can help it. \u201cThey\u2019re going to bury me in that car,\u201d she said. Insurance companies experienced big profit losses in 2022, as steep inflation drove up the costs of repairs, labor and used cars. They have raised rates in the past few years to try to offset those losses. \u201cInsurance companies now are running to the bank with record profits,\" said Aaron J. Stein, president of Norton & Siegel Inc., an insurance agency in Babylon. \"They\u2019re trying to make up for the years they lost, but at some point \u2026 this is a problem.\u201d Geico\u2019s underwriting profit in the third quarter of 2024 was $2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. In the third quarter of 2024, Progressive\u2019s revenue grew 25% to $19.5 billion compared with the same period a year earlier. The company had 33.9 million active insurance policies, a 14% increase from the same period in 2023. In New York state, Geico, State Farm, Allstate and Progressive accounted for 70.87% of the market share for auto insurers in 2023, according to a report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Among the insurers with more than $100 million in written premiums in the state, State Farm had the biggest auto insurance rate increase for renewing customers last year, an average of 24.9%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a Manhattan-based financial analysis provider. State Farm, New York's second-largest auto insurer, said it has experienced unprecedented growth in its car insurance business in the state. \u201cWhile it is a privilege to be chosen by so many New York drivers, it is important that our rates are adequate to support the business and that we\u2019re able to match price to risk,\u201d Justin Tomczak, a spokesman for the Bloomington, Illinois-based company, said in an email. During the pandemic in 2020, State Farm enacted a double-digit rate cut in its auto policies in New York state, he said. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Co. had the second-largest car insurance rate increase in New York last year, averaging 18.7%, according to S&P. The insurer did not respond to requests for comment. Progressive, which averaged increases of 19.7% in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024, also did not respond. Geico is New York State's largest auto insurer, holding 28.37% of the market share in 2023, according to NAIC. Geico had an average New York car insurance rate hike of 7% in March 2024 and a 10% increase in August 2023, according to S&P. Newsday asked Geico about the premiums it charges in the state and why it has increased them. The Chevy Chase, Maryland-based company forwarded the inquiry to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, which responded by email: \u201cAcross the country, auto insurance premiums have been on the rise for the simple reason that the cost of things that auto insurance pays for has been rising,\" Kristina Baldwin, vice president in state government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based association, said in an email. \"The cost of medical care for accident victims continues to increase as well as the cost of the parts and labor to repair vehicles.\u201d She also cited riskier behavior, including distracted and impaired driving, as factors that are increasing injury and collision claim costs and compounding the effects of inflation. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of car crashes in the state fell 18% to 418,687, but fatal crashes rose 16% to 1,022, according to the Institute for Traffic Safety Management & Research in Albany. On Long Island, the number of crashes dropped 5% to 77,547, while fatal crashes grew by nearly a fifth, reaching 204 annually. Insurance rate increases are expected to continue in 2025 across Long Island, New York and the nation, but will likely proceed more modestly than in the past two years as inflationary pressure eases on the cost of repairing and replacing damaged vehicles, said Tim Zawacki, insurance sector strategist at S&P. The second half of the year should bode better for consumers, he said. \u201cAssuming no unexpected economic events, we would expect price competition to pick up across markets,\" he said. \"And we\u2019re already seeing carriers spend significantly more money on advertising seeking to attract new customers.\"\n\nClaudia Schimmel and her husband felt sticker shock when they received their car insurance renewal notice last fall.\n\nThe six-month premium to insure the Lindenhurst couple\u2019s 2023 Volkswagen SUV and 2019 Ram pickup truck with Geico increased in November by about $500, or 30%, to $2,223, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to shift a few things around, definitely,\" said Schimmel, 31, the mother of a 2-year-old boy. \"The excess spending on toys and things like that definitely goes down.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband plan to shop around for cheaper insurance, she said.\n\nThey're not alone.\n\nSign up for the Daily Business newsletter Stay in the know on jobs, retail and all things business across Long Island.

By offering real-time support, AI-powered chatbots not only save time for users but also build trust and loyalty. This trend highlights the growing importance of automation in delivering efficient and user-friendly online experiences.\n\nDynamic Storytelling with Smart Videos\n\nStatic images are being replaced by short, context-aware videos that adapt to user behavior. These \u201csmart videos\u201d deliver tailored content, making it easier to communicate complex ideas quickly and effectively. By incorporating dynamic storytelling, you can create a more engaging and memorable user experience. Smart videos allow brands to connect with their audience on a deeper level, using visuals to convey messages that resonate.

Custom illustrations are especially effective for storytelling, helping to build emotional connections with users. By using illustrations tailored to your brand, you can create a distinctive visual identity that resonates with your audience and reinforces your message.\n\nImmersive Full-Screen Headers\n\nFull-screen hero sections dominate the first impression of a website, offering an impactful way to capture attention. Whether through high-quality sliders, bold typography, or immersive videos, these headers set the tone for the rest of the site. By focusing on striking visuals and concise messaging, full-screen headers create a strong and memorable introduction. This trend emphasizes the importance of making a powerful first impression and guiding users into the website experience seamlessly.\n\nBento Grid Layouts: Organized Creativity\n\nInspired by mosaic designs, Bento grid layouts offer a visually appealing way to organize content. These grids balance structure and creativity, making it easier for users to navigate complex information. When combined with CSS grids, Bento layouts ensure responsiveness and adaptability across devices. This trend highlights the importance of combining aesthetics with functionality, creating designs that are both visually engaging and user-friendly.\n\nExpressive Typography and Bold Color Trends\n\nTypography is taking center stage in web design, with unique fonts and creative text styles enhancing visual identity. Pairing expressive typography with bold color trends\u2014such as vibrant tones, earthy shades, and Pantone\u2019s Mocha Mousse\u2014creates striking contrasts and harmonious designs. This trend allows brands to experiment with text as a design element, using it to convey personality and draw attention. By embracing expressive typography and bold colors, you can create designs that are both visually stunning and highly memorable.\n\nMinimalism vs. Brutalism\n\nMinimalist designs focus on simplicity, using clean layouts and ample white space to emphasize clarity and content. In contrast, brutalism embraces oversized elements, stark aesthetics, and bold contrasts for a raw, unapologetic look. Both approaches cater to different audiences, offering either clean simplicity or a daring edge. By understanding your target audience, you can choose the style that best aligns with your brand and message. This trend highlights the diversity of design approaches and the importance of tailoring your website to your audience\u2019s preferences.\n\nBlending Images with Graphics\n\nLayering photographs, illustrations, and text creates dynamic visual effects that elevate storytelling. This trend allows for experimentation with composition, resulting in designs that feel modern, artistic, and engaging. By blending images with graphics, you can create a cohesive and visually striking aesthetic that captures attention and communicates your message effectively. This approach emphasizes the importance of creativity in crafting unique and memorable designs.\n\nDark Mode and Light Mode Adaptability\n\nDark and light mode options are becoming standard features in web design, catering to user preferences and device settings. This dual-theme approach enhances accessibility while making sure your website looks polished in any environment. By offering both modes, you can prioritize user comfort and adaptability, creating a more inclusive experience. This trend reflects the growing demand for customizable interfaces that meet diverse user needs.\n\nStrategic Use of White Space\n\nWhite space, or negative space, is a powerful design tool that focuses attention on key content. By giving elements room to breathe, you can create a clean, uncluttered layout that improves readability and user experience. Strategic use of white space enhances the overall aesthetic of your website, making it feel more organized and professional. This trend underscores the importance of simplicity and clarity in effective web design.\n\nMedia Credit: Codex Community\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "Job hunting can be an exhausting and time-consuming process. Between scrolling through endless job boards, deciphering lengthy descriptions, and trying to figure out which roles are actually worth your time, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. If you\u2019ve ever wished there was a way to cut through the noise and focus on opportunities that truly match your skills and goals, you\u2019re not alone. The good news? There\u2019s a smarter, more efficient way to tackle your job search\u2014one that uses automation and AI to do the heavy lifting for you. Imagine a system that not only finds job postings but also organizes, filters, and prioritizes them, leaving you with a clear path forward. Sounds like a fantastic option, right?\n\nThis guide by Eric Tech introduces a no-code workflow that transforms the way you approach job hunting. By combining tools like Make, Airtable, and ChatGPT, this system automates repetitive tasks, from pulling job postings off LinkedIn to summarizing descriptions and calculating how well each role aligns with your profile. It\u2019s not just about saving time\u2014it\u2019s about working smarter, so you can focus your energy on what really matters: landing the job that\u2019s right for you.\n\nAI Job Search Automations\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Automate your job search using no-code tools like Make.com, RSS feeds, Airtable, and ChatGPT to create a streamlined workflow that extracts, filters, and prioritizes job postings.\n\nThe system processes job data by summarizing descriptions, calculating match percentages, and organizing information into a structured Airtable database for easy prioritization.\n\nScalability allows the workflow to include additional job sources, handle errors, and adapt to evolving job search needs.\n\nCost management is crucial, with ChatGPT processing fees estimated at $1.55 for 100 job records, making optimization key to balancing efficiency and affordability.\n\nThe workflow is highly customizable, allowing users to refine prompts, add new metrics, and tailor filters to align with their unique job search strategies and goals.\n\nSearching for a new job can often feel overwhelming, with countless postings to sift through and repetitive tasks consuming valuable time. However, by using no-code tools such as Make, RSS feeds, Airtable, and ChatGPT, you can automate and simplify this process.\n\nHow the Workflow Functions\n\nThe automation process operates on a timer-based system that retrieves job postings at regular intervals, such as every three hours. This ensures that your job search remains consistent and up-to-date. The workflow includes the following steps:\n\nJob postings are extracted from LinkedIn using RSS feeds, providing a steady stream of opportunities.\n\nDuplicate entries are filtered out, making sure that you only see unique and relevant listings.\n\nBy automating these repetitive tasks, you can reduce clutter and focus on roles that truly matter.\n\nTransforming Data into Actionable Insights\n\nOnce job postings are collected, the workflow processes the data to make it actionable and easy to evaluate. Key steps in this stage include:\n\nExtracting critical details such as job title, description, and posting date using HTTP requests.\n\nSummarizing lengthy job descriptions into concise, 215-character summaries with ChatGPT for quick review.\n\nCalculating a job match percentage by comparing your skills and profile with the job requirements.\n\nThis combination of automation and AI allows you to efficiently assess the relevance of each job without manually analyzing every detail, saving both time and effort.\n\nNo-Cod Job Search Automation Workflow\n\nUncover more insights about No-Code Automation in previous articles we have written.\n\nOrganizing and Prioritizing Job Opportunities\n\nThe processed job data is stored in Airtable, a versatile database tool that organizes information into a structured and easily navigable format. Each job entry includes:\n\nJob title and description\n\nPosting date\n\nDirect link to the job posting\n\nMatch percentage\n\nBy sorting and filtering jobs based on the match percentage, you can prioritize roles that align closely with your skills and career goals. This structured approach ensures that your efforts are directed toward the most promising opportunities.\n\nExpanding and Customizing the Workflow\n\nThis system is designed to adapt and grow with your job search needs. You can expand its functionality to include additional job sources, such as other job boards or company career pages. Customization options include:\n\nRefining ChatGPT prompts to exclude irrelevant roles, such as internships or part-time positions.\n\nAdding new data points, like a competition metric, to evaluate the difficulty of securing a position.\n\nIncorporating filters to tailor results to your preferences, such as location or industry.\n\nThese adjustments allow you to create a workflow that aligns with your unique strategy, making sure a more targeted and effective job search.\n\nEnhancing Efficiency and Managing Costs\n\nWhile automation significantly reduces the time spent on job hunting, it is essential to manage costs effectively. For instance, using ChatGPT to summarize job descriptions and calculate match percentages incurs a fee. Processing 100 job records with GPT-4 costs approximately $1.55, making it a cost-effective solution for handling large volumes of data. To optimize efficiency while keeping expenses under control, focus on high-priority tasks and refine the workflow to minimize unnecessary processing.\n\nTo further enhance the system, consider adding features such as:\n\nCombining job match percentages with competition metrics for better prioritization of roles.\n\nExpanding the workflow to include more job boards or data sources, increasing the range of opportunities available.\n\nThese enhancements can help you refine your search and strategically target roles that offer the best fit for your skills and career aspirations.\n\nMaximizing the Benefits of Automation\n\nBy using no-code tools and AI, this job search automation workflow transforms the job search process into a streamlined and efficient system. From extracting job postings to prioritizing applications, it saves time and allows you to focus on the most relevant opportunities. With its scalability, cost management, and customization options, this solution is a powerful resource for job seekers aiming to optimize their search and improve their chances of success. Whether you are just starting your career or looking for your next big opportunity, this workflow provides a practical and adaptable approach to navigating the job market.\n\nMedia Credit: Eric Tech\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology, and we've only scratched the surface of its potential. Currently, it's being used as a program on the side of normal work, but it's about to enter a new phase: Agentic AI. Agentic AI, often called AI agents, involves setting up software programs to do tasks that humans normally do. This next phase in implementing AI is critical, as it will allow those at the cutting edge to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOne of the leaders in agentic AI is Salesforce (CRM 1.43%). The software company is making a heavy push to promote and integrate agentic AI, and it also has one of the best platforms for implementing it.\n\nSalesforce's platform is ripe for agentic AI integration\n\nSalesforce makes customer relationship management (CRM) software. CRM is an incredibly broad sector but can generally be summarized as a business interaction with a potential customer from the marketing stage to after-sale support. There's a lot that happens between those two points, and Salesforce software is there to offer support along the way.\n\nMany customer interactions can be automated by AI agents, which is why agentic AI is such a massive trend for Salesforce. As with most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, the more add-ons you have from the base software package, the more expensive it gets. This unlocks another milestone for the generative AI trend; we're reaching a point where many companies are starting to monetize their AI investments.\n\nSalesforce's CEO and co-founder, Marc Benioff, is extremely bullish on agentic AI. During the company's 2024 Dreamforce conference, he stated, \"This is what AI was meant to be.\" That's a big statement, but the ability for companies to become more efficient and free their workers up to do tasks that require original thinking will be a huge change for many in the workforce.\n\nHowever, does this one technology have the ability to drive Salesforce's stock to new heights?\n\nSalesforce needs this new technology to kick-start growth again\n\nSalesforce is a mature software company that started to shift from growth-at-all-costs to maximizing profitability a few years ago. However, its sales growth has been a bit slow, by most software company standards, over the past few quarters. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), revenue was up 8% year over year to $9.44 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.60 versus $1.26 a year ago -- a 27% gain.\n\nEPS growth outpaced revenue growth because of Salesforce's rising margins. During last year's third quarter, Salesforce posted operating margins of 17.8%. This year, it delivered 20.6% operating margins. This will be a key trend to watch, as some of the most profitable software companies can reach profit margins of up to 30%. It will likely be some time before Salesforce can reach that level (if it can), but shareholders will be elated if it does.\n\nRight now, Salesforce stock trades at 32 times forward earnings, so it's far from cheap, especially with its current growth rate. Salesforce needs agentic AI to drive further revenue growth to justify its current price tag, but its platform currently has one of the most logical use cases for agentic AI. As a result, Salesforce will be a key company to watch to see how successful this agentic AI push is.\n\nI think it will be a huge success and help Salesforce deliver faster sales growth. We won't know how well this trend turns out for a few more quarters, but I'm optimistic that Salesforce will see a massive benefit from this push, making it a top pick in the AI investing world."

            "article_content": "This is a guest post for the Computer Weekly Developer Network written by Dom Couldwell, head of field engineering for EMEA at DataStax.\n\nCouldwell writes in full as follows\u2026\n\nIn certain circles \u2013 the majority of CEOs and a lot of developers \u2013 there is a lot of excitement around generative AI.\n\nOver the next year, we should see these applications move from pilot projects into real world production deployments.\n\nBut delivering any kind of AI experience relies on data \u2013 and of course, data engineering.\n\nIn turn, that data depends on having the right infrastructure to get that data ready for use with gen-AI.\n\nRAG defined This involves creating vector embeddings of any records or data sets that you want to use. Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data so that it can be understood semantically. When a user request comes in, the request is turned into a vector and used to search against your vectorised company data for semantically similar results. Those results then get shared to your LLM and the LLM delivers a response back. This approach is termed retrieval augmented generation, or RAG \u2013 it\u2019s becoming a standard for any AI application.\n\nHow to keep your data relevant From a data engineering perspective, there are some challenges that exist around data and AI \u2013 the first is around data quality. Developers are not normally responsible for the data that they have to work with \u2013 however, if that set of data is not clean to start with, it will affect the quality of any responses. Understanding what data you have \u2013 whether that is specific sets of PDFs for products through to huge catalogues of data \u2013 at the start can help. This will impact the rest of your data infrastructure and in turn how you design your systems.\n\nFunky (data) chunking As an example, data chunking is how you chop up the data before it\u2019s converted into vectors. Without the right tooling here, your search results will suffer. Alongside, you will have your search approach too \u2013 should you go with a pure vector search model, or combine it with additional metadata to perform a hybrid search? Lastly, how much data do you have stored \u2013 will your vector data be enough or do you need to consider creating graphs of your data as well? All these decisions will affect your application performance around AI responses. Creating a set of vector data is one thing, but your data set might change over time. You don\u2019t want to have old or out-of-date information in any responses that you serve up to users. While RAG can improve the relevance of your responses, it is only as good as the quality of the data in your vector database. Updating that set of vector data over time requires its own pipeline. To implement this, data developers and engineers can use data streaming to bring data in. The theory is that new relevant data can be streamed across for conversion into new vector embeddings alongside existing values. However this pipeline needs to be managed in its own right and companies like Unstructured are coming up to fill that gap."

            "article_content": "The search for an automated way to \u201ctaste-test\u201d products at mass-\u00adproduction speed and scale has stumped the food and beverage industry for decades. But in a new study, researchers used machine learning to overcome the limitations of a promising type of chemical sensor, meaning that a robotic tongue may soon assess your milk or merlot before you do.\n\nWhen ions in a liquid\u2014say, a delicious drink\u2014touch the conductive sheet of an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET), the electric current that flows through changes based on the liquid\u2019s exact composition and the voltage applied. This lets scientists use ISFETs to convert chemical changes into electrical signals. The chemical makeup of any drink, and thus its taste, is influenced by contamination and freshness\u2014which ISFETs can discern.\n\n\u201cThe food industry has a lot of problems in terms of figuring out whether food is adulterated or has something toxic in it,\u201d says Pennsylvania State University engineer Saptarshi Das. The first ISFETs were demonstrated more than 50 years ago, but the sensors aren\u2019t used much commercially. The advent of graphene, an ideal conductive material, helped researchers create improved ISFET sensors that detect specific chemical ions. But a big problem remained: readings varied from sensor to sensor and with changes in conditions such as temperature or humidity.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nIn Nature, Das and his colleagues addressed this issue by marrying ISFETs with neural networks, training a machine-learning algorithm to classify drinks using the sensors\u2019 readings. The resulting system could tell whether milk was diluted, distinguish among soda brands or coffee blends, and identify different fruit juices while judging their freshness.\n\nDuring development the team tried training based on human-selected data points, but the scientists found that designations were more accurate if the algorithm was given all device measurements and chose its own data features to base decisions on. Human-chosen features were vulnerable to variations in the devices, whereas the algorithm analyzed all the data at once, finding elements that change less. \u201cMachine learning is able to figure out more subtle differences\u201d that humans would find hard to define, Das explains. The system managed more than 97 percent accuracy on practical tasks.\n\n\u201cThe data are very convincing,\u201d says University of California, San Diego, engineer Kiana Aran, who co-founded a company to commercialize graphene-based biosensors. Unlike the human tongue, which detects specific molecules, this type of ISFET system detects only chemical changes\u2014\u00ad\u201cwhich limits it to specific, predefined chemical profiles\u201d such as brand formulations or ranges of freshness, she says.\n\nNext, Das and his colleagues will test larger, more diverse training datasets and more complex algorithms, as they expand the system\u2019s reach. For example, \u201cyou can use this technology for health-care applications: blood glu\u00adcose level or sweat monitoring,\u201d Das says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be another area we want to explore.\u201d"

            "article_content": "It will be a close encounter of the informative and entertaining kind when a local paranormal investigator shares his experiences at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library in Gardner.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, who starred on the \"Expedition Bigfoot\" series on the Discovery Channel for several season and appears regularly on \"Paranormal Caught on Camera\" the Travel Channel, will discuss the phenomena of unidentified flying objects in New England at the library on Wednesday, Jan. 22.\n\nLeBlanc, who lives in Leominster and is the author of two \"Monsterland\" books, said he had been unaware that Central Massachusetts had been such a hotbed of UFO activity until he began doing research for his first book.\n\nRonny LeBlanc, a renowned Leominster-based paranormal investigator, will discuss \"UFOs in New England\" at the Levi Heywood Memorial Library on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event, which will begin at 6:00 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\n\"There were rumors that Fort Devens, believe it or not, had a crash-retrieval program for UFOs, and then I heard from people personally that they had heard Fort Devens had a supposed recovered UFO, which kind of blew me away,\" said LeBlanc. \"For whatever reason, this area has had a long history of this stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, LeBlanc said, the very first UFO sighting ever reported occured in Massachusetts in the 1600s, when Gov. James Winthrop claimed to have seen a strange light moving up and down in the sky over Charlestown. And people have been fascinated by the possibility of being visited by aliens ever since, he said.\n\n\"What are these things and why are people seeing these crafts?\" LeBlanc wondered. \"Not all of these people can be lying, and I think people are ready now for the truth to come out. There has to be life elsewhere.\"\n\nUFOs in Ashburnham?\n\nNo discussion of UFOs in New England can be complete without including the \"Andreasson Affair,\" a celebrated case concerning the alleged abduction of an Ashburnham woman by aliens in 1967. The incident, which was the subject of several books and a movie, concerned the experience of Betty Andreasson, who claimed to have been abducted from her Highland Ave. home, taken aboard a UFO, and experimented on by aliens.\n\nMore: An Ashburnham close encounter 50 years ago\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBlanc said the Andreasson incident one of UFOlogy's most interested cases because of how much serious investigation went into trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"Through 1965 and 1967, during that time period, there were a lot of reports of flying saucers, but Betty's story was really compelling,\" LeBlanc said, adding that unusual phenomena seemed to follow Andreasson, who also lived for a time in Fitchburg and Leominster, throughout her life. \"She passed several lie-detector tests, people witnessed an orange orb appear in the room while she was being interviewed, and another time people witnessed a gray alien materialize in the interview room and then disappear. There was some real strange stuff going on with her.\"\n\nAfter Andreasson moved to Florida, according to LeBlanc, her husband reported seeing mysterious black helicopters hovering over the couple's home from time to time.\n\nRecent drone sightings have renewed interest in UFOs\n\nRecent reports of mystery drones flying over the East coast had sparked a renewed interest in UFOs, and LeBlanc said it was possible that some of the object in the skies could be of extraterrestrial origin. And he has a bold prediction for the year ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Officials investigate drone sightings spotted in New Jersey and other states\n\n\"I think we're going to find out we're not alone in 2025,\" he said.\n\nThe event, which will be held in the library's Greenwood Meeting Room at 6 p.m., is free and open to the public.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gardner News: Levi Heywood Memorial Library to host UFOs in New England presentation"

            "article_content": "Fundamental research in cryptography that\u2019s used worldwide to facilitate internet banking, e-commerce services, and secure messaging systems is now taking root in India as well.\n\nThe principal goal of those developing or using cryptographic systems is to improve system security. Cryptography \u2014 from the English roots of \u201chidden writing \u2014 is the name for techniques that secure information by converting plain text into ciphertext. It is concerned with the creation and use of encrypted messages that only the sender and the receiver can understand and which a malicious actor who interferes with the communication can\u2019t.\n\nSending secret messages isn\u2019t new. Archaeologists have unearthed clay tablets made by the ancient Mesopotamians in which they wrote down cryptic formulae to make ceramic glazes. In the first century BC, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar used the eponymous Caesar cipher to relay messages of strategic value to his generals.\n\nMore recently, many Polish codebreakers fled their country after Adolf Hitler invaded it in 1939 to work with reputed British mathematicians, including the father of modern computing Alan Turing, to crack Germany\u2019s famed Enigma cryptosystem. Turing\u2019s work in particular established much of the foundational theory for modern algorithmic computing.\n\nScientists have devised many sophisticated methods to prevent adversaries from cracking secret codes and gaining unauthorised access to sensitive information. These methods achieve their goals by using algorithms and protocols to protect some data\u2019s confidentiality, integrity, authenticatability, and non-repudiation.\n\n\u2018Hard\u2019 problems\n\nCryptographic algorithms convert messages in ways that make it very difficult, very expensive or both to decode them. A common way to achieve this has been to place some sensitive information behind the answer to a very difficult problem. An agent can access the information by solving the problem, so the harder the problem, the more inaccessible the information.\n\n\u201cHence the search for harder and harder problems \u2014 for instance, even those that quantum computers may find hard to solve,\u201d R. Ramanujam of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, said.\n\nAs computational techniques evolve, particularly with advancements in quantum computing, the interplay between complexity and cryptography will continue to be a crucial area of research and development, he added.\n\nModern cryptographic systems are built on problems that demand far too many resources to be solved.\n\n\u201cAs they say in the crypto community, if your cryptosystem is broken, either a spy is dead or a million dollars is missing,\u201d Ayan Mukherjee, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, said. \u201cSuch is the seriousness of the effect of a broken cryptosystem. Thus, oftentimes, people use the old and the trusted to secure their communications.\u201d\n\nThis is also why, he added, \u201cThe field of cryptography is very slow-moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a close connection between complexity theory and cryptography, hence many [researchers] work on these connections, clarifying notions and building finer techniques,\u201d Ramanujam said.\n\nAreas where Indian researchers are working extensively include communication complexity (the amount of communication required to complete a computational task), proof complexity (the computational resources required to prove or disprove statements), and algebraic coding theory (using algebra to encode and decode data).\n\nLocks and keys\n\nThe goal is to make sure an adversary, especially one with enormous computational resources, can\u2019t crack the code. At the heart of any cryptosystem is the key: a secret value an algorithm uses to encrypt or decrypt data.\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a simple example. It works by mapping the existing alphabet to one where the starting letter is offset by some number of letters. This number is the key. For example, if the key is 14, the encrypted alphabet begins with the letter O (the 14th letter) rather than A. Thus the words FIGHT FOR ROME become TWUVH TCF FCAS.\n\nWhen the sender encrypts data with a key, only someone who knows the key can decrypt the message and read it. More sophisticated systems use two keys \u2014 one each for the sender and the receiver \u2014 and map them in a separate secret way.\n\nA famous example is public-key cryptography, which is used to secure information over the internet. The receiver uses a single algorithm to generate two keys called the public key and the private key, and shares the public key with the sender. Any message the sender encrypts with the public key can be decrypted by the private key.\n\nResearchers prefer the algorithms that generate keys to be one-way functions, a name in mathematics for functions that are simple to use but hard to crack. In cryptography, this means they can be used to easily encrypt messages but can\u2019t be cracked without knowing the key. As Ramanujam put it, the challenge is like protecting a house with a strong alarm system that the house\u2019s residents can still use without training.\n\nSome one-way functions are very difficult to crack and thus very secure \u2014 but which also take a long time to decrypt messages. This is one of the principal reasons mining for bitcoins has become a very energy-intensive process. The bitcoin system uses a one-way function that has required more computational resources to decrypt messages as the size of its blockchain has increased.\n\nThis is why some cryptography researchers in India and abroad are working on simplifying the decryption side in particular. Researchers are also considering whether shorter proofs (of the hard problems) can be used to verify the integrity of data in artificial intelligence and large language models.\n\nCryptography isn\u2019t just a mathematical or academic curiosity but is of considerable practical interest, Yael Kalai, whose work on proofs won her the 2022 Turing Award, told the 11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in September (the author was in the audience). \u201cIn today\u2019s world, the biggest problem we have to solve is trustworthiness,\u201d she said.\n\nSince researchers have solved the problem of authentication and security in communications, she added, the current problem is computation.\n\n\u201cPeople are computing things for us. How do we know that they are computing correctly? How do we certify the huge and often crazy computations people are coming up with? That is a huge new research problem now.\u201d\n\nPossibility of disruption\n\nTwo research areas that could disrupt current cryptographic systems with significant economic and social consequences are homomorphic encryption and quantum information technologies, per a recent paper by the Organisation of Economically Developed Countries (OECD).\n\nHomomorphic encryption is a cryptographic method that allows certain calculations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first and without accessing the secret key. The result of such computations remains in encrypted form and can be revealed later, when necessary. According to the paper, this technique could surmount the problem of processing encrypted data without decrypting it first, which increases risk.\n\nSecond, a mature quantum computer could easily break some encryption methods widely used today. Some researchers are thus working on algorithms that can resist attacks powered by a quantum computer, an enterprise called quantum resistant cryptography (QRC). In fact marrying cryptography with quantum physics paves the way for encryption technologies based on the laws of quantum physics, which can be more convoluted than mathematical concepts alone.\n\nResearchers worldwide have been working on QRC since 2006, including in publicly funded research projects in the European Union and Japan. In India, Mukherjee\u2019s group at IISER Pune, and those at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Raman Research Institute (RRI), both in Bengaluru; the Centre for Development of Telematics, New Delhi; and at Pondicherry University are working on it as well.\n\n\u2018A huge deal\u2019\n\nCryptography research in India is taking off in other aspects, too, catching up with that in the European Union, the U.S., and China. The National Quantum Mission the Cabinet approved in 2023 includes a research hub for quantum communication. The mission is to enable satellite-based secure quantum communications between ground stations over 2,000 km, long-distance secure quantum communications with other countries, inter-city quantum key distribution over 2,000 km, and multi-node quantum networks, among other outcomes.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation is also planning to launch a satellite with ultra-secure quantum communication capabilities.\n\nIn July, a team of Indian scientists from RRI, IISc, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, and the Bose Institute in Kolkata published a paper describing a way to generate true random numbers that are crucial to making secure private keys and nearly unhackable passwords.\n\n\u201cThis new method offers the enhanced protection we all need in our daily lives, by using truly random numbers to generate keys that will be used to encrypt the passwords,\u201d the Department of Science & Technology said in a statement.\n\nApart from the Ministry of Science & Technology, major government funders for cryptography research in the country include the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Department of Telecommunications.\n\n\u201cThe present status of quantum cryptography is to build quantum-secure cryptosystems,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s based on the idea that, in the near future, we will have quantum computers. When that happens the current cryptosystems will fail. This is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe consequences will also affect India\u2019s cryptography policy. According to a recent study commissioned by the Thales Group, the volume of sensitive data in the cloud could surge from 51% of all organisational data to 68% by 2027. As more data enters and lives in the cloud, \u201cencryption techniques for data at rest, in motion, and in use are becoming more pervasive, evolving into a standard practice for protecting cloud-resident sensitive information against emerging cyber threats,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere is widespread data loss as well: the report said almost three-fourths of all organisations have faced multiple data breaches in the past year, foremost due to inadequate encryption. Some 71% initiated formal cryptographic programmes and 81% have dedicated encryption teams.\n\nT.V. Padma is a science journalist in New Delhi."

            "article_content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nFor children today, artificial intelligence (AI) won't be a marvel or a menace\u2014it will simply be there. As unremarkable as Wi-Fi or running water. It's not a question of whether they'll adapt to AI; they're already growing up with it.\n\nAlexa's voice mingles with bedtime stories. ChatGPT drafts homework outlines. Google Home turns on the lights and plays morning playlists.\n\nAI is settling into family homes, classrooms, and even cribs, not as an anomaly but as a quiet companion.\n\nMy daughter is growing up with humans and AI. Literally. She just turned one and already recognises her mom, her dad, and her AI assistant. We have the Amazon Alexa at home, and my partner and I use Siri on our iPhones all the time. As a result, she sees AI as a natural part of her life. Alexa and Siri are two names she is familiar with, just like 'Mama' and 'Papaa.'\n\nWhen she cries, we say, \"Alexa, tell Raaha to stop crying,\" Alexa blinks blue and green, luring her to think it's her friend. And she stops crying.\n\nWhen tears roll down her cheeks, Alexa's soothing lullabies often succeed where parenting hacks fail. A simple command transforms chaos into calm. This isn't the splashy tech revolution futurists warned about.\n\nDon't forget the foundation. AI here is not forced. It didn't announce itself. It's here to weave itself into the fabric of daily life. Like a flawless merger.\n\nA decade ago, Skype calls felt like science fiction; toddlers swipe through virtual classrooms today without batting an eye.\n\nSimilarly, today's AI-powered toys, chatbots, and voice assistants will become as banal as microwaves by the time Generation Alpha enters middle school. The shift is happening in the mundane moments.\n\nAlgorithms suggest learning apps tailored to individual needs. Toys respond to emotional cues, fostering a strange form of companionship. And yet, these tools are less about transforming life and more about streamlining it. For today's kids, there's no awe or fear. It's just life.\n\nAI's creeping omnipresence creates a paradox.\n\nOn one hand, it's a miracle of modernity. Need a quick science lesson? AI tutors have you covered. Want to track developmental milestones? Machine learning apps will cheerfully send reminders. But this efficiency comes at a cost. If Alexa answers every curious \"why,\" will children still learn the joy of discovery? If empathy is simulated, will they grasp the depth of real human connection?\n\nAlso Read: AI in the real world\n\nI wrestle with these questions daily. I marvel at AI's ability to ease daily burdens. As a sceptic, I wonder: Are we outsourcing too much? AI may smooth the edges of chaos, but it also raises a nagging fear\u2014what happens when the lines between human and machine blur too much?\n\nOutside the home, the AI ecosystem is reshaping every facet of society. Schools are piloting AI tutors that promise personalised education, a far cry from one-size-fits-all classrooms. In healthcare, AI tools detect patterns in patient data, offering diagnostics faster than human doctors. Even our social interactions are subtly guided by recommendation algorithms dictating what we see, read, and share.\n\nBut with ubiquity comes complacency. Who ensures these systems remain ethical while children grow up surrounded by invisible, algorithmic hands? Bias in AI is no theoretical issue. A 2019 study found that facial recognition software misidentified Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more frequently than white ones. When these systems shape our children's realities, vigilance isn't optional\u2014it's imperative.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe next frontier for AI isn't innovation\u2014it's normalisation. Systems will become more personalised, more humanlike, and more integrated into the spaces we inhabit. Picture this: smart homes seamlessly adapting to moods, smart cities optimising every resource, and AI tools that learn not just how we think but how we feel. Our children will inherit this reality\u2014a world where AI doesn't stand out; it blends in.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will be part of their lives. It's whether it will shape them more than they shape it.\n\nA Quiet Revolution, Carefully Tended\n\nIt's to make life a little smoother, a little easier quietly. As parents, educators, professionals and citizens, our responsibility is to ensure this transition is thoughtful and deliberate. AI shouldn't raise our children. It should support us in raising them.\n\nIn business, think of AI as a dependable assistant. It simplifies tasks, spots problems, and lets leaders focus on big-picture decisions. It's not the boss; the behind-the-scenes helper keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nIn education, AI works like a helpful tutor. It finds where students struggle and offers the right tools to support them. But the teacher inspires creativity, critical thinking, and emotional growth\u2014skills no machine can truly replace.\n\nAlso Read: Human intelligence must guide artificial intelligence\n\nFor now, I'll keep asking Alexa to play lullabies when the chaos peaks. But I'll also keep asking myself harder questions. Will this ecosystem of AI enhance our humanity\u2014or dilute it? The answer, perhaps, lies in how we choose to nurture this strange, quiet revolution. Maybe it's not as scary as it's portrayed in the movies, as it's quietly evolving into our regular ecosystem anyway.\n\nPersonally, I'm okay with AI if it can help my baby stop crying. More okay with it helping me automate the most boring task in my profession."

Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.\n\nThis transformative technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Underscoring this point, a recent McKinsey & Co. research report projects that quantum computing could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in economic value by 2035.\n\nJust as the internet boom created giants like Amazon and Google, quantum computing could give rise to a new generation of industry-leading companies, offering early investors the potential for extraordinary gains. Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ (IONQ -6.40%) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI -12.54%) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps."
