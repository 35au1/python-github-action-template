This is why it\u2019s been hard to get facts from any US Agency,\u201d DeLonge wrote on social media Saturday. \u201cSome of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nLocal, stat and federal authorities have thus far been mystified about the nature of the drones, with the White House saying Thursday that the objects do not appear to be of foreign origin, but their investigation.\n\nOver the past week alone, the drones \u2014 which are reportedly bigger than most recreational drones, according to some witnesses \u2014 have been seen by hundreds of Garden State denizens, with Governor Phil Murphy admitting that there were nearly 50 sightings alone last Sunday, NPR reports.\n\nThe situation reminded DeLonge, an expert on the subject of UFOs and UAPs, to similar mass sightings that happened in the 1960s \u2014 \u201cThere is a good chance that these things could potentially be \u2018mimicking\u2019 other aircraft,\u201d the guitarist said \u2014 and shared documents from 1965 about a military base that \u201cexperienced a considerable number of reports pertaining to unidentified flying objects.\u201d\n\nThen and now, the UFOs/drones flew in formation, had \u201cred and green flashing lights,\u201d and made \u201cno sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all something to consider, and although we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time,\u201d DeLonge speculated.\n\n\u201cWhy? To get us to notice them without a major freak out? Who knows\u2026 but well, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Increasingly, over the last few decades, modern pop culture has warmed up to embracing the frightful chills of the winter holidays in films like Gremlins, Black Christmas, Terrifier 3 \u2026 Love Actually. But the historical roots of this time of year have always had a darker, spookier side. Long before Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol \u2014 an era when families of Victorian England gathered to share ghost stories by the fire on Christmas Eve \u2014 pre-Christian folklore told of a thin veil between worlds, where spirits (and goblins, beasts, and gods) lingered during the winter solstice.\n\nThose ancient beliefs blend with modern natural introspection of the holidays. Along with the (sometimes saccharine) jubilations, Christmas and the winter festivities encourage people to reflect on the past, lost loved ones, and the lingering \u201cghosts\u201d of memory. Add to that how this month is populated by magical home invaders, and a creepy surveillance imp on the shelf, and December is a rather fitting time for mystery, the macabre, and paranormal tales.\n\nCelebrating the scarier side of the holidays is not only a sort of subversive counter-programming by pairing cheer with fear, it allows us to acknowledge the dichotomy of light and dark, contrasting cozy, nostalgic evenings with long, eerily silent nights.\n\nAll of this is a very drawn out way of saying I love getting creepy, spooky, and downright scary gifts for the holidays, and I love shopping for loved ones who also appreciate a little splash of blood red with their Christmases so white. And so, we return with a Talking Strange Show \u201cSeason\u2019s Screamings Gift Guide\u201d for 2024. After the success of last year\u2019s guide, we are going bigger and bloodier with gift suggestions for the horror and paranormal fans in your life. Comic books, action figures, statues, graphic novels, swanky shirts and hats, paranormal investigation equipment, and even some vodka and cologne are all included, and all part of the theme."

            "article_content": "MA Ganapathy (File photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: When laying hands on a book penned by a recently retired IPS officer, you would normally expect tales of gallantry, security strategy insights and, even better, some inside and juicy details of investigations into high-profile cases that can possibly generate enough media interest to get the memoirs flying off the shelves.But M A Ganapathy \u2014 who hung up his boots earlier this year after discharging key roles as DG, NSG and Uttarakhand DGP as well as earlier stints in the CBI, Union home ministry and Central police organisations \u2014 in his debut novel \u2018 Whispers in the Shadows \u2019, a collection of short stories , has chosen to go with the paranormal rather than normal. With the government of India having tightened rules to rein in bureaucrats\u2019 post-retirement \u201ckiss and tell\u201d memoirs, Ganapathy has steered clear of making his literary foray with a first-person account in James Bond-style and dabbled instead in Ruskin Bond \u2019s much-loved art of narrating \u2018spooky events and paranormal encounters \u2019 set in the woods and quaint Indian towns.Taking a cue from the Uttarakhand-based celebrity author, Ganapathy in \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 (mind you, not \u2018Whispers in the Corridors\u2019, which would anyday be a more awaited offering from an ex-bureaucrat), puts together hair-raising and captivating tales set in UP/Uttarakhand, Ganapathy a.k.a. Avinash\u2019s cadre state; his native home in the coffee haven of Coorg set in the Western Ghats; his alma mater JNU (not named in the book) and even his Central postings in CISF and as head of Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security (BCAS).It could thus not be more apt that \u2018the\u2019 Ruskin Bond himself introduces \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 on the cover as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.Ganpathy stars in and as Avinash, a protagonist he has cleverly created to narrate his rather frequent brushes with the supernatural. There are enough giveaways: Avinash, like Ganapathy, is a native of Coorg, or Kodagu. The stories \u2018Shriek in the Woods\u2019 and \u2018Babu\u2019s Hurricane Lamp\u2019 may remind you or your own childhood \u2014 the fear of Maths, walks from the school through the haunted woods and spooky stories fed to wide-eyed children by the househelps \u2014 and have a flash of R K Narayan\u2019s \u2018Swami\u2019 from Malgudi Days.Each of the tales has Avinash narrating his weird, ghostly, time-travel and post-death experiences in a lucid but captivating, edge-of-the-seat style. The book is a window to the life of a senior police officer who is trained to be fearless and rely on scientific evidence but who is also human enough to marvel at and embrace the unexplained, supernatural experiences along the way. So much so, Ganapathy made it a point to chronicle these chilling life incidents and produce a novel soon after he retired.The stories may be intriguing, sometimes rather incredible (particularly The Curious Case of Class of 1986, which sees Avinash travel through different realms of time), but they also carry a message. The ghosts and supernatural entities, including dead dogs, seem to help in solving knotty murder cases (The Uncanny Experience in Behta Village and Little Khairi Still Roams the Wilds), save lives (Do Miracles Really Happen Anymore and The Small Boy Who Loved Airports) and ensure that the forests and wildlife are protected (Bote Aiyappa of the Sacred Grove)."

            "article_content": "It may not have won \u201cWord of the Year,\u201d but romantasy is still the reigning champion of many readers' hearts.\n\nAlex Belanger shares her romantasy recommendations with more than 16,000 followers on TikTok. Because the 31-year-old Kentuckian grew up in a sheltered religious sect, she's always been drawn to \u201cRapunzel\u201d stories. Fairytales about broadening worldviews and unexplored places were a childhood comfort. During the pandemic, she stumbled into romantasy books on TikTok, and found they both reminded her of her youth and reflected her interests as an adult.\n\nBelanger is just one of the many readers steering one of publishing's prized horses \u2013 the genre's sales increased 42% from 2022 to 2023, according to Circana.\n\nWhat is romantasy?\n\nA portmanteau of the words \u201cromance\u201d and \u201cfantasy,\u201d romantasy blends two beloved genres. Readers get all the best parts of swoony love story tropes, magical world-building and high-stakes adventure.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nMany romantasy books include fae or fairies, dragons, elves and other mythical creatures. Popular series \u201cA Court of Thorns and Roses\u201d by Sarah J. Maas is a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d retelling set in a divided realm of humans and faeries. \u201cFourth Wing\u201d by Rebecca Yarros, another romantasy favorite, follows a young girl training to become a dragon rider.\n\nThe world-building is more expansive than many other romance subgenres. In paranormal romance, for example, magical characters often appear in normal society rather than in an entirely new, imagined land.\n\nBut the two genres often overlap, especially with their readership. Ali Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cBride,\u201d which features a romance between a vampire and werewolf, was a recent hit with romantasy fans.\n\n\u201cThe blurring of these lines is just exciting and expansive and allows authors and publishers to have a greater diversification of contents, of character,\u201d says Ashley Doliber, the senior director of marketing strategy at Entangled Publishing, which houses such series as Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Obsidian\" by Jennifer L. Armentrout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to color within certain lines, you have the opportunity to really push those boundaries.\u201d\n\nIs romantasy the right genre for you?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a fantasy fanatic to get in on the fun. Many readers credit romantasy series like \u201cACOTAR\u201d as the reason they got back into reading, even if they were initially hesitant to try the genre. And despite their length, they tend to be fast-paced, immersive reads.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to choose from, which keeps the genre fresh, says Belanger. She recommends switching up the tropes and types of mythical beings in your books. Worlds inhabited by fairies or dragons are among the most popular, but she's recently seen an uptick in \u201cshifter\u201d protagonists, who, as the name suggests, can morph between human and animal forms.\n\nRomantasy is also the perfect genre for those who grew up reading fan fiction.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to find a lot of the people that write romantasy are the people that wrote fan fiction in the past,\u201d Belanger says.\n\nJulie Soto, author of \u201cRose in Chains,\u201d used to write \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan fiction. Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cThe Love Hypothesis\u201d was originally published online as \u201cReylo\u201d fan fiction (yes \u2013 as in Rey and Kylo Ren from \u201cStar Wars\u201d).\n\nMore than just \u2018spicy\u2019: Readers find romantasy empowering\n\nThere\u2019s something so unputdownable about stepping into a magical world and finding your OTP (one true pairing).\n\nSteamy romance novels are sometimes seen as the fluff of the literary world. Society has long been quick to invalidate female sexuality and empowerment as \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d reads.\n\n\u201cThat escapism aspect is certainly key,\u201d Doliber says. \u201cBut I think what a lot of genre fiction allows is the opportunity to simultaneously have that fun, joyful, thought-provoking escapism (and) at the same time, you\u2019re tackling real-world themes\u201d like female empowerment and agency.\n\nIt\u2019s also one corner of the internet where readers have been able to embrace their sexuality and center female pleasure. Some readers told HuffPost that romance books and erotica have helped improve their sex lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great way to help your mind become open and break away from purity culture,\u201d Belanger says. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in a woman\u2019s pleasure and knowing what you want.\u201d\n\nBest romantasy books\n\nRomantasy may be buzzy, but it\u2019s not a new genre. Belanger cites \"foundational\" romantasy reads (which, in the 2010s, were more medieval than fae) like Mary E. Pearson\u2019s \u201cThe Remnant Chronicles\u201d and Marissa Meyer\u2019s fairytale retellings in \u201cThe Lunar Chronicles.\u201d\n\nModern classics include Sarah J. Maas' three bestselling romantasy series \"A Court of Thorns and Roses,\" \"Throne of Glass\" and \"Crescent City.\" Rebecca Yarros is another big name in romantasy with \"Fourth Wing,\" \"Iron Flame\" and her upcoming \"Onyx Storm,\" which releases in January.\n\nIf you want to dive into the romantasy genre, here are the titles Belanger suggests starting with:\n\n\u201cA River Enchanted\u201d by Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cHouse of Dragons\u201d by K.A. Linde\n\n\u201cSong of the Forever Rains\u201d by E.J. Mellow\n\n\u201cA Court this Cruel and Lovely\u201d by Stacia Stark\n\n\u201cFor the Wolf\u201d by Hannah Whitten\n\n\u201cThe Bridge Kingdom\u201d by Danielle L. Jensen\n\n\u201cLedge\u201d by Stacey McEwan\n\n\u201cQuicksilver\u201d by Callie Hart\n\n\u201cFeather\u201d by Olivia Wildenstein\n\n\u201cThrone in the Dark\u201d by A.K. Caggiano\n\n\u201cA Fate Inked in Blood\u201d by Danielle L. Jensen\n\n\u201cBelladonna\u201d by Adalyn Grace (YA)\n\n\u201cSinner\u2019s Isle\u201d by Angela Montoya (YA)\n\n\u201cAn Enchantment of Ravens\u201d by Margaret Rogerson (YA)\n\n\u201cA Curse So Dark and Lonely\u201d by Brigid Kemmerer (YA)\n\n\u201cThe Shadows Between Us\u201d by Tricia Levenseller (YA)\n\n\u201cImmortal Dark\u201d by Tigest Girma (YA)\n\nAnd here are some favorites from USA TODAY staff:\n\n\u201cFrom Blood and Ash\u201d Jennifer L. Armentrout\n\n\u201cThese Hollow Vows\u201d Lexi Ryan\n\n\u201cHouse of Beating Wings\u201d Olivia Wildenstein\n\n\u201cThe Serpent and the Wings of Night\u201d Carissa Broadbent\n\n\u201cDivine Rivals\u201d Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cSpark of the Everflame\u201d Penn Cole\n\nNot the right fit for you? Try these other genres:\n\nCozy mystery books have octogenarian protagonists and combine crime with comfort. Paranormal romances deal in otherworldly love (literally). And cozy fantasy books have all the loveable characters with less of the blood-pressure-raising stakes. Still not it?

            "article_content": "Charming and ebullient, Ducotterd does not fit the stereotype of a research scientist. She grew up in Wigan, and her accent has survived long years abroad. Like many involved in dementia research, she has a personal connection to the disease. With a dentist father and social worker mother, Ducotterd initially planned to become a vet, but when she didn\u2019t get into veterinary school she studied biology at the University of Edinburgh instead. Around the same time, her grandmother\u2019s mental state began to decline.\n\n\u201cI was watching my granny start to buy food for people who didn\u2019t live with her anymore and forget big details about her life,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving that personal connection to the story made me so motivated by what I was doing in the lab. I thought: this is exactly what I want to do. Make medicines.\u201d She went on to a PhD at Newcastle. In the face of diminished neuroscience investment in the UK, she moved to Japan for a postdoctoral position studying Parkinson\u2019s disease. Later she worked at GSK in China and later at Eisai Pharmaceuticals in the USA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazingly global experience of drug discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be innovative you have to think differently. And the more different ways of thinking you have in your group, the more you\u2019re going to challenge each other.\u201d\n\nShe ended up staying in America for nine years, before moving back to the UK at the end of 2022, by which time she had acquired a husband and a daughter. While she had been away, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK had taken the lead in establishing new Drug Discovery Institutes at Oxford, Cambridge and in London, enabling them to function like biotech startups in a university setting, adding free-market pep to academic excellence.\n\nSince Ducotterd was an undergraduate, there has been revolutionary progress in neurodegenerative diseases, mostly driven by advances in computing.\n\n\u201cI went to university just after they\u2019d cloned Dolly the sheep,\u201d she says. \u201cThe molecular technologies have transformed the field \u2013 being able to sequence genomes in minutes rather than years; methods that let us do more rapid analysis of big data; artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe success of lecanemab, a drug that has been shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s progression by 30 per cent in early-stage patients (but which has yet to be approved on the NHS) has also energised the field by showing that progress is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never seen a trial that has shown we can slow the disease at all. It gives massive amounts of hope and investment because everyone now knows it is possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects she is particularly excited about involves leveraging human genetics to mimic natural resilience against dementia. \u201cThere is a really interesting study in a group in Holland where they\u2019re looking at people who live healthily into their hundreds cognitively,\u201d she says."

This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

This screengrab is taken from OpenAI's press demonstration of the generator posted on Monday. Image by OpenAI\n\nDec. 14 (UPI) -- OpenAI has launched Sora, a new video tool powered by artificial intelligence technology that has generated controversy in recent months. The Sora Turbo product, available since Monday, makes it much easier and faster for users to generate high-definition videos lasting up to 20 seconds. Advertisement\n\n\"We're introducing our video generation technology now to give society time to explore its possibilities and co-develop norms and safeguards that ensure it's used responsibly as the field advances,\" OpenAI said in an online announcement.\n\n\"We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories and push the boundaries of what's possible with video storytelling.\"\n\nUsers can use the A.I.-powered technology to incorporate existing digital information and extend, remix, blend or generate new content from text.\n\nA storyboard tool enables users to control the outcomes for every frame while adding text, images or video, and two community feeds provide new and continually updated content.\n\nOpenAI said it is blocking content that is illegal or otherwise highly controversial, such as child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes.\n\nStill, the app has faced criticism long before it was released to the public with some experts alarmed about how A.I.-generated video could be used and others concerned with legal issues regarding things like copyright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty artists who had early access to the Sora app in November opposed the Sora app in an open letter to OpenAI and accused the tech firm of using artists as a way to make the app appear more accepted among the global artist community.\n\n\"Artists are not your unpaid R&D,\" they said. \"We are not your free bug-testers, PR puppets, training data, validation tokens.\"\n\nThe artists addressed the open letter to \"A.I. corporate overlords\" and included a leaked code for Sora. Just weeks later, the company rolled out the product to the masses, possibly influenced by that leak.\n\n\"We are being lured into art-washing to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists,\" the artists had said.\n\nOpenAI in February announced the roll-out of the text-to-video Sora app as a follow-up to its ChatGPT chatbot tool for generating textual content.\n\nSora said artists would be part of its development team for the Sora app that is intended to compete with Meta's Make-a-Video tool, which was previewed by Facebook's parent in a 2022 white paper but has seemingly not been released to the public.\n\nAt the time, UPI reported that the success of Meta's model would be likely to spur an increase in investments by other companies into videos generated by A.I.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI in March also rolled out its A.I. tool called Voice Engine, which can clone someone's voice after hearing several seconds of audio. The company has said Voice Engine can help people who have lost their voices and be used in other beneficial ways."

            "article_content": "YouTube has had quite a monumental year in terms of user engagement, logging in over a billion hours of content streamed daily on TV sets alone. However, the platform is also home to a sea of content that isn\u2019t safe for children, which is why a dedicated kids\u2019 experience has been there for a while.\n\nNow, YouTube is adding a password protocol that will keep young users from accessing any other profile apart from their designated kid\u2019s profile on a TV. In a community update, the company introduced the new Parent Code feature that will block kids from accessing user profiles for adults in their household.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt is an opt-in feature that needs to be enabled manually. Once activated, this code will be required if kids want to access a profile meant for other members of their family. Moreover, they will also be prompted to enter the code if they want to access the video platform without any Google account signed in.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nGoing a step further, the team will also require the parent code if an individual attempts to remove an account from the shared TV. YouTube has also clarified that enabling the new feature won\u2019t affect other devices on which the same account is being used.\n\nIn order to enable the Parent code feature, follow this path:\n\nIn the YouTube app installed on your TV, navigate to the Settings page. You will see a dedicated Parent Code tab in the Settings dashboard. Go through the on-screen prompts and set up the four-digit Parent Code. In order to disable the safety feature, you need to enter the same code in the future.\n\nDo keep in mind that once you remove the parent code, anyone can enjoy YouTube sans any age restrictions for content and without having to sign up with a Google account. Moreover, all user profiles belonging to adult members will be openly accessible.\n\nThe latest safety-focused feature update from YouTube is actually a corrective measure on the company\u2019s end. Earlier this year, Google pulled away the separate YouTube Kids app icon in the YouTube experience for TVs and smart devices.\n\nInstead, the profiles for kids and adults were all clubbed together under the \u201cWho\u2019s watching\u201d launch banner. \u201cNow, you can easily select your child\u2019s profile from within the YouTube app, and you\u2019ll be brought right into the new YouTube Kids experience on TV,\u201d the company reasoned back then.\n\nHowever, it seems that not all parents and guardians were happy with the move, apparently because it makes it far easier for kids to access other user profiles that show content without any age restrictions. Locking non-kids profiles behind a passcode is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Parent Code feature on YouTube is now rolling out and will start appearing for all users within the next few days."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nThe case of Subhash Atul's suicide has highlighted numerous issues in alleged misuse of law sections such as Section 498A and 306 of the Indian Penal Code, IPC. The original legislation was meant to safeguard distressed women against dowry harassment and associated abuse but its misuse led to serious persecutions for the accused, their families, and social groups. Subhash Atul, a Pune-based software engineer, was found dead under mysterious circumstances. Reports indicated continuous harassment by his spouse as an alleged cause of his distress.\n\nHis death reignited a nationwide debate on gender-neutrality in laws as well as the psychological pressure such allegations can put the accused under. The legal framework governing these cases reflects the delicate balance between protecting vulnerable individuals and ensuring fairness in the justice system. Section 498A of the IPC addresses cruelty by a husband or his relatives, while Section 306 deals with abetment of suicide.\n\nHowever, an increasing number of evidence points to the possibility of false cases under these acts, which leads to unnecessary legal tangles, loss of reputation, and even suicides by the accused. Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) are alarming: more than 70% of cases filed under Section 498A end in acquittal, which questions the validity of such cases and calls for reforms. Discussions around gender-neutral laws have been gathering steam worldwide, and countries like the UK and Canada have implemented frameworks addressing domestic abuse without any form of discrimination on the basis of gender.\n\nIn India, although the judiciary has intervened in many cases to prevent misuse, there is a great need for a thorough review of existing laws to balance protection for the vulnerable and the exploitation of legal provisions. This article explores the complexities in the Subhash Atul case, examines landmark judgments on husbands accused under Sections 498A and 306, analyzes statistical trends, and proposes policy reforms to these challenges.\n\nThe psychological and social implications of false allegations cannot be ignored. Most people accused under these sections suffer social ostracization, financial loss, and disconnection from their families well before a judgment is pronounced.\n\nThe case of Subhash Atul is the epitome of how false accusations at times can bring about devastating effects not just on the person being framed but also on his dear ones. The death signals a grim reminder of systematic changes that will ensure justice from all sides. This article seeks to understand thoroughly the Subhash Atul case, contextualize this within the larger framework of Indian and international legal systems, and try to come up with pragmatic solutions that can help work through issues arising from an abuse of these laws. This article, with careful case studies, judicial pronouncements, and analysis of statistical data, will attempt to throw light upon the various dimensions of this burning issue and plead for reforms that are equitable and just.\n\nThe path of legal reform is long and arduous, but a more balanced and equitable system can be achieved with informed discourse and judicial activism. Shubhash Atul Suicide Case\n\nOverview\n\nThe Shubhash Atul case is a grim reminder of how the misuse of legal provisions can result in devastating consequences. Shubhash, a 34-year-old software engineer, was involved in a contentious marital dispute. According to reports, his wife and her family demanded exorbitant sums of money under the guise of alimony and maintenance. When Shubhash refused to oblige to these demands, they reportedly threatened to file false complaints of dowry harassment under Section 498A IPC. The mental torture and social stigma with such allegations compelled Shubhash to take the extreme step of ending his life. The case throws light on several systemic issues.\n\nPrimarily, it highlights the insufficient safeguards against the misuse of Section 498A. Where the law was initially conceived to protect women from cruelty, its implementation is shoddy, and hence many innocent people get implicated. Second, the case highlights the stigma and mental health issues faced by men who are accused of dowry harassment. Unlike women-centric support systems, men often lack counselling and legal aid, which makes them feel more isolated and hopeless.\n\nThis case is not an isolated incident. Recent times have seen several men go through similar ordeals that could have been well averted with timely intervention and balanced legal approaches leading to suicides. Critics assert that laws like Section 498A, enacted with great intent to safeguard women against abuse, have been wrongly misused and have therefore resulted in undue harassment of innocent people. The case requires a critical look at the implementation of such provisions and more accountability towards the misusers. The role of the media in shaping public perception must not be forgotten.\n\nSensationalised coverage of marital disputes often tends to demonise one party without providing both sides of the story. At first, reports about the case were all about allegations against Shubhash rather than the extortion attempts being made on him. Single-sided stories contribute to this stigma and social ostracisation, forcing the accused to take more extreme measures. It involves legislative reforms, judicial intervention, and public awareness so that these issues are attended to.\n\nA culture of accountability and empathy can be bred in society so that these laws like Section 498A are meant to be followed and not used to harass. This case has sparked debate surrounding the need for gender-neutral law. Advocates have cited that a more comprehensive framework of law would address the reality of modern marital disputes appropriately. Such reforms would provide protection to real victims besides deterring any misuse at the hands of the offender.\n\nStatistics on Section 498A and Related Cases\n\nThus the concept of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code was devised with a high-minded ideal of safeguarding women against cruelty from their husbands or other related members. It has progressed many years, but controversies have sparked how misused it has been and the consequences for the innocents charged. An examination of closer views of statistics shows a comprehensive story of misuse and fault in the system.\n\nIncreasing Number of Cases\n\nWe can see that the cases registered under Section 498A rose sharply between 2010 and 2022. Cases reported rose from around 1,20,000 in the year 2010 to nearly 1,48,000 in 2022. This may also be symptomatic of an increasing awareness regarding legal rights and avenues available to redress among women. Critics suggest that this trend also goes to indicate the increasing misuse of the law when accusations made are often more a vehicle for personal vendettas.\n\nIn stark contrast to the increasing trend, the conviction rate under Section 498A depicts a totally different scenario. In relation to the conviction rate, it has slowly declined to 18 in 2011 and has reached 14.3 in the year 2021. The stark contrast between two numbers raises many questions with regard to the genuineness of many complaints, so the judiciary finds the task of separating wheat from corn very difficult.\n\nBelow are graphical representations of the trends:\n\nHuman Costs: Suicides by Married Men\n\nAnother silent victim of misuse of domestic violence laws is the psychological trauma upon the accused or married men. In an article in 2021, it has been claimed that a substantial number of cases of suicides among married men in India arise out of mere false accusations or disputes concerning marriage. Health reasons stand at 33% as grounds for suicide, followed by a financial crisis in 23%, marital dispute at 14%, and others being 30%. These numbers tell a rather macabre story of the emotional and psychological cost false accusations may inflict.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost menacing though is the trend given out by the data released by the National Crime Records Bureau: The suicide rates amongst married men are higher than those of women who are also married. It is being claimed, it is alleged, falsely no doubt, by wives to put husbands in depression-and-sometimes-suicide-or-tragedy by filing an action under Section 498A.\n\nInternational Comparisons: False Allegations in Domestic Violence Cases\n\nThis problem of false allegations is not limited to India. It has been noticed that this problem of misuse of domestic violence laws is also increasing in the world. According to some research, it has been estimated that around 25% of cases in India are based on false allegations. Rates in other countries are much lower: the USA reports 12%, Canada 8%, and the UK 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese statistics definitely demand a more subdued approach toward the domestic violence laws. Being adequate with the legal protection for the true victims, there must be a mechanism that does not allow frivolous misuse of such laws. Most countries, including both the USA and UK, have offered penal provisions in case of frivolous complaints, and India must follow this precedent for consideration.\n\nSocial and Legal Implications\n\nThe statistics actually tell the story of empowerment as well as exploitation. It would speak well for improving access to justice and increased willingness on the part of the women to oppose the crimes as the numbers of Section 498A cases increased. However, in a wider perspective, dwindling cases of conviction as well as increasing misuse call for reformation.\n\nThe judiciary has not remained a silent spectator either. Several landmark judgements from the Supreme Court of India have highlighted that the scrutiny over Section 498A needs to be very stringent. It has further directed the police not to adopt automatic arrests but to have due diligence while investigating a case.\n\nSome of the landmark judgments include Rajesh Sharma & Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh in 2017. The Supreme Court issued a series of directives in the judgment to restrain misuse of Section 498A. It also shifted the preliminary examination burden of the family welfare committee before taking legal action. This resulted in reduced frivolous litigation and ensuring that actual grievances were dealt with properly.\n\nCharting the way forward\n\nAbusing Section 498A, its provision-cum-sister provisions prove somewhat more onerous. Legal changes needed should be such that they provide necessary protections to genuine victims vis-\u00e0-vis the rights of the accused for their false implication. Massive media campaigns can also come up to educate the world to avoid false complaints through these provisions and thus induce the culture of accountability for its own sake and towards each other.\n\nIn the final analysis, statistics remind us that justice must be blind and that justice should be just, that the law should act as a shield for the weak and not as a tool of exploitation.\n\nCase Laws and Court Decisions\n\nSections 498A (Dowry harassment) and 306 (Abetment of suicide) have been of tremendous utility for the past all these years while dealing with sensitive cases related to marital disputes, dowry harassment, and suicides. The said sections were essentially designed to save women from domestic cruelty and protect the dignity of those suffering under abusive relationships.\n\nHowever, the wrong use or misuse of these sections has given many husbands the wrong implication in the judicial system. A few landmark judicial precedents have given great insight into how these laws should be applied. It has been mainly aimed at protecting innocent people from false accusations. Some of the important cases and judgements are given below that have helped shape the interpretation of Section 498A and Section 306.\n\nArnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014)\n\nThe case of Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar turned out to be a landmark decision when the Supreme Court realised the misuse of Section 498A was gaining momentum. In said case, the wife alleged mental cruelty and dowry harassment against her husband, and the court found that the allegations were vague.\n\nIn this, the High Court came down with the stringent mandates to the police to investigate before filing an arrest in the case against the person under Section 498A. It decried that grossly is misused and frivolous arrest takes place over the innocents under flimsy allegations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has clarified that under Section 498A, the arrest is required only if prima facie evidence of cruelty or harassment is found. It has brought to the fore that such false accusations are not rare and ushered in the importance of ensuring fairness in such cases. This judgement has led to the formation of guidelines to prevent such unwarranted arrests wherein the innocuous husbands and his families were dragged into legal proceedings without substantial grounds.\n\nState of Maharashtra v. Suresh\n\nState of Maharashtra v. Suresh involved a tragic female suicide where her husband had been convicted under Section 306 for abetment of suicide. The family of the wife produced in court that she had undergone mental torture from her husband, and due to it, she committed suicide to such an extent. However, the Bombay High Court held that there was no evidence to prove that direct nexus was between the act of the husband and suicide. Generalised allegations regarding cruelty are not enough for availing Section 306 held by the High Courts of India.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the judgement with the contention that Section 306 should be brought into play only where evidence would show a direct link between the acts of the accused and the decision to commit suicide by the victim. It said that mental cruelty cannot result in suicide and also that it cannot be misconstrued so as to involve a person without there being satisfactory proof. It worked as a judgment that hindered the misuse of the Section 306 in the manner that no person be falsely charged without there having been proof of intentional abetment.\n\nS. R. Batra v. State of U.P. (2005)\n\nThe case of S. R. Batra v. State of U.P. involves the issue of holding the husband liable for mental cruelty under Section 498A on the ground that he let his wife claim to have been subjected to emotional abuse and ill-treatment. The Supreme Court held that mere facts that marital relationships may meet with some kind of difficulty do not amount to mental cruelty under Section 498A. The Court further stated that the nature of mental cruelty should be such as to cause grave emotional distress that leads to serious harm for the victim.\n\nThis judgement has turned out to be a landmark precedent wherein Section 498A could not be invoked for each and every marital dispute, but only when allegations of cruelty were supported by substantial evidence. The Court had made it clear that mere marital discord cannot be considered justification for invoking legal provisions for the reason that emotional issues would always crop up during relations, but these do not have to necessarily amount to criminal behavior. This judgement repeated the proposition that mental cruelty has to be intentional, persistent, and grave so that it can affect the mental health and well-being of the victim.\n\nKey Impact and Judicial Guidelines\n\nThrough these case studies, the courts have consistently sought to balance the protection of victims and the protection of innocent individuals from wrongful accusations. The rulings of the Supreme Court and various High Courts have set important guidelines for proper investigation and evaluation of evidence before charges under Section 498A or Section 306 are brought. They emphasize the need for precautionary measures such as preliminary inquiries, clear evidence, and substantive proof before proceeding with accusations that can deeply affect a person\u2019s life and reputation.\n\nThese judicial precedents have made it clear that false claims under these provisions will not be tolerated, and that the legal process must be fair and equitable. They aim to ensure that the law serves its true purpose \u2014 to protect victims of domestic violence and suicide abetment while also safeguarding against abuse of the legal system by malicious or vindictive individuals.\n\nKey Judicial Rulings Supporting Men in False Accusation Cases\n\nIndian courts have dealt extensively with improper usage of the laws such as Section 498A and 306 IPC. Some landmark rulings have not only provided relief to harassed spouses who were wrongfully accused, but they have also established significant precedents for similar instances in the future. In Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India, decided in 2005, the Supreme Court recognized the misuse of Section 498A and demanded protections against baseless charges.\n\nAnother notable case in which the Supreme Court ordered the cessation of arbitrary arrests under Section 498A was Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014). Before acting, the magistrates and police officers had to thoroughly examine the complaints.\n\nThese guidelines have significantly curtailed the misuse of this provision, although some issues still persist.\n\nAdditionally, the High Courts have rendered a number of decisions in support of wives who are the targets of false claims. The Bombay High Court, for instance, emphasized the necessity for legislative reform in Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand (2010) to address the misuse of Section 498A, highlighting the psychological pain suffered by families falsely accused of dowry harassment without adequate evidence.\n\nThe Supreme Court provided some extra guidelines in Rajesh Sharma v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2017) to help stop Section 498A from being misused. It recommended formation of family welfare committees to make a preliminary analysis of the complaints before the courts admit them. This would also give an impartial assessment to the allegations made, hence the chances of false cases reaching the court would become very low.\n\nIn such cases, the courts strive hard to ensure equal justice for both parties, and more can be done by the judiciary to ensure the rights of all parties concerned are preserved without compromising the law's integrity. More to that, these judgments imply more than individual cases. It sets precedents for later litigations and the judiciary's intent to ensure justice in a manner that would not compromise before social or political pressures. This ensures that the legal system continues to remain a haven for all regardless of gender.\n\nLegal Provisions and Safeguards Against False Claims\n\nIn the context of Shubhansh Atul suicide, false accusations or claims may really misorient the process of judiciary as well as harm people, their respective reputations in society.\n\nIndian law deals with such false accusations at various stages and offers provisions for recourse to law regarding wrongful accusation.\n\nIndian Penal Code provides definite provisions to deal with false claims. When a false charge is made that damages a person's reputation, Section 499, Defamation, may be used. An accused person who intentionally disseminates false material with the goal of damaging another person's reputation may be subject to defamation litigation. The onus then shifts to the accuser to establish the veracity of the claim.\n\nIn addition, Section 182 punishes anybody who willfully harms a public servant by giving them misleading information while knowing it to be inaccurate. This provision can be particularly relevant in cases where false allegations are made during the investigative process, leading to wrongful harassment or legal consequences for the accused. Further, Chapter 191 prescribes punishment on those who invent false material to deceive authorities, which, inter alia, even includes the statement or other documents given as evidence based on a baseless report. In this extreme case of making a false report with an intention to cheat or deceive, it invokes charges under Section 420, IPC, for cheating and dishonestly.\n\nTo protect the rights of individuals from being injured by a false claim, the Indian judicial system protects the right to a fair trial to provide every accused with a chance to defend themselves before the court against any false allegation. This right incorporates the ideas of natural justice; no one may be sentenced based on misleading information. In criminal cases, the burden if upon the prosecution to provide evidence so as to prove that the accuser has committed the crime. A person who makes an accusation must prove the veracity of the claim.\n\nWhere the accusation is false, the prosecution will have to prove that the claim they made is true and believable. There are legal provisions safeguarding against abuse of the law, too. It includes the Anti-Defamation Act 2013, which aimed to ward off malicious prosecution and wrongful lawsuits. That is one of the sources of redress for those reputations harmed or damaged by a false statement made without cause or even with malice.\n\nApart from criminal law, a false accusation also allows the application of civil remedies. Damages that result from a claim, whether in the form of monetary losses or distress caused, may be sought for in cases of defamation. In case the false accusation is made publicly or has an impact on the reputation of a person, a civil remedy is also available to recover the damages.\n\nInternational Approaches towards False Accusation Cases\n\nThe issue of false accusation and the legal remedies available to those wrongfully accused is beyond the borders of India, and various legal systems worldwide offer safeguards and legal recourse to such individuals. In the United States, the legal framework for handling false accusations lies in defamation laws, criminal liability for false reporting, and remedies for wrongful prosecution. False statements intended to damage someone's reputation are protected under the U.S. Defamation Act.\n\nTo successfully launch a defamation action, a claimant must demonstrate that the comment was untrue, made with malicious intent, and caused injury to their reputation. Furthermore, in cases where false allegations are made with the intention of misleading law enforcement or the courts, criminal culpability may apply.\n\nFor instance, persons who file false police reports can be charged under a variety of statutes penalizing false statements to authorities, including laws against false reporting or obstruction of justice. Victims of false allegations may file lawsuits for malicious prosecution in order to obtain remedies in cases of unjust prosecution. Through this action, the person who was falsely accused can seek compensation for the injury that the judicial procedures against them caused.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, legal protections against false accusations are provided under Malicious Falsehood laws. These laws protect people's rights and ensure they can sue over anything stated with malice but that happens to cause detriment to their reputation, or business interest, or damage to property. The primary cause of malicious falsehood usually lies in intentional falsehood and misrepresentation for harm caused regarding someone's reputation and personal or professional status.\n\nIn criminal false statements, a person may be charged with perjury or perverting the course of justice if they have provided false information knowingly or willfully that resulted in wrongful convictions or the obstruction of justice. Malice is also an element of the action on the case for defamation and must be shown to exist, that the false statement was made with an improper motive or with knowledge of its falsity.\n\nIn Australia, in the same way as other common law countries, laws to deal with false allegations include defamation and false reporting. In the Australian context, a person who intends to harm somebody's reputation by making a false statement can be prosecuted civilly for defamation. Likewise, anyone who makes false information to the police or who provides false information to a public officer can be sued for crimes against false reports. The Defamation Act of Australia provides individuals with a legal opportunity to seek redress if they have been wrongly accused of crimes or misconduct, which has caused damage to their reputation. Even where false accusations lead to criminal charges or judicial proceedings, they may also seek compensation for emotional and financial harm occasioned by the wrongful legal actions.\n\nThe approach to false accusations in the international legal systems reflects an overall commitment to ensuring the protection of individuals from unjust claims that can cause immense damage to their reputations, livelihoods, and private lives. Although the actual legal provisions may differ from country to country, the bottom line is that the principle is a universal legal tenet-one that safeguards individuals from malicious or false accusations. Legal frameworks around the world ensure that those perpetuating false claims are given their just due, by civil action for defamation or criminal prosecution for false report or perjury, or reparations for wrongful prosecution.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Shubhash Atul case puts before the world a pressing need to look into the misuse of Sections 498A and 306 IPC. Even though these provisions are the bastions of protection of women's rights, the resultant misuse has been bringing harsh punishments for innocent people. It is a good gesture of the judiciary to come out with guidelines and safeguards but more consistent efforts are needed for a balanced dispensation of justice.\n\nWith a thrust in raising awareness, enhancing judicial training, and pushing for legislative reforms, society would work toward building a fair and just system of laws. Shubhash Atul case, among so many other, serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of misuse of laws and pressing the call for change.\n\nFAQs\n\n1.What does the Section 498A of the IPC lay out?\n\nThe IPC's Section 498A deals with cruelty committed by a husband or other family members against a woman. It includes harassment for dowries, as well as emotional, mental, and physical agony.\n\n2. What is IPC section 306?\n\nSection 306 of the IPC deals with assisting and abetting suicide. It holds someone liable for any action or inaction that leads another person to commit suicide.\n\n3. How are the safeguards against misuse implemented?\n\nBefore making an arrest, a comprehensive investigation must be carried out, under court rulings like those in Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar. The purpose of anticipatory bail and measures for Family Welfare Committees is also to prevent misuse.\n\n4. What are the implications of making deceptive claims?\n\nFalse charges are punished by up to two years in prison under Section 211 IPC. Victims of false claims may also be compensated by the courts.\n\n5. Is there any abuse of the Section 498A of IPC that happening? If yes, then to what degree?\n\nAccording to studies, false or spurious allegations are made in around 27% of Section 498A cases. The low conviction rate highlights the issue of abuse even more.\n\n6. What are the reforms required to curb abuse?\n\nReforms include the introduction of gender-neutral laws, judicial training, and better implementation of existing safeguards to balance the rights of all parties.\n\n7. Are there gender-neutral domestic violence laws in India?\n\nCurrently, Indian laws primarily focus on protecting women. Advocates for reform have called for gender-neutral provisions to ensure justice for all victims of domestic violence."

It is believed this can even occur at the coldest temperatures possible.\n\nAccording to the theory, these spins can stay in constantly changing, interconnected states that behave oddly, similar to those in quantum mechanics. This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

            "article_content": "Charming and ebullient, Ducotterd does not fit the stereotype of a research scientist. She grew up in Wigan, and her accent has survived long years abroad. Like many involved in dementia research, she has a personal connection to the disease. With a dentist father and social worker mother, Ducotterd initially planned to become a vet, but when she didn\u2019t get into veterinary school she studied biology at the University of Edinburgh instead. Around the same time, her grandmother\u2019s mental state began to decline.\n\n\u201cI was watching my granny start to buy food for people who didn\u2019t live with her anymore and forget big details about her life,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving that personal connection to the story made me so motivated by what I was doing in the lab. I thought: this is exactly what I want to do. Make medicines.\u201d She went on to a PhD at Newcastle. In the face of diminished neuroscience investment in the UK, she moved to Japan for a postdoctoral position studying Parkinson\u2019s disease. Later she worked at GSK in China and later at Eisai Pharmaceuticals in the USA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazingly global experience of drug discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be innovative you have to think differently. And the more different ways of thinking you have in your group, the more you\u2019re going to challenge each other.\u201d\n\nShe ended up staying in America for nine years, before moving back to the UK at the end of 2022, by which time she had acquired a husband and a daughter. While she had been away, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK had taken the lead in establishing new Drug Discovery Institutes at Oxford, Cambridge and in London, enabling them to function like biotech startups in a university setting, adding free-market pep to academic excellence.\n\nSince Ducotterd was an undergraduate, there has been revolutionary progress in neurodegenerative diseases, mostly driven by advances in computing.\n\n\u201cI went to university just after they\u2019d cloned Dolly the sheep,\u201d she says. \u201cThe molecular technologies have transformed the field \u2013 being able to sequence genomes in minutes rather than years; methods that let us do more rapid analysis of big data; artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe success of lecanemab, a drug that has been shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s progression by 30 per cent in early-stage patients (but which has yet to be approved on the NHS) has also energised the field by showing that progress is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never seen a trial that has shown we can slow the disease at all. It gives massive amounts of hope and investment because everyone now knows it is possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects she is particularly excited about involves leveraging human genetics to mimic natural resilience against dementia. \u201cThere is a really interesting study in a group in Holland where they\u2019re looking at people who live healthily into their hundreds cognitively,\u201d she says."

            "article_content": "We have discovered thousands of exoplanets in the last few decades, while the number of planets in the Solar System has remained at eight \u2013 but our discovery of more might not yet be over.\n\nA team of researchers say they have found the \"strongest statistical evidence yet that Planet 9 is really out there\", after studying a population of distant, unstable objects that cross Neptune's orbit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2015, two astronomers from Caltech presented evidence that six objects past the orbit of Neptune were bunched together in a way that suggested they were being \"herded\" by something with a large gravitational pull.\n\nDespite suggestions the planet could be due to a statistical anomaly and selection bias, the team believes the objects could be moving due to the influence of a large object beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\nIn a recent paper, the team looked at long-period objects that crossed the path of Neptune's orbit, finding that their closest point of orbit to the sun was around 15-30 astronomical units (AU), with one AU being the distance between the sun and the Earth.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCarrying out simulations to try and discover what best explains the orbits of these objects, the team found that a model that includes a massive planet beyond the region of Neptune explained the steady state of these objects much better than in simulations where planet 9 was not included.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nThough this is intriguing, the analysis does not narrow down where to look for such a planet.\n\nIt is also not the only possible explanation for the unusual orbits of trans-Neptunian objects. Another team believes it could be down to a close encounter, where a star passed by our own Sun several billion years ago in our history.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe team ran 3,000 simulations of scenarios where stars of various masses passed by our own at different distances. Though we have only discovered an estimated 1-10 percent of TNOs, making further observations and study of their orbits necessary for a full explanation, the researchers found that a close flyby of a slightly smaller star than our own could produce a Solar System that looks remarkably similar to how it looks today.\n\n\"The best match for today's outer Solar System that we found with our simulations is a star that was slightly lighter than our Sun \u2013 about 0.8 solar masses,\u201d Amith Govind, co-author of the \u201cclose encounter\u201d hypothesis paper, explained in a statement. \"This star flew past our sun at a distance of around 16.5 billion kilometres [10.3 billion miles]. That's about 110 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, a little less than four times the distance of the outermost planet Neptune.\u201d\n\nThankfully, we might not have too long to wait for either hypothesis to be further tested.\n\n\"Excitingly, the dynamics described here, along with all other lines of evidence for Planet 9, will soon face a rigorous test with the operational commencement of the Vera Rubin Observatory,\" the authors of the Planet Nine paper concluded. \"This upcoming phase of exploration promises to provide critical insights into the mysteries of our solar system\u2019s outer reaches.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d study is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and the \u201cclose encounter\u201d study in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in April 2024."

            "article_content": "Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) stock has likely impressed its shareholders with a nearly 60% gain over the last year. Such gains might even make investors forget that its current price is still 35% below the stock's peak in November 2021.\n\nNonetheless, a greater focus on its software business and the continuing growth of e-commerce have got the company back on track. Hence, the stock could continue to benefit investors amid its recovery.\n\nThe state of Shopify's stock\n\nThroughout its history, Shopify has stood out among e-commerce platforms. Its ability for no-code site development and the flexibility to customize websites drew entrepreneurs to Shopify, and the company's emphasis on website speeds reduced the possibility that website issues would hamper sales for its customers.\n\nMoreover, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 19% for the e-commerce industry through 2030. This should mean more merchants turn to Shopify as more retail sales businesses move online.\n\nShopify has further emphasized its competitive advantage with ancillary services such as managing payments, monitoring inventory, or supporting email marketing campaigns. This part of the business, called merchant services, accounts for the majority of Shopify's revenue.\n\nHowever, an effort to expand merchant services into logistics brought about high expenses and ongoing losses, which contributed to a massive stock price decline in 2022. That led to Shopify reversing course and selling that business. After selling the logistics enterprise and suffering through some impairment charges, Shopify has again become profitable and stock price growth has returned.\n\nShopify's financials\n\nAdmittedly, Shopify has not grown as fast as it did before or during the pandemic when revenue growth either closely matched or, at times, exceeded the 50% level. Furthermore, Shopify increased the prices for its services in 2023, so its not clear how that affected customer churn.\n\nNonetheless, the company's revenue for the first nine months of 2024 of $6.1 billion increased 23% yearly. This closely matches the 25% growth forecast for this year and the 22% predicted in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Shopify has reduced its operating expenses slightly in 2024. Investors might also remember that the $1.3 billion impairment from the sale of the logistics business in 2023 led to losses in that year despite a $1 billion gain from its equity investments. Amid those developments, its $726 million net income for the first three quarters of 2024 represents a vast improvement from the $525 million loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nStory Continues"

Both sides scored 15 points in the second quarter, then SHU outscored Le Moyne 13-11 in both the third and fourth frames to improve its record to 8-2.\n\nLe Moyne freshman guard Eli Clark (Oakhurst, N.J./Ocean Township) led Le Moyne with a season-high 15 points with three three-point field goals to go along with five rebounds and three assists.\n\nJunior guard Sierra Linnin (Valley Cottage, N.Y./Albertus Magnus) also knocked down three threes to finish the contest with nine points, while graduate forward Haedyn Roberts (Holland Patent, N.Y./Holland Patent) added seven points and a game-high nine rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe did a lot of the things from the second quarter on that we really preached. Some of that was switching to the zone defensively, I think a lot of that was the energy that everyone kept bringing,\u201d said Le Moyne coach Nick DiPillo, who served on the coaching staff at Seton Hall from 2014-19. \u201cThere were a lot of positives, for us it starts so much with the energy and the belief that we can do things and make those extended runs. I said to the team, where we were a week ago, where we were questioning the consistency of our effort, to come back the way we did today, I was really proud of our kids.\u201d\n\nFour Pirates scored in double figures during the team\u2019s seventh home win of the campaign, led by freshman guard Jada Eads who drained four threes to register a season-high 19 points with a season-high five assists.\n\nSophomore guard Savannah Catalon provided 13 points, four rebounds, three assists and three steals for the Pirates, graduate forward Yaya Lops registered 12 points and six rebounds, and graduate forward Faith Masonius added 10 points, three rebounds and three assists.\n\nThe Pirates shot 12-for-34 from three-point range and tallied 19 assists on their 26 made field goals.\n\nEach team took just five free throws during the contest, which was the first-ever meeting between the two programs.\n\nSHU, which entered the contest with the 17th best turnover margin among all Division I teams, forced the Dolphins into 24 turnovers and committed 10.\n\nFive different players knocked down a three for Seton Hall during the first quarter as the Pirates jumped out to an early lead.\n\nLe Moyne shot just 2-for-15 from the field in the first quarter, including 0-for-7 from three-point range, but built some momentum in the second quarter, shooting 6-for-12 from the field, including 3-for-5 from three.\n\nClark scored nine points in the second frame with three threes, including back-to-back triples to begin the quarter and one just before the halftime buzzer which cut Le Moyne\u2019s deficit to 23.\n\nLe Moyne went on a 9-0 run between the 5:00 and 2:52 marks of the third quarter with a three from Roberts and two from Linnin to make it 46-30 in favor of the Pirates.\n\nCatalon ended the run with two free throws with two minutes remaining, then converted a three from the left wing during the next possession to extend the Pirates\u2019 lead back to 21.\n\nSeton Hall ended the third on a 9-0 run, then scored the first four points of the fourth with a layup from Lops and a jumper from Eads.\n\nLinnin ended the run with another three at the 7:12 mark.\n\nLe Moyne (0-10) will return to action next Saturday when they host Colgate University for a noon matchup at Ted Grant Court."

            "article_content": "2024 was a year of mixed successes for the top smartphone industry players, but the devices we got were some of the best we\u2019ve ever seen. There were notable comebacks, a continued and welcome trend of maturation in the foldable space, a distinctly less welcome trend of promises of future AI features that didn\u2019t really live up to the hype, and a certain August launch that threw the Android Authority\u2018s usual content plans for a loop (thanks for that, Google!).\n\nThrough it all, we delivered more exclusive reports and deep dives than we\u2019ve ever shared in any calendar year, and we\u2019re not stopping any time soon. But now isn\u2019t the time to look forward, it\u2019s time to cast an eye back as we crown our Editor\u2019s Choice smartphone of the year 2024. Read on for our top five!\n\nBest foldable? Best camera phone? Best tablet? All this and more in our best tech of 2024 awards.\n\nCheck out the result of our Reader's Choice phone of the year award!\n\nHow we chose our winner\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nBefore we get to our top five, here\u2019s how we chose them. Our Editor\u2019s Choice award for smartphone of the year isn\u2019t a mantle we bestow lightly. The overall winner and the runners-up are all phones that go beyond success on a spec sheet.\n\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve reviewed over 40 phones. That process included extensive testing in performance, battery, and charging benchmarks, as well as subjective analysis of photography, hardware design, software smarts, update policies, and much much more. Our expert product testers spend countless hours digging into what makes these devices tick, and while everyone has their own favorites and preferences, when it comes to picking the year\u2019s best, we bring all of our senior editors and product testers together and reflect on our highest-reviewed phones as a collective of experts.\n\nIn 2024, we reviewed over 40 phones. Our expert product testers spend countless hours digging into what makes these devices tick.\n\nThe class of 2024 was made up of 20 phones from 12 brands from all over the globe. From there, each member of the jury assigned votes to their top five picks, ranked from fifth to first. Fifth place earned a single point, fourth took two points, and so on, up to a maximum of five points for the top pick. The phone that received the most points took home the grand prize.\n\nWith all the votes tallied, our winner took our most prestigious annual award in an absolute landslide\u2026\n\nAndroid Authority\u2018s Editor\u2019s Choice phone of the year 2024 Ryan Haines / Android Authority Four years at the top for a Pixel, but we\u2019ve never seen such a dominant win as this. With just shy of double the amount of votes as our runner-up, the Google Pixel 9 Pro takes the crown. With the Pro-tier Pixel winning in 2022 and 2023, this isn\u2019t a huge surprise \u2014 we\u2019re obviously big Pixel fans here. However, what really stands out this year is the fact the Pixel 9 Pro managed such a massive points gap despite the vote being split for the first time ever not between two Pixel flagships, but three. Yet, as much as we still loved the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL (mild spoiler for later in this list), the newly shrunken Pixel 9 Pro was the one that left the biggest impression. While it wasn\u2019t exactly a return to the Pixel 5-style small phone form factor, Google learned all the best lessons from the iPhone Pro range and delivered a reasonably-sized flagship (with a hint of iPhone inspiration to the overall design), while still managing to squeeze in all the best of the series \u2014 Gemini, Tensor, the photography chops, the most extensive software support guarantee in the business, and more. So, congrats to Google and the Pixel 9 Pro, our Editor\u2019s Choice smartphone of the year winner for 2024, and a phone that we told you was coming, but still managed to surprise us when it did. Google Pixel 9 Pro Google Pixel 9 Pro Impressive AI-powered features \u2022 Excellent build quality \u2022 Flexible, capable cameras \u2022 Reliable update commitment MSRP: $999.00 All Pro, in a compact package. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the Pixel device many have been begging for for a long time: Google's very best smartphone hardware and software features, in a more compact form factor. With identical dimensions to the regular Pixel 9, it retains the same great specs as the much larger XL model, plus 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of internal storage, and the Tensor G4 chipset. See price at Amazon See price at Google Store See price at Best Buy\n\nRunner-up If you can bet on one thing to deliver quality across the board every year, it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S Ultra series. Long gone are the days when we see anything particularly new from Android\u2019s de facto ultra-flagship, but you can\u2019t knock it for consistency. The Galaxy S24 Ultra may have dropped half a star from its perfect-scoring predecessor in our review as a result of a $100 price hike that didn\u2019t quite feel earned, and some persistent camera motion woes, but the sheer brilliance across the board was undeniable. Additions like the then-bleeding-edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset and the brand-new titanium frame joined the usual hallmarks of excellence we expect from Samsung\u2019s top dog. There was also the debut of Galaxy AI, which, while not quite as mature as Google\u2019s AI offerings, has grown over time to add real value to the Galaxy experience. It didn\u2019t come close to snatching the top spot, but it did comfortably secure the runner-up position. With Samsung\u2019s iron grip on the smartphone industry starting to slip a little, can the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra do one better in 2025? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Powerful, flexible cameras \u2022 Excellent update commitment \u2022 Brilliant flat display MSRP: $1,299.99 The best of the best in the S24 series Samsung's true flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra offers the very best specs and features from any Galaxy phone to date. Ai and camera functions are the name of the game, with a 200MP primary camera, 50MP 5x telephoto, 10MP 3x telephoto, and 12MP ultrawide shooters. Smaller display bezels, 2,600 nit display, 5,000 mAh battery, an advanced cooling vapor chamber, up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage, and 12GB of RAM make for a powerful mobile computing system. The new ProVisual Engine offers AI-powered camera tools for photo and video capture.

Yes, we\u2019re Android Authority, but you can\u2019t talk with any actual authority about the devices and platform we dedicate ourselves to without testing out and intimately knowing what the competition is up to. And yep, it turns out that the iPhone 16 Pro is a pretty excellent phone. While some of its shine was dampened by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence (and its fairly underwhelming current state), the iPhone 16 Pro nevertheless stood out, much like the Pixel 9 Pro, as another regular-sized flagship phone that refused to compromise. iOS 18 is better (and more Android-y!) than ever, the Action Button and overall design blueprint are being copied by Android brands for a reason, and the reduced real estate didn\u2019t lead to a loss of power under the hood. It didn\u2019t do enough to convince many of us on the team that a permanent switch would be worth it (myself included \u2014 no thank you), but the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s bronze medal is a reminder of how capable Android\u2019s biggest rival continues to be. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Apple iPhone 16 Pro Excellent hardware \u2022 Flexible cameras \u2022 Solid software support MSRP: $999.00 The best of the iPhone 16 series, in a compact form factor. The iPhone 16 Pro offers a sleek 6.3-inch display with ultra-slim bezels for a refined, modern design. It features an upgraded 48MP ultrawide camera, 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, and a new touch-sensitive shutter button for a DSLR-like photography experience. Powered by a faster chip optimized for AI, the iPhone 16 Pro delivers top-tier performance in striking colors like gold titanium. See price at Amazon See price at Apple\n\nFourth place 2024 was a banner year for the Google Pixel line, with significant gains in market share and increasing awareness among smartphone users starting to prove that the Big G can finally become a big player in the hardware sector, too. The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was the pinnacle of that promise \u2014 the Pixel series\u2019 best specs in the biggest possible package. As a lover of super-sized phones, this was my personal top pick, and while the Pixel 9 Pro romped home with the overall victory, the XL-ent larger model can be proud of its fourth place finish. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Google Pixel 9 Pro XL The best specs in the Pixel 9 series \u2022 Gorgeous display \u2022 Seven years of software updates MSRP: $1,099.00 Pure XL-ence. Google reserves its best hardware for the largest device in the line. The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a 6.8-inch display, the biggest battery we've ever seen in a Pixel phone, and 37W wired charging. Otherwise, the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL share almost all other hardware and software features, giving users the option between display sizes with top hardware. See price at Amazon See price at Google Store - See price at Best Buy\n\nFifth place Welcome back, OnePlus! Okay, that\u2019s not exactly fair. The OnePlus Open deservedly took the runner-up spot in 2023, but there was no OnePlus foldable challenger in 2024 (side note: our top-ranked foldable was the Motorola Razr (2024), which came in joint sixth alongside the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE). But the OnePlus 12 becomes the first slab-style phone from the Android stalwart to crack the top five in our end-of-year Editor\u2019s Choice list since the OnePlus 7T way back in 2019. A Pro-grade phone without Pro in the name, the OnePlus 12 summoned some of that old-school flagship killer spirit, offering ridiculous power and rapid charging while undercutting many of its contemporaries on price. OnePlus 12 OnePlus 12 Bright, sharp display \u2022 Blistering-fast charging \u2022 Approachable price MSRP: $799.00 The flagship killer returns. The OnePlus 12 is an important update for the brand that never settles. The phone offers the latest and best technology, including a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, 50W wireless and 80W wired charging, next-gen Hasselblad cameras, and more.

We\u2019re also already gearing up to bring you the best possible coverage from CES 2025 in January, while also continuing to think of new and exciting ways to bring you the best analysis, opinions, and reporting at Android Authority throughout 2025 and beyond.\n\nUntil then, from our families to yours, we hope you all have a happy holidays!\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "Altman called the change in the relationship \u201ctremendously sad.\u201d He continued:\n\nI grew up with Elon as like a mega hero. I thought what Elon was doing was absolutely incredible for the world, and I\u2019m still, of course, I mean, I have different feelings about him now, but I\u2019m still glad he exists. I mean that genuinely. Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously. And grateful is the wrong kind of word. But I\u2019m like thankful. You know, we started OpenAI together, and then at some point he totally lost faith in OpenAI and decided to go his own way. And that\u2019s fine, too. But I think of Elon as a builder and someone who \u2014 a known thing about Elon is that he really cares about being \u2018the guy.\u2019 But I think of him as someone who, if he\u2019s not, that just competes in the market and in the technology, and whatever else. And doesn\u2019t resort to lawfare. And, you know, whatever the stated complaint is, what I believe is he\u2019s a competitor and we\u2019re doing well. And that\u2019s sad to see.\n\nAltman said of Musk\u2019s close relationship with Trump:\n\nI may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon has it to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses. And I don\u2019t think people would tolerate that. I don\u2019t think Elon would do it.\n\nOn OpenAI\u2019s relationship with Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI\u2019s largest investor, has put more than $13 billion into the company and has an exclusive license to its raw technologies. Altman once called the relationship \u201cthe best bromance in tech,\u201d but The Times and others have reported that the partnership has become strained as OpenAI seeks more and cheaper access to computing power and Microsoft has made moves to diversify its access to A.I. technology. OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion this year because of the steep costs of developing A.I.\n\nAt the DealBook Summit, Altman said of the relationship with Microsoft, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re disentangling. I will not pretend that there are no misalignments or challenges.\u201d He added:\n\nWe need lots of compute, more than we projected. And that has just been an unusual thing in the history of business, to scale that quickly. And there\u2019s been tension on that.\n\nSome of OpenAI\u2019s own products compete with those of partners that depend on its technologies. On whether that presents a conflict of interest, Altman said:\n\nWe have a big platform business. We have a big first party business. Many other companies manage both of those things. And we have things that we\u2019re really good at. Microsoft has things they\u2019re really good at. Again, there\u2019s not no tension, but on the whole, our incentives are pretty aligned.\n\nOn whether making progress in A.I. development was becoming more expensive and slower, as some experts have suggested, he doubled down on a message he\u2019d previously posted on social media: \u201cThere is no wall.\u201d Andrew asked the same question of Sundar Pichai, the Google C.E.O., which we\u2019ll recap in tomorrow\u2019s newsletter.\n\nOn A.G.I. and A.I. safety\n\nAltman has a business interest in suggesting that A.G.I. is near: When OpenAI decides that it has reached the milestone, Microsoft\u2019s exclusive license to use OpenAI\u2019s raw A.I. technologies ends. That would be a big bargaining chip in its negotiations with Microsoft. At the DealBook Summit, Altman suggested that A.G.I. was closer than most people expect, but he downplayed safety concerns, some of which he has raised himself or have come from his own former employees:\n\nA lot of the safety concerns that we and others expressed actually don\u2019t come at the A.G.I. moment. It\u2019s like, A.G.I. can get built, the world goes on mostly the same way. The economy moves faster, things grow faster.\n\nAltman said that he did expect there would be quick disruption of jobs in the relatively near term, but that the major upheaval would come with what he called \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d"

File image/Reuters\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Gaza killed 17 people on Saturday (December 14), including seven at a United Nations-run school sheltering displaced civilians, Gaza\u2019s civil defense agency said.\n\nMahmud Bassal, a spokesman for the agency, said Israeli warplanes targeted the Al-Majida Wasila school west of Gaza City, killing seven people, including women and children, and wounding at least 10 others. The school, operated by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, had been converted into a shelter for those fleeing the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the reports.\n\nTargeted attacks on UN facilities?\n\nSince the escalation of conflict on October 7, 2023, Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip have resulted in significant damage to United Nations (UN) facilities, particularly those operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)\n\nBetween October 7, 2023, and March 15, 2024, UNRWA documented 349 incidents impacting its premises and the internally displaced persons (IDPs) sheltering within them.\n\nThese incidents resulted in the deaths of at least 408 individuals. Additionally, as of September 6, 2024, approximately 161 UNRWA school buildings\u2014representing 86.1% of all such facilities in Gaza\u2014had suffered direct hits or damage.\n\nThe United Nations and various human rights organisations have condemned attacks on UN facilities, stressing their protected status under international law.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have stated that their operations target militant infrastructure and personnel, asserting that groups like Hamas use civilian areas, including UN facilities, for military purposes.\n\nWar death toll mounts\n\nThe conflict in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a large-scale offensive on Gaza, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed at least 44,930 people, the majority of them civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United Nations has deemed the casualty figures provided by Gaza\u2019s health ministry reliable, underscoring the devastating toll the conflict has taken on the densely populated territory.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

            "article_content": "A wide range of commodity groups demanded Saturday that lawmakers oppose a stopgap spending bill unless it includes economic assistance for farmers.\n\nThe demands raise the stakes for congressional leaders who have been unable to reach agreement on an economic package. House GOP leaders have so far refused to give in to Democratic demands that the legislation also roll Inflation Reduction Act conservation funding into the farm bill baseline.\n\nAfter leaders of the House and Senate Ag committees announced Saturday morning that a stalemate had been reached on the aid package, one farm group after another issued statements in opposition to passing a continuing resolution to keep the government funded unless it includes the market relief for row crop producers.\n\nLawmakers also intended to include in the CR a new one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill.\n\nBut passing the legislation without the economic assistance \u201cwould fall far short of what is needed to ensure the survival of thousands of producers across the country,\u201d said Chuck Conner, president and CEO of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n\n\u201cWe urge congressional leaders to rethink this approach, negotiate in good faith, and keep their promises to farmers. Without such action, NCFC can not support such a bill and would urge a \u2018no\u2019 vote on the measure.\u201d\n\nUSA Rice said in a statement that it \u201cadamantly opposes any extension of the 2018 farm bill or end-of-year federal government spending package that excludes meaningful economic assistance for rice farmers.\u201d\n\nJoe Nicosia, chairman of the National Cotton Council, said, \u201cWe urge Congressional leadership to return to the negotiating table to find a path forward on economic assistance. If not, we will vigorously oppose a supplemental spending package that does not provide the immediate support our producers need,\u201d\n\nCotton farmers are seeing the largest projected decline in receipts among major row crops this year at 26.9%, while sales of corn are estimated to drop 20.8%, and soybean revenue is projected to decline 12.3%, according to USDA\u2019s latest farm income forecast.\n\nWheat receipts are estimated to be down 7%, while receipts on rice are expected to decline 4.5%.\n\nTotal cash receipts for row crops are projected to fall 9.2%.\n\nKenneth Hartman Jr., president of the National Corn Growers Association, said, \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that congressional leadership appears to be at an impasse over crucial economic assistance for farmers in an end-of-the-year legislative package. \u2026 While these developments are disheartening, we call on Congress to resume negotiations and pass legislation that includes economic assistance while there is still time.\u201d\n\nCaleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, said any legislation \u201dthat does not include both economic and disaster assistance for our farmers who have suffered significantly from unforgiving market conditions, disastrous weather phenomena and for many, a combination of both, simply does not meet the mark for what agriculture and specifically, our soy growers, need.\n\n\u201cWe will oppose any supplemental spending package that does not provide meaningful assistance to farmers who need help now to stay afloat in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nSpecialty crops have been one of the brighter spots in the farm economy, but the International Fresh Produce Association joined other ag groups in calling on Congress to get a deal done on farm aid.\n\nIFPA said lawmakers should \u201creengage to negotiate a Farm Bill extension that not only maintains current USDA programs but also robustly funds the vital economic relief and overdue natural disaster aid that the specialty crop producers desperately need.\"\n\nRevenue for vegetable and melon cash are expected to increase by 6.7%, while sales for fruits and nuts are expected to fall by 2.1%, according to USDA."

            "article_content": "These high-quality stocks are well positioned to surge in 2025.\n\nThe U.S. stock market posted a stellar performance in 2024, with the benchmark S&P 500 index reaching an all-time high closing value of 6,090.27 on Dec. 6.\n\nBut things may turn even better in 2025. According to Charles Schwab, based on 14 interest rate cycles since 1929, the S&P 500 index has posted positive returns 12 months from the first rate cut in the cycle 86% of the time. The benchmark index posted negative returns after rate cuts in 2001 and 2007, attributed mainly to the recessionary environment.\n\nIn September 2024, the Federal Reserve commenced the ongoing rate cut cycle by reducing benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points. Subsequently, since the current economic environment does not appear recessionary, it may be prudent to expect the index to continue growing till September 2025. Many analysts seem to agree with this projection. UBS expects the S&P 500 to reach 6,400, while Oppenheimer Asset Management's chief investment strategist, John Stoltzfus, expects the index to reach 7,100 in 2025.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it makes sense for retail investors to pick up small positions in high-quality stock riding secular tailwinds. Here's why these two companies picks fit the bill.\n\n1. Oracle\n\nWhen investing in database software and cloud services stocks, Oracle (ORCL -1.10%) is an obvious choice. The company's second-quarter fiscal 2025 top- and bottom-line performance missed consensus estimates by a slight margin (for the period ended Nov. 30). Despite this, the company's prominent role in the ongoing AI revolution and its strength in traditional databases make it a worthwhile pick in December 2024.\n\nOracle's cloud services and licensing support revenue accounts for almost 77% of the company's total revenue. The cloud business is expected to rake in $25 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025. Oracle's prominence in providing artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized data center infrastructure is the main factor fueling the growth of its cloud business. The company's Oracle cloud infrastructure is used by major AI companies such as Nvidia, Meta Platforms, xAI, OpenAI, and Cohere to train their most important generative AI models.\n\nOracle is also focused on further improving the performance of its cloud infrastructure and recently released the largest and fastest supercomputer in the world, which uses up to 65,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs. This performance advantage has made Oracle cloud infrastructure faster and cheaper than many competing infrastructure clouds, helping it win large AI training workloads. The company's GPU usage also jumped by a stunning 336% year over year in the second quarter.\n\nOracle differentiates itself from many other cloud infrastructure players with its unique cloud architecture. The company has opted for a modular design approach where only six standardized data racks are needed to build a cloud region that provides all services to clients. The company can easily scale the data center infrastructure from 50 kilowatts to 1.6 gigawatts in line with the demand cheaply and efficiently. The standardization in racks and services has also helped Oracle effectively deploy automation tools in its cloud infrastructure.\n\nOracle has also established a broad geographical footprint with 98 cloud regions. The company has entered into multi-cloud agreements with Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Amazon's AWS, which further allows customers high flexibility to deploy their systems in the cloud.\n\nAdmittedly, Oracle does not seem to be the hottest stock on Wall Street. However, the company recently was trading at just 8.43 times trailing-12-month sales -- better than the software industry median price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10.4. As multiples expand in line with robust growth, Oracle may see significant share price gains in the coming months.\n\n2. MongoDB\n\nThe second database specialist worth investing in is MongoDB (MDB -7.42%). Although the company managed to handily beat consensus revenue and earnings estimates in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, shares have tanked on unexpected news of longtime CFO and Chief Operating Officer Michael Gordon leaving at the end of January 2025. The subsequent price correction has presented an excellent entry opportunity for retail investors.\n\nMongoDB added nearly 1,900 new customers sequentially and ended the third quarter (ended Oct. 31) with a total customer count of more than 52,600. Furthermore, the company catered to 2,314 high-value customers (those generating at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue) in the third quarter, up from 1,972 customers in the same quarter of the prior year.\n\nAtlas, a cloud-native and integrated suite of database tools and services, accounts for nearly 68% of MongoDB's total revenue. The cloud platform's revenue grew 26% year over year in the third quarter, driven by robust adoption by enterprises for running mission-critical projects. Atlas catered to more than 51,100 customers at the end of the third quarter, up from over 44,900 in the same quarter of the prior year.\n\nMongoDB is focusing on reallocating some of its go-to-market resources from mid-market to large enterprise channels. While the funds' reallocation from the mid-market segment to the enterprise channel is expected to reduce the pace of direct sales customer growth in the short run, it should drive higher revenue growth in the long run.\n\nMongoDB uses AI tools and professional services to modernize customers' legacy applications. Since many of these applications are based on relational databases, the company also deploys a relational migrator to migrate them to MongoDB's platform (suitable for documents and other complex data structures). This modernization reduces cost, time, and risk of data loss or corruption. Hence, MongoDB sees a solid long-term growth opportunity in the legacy application modernization market.\n\nFinally, MongoDB is also poised to benefit from enterprises increasingly focusing on AI-powered applications, which mostly require querying complex and rich datasets. The company says its unified platform approach (combining source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data) is superior to using multiple complex databases.\n\nConsidering its several growth tailwinds and strong financials, MongoDB seems a compelling buy now."

            "article_content": "If you've ever wondered what the world looks like from a polar bear's perspective, this incredible footage can give you a good insight.\n\nScientists said they were left 'amazed' after examining the 115 hours of video they captured while strapping cameras to the animals as they roamed around Canada.\n\nAs well as giving us a deeper understanding of what it's like to move around on all fours, the clips also highlighted how clever these creatures really are.\n\nThe thing is, this species have been hit hard by the effects of climate change over the last few years and are now considered as 'vulnerable' by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group.\n\nAdvert\n\nVast amounts of sea ice are melting due to global warming, which poses quite the problem to polar bears, as they use the frozen sheets as stepping stones to score some lunch.\n\nDue to the fact the animals' primary food source is seals, the lack of sea ice really throws a spanner in the works when it comes to their survival.\n\nAccording to the WWF, polar bears also use sea ice to 'rest, breed, and store energy for the summer and autumn, when food can be scarce'.\n\nIt's now melting earlier in the spring and forming later in the autumn in the bears' southern range, the organisation warned, in spots such as Hudson Bay and James Bay in Canada.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd the impact of this is worrying, to say the least.\n\nThe incredible footage gave us an insight into the life of a polar bear from their perspective (USGS/Washington State University)\n\n\"For every week earlier that the ice breaks up in Hudson Bay, bears come ashore roughly 22 pounds lighter and in poorer condition,\" the WWF said.\n\nPolar bears are being forced to spend more time on land as a result of the melting sea ice, but food high in calories is hard to come by for the animals - hence their dramatic weight loss.\n\nAdvert\n\nSo, to get to the bottom of how the polar bears were dealing with this life-and-death dilemma, scientists strapped cameras to 20 of them who were wandering around Hudson Bay.\n\nThe team scoured through more than 100 hours of footage captured over a three-year period, which showed the creatures eating, sleeping, hunting and having fun.\n\nThey were seen feeding on bird carcasses, chowing down on berries and grass, feasting on marine animals, as well as play-fighting with each other in the water and chewing on antlers.\n\nAnthony Pagano, wildlife biologist at the US Geological Survey (USGS) and leader of the study, previously told Vox about the findings: \"We were amazed by the video footage.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"The video footage really highlighted how intelligent these animals are by using different behaviour strategies to survive their time on land while without access to their primary prey.\"\n\nBefore the study, scientists presumed that polar bears might be coping with prolonged periods on land by resting to save energy, or filling up on other prey such as plants and seabirds.\n\nThe animals are being forced to forage for food on land due to the melting sea ice (OLIVIER MORIN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe footage and other data collected by boffins - such as the amount of energy burned and measurements of movement - suggests that the predators actually did both, with some heading out in search for food and others opting to have a little lie down instead.\n\nAdvert\n\nDespite the split in approaches among the polar bears, sadly neither was successful - and all but one of the 20 subjects lost weight.\n\nAlarmingly, one even lost nearly 80 pounds.\n\nScientists also found that polar bears were taking longer swims in search of food, which is 'unexpected for this time of year', according to polar expert at the University of Alberta Andrew Derocher.\n\nDerocher further explained: \"These are possibly acts of desperation. Hungry and skinny bears take more risks than fat bears.\"\n\nEssentially, eating berries and smaller prey isn't enough to tide a polar bear over.\n\n\"This study really brings home the message that there\u2019s no salvation from terrestrial feeding to help polar bears through the ice-free period,\" Derocher added.\n\nThe polar bear population in this area is estimated to have fallen 30 percent since 1987, and this study appears to prove that global warming will continue to make it even harder for the species to survive."

            "article_content": "While left-wing governments hold power across most of Latin America, ultraright social forces remain a threat. In Bolivia, powerful left-indigenous social movements have managed to keep an insurgent right wing at bay since the devastating coup of 2019. But a growing political crisis for the plurinational state highlights the urgent need to maintain unity in the face of an ever-powerful right. The coup of 2019 was a catastrophic attack on Bolivian democracy. It saw the rapid ascent of ultraright conservatives from the lowland city of Santa Cruz \u2014 the axis of regional-class antagonism to the then President Evo Morales and his party, the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS \u2014 directed by businessman Luis Fernando Camacho, the leader of the business group Comit\u00e9 Pro Santa Cruz and former leader of the Nazi youth group Uni\u00f3n Juvenil Cruce\u00f1ista (UJC). The coup unfolded when middle-class protesters took to the streets to dispute Evo\u2019s victory in that year\u2019s elections. As the protests escalated, the head of the armed forces \u201csuggested\u201d Morales resign, forcing him into exile in Mexico. In the resulting power vacuum, the right-wing evangelical Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez seized the presidency, and as social movements resisted, she presided over two mass killings \u2014 of nine protesters in Sacaba, Cochabamba, and of ten protesters blockading the Senkata gas plant in El Alto who were shot dead by a military exempted from criminal liability by a sudden presidential decree. \u00c1\u00f1ez swiftly reestablished diplomatic ties with the United States and Israel, with whom Morales had had strained relations. Clutching a giant Bible, \u00c1\u00f1ez declared, \u201cThe Bible has returned to the government,\u201d as she paraded through the government headquarters. Soldiers were filmed burning the Wiphala flag, representing highland indigenous peoples, signifying a new turn against the decolonizing policies of the state. A frenzied crackdown on leftists ensued as the coup government issued arrest warrants against journalists and MAS-supporting politicians. A year later, Bolivia\u2019s left-wing party, the MAS, staged a stunning political comeback. It came after campesinos, indigenous groups, and the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), Bolivia\u2019s major trade union federation, brought the country to a standstill by forming roadblocks to demand that the dictatorship government hold elections. Faced with the insurgent popular forces, the government buckled. In the elections that followed, the MAS swept to power in a landslide, repudiating the neoliberal and racist policies initiated by Bolivia\u2019s elites. Those elites remain, nonetheless, active and powerful.\n\nDissecting the Right In a recent article in Nueva Sociedad , Crist\u00f3bal Rovira argues that as in Europe, far-right political projects are on the rise everywhere in Latin America. In the 2019 coup in Bolivia, two key strands of right-wing mobilization emerged, the newest being the self-styled pititas \u2014 urban, young, middle-class protesters. Some were students at the universities in La Paz, such as the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s (UMSA), whose then rector, Waldo Albarrac\u00edn, was a longtime critic of the MAS. Their modus operandi was the formation of makeshift string barricades in the streets. They shared memes likening Bolivia to a dictatorship, and their protest chants decried Morales\u2019s \u201ccommunism\u201d and compared Bolivia to that old bogeyman, Venezuela. The pititas were joined by a more dangerous element: the ultraright concentrated in the wealthy eastern region of Santa Cruz with ties to Brazilian fascists and Washington, DC. This faction coalesced around Camacho, who went on to become governor of Santa Cruz in the 2021 regional elections. His old organization, the UJC, launched a campaign of terror in Santa Cruz in the wake of the coup, setting off bombs outside the headquarters of the local peasant union. The coup of 2019 was a catastrophic attack on Bolivian democracy. The formation of the UJC in 1957 is linked to the arrival in Bolivia of German Nazis who fled Europe after World War II. In recent decades, it has functioned as a kind of paramilitary group protecting the interests of loggers and agribusinesses. It seeks to establish an autonomous Santa Cruz state, and it uses racist rhetoric to castigate the highland indigenous \u201csavages\u201d associated with the national government. The far right also exploits the long-standing cultural divisions between the eastern and western regions, the Andean highlands and the lowlands, respectively. Until the mid-twentieth century, the city of Santa Cruz was an isolated backwater, presided over by white elites who viciously exploited the small and dispersed indigenous populations who lived in the wider region. The discovery of oil and gas deposits in the 1960s generated huge economic growth. Today Santa Cruz is the powerhouse of Bolivia, fueled in the past two decades by the expansion of the agricultural frontier for soy production, logging, and livestock, which are devastating the biodiverse landscapes and usurping indigenous territory. In these eastern territories, vast tracts of land are still owned by a small wealthy elite, many of them having acquired the land during the dictatorships of the 1970s and \u201980s. One of these landowners is Branko Marinkovic, the openly fascist descendant of wealthy Croatian immigrants, who, as minister of economy and public finance under \u00c1\u00f1ez, was rewarded with 34,000 hectares of land. In 2008, Marinkovic was arrested and went into exile in the United States and, subsequently, Brazil after orchestrating an assassination attempt against President Evo Morales. Cruce\u00f1o elites \u2014 those associated with the Comit\u00e9 Pro Santa Cruz \u2014 have fashioned an identity as cambas to refer to their lowland identity, which they juxtapose with the racialized and often pejorative term collas, meaning highland indigenous peoples. They are well integrated with the far right regionally. Marinkovic, for example, is a close associate of Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president; earlier this year, he was detained at Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires, where he was on his way to meet Argentina\u2019s libertarian president, Javier Milei, for dinner. Unlike the right-wing supporters of Milei and Bolsonaro, who were able to win national power at the ballot box, the ultraright in Bolivia remains heavily concentrated in the east of the country and has not yet been able to court wider support translating into electoral success nationally. In June 2022, \u00c1\u00f1ez was sentenced to ten years in prison for her role in the coup, and that December, Camacho was kept in preventive detention on charges of terrorism and embezzlement of funds. Despite their imprisonment and relative marginality, however, the forces that brought these two figures to prominence remain significant.\n\nDefending Democracy The ill-fated coup attempt of June 26, 2024, showcased the commitment of Bolivian movements to resisting threats to democracy. Troops led by an aggrieved army general sent a tank into the presidential palace in La Paz in what many feared was an effort by the military to seize power in the context of an ongoing internal conflict within the MAS. General Juan Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga demanded the release of A\u00f1ez and Camacho. Although the \u201ccoup\u201d fizzled out of its own accord within a few hours, Bolivia\u2019s social movements immediately rushed to take a stand. \u201cWe will take to the streets. We will defend democracy!\u201d declared Guillermina Kuno, an Aymara leader of the Bartolina Sisas, Bolivia\u2019s national union of indigenous peasant women, at a press conference. Social movements flooded Plaza Murillo in a show of strength against military interference. Unlike the right-wing supporters of Milei and Bolsonaro, who were able to win power at the ballot box, the ultraright in Bolivia has not yet been able to court wider support translating into electoral success nationally. The incident nonetheless bodes ill for a country still reeling from the 2019 coup. It certainly would not be the first time that military leaders had subverted democratic rule in Bolivia. Amid a litany of military coups, one of the most tragic in recent history was the putsch led by Luis Garc\u00eda Meza in 1980. Troops entered the headquarters of the trade union federation and kidnapped socialist party leader Marcelo Quiroga, who was tortured and killed. As a result, almost the entirety of the labor movement leadership was forced into exile. In the late 1970s and \u201980s, the peasant movement was a fierce defender of democracy in Bolivia in the face of authoritarian regimes. The MAS has its early origins in the mobilizing strategy of that peasant movement. It first came to power in 2005 under Morales, on the back of a cycle of uprisings between 2000 and 2004 led by peasants, miners, workers, and indigenous groups against the privatization of the country\u2019s resources and other neoliberal policies. With revenues from the newly nationalized oil and gas industries in the late 2000s, the economy boomed, and inequality reduced drastically. Social spending transformed the lives of the poor people, workers, indigenous communities, and women. In a country marked by deep racial discrimination against indigenous peoples, the state newly proclaimed the importance of indigenous languages and ways of living."

            "article_content": "The drones are everywhere, and Black internet is concerned. After weeks of complaints, the frenzy is reaching a new peak as mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey and now in parts of New York and Connecticut continue to ramp up, even leading government officials like Senator Cory Booker share concern about the lack of transparency from federal government officials about these alarming sightings.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been enough transparency,\u201d the Black Senator from New Jersey explained to CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing a lot of potential misinformation to spread or fear. We should know what\u2019s going on in our skies.\u201d\n\ntiktok-7447606032727084334\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Senator is certainly right about that, as the conspiracy theories have taken off on the internet, especially the Black internet. You know how it goes, we will absolutely bring up some conspiracies in our conversations and online as we already tend to be pretty wary of things. And now, even one of the biggest Black politicians in the country is stating his concern about drones, which makes matters even more worrisome. Naturally, the conversation has taken to social media with their ideas regarding the origin and meaning of these large, mysterious drones that are reportedly 6 feet in size, per AP News.\n\nOne user on X, formerly known as Twitter, echoes what many are feeling, writing that in their opinion there are two options when it comes to these drones, that \u201cthey really don\u2019t know what they are and, therefore, our air defense is extraordinarily weak,\u201d or \u201cthey know what they are but can\u2019t say.\u201d They added, \u201cNot sure which is crazier.\u201d\n\nThe same user also gave \u201ctin foil\u201d takes, that either the drones are aliens (classic) or that they are our government themselves.\n\nThe mysterious drones over Jersey.\n\n\n\n1. They really don\u2019t know what they are and, therefore, our air defense is extraordinarily weak; or\n\n\n\n2. They know what they are but can\u2019t say.\n\n\n\nNot sure which is crazier. \u2014 kyle alex brett (@kyalbr) December 13, 2024\n\nMy tin foil take.\n\n\n\n1. The drones belong to aliens who live under the ocean and they\u2019re intimidating our top secret government to stop the government from doing something; or\n\n\n\n2. It\u2019s our top secret government looking for something that has been stolen and emits a faint trace. \u2014 kyle alex brett (@kyalbr) December 14, 2024\n\nThe fact that the government seems to be just as much in the dark as we are certainly doesn\u2019t help matters either! We have gotten little confirmation from federal government officials in the days since the sightings increased. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said that they have \u201cno evidence\u201d that the drones are from an adversary or a foreign entity. She also said that the drones are \u201cnot U.S. military drones.\u201d Again, still not making any of us feel better!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\ntiktok-7447530870233222442\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee also addressed concerns over the drones with the FBI in a now-viral TikTok from CBS News, with a representative confirming that they are \u201cactively\u201d investigating but they \u201cdon\u2019t have an answer\u201d for who is responsible. Again, the lack of answers has only led to more speculation, as seen in the comments of the Tiktok alone.\n\ntiktok-7447237219506474282\n\nAs ABC News has reported, the rise in conspiracy theories surrounding drones has even led to a massive Facebook page. Titled New Jersey Mystery Drones \u2014 let\u2019s solve it, the page has nearly 44,000 members as of Friday. On the page, theories are able to run wild as residents share their video footage, photos and sightings, while also offering their own suggestions for how to handle the situation, with some even suggesting shooting them down themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Senator Booker shared when shooting them down was suggested, he explained, \u201cSafety first. You\u2019re over populous neighborhoods and areas,\u201d while adding that Jersey is the most densely populated state in America.\u201d He added, \u201cThe most important thing right now is the safety and security of our communities.\u201d\n\nOf course, along with the conspiracy theories, has come some levity on the internet as well, with some just marveling over the situation in general. One user on X took a little jab at the state of Jersey, writing, \u201cAlien 1: You know where we should go next? Alien 2: Where? Alien 1: New Jersey.\u201d Another shared the same sentiment, writing, \u201cOf course the alien invasion would start in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nAlien 1: You know where we should go next?\n\n\n\nAlien 2: Where?\n\n\n\nAlien 1: New Jersey. \u2014 Alex Cole (@acnewsitics) December 14, 2024\n\nOf course the alien invasion would start in New Jersey \u2014 Cydel (@cydelmg) December 14, 2024\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

            "article_content": "\n\n/\n\n\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday called upon recently returned teachers from Finland to spearhead an educational revolution in the state, transforming government schools into vibrant hubs of quality learning. Addressing the teachers at his official residence, Mann lauded their successful training in Finland and emphasized the critical role they play in building a strong foundation for the nation\u2019s future.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day for Punjab as our teachers return equipped with world-class expertise,\u201d said the Chief Minister, urging the teachers to serve as role models, imparting skills and knowledge that would allow students to compete with their peers from private schools. The Chief Minister highlighted that the state\u2019s initiative to send 72 primary teachers for advanced training in Finland was not just a trip but a mission to overhaul the education system.\n\n\n\nMann elaborated on why Finland was chosen for this program, citing its globally acclaimed education system. \u201cThe training has provided our teachers with innovative techniques and best practices that will not only enhance their teaching abilities but also bring a much-needed boost to our education sector,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nThe program is aimed at broadening the professional skills of teachers, fostering leadership qualities, and equipping them with advanced pedagogical tools.\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister emphasized that the enriched expertise of these educators would empower government school students to excel academically and socially. \u201cThis initiative will enable the creation of an education system that nurtures every child's potential,\u201d Mann asserted.\n\n\n\nMann called the Finland training program a \u201cred-letter day\u201d in Punjab\u2019s history. He expressed confidence that such initiatives would help Punjab become a frontrunner in education. \u201cThis training will act as a seed, growing into a tree of knowledge that benefits not just individuals but entire communities,\u201d he envisioned.\n\n\n\nTo further support these efforts, Mann announced plans for creating platforms where Finland-trained teachers could share their experiences and expertise with colleagues, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. He encouraged teachers to take pride in their transformative role, adding, \u201cEducation is the most powerful tool for progress, and you hold the keys to unlocking our state\u2019s potential.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister also underscored the importance of aligning students\u2019 academic paths with their interests rather than societal pressures. He urged parents and teachers to nurture children\u2019s individual strengths, allowing them to achieve their aspirations.\n\n\n\nAdding an exciting dimension to the occasion, Education Minister Harjot Singh Bains announced upcoming student visits to premier institutions like the Indian Institute of Science and Google\u2019s headquarters. \u201cThis will provide students with valuable exposure to cutting-edge technologies and inspire them to dream big,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nTeachers Laud Initiative, Share Experiences\n\nEquipped with innovative methodologies, the delegation of 72 educators \u2014 including BPEOs, CHTs, HTs, and primary teachers \u2014 shared their transformative experiences.\n\n\n\nManmeet Singh, a teacher from Ludhiana, reflected on how Finland\u2019s playful learning techniques replaced their reliance on traditional methods. \u201cWe\u2019ve started sharing these techniques with fellow educators, and the results are promising,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBathinda\u2019s Daljit Singh recalled praise from Finnish trainer Cristina, who applauded Punjab\u2019s initiative. \u201cHer encouragement inspired us to share our experiences with local communities, bringing renewed energy to our teaching,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Talwara\u2019s Amrinderpal Singh Dhillon emphasized how the training instilled a profound sense of responsibility among the participants. \u201cThis visionary program will drive grassroots change in education,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBaljit Kaur Parmar, a primary teacher from Fatehgarh Sahib, expressed how the experience boosted her confidence. \u201cI feel equipped to contribute more effectively, both inside and outside the classroom,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nEducators were especially impressed by Finland\u2019s emphasis on practical education. Anoop Singh Maini from Tarn Taran highlighted, \u201cThe Finnish system focuses on practical learning alongside academics, a model we aspire to replicate in Punjab.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCERT director Amaninder Kaur Brar emphasized the need for integrating practical tools into classrooms, such as carpentry workshops, to provide hands-on learning experiences. \u201cThis approach will ensure students apply theoretical knowledge effectively,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nSeveral teachers acknowledged the psychological benefits of the training. Hoshiarpur\u2019s Vandana Heen said: \u201cIt was a joyful learning experience that encouraged us to rethink our teaching practices.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers, like Nirmaljeet Kaur of Tarn Taran, highlighted Finland\u2019s unique approach to time management and moral education. \u201cThese lessons will prove invaluable as we apply them in our schools,\u201d she shared.\n\n"
