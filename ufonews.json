        "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nThree years ago, Missouri resident Justin Johnson captured video of a strange, cube-shaped silver UFO that appeared to be spinning in place in the sky. He is still looking for help identifying it.\n\n\u201cThat thing\u2019s a cube with lights!\u201d Johnson shouts on the video.\n\nAfter recording the strange cube-shaped UFO on his phone, he reached out to people who launch weather balloons and nearby air traffic controllers to see if they could shed any light on what he had seen. No one could give him an answer.\n\nHe believes the object was flying just a few hundred feet in the air, but when he tried to follow it in his pickup truck, it disappeared.\n\nJustin Johnson isn\u2019t alone in his quest for answers about UFOs that have been spotted in the skies above Missouri. Nor is the cube-shaped UFO the only time he has spotted and filmed something unexplained in the sky.\n\nSeeking answers, Johnson uploaded his videos to an app that launched in May called Enigma that calls itself \u201cthe first Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP/UFO) sightings alert network.\u201d\n\nEnigma says its mission is \u201cTo advance progress on UAP using cutting-edge technology and social intelligence. Only through thoughtful, open-minded study of unidentified phenomena can we get answers. We are focused on building and keeping our team low profile for privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of sightings that we get are misinterpretations of something mundane,\u201d Alejandro Rojas, a consultant to Enigma Labs, told KMBC News.\n\nHowever, with nearly 20,000 videos and UFO sighting reports to review, Enigma isn\u2019t ruling anything out.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of great possibilities out there. But we just don\u2019t know. We really need to follow that data to figure it out,\u201d Rojas said.\n\nJohnson, too, isn\u2019t giving up hope.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of finding out something that can change humanity forever. This is all very exciting to me,\u201d he said."

        "article_content": "Editor's note: This archival article was first published Oct. 23, 2008.\n\nMINOT \u2014 A routine bomber flight in the pre-dawn hours of Oct. 24, 1968, turned unforgettable for navigator Patrick McCaslin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMcCaslin and his B-52 crewmates were practicing maneuvers in the skies above Minot, N.D., when officials at the nearby Air Force base radioed a request.\n\n\"The tower called and said, 'Could you guys keep your eyes open for anything unusual?' '' said McCaslin, recalling that flight four decades ago.\n\n\"We asked, 'What are we looking for?'\n\n\"They said, 'You'll know it if you see it,' '' McCaslin said.\n\n\"This is a dim memory,\" he added, \"but I think one of the pilots said, 'Are the missile crews seeing things again?'''\n\nMcCaslin's first move was to focus the plane's radar into a narrow, high-intensity beam.\n\n\"I saw a (radar) return off to our right; it was faint on the first sweep and then it was very strong on the next sweep,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen McCaslin informed the pilots about the contact, they replied they couldn't see anything because of cloud cover, but asked him to keep them apprised of what the object did.\n\nWhat it did, McCaslin said, was move faster than anything he had ever clocked on radar.\n\n\"From one sweep (of the radar) to the next, it came from three miles to one mile,\" he said. \"Later, we computed the closure speed at 3,000 miles an hour.\"\n\nFrom there, it only got stranger.\n\n\"It blew my mind that this thing had closed on us this quickly,\" said McCaslin, who recalled that as he advised the pilots of what the object was doing, the bomber lost radio contact with the tower.\n\n\"We could hear them, but they couldn't hear us,\" he said.\n\nA short while later, the object dropped from the plane's radar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfficials in the tower also watched the blip disappear from radar and asked the bomber to fly lower in an attempt to regain contact.\n\nThis is a drawing by B-52 pilot Brad Runyon of a craft sighted October 1968 over the Minot Air Force Base. Bill McNeff / Special to The Forum\n\nAs the plane approached the spot where radar contact was lost, the crew finally saw something.\n\n\"The pilots indicated they could see it visually, just hovering above the ground,\" McCaslin recalled.\n\n\"They said to me, 'Why don't you unstrap and come up and take a look at this thing?' \" said McCaslin, who decided to stick close to his ejection seat.\n\n\"I didn't know what this thing was.\"\n\nShortly after the pilot and co-pilot began observing the mysterious, glowing object, it rose quickly into the sky and disappeared.\n\nLong witness list\n\nWhile the bomber crew members were making their observations, workers on the ground were seeing something similar and reacting to alarms going off at one of the Minuteman missile silos near the Minot air base, said Bill McNeff, who heard parts of the story firsthand from a brother-in-law who worked as a security guard at the air base in 1968.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMcNeff, a retired electrical engineer living in the Twin Cities and a former director of the Minnesota chapter of the Mutual UFO Network, said the Minot incident was one of the things that inspired him to pursue decades of research into UFO phenomenon.His quest led him in the 1980s to the National Archives in Washington, where he poured over the files of Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Air Force inquiry into reports of unidentified flying objects in the 1950s and '60s.\n\n\"There were incidents (during the Minot episode) that did not make it into the Blue Book files,\" said McNeff, who added the official record doesn't reflect that two airmen passed out after a close approach from the UFO.\n\nHe said a report that the lid of a missile silo was tampered with was also left out.\n\n\"What I learned later is that the lid was completely off the silo and lying on the grass,\" McNeff said.\n\n'Patternicity'\n\nMcNeff said the Minot case ranks among the most intriguing of all UFO sightings because of the number of witnesses and its proximity to a heavily guarded nuclear installation.\n\nThose factors don't impress Michael Schermer.\n\nSchermer, the publisher of Skeptic magazine and founder of the Skeptics Society, shakes his head at any suggestion UFOs are anything more than earthly events that have yet to be explained.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"What the public has done is equate 'UFO' with 'extraterrestrial spaceship,' but to date we don't have a shred of evidence that any of the sightings represent extraterrestrial,\" Schermer said.\n\nHe said the Minot case, with its radar contact indicating an object that moved extremely fast, is interesting, but proves nothing.\n\nIn this 2003 Forum file photo, a B-52 takes off while another sits on the runway at Minot Air Force Base.\n\n\"How do you know it just wasn't one branch of the military not telling the other branch of the military what they're doing? That happens all the time.\" Schermer has coined a term for why some equate UFOs with visits from outer space.\n\n\"I call it patternicity, the tendency to find meaningful patterns in random noise,\" he said.\n\n\"Basically, our brains are wired to always find an explanation even if there isn't one,\" he said. \"In other words, we have a low tolerance for ambiguity.\"\n\nVega schmayga\n\nMcCaslin, who eventually became a pilot and later a high school science teacher in Texas, where he still lives, doesn't know if what showed up on his radar that night 40 years ago came from outer space or inner space.\n\nBut he said one of the explanations the Air Force came up with - that his bomber crew was looking at a star called Vega - is hogwash.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWell, he actually used a stronger noun.\n\nAnd his irritation with the official story is still evident after four decades.\n\n\"My business was to navigate with several means, the star Vega for one,\" he said. \"This thing was at or near the ground. How could it be a star if you're looking at the ground?\"\n\nWhen TV specials air interviews with McCaslin, his neighbors will approach him and ask if he believes in UFOs.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I tell them. I believe what I saw that night. I'm not ready to accept all the things that you see out there - about alien abduction and all that - because I didn't have that experience.\n\n\"It would be a leap in logic to say it came from outer space,\" McCaslin said.\n\n\"It could have come from inner space,\" he said. \"It could have come from anywhere.\"\n\nScientist says some UFO reports worth pondering\n\nStories about a B-52 bomber's encounter with an unidentified flying object in North Dakota in October 1968 pop up on many Web sites.\n\nIn one posting, Twin Cities-based UFO researcher Bill McNeff relates what co-pilot Brad Runyon reported seeing in the early morning hours on that day 40 years ago.\n\nRunyon described an object more than 200 feet in diameter and hundreds of feet long.\n\nHe said the object had a metallic cylinder attached to one end, with a crescent moon-shaped section glowing yellow-green connected to the cylinder.\n\nThis page on UFOcasebook.com details the 1968 UFO encounter of a B-52 crew from Minot Air Force Base.\n\nMany scientists dismiss UFO sightings as unremarkable.\n\nMany, but not all.\n\n\"My perspective is there's certainly something going on. I don't know what it is,\" said Bernard Haisch, an astrophysicist and author of more than 130 scientific publications.\n\nHaisch believes the UFO question deserves to be pondered by the scientific community, even if 99 percent of reports are explainable or hoaxed.\n\n\"There's still a huge amount of data that is potentially useful,\" said Haisch, who operates a Web site called ufoskeptic.org .\n\nHe defines \"skeptic\" as someone wary of extraordinary explanations for perplexing mysteries who is also willing to look at data.\n\nWith the rise of string theory - which allows for the possibility of multiple universes - Haisch finds it odd that physicists are usually the first to scoff at the idea of visitors from other worlds.\n\n\"It's kind of a strange situation,\" he said.\n\nThomas McDonough, senior scientist with a group called The Skeptics Society, grew up believing in the paranormal, but gradually became a doubter.\n\n\"There are so many ways people can be fooled,\" said McDonough, who like Haisch is from California and has a Ph.D. in astrophysics.\n\nAbsent tangible evidence, McDonough said he has concluded that the Earth is not being visited by aliens.\n\nHowever, he's keeping the door open to possibilities.\n\n\"Every now and then in science, someone comes along with a weird story that leads to something new.\n\n\"But most times,\" he said, \"the weird stories lead to something mundane.\""

Unlike other politicians, he could potentially push for full disclosure.\"\n\nTrump has previously revealed, during an interview with his son, Donald Jr., that \"he knows a few things\" but had to be careful with the information.\n\nPope believes Trump is also determined to release the JFK files, which have similarly been shrouded in secrecy as the conspiracy theories over the infamous 1963 assassination continue to swirl.\n\n\"He\u2019s already promised total transparency on JFK if re-elected, so it\u2019s reasonable to think he might do the same with UFOs,\" the expert continued.\n\n\"SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS\"\n\nA whistleblower linked to the Immaculate Constellation case, described as \"a current or former US government official,\" has allegedly written a report with significant claims.\n\nIt alleges that the US executive branch has been addressing issues related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and non-human intelligence (NHI) without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization.\n\nWill Trump or Harris FINALLY reveal the truth about America\u2019s alien secrets? UFO expert says one candidate will tell all\n\nThis situation, the report claims, may have persisted for decades.\n\nThere are also detailed descriptions of several UFO encounters logged in a government database.\n\nOne incident involved an F-22 fighter jet being \"intercepted and boxed in\" by a group of three to six spherical objects, which ultimately forced the jet to leave its mission area.\n\nIn another reported encounter, the crew aboard a Navy aircraft carrier observed a sphere glowing orange-red with a surface that seemed to be \u201croiling like the sun.\u201d\n\nThis object descended rapidly from a high altitude, stopping to hover approximately 100-200 yards (90-180 meters) above the flight deck.\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger claimed he had communicated with the alleged whistleblower.\n\nHowever, identifying information, such as the exact role and gender, was being withheld to protect them from retaliation.\n\nFRESH HOPES\n\nIf Trump does indeed defeat Kamala Harris and return to the Washington DC hot seat, Pope is hoping access will be granted for \"clearer, longer videos of UFO sightings\" as well as underwater tracking data, which insiders believe is also present.\n\nFootage from military surveillance systems could also be released.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot we haven\u2019t seen from the military\u2019s surveillance systems,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"For example, the recent Chinese spy balloon was followed by other ambiguous shoot-downs, yet the government cited national security concerns as reasons for not releasing clear images.\n\n\"But soon after, they released clear photos of a Russian aircraft near a U.S. drone. This kind of inconsistency frustrates the UFO community, and we expect that a new administration might change this stance.\"\n\nAllan Lichtman's 2024 presidential election prediction Renowned historian Allan Lichtman has accurately predicted the outcomes of presidential elections since 1984 using his 13 Keys to the White House algorithm. In 2016, he was one of the few scholars who correctly predicted a Trump win. This year, has revealed who he thinks will be inaugurated as the 47th president in January next year based on his system of true and false statements. If six or more statements go against the White House party, they are projected to lose the presidential election. Midterm elections: The Democrats suffered losses in the 2022 House elections, meaning the key turns false. (Harris 0-1 Trump) There is no primary contest: This key turns in favor of Harris because the Democrats got \"smart\" and rallied behind the vice president after Joe Biden ended his campaign, according to Lichtman. (Harris 1-1 Trump) The sitting president is seeking another term: This turns false because Biden suspended his re-election campaign. (Harris 1-2 Trump) There is no third-party challenger: This statement is true because third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. needed to poll at 10% nationally, according to Lichtman. (Harris 2-2 Trump) The short-term economy is strong: This key goes in favor of the White House Party. (Harris 3-2 Trump) The long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms: This key also swings toward Harris. (Harris 4-2 Trump) The White House Party has made major national policy changes: This key is also true, according to Lichtman's theory. (Harris 5-2 Trump) There is sustained social unrest during the term: College campus demonstrations have erupted in reaction to the Gaza conflict, but no protests have broken out that threaten the fabric of society. This means the key goes in Harris' column. (Harris 6-2 Trump) The White House is untainted by scandal: Despite House Republican efforts to impeach Joe Biden, they have been unable to pin a scandal on him. (Harris 7-2 Trump) The incumbent is charismatic: Harris is not considered a Ronald Reagan or Franklin D. Roosevelt-like figure so the key is false. (Harris 7-3 Trump) The challenger is uncharismatic: This key goes in favor of the White House party - even though Trump is a showman. (Harris 8-3 Trump) Lichtman warned that the two foreign policy keys - whether there has been a major success or no failure - could flip either way. But, even if both statements flipped against Harris, Trump would not have enough keys in his column to win the election.\n\nInterest in possible extraterrestrial activity from political parties isn't new.\n\nMarco Rubio and Tim Burchett have pushed for transparency in the past, while Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Coretz and Kirsten Gillibrand have also voiced interest.\n\nUFO fanatic Robert Bigelow has donated millions to Republican campaigns over the years.\n\nHISTORY CHANGER\n\nPope, however, believes a maverick like Trump \"could make a real change\" and push ahead with some seriously stunning revelations.\n\n\"Some feel he\u2019s polarizing, but still hope he might follow through on disclosure promises,\" the expert admitted.\n\n\"People would remember where they were when it happened, much like they remember moments associated with JFK,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"And if there\u2019s a backstory, such as humanity\u2019s origins being linked to extraterrestrials, it could fundamentally alter worldviews, even presenting darker possibilities\u2014that Earth might be a science experiment, prison, or farm, theories that would undoubtedly provoke significant shifts in understanding.\n\n\"The President who discloses alien existence would change history forever.\"\n\n5 UFO expert Nick Pope told The U.S. Sun he believes Trump is a \"disruptor\" who will come clean about what the government knows about UFOs Credit: Getty"

Each functions the same way - you click, and speak through the mic, and there's no Hume account required if you want to give it a go.\n\nI asked the Quick Answers chatbot how tall the Eiffel Tower is, and got, well, a quick answer, followed by additional information about how it's been added to over time, and how big certain sections of it are.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

It repeated lines, and even changed voice at one point which was pretty jarring, but it was happy to receive additional prompts to help direct the flow of the story (sadly, the story it provided, of a car called Cara looking for a power source, is unlikely to win any awards any time soon.\n\nOn the other hand, there's some overlap between some of the voices, and I actually found that a nice way of acknowledging there's no one true answer.\n\nI asked the Spirituality voice how I could better live in the moment, and it suggested feeling the breeze through my hair, the sun on my skin, and that I try eating a mango, bizarrely.\n\nThe same prompt on the Deeper Questions bot prompted smelling my morning coffee, and the way sunlight hits a desk for some reason. Interestingly, the Deeper Questions bot, like the Storytelling one, kept repeating some lines of dialog.\n\nI'm definitely curious to see how things expand from here, and I think Hume has a solid base to build from if it can fix those minor teething issues."

        "article_content": "The Dr Pepper Museum is said to be haunted and long-time employees say they've had their fair share of bizarre encounters.\n\nWACO, Texas \u2014 If you had to think of a Texas soda, there's really only one choice: Dr Pepper!\n\nThe Texas staple runs a popular museum in Waco that draws plenty of soda-savvy connoisseurs, but employees say there's more bubbling beneath the museum floors than meets the eye.\n\nWith more than 250,000 artifacts on site, there's a lot to learn at the Dr Pepper Museum.\n\n\"There's a lot of different stories in our collection, there's a lot of rich history with the soda industry in general and we're able to tell many of those stories,\" said Rachael Nadeau Johnson, the Collections Manager for the Dr Pepper Museum.\n\nJohnson has worked at the museum for more than 10 years and she is a testament to the fact that the history inside the museum isn't all as sweet as the beloved soft drink.\n\n\"Yes, it is some sort of haunted,\" Johnson added. \"I guess I'm used to it for the most part. I've been here for over 10 years and we're all friendly. I say hi to them and just go about my day.\"\n\nThe \"them\" Johnson is referring to are whatever entities roam the halls and rooms of the museum. Making friends with the spirits, the ghouls, whatever old presence is trying to be relevant isn't the worst idea, especially with how prevalent they are.\n\n\"In several places around the museum we have little ghosts [signs] that say 'spooky spots' and those are places where paranormal investigators have gotten activity,\" Johnson explained.\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries is who or what is doing the haunting. Johnson believes it could stem from over a century ago.\n\n\"On the property where this museum now resides, it used to be several private dwellings and boarding houses, which is where we believe some of our activity actually comes from, not the museum building itself,\" Johnson added.\n\nThe second floor of the museum supposedly has the most paranormal activity in the entire museum.\n\n\"Why, I don't know, but it really is,\" Johnson said. \"It always feels colder in here than anywhere else in the building. We have had paranormal investigators come and have a lot of experiences in this room. We have also had some people catch some weird light activity going on in the lights in the case behind me. Also, in this room it always feels like there's someone in here with you whether or not there is.\"\n\nWhen 6 News visited the museum, Johnson said one of the ghosts possibly goes by the name Seth and is better known for its personality traits.\n\n\"Most of the information we get from whatever entity is here is usually it comes across as a young, maybe teenage man and a little bit sassy when we get our electronic voice phenomenons,\" Johnson said. \"It's not a bad vibe. Like Casper or something, I don't know -- sassy.\"\n\nThose lurking the halls of the museum aren't all friendly or sassy. There are some that are described as more eerie.\n\nOne morning Johnson was working in a third floor office before the museum opened.\n\n\"I shut the office door behind me, it locks when you shut it and I came back to the office door being cracked open, which was weird because it was shut and locked when I left it,\" Johnson explained. \"Then, I heard people whispering and I said 'I don't know who's supposed to be up here right now, other than me,' and then the door slammed shut in front of my face and then I opened the office and no one was in here. Apparently dusting exhibits was just too much for them that morning, I guess.\"\n\nSecurity cameras have also captured some paranormal activity too, like orbs floating in rooms.\n\n\"There are also some theories that we might just have some residual energy or poltergeist activity that was created by the 1953 tornado that went through the center of downtown and hit both buildings that are now the Dr Pepper Museum,\" Johnson added.\n\nWhen visiting the Dr Pepper Museum, it's common for visitors to end their experience by getting a sweet treat from the soda fountain, like the world-famous float. However, there's an unpleasant presence felt in the soda fountain, too -- but mainly for the soda jerks. The staff working the soda fountains were originally called soda jerks because of the jerking motion they made pulling the soda fountain handle back and forth.\n\n\"I have not personally experienced anything here, but we have had soda jerks who have experienced things,\" Johnson said. \"Some of them have reported experiencing their apron strings being tugged on, or their hair being pulled sort of like in a playful manner.\"\n\nNo matter where you go in the museum, there's a chance to experience a little taste of tension, but you must dare to step in.\n\n\"There are a lot of different experiences that people could experience specifically on the paranormal tour, but also maybe if they just visit during regular operating hours,\" Johnson added."

        "article_content": "(\u00a9 Khaosai Wongnatthakan at Canva.com)\n\nThe raft of new global legislation for financial, GRC and ESG reporting is putting fresh pressure on enterprises to consolidate and clean up their data and processes. Could generative AI could help alleviate some of this pressure? Companies are unsure about how to make the best use of it, and the regulations themselves are still evolving.\n\nThis was front-of-mind for delegates at last week\u2019s Amplify EMEA conference in Amsterdam last week, hosted by Workiva, which provides a cloud-based platform for integrated reporting in ESG, Financial Reporting, and GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance). The agenda highlighted trends for a rethink of data, reporting and governance. In this complicated market, where a mix of consultants, auditors and vendors all work closely with their clients, AI is beginning to have an impact \u2014 particularly in the ESG space, where data sources and processes are not as predictable as for financial reporting.\n\nSpeaking on a panel called \u2018Can you anticipate regulatory change?' Andie Wood, VP of Regulatory Strategy at Workiva, told delegates that even the regulators are now trying to streamline the increasingly complex demands on organizations. She says:\n\nOver the last five years there have been a lot of new regulations introduced, and the regulators are hearing from companies that they've been feeling massively under pressure as a result. I'm not just talking about one big reporting regulation, but that whole suite of regulations across the Green Deal and across the other changes in the environment. We're hearing them start to talk about focusing on the implementation. What are we going to do next? We actually saw the commissioners all being given the brief to specifically find reductions in the reporting burden. So we're very interested to hear what they actually think a reduction in reporting burden is. Everybody's getting themselves together. They're deciding what their new policy is going to be.\n\nUndoubtedly robust data and processes will play a big role in the new regulatory frameworks, according to panel moderator Paul Dickinson, founder of CDP. He comments:\n\nWe talked before about how if you want to really make the best use of the almost unlimited, almost unimaginable abilities of machine intelligence, artificial intelligence, then you need incredibly good data benchmarks now to be able to take advantage of that in the future.\n\nThe growing role of generative AI\n\nIn ESG in particular, having robust data and processes is an important step towards allowing generative AI to play a significant role. Naval Khana, Director at PwC UK, says the technology could help companies meeting their commitments in updated regulations like CSDR and ISSB.\n\nHe presented figures to the conference from this year\u2019s annual PwC CEO report, which found that 68% of CEOs think generative AI will increase employee efficiency, and 44% expect it to increase profits. In the report PwC says it is currently actively engaged with 950 of its top 1000 US consulting clients, and is now discussing its use and implementation with its audit clients. Khana says:\n\nEveryone has access to generative AI, and this has led to an unusual situation, a democratization of a new technology, where personal use of gen AI, like ChatGPT, has come before companies get up to speed. It is unique and is having a mass impact, which corporations are looking at with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.\n\nGenerative AI is already making inroads in content generation, and analysis and interpretation according to Khana. He says trends like interpreting data from multiple media inputs using AI agents that can cope with text, video and audio inputs is having a major impact on efficiency. Domain specific models such as Harvey in the legal arena, and AI systems which use the \u2018Human in the Loop\u2019 models are also becoming more effective.\n\nHowever, Jeannette Gorzala, VP European AI Forum, told delegates they need to guide the technology until they are confident they can use the models and mitigate any risk fears. She says:\n\nTwo thirds of employees are now using ChatGPT secretly at work, but only a third of companies are offering their employees guidance on how best to use gen AI. So there is a gap, a sort of limbo, and in order for the companies to get over pain points and innovate using gen AI we have to have a top down approach, as well as the current bottom up one.\n\nGorzala, who represented over 2000 European AI companies during the legislative process of the EU AI Act, says that the approach the Act takes will help organizations to scope their systems based on risk. She comments:\n\nGen AI will be disruptive, and there will be pain points in reporting, but data literacy will gradually develop and the use of gen AI tools in specific areas will increase, without adding any risk.\n\nDifferent paths to adoption\n\nBut while these companies may need the efficiencies that generative AI based platforms offer, it makes no sense to start building their own generative AI systems from scratch, according to Simon Atherton, director CFO Advisory practice at Deloitte UK. He believes that it makes more sense for organizations to make use of software companies like Workiva that incorporate generative AI into their platforms. He says:\n\nIn certain areas like the front office, we all engage with organizations which are already using gen AI. But from a finance and GRC perspective, I think people are just trying to understand what the use cases are. My view is that most won't ever actually buy and build their own gen AI applications, but will use it when companies like Workiva incorporate it onto their platforms.\n\nHe draws a parallel with the emergence of Robotic Process Automation (RPA):\n\nThere was a massive trend for RPA software about 5 years ago. Everyone was going to use RPA. I actually don't think that many people in finance use RPA, because how you produce reports, how you raise invoices, how you pay invoices, how you do journals, needs the same organization. So I think vendors will build gen AI into their platforms. That's how finance functions. If Workiva builds something that uses gen AI, it's all about risk. Workiva will say, \u2018We\u2019ve tested this. We've got these protocols. This is what it is, otherwise you have to build it yourself.\u2019 It doesn't make sense to build it yourself.\n\nWorkiva\u2019s Wood says organizations are uncertain about incorporating generative AI into their reporting processes at the moment, but it has become a learning process. She comments:\n\nThere is uncertainty. To what extent AI can really draft? Does it produce a high quality disclosure? Does it produce a common disclosure? But certainly we see it being used to produce the initial outline and then circumstances. I think it's definitely already helping but we're still learning.\n\nGorzala from the European AI Forum believes it will be critical for companies to take their employees on that learning journey, if they are to use generative AI effectively and safely in meeting their regulatory obligations. She says:\n\nThe disruption gen AI brings will lead to innovation, and offer lots of potential to achieve more, and bring benefits throughout organizations. Taking employees on the learning journey is an important first step. There will be massive real time savings in the automating reporting of real time information sources, and using more gen AI tools for assuring compliance.\n\nMy take\n\nDelegates at the Workiva Amplify EMEA conference are pretty fed up with the constantly changing global regulations hitting them. And whereas financial reporting has evolved gradually over quite a few decades, the ESG space offers all sorts of extra worries including the robustness of different data sources and processes they now have to deal with. One delegate told a panel she was tired of constantly thinking about risk, and wanted to start thinking about creating business value.\n\nIt makes little sense for these organizations to start incorporating generative AI from scratch. They should begin to embrace this disruptive technology as it develops through the platforms they already use. Suppliers like Workiva, and the management consultants and auditors who work in this arena, are ready to step up."
