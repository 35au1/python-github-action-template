        "article_content": "It\u2019s been nearly 2 decades since the \u2018Tic Tac\u2019 incident, here\u2019s what we know about the iconic UFO encounter\n\nLAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2014 The most consequential UFO incident in modern history is about to reach a milestone, and while the Pentagon still can\u2019t explain what happened, the incident\u2019s impact is still being felt 20 years later.\n\nOn Nov. 14, 2004, U.S. Naval aviators were sent to intercept an otherworldly object that \u201ctook off like a bullet fired from a gun.\u201d It was dubbed the \u201cTic Tac\u201d UFO due to its shape and color, which resembled the popular breath mint. However, this breath mint was 45 feet across. It was detected by the Navy dozens of times in Nov. 2004.\n\nThe now-famous video of the Tic Tac, which was recorded by Navy pilots, was initially buried by the military. However, a clandestine investigation based in Las Vegas eventually documented why the encounter was so revolutionary.\n\nDuring two weeks in Nov. 2004, the world\u2019s most sophisticated sensor systems attached to the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group were befuddled by repeated cat-and-mouse type incursions by unknown objects off of the coast of Southern California. Objects were detected one moment and gone the next. On Nov. 14, radar operators finally got a lock on one object\u2014the Tic Tac.\n\nTop Gun pilot David Fravor was sent to investigate. The commander of the \u201cBlack Aces\u201d Strike Fighter Squadron 41 sped through the skies in his F-18 and could not believe what he saw. Years later, his opinion hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nDavid Fravor, the commander of the \u201cBlack Aces\u201d Strike Fighter Squadron 41 sped through the skies in his F-18 and could not believe what he saw.\n\n\u201cThe video was taken by a crew after us when we came back and landed,\u201d Fravor recounted. \u201cThere were four of us. We chased it visually, and I looked at it for over five minutes.\u201d\n\nFravor described watching it move and interact with his jet. He was confident that what he saw was not one of the usual aerial suspects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bird. It\u2019s not a weather balloon. It had no wings, it had no rotors, there was no wash,\u201d he said. \u201cThe four of us will to this day tell you that we have no idea what we saw, as far as where it was from or what it was, but it had incredible performance characteristics that were well beyond brand new Super Hornets right out of the factory, which [were] the jets we were flying.\u201d\n\nCommander Chad Underwood was in the second F-18 sent after the Tic Tac. A recording device on his plane recorded the grainy image from an infrared sensor. Underwood said a second recording of the incident has never been released, adding that the Tic Tac engaged in active jamming.\n\n\u201cI did get jamming cues on my radar tape,\u201d Underwood said.\n\nAccounts vary regarding what happened to the recordings afterward, although the encounter was not investigated by the Navy, nor was it sent up the organization\u2019s hierarchy. A few years later, a bootleg of the recording appeared online without much fanfare. A more detailed article penned by a former Navy pilot appeared in an online aviation publication without much notice.\n\nIn Dec. 2017, the Tic Tac became worldwide news as the centerpiece of a front-page story in the New York Times. The article revealed the existence of previously unknown Department of Defense programs looking into UFOs. The video of the Tic Tac alongside Fravor\u2019s account was, and still is, viewed as solid proof that genuine unknowns have continued to perplex the world\u2019s most powerful military.\n\nThe New York Times article turned the UFO subject on its head, and other mainstream media started investigating the cover-up. Members of Congress asked questions and demanded briefings. The public showed renewed interest in a subject long dismissed as nonsense. Veteran journalist Ralph Blumenthal said the story was a tough sell to his editors.\n\n\u201cEverything was, you know, it was documented,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cBut it was still a difficult topic for the times to grapple with, and the Times has a history of being very skeptical of UFOs.\u201d\n\nThe larger story exposed a previously unknown investigation into UFO encounters within the U.S. Military. AATIP, or the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, was described as \u201ca program\u201d by some and \u201ca working group\u201d by others.\n\nLue Elizondo, a career intelligence officer who left his Pentagon position in 2017, was instrumental in getting the Tic Tac video into the hands of the New York Times. In 2018, he confirmed that other instances similar to the Tic Tac exist in hidden military files.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many Nimitz incidences that are equally compelling that are told from the eyes of people like Commander Dave Fravor,\u201d Elizondo said, with documents later confirming that Elizondo had taken formal steps to get the Tic Tac video and others like it, released to the public.\n\nChris Mellon, a former intelligence insider, admitted that he put the videos into the hands of the New York Times, creating a wave of publicity that led to the creation of a new Department of Defense investigation: the UAP Task Force. That organization, headed by veteran intelligence professional Jay Stratton, quietly compiled and analyzed other UFO videos and cases. A few of them eventually surfaced in media reports.\n\nVeteran intelligence professional Jay Stratton is interviewed on camera for the first time.\n\nIn Stratton\u2019s very first on-camera interview, he said a major goal of the task force was to reduce the stigma so that more military pilots would be willing to report their encounters, and to give them a formalized process to submit what they saw.\n\n\u201cIf you look back to that Tic Tac incident that happened in 2004, and you know from some of the releases that it wasn\u2019t until 2009, 2010 that things were looked at because they had nowhere to send it,\u201d Stratton said.\n\nWhat has changed in 2024? Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, head of UFO investigation AARO, or the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said the majority of UFO cases can be explained, as could the Tic Tac if more data were available. However, a detailed analysis of the Tic Tac and its capabilities was created. It was the first case investigated by AAWSAP, the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program, another secretive program based in Las Vegas.\n\nIt\u2019s a project that Dr. James Lacatski, former director of AAWSAP, said did not have a vague purpose.\n\n\u201cIt was completely UFO-related,\u201d Lacatski said.\n\nContrary to what the public has been told, the U.S. government knows quite a bit about the Tic Tac, with one of its goals being to construct its own.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "When booting up a game like UFO 50, a collection of 50 titles whose 80s-inspired roots belie the modern design sensibilities that make them special, it's easy to feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe collection was released on September 18, 2024 to critical and commercial acclaim in spite of how unusual it is in the indie landscape, and it's hard to imagine how one would go about tackling the development process of such a vast homage to gaming and its history. So, we sat down with Derek Yu to do just that.\n\nYu, the rockstar indie developer behind Spelunky and Spelunky 2, worked on UFO 50 with a team of five other indie developers for over eight years.\n\n\"Everyone on the team enjoyed the excitement and freedom of 80s gaming \u2013 when game design was less established and less dissected\"\n\nJon Perry, a childhood friend of Yu's, is known for board game design, but turned to video games for this project. Composer Eirik Suhrke has collaborated with Yu in the past, doing the music for Spelunky and Spelunky 2. Paul Hubans is a pixel artist and indie game dev known for Madhouse, Ojiro Fumoto is known for the smash mobile hit Downwell, and Tyriq Plummer is a pixel artist and animator also working on Catacomb Kids.\n\nWe begin our discussion with Yu by diving into how this team managed to wrangle the scope and perspective of such a massive project while dealing with the usual exigencies of making one game, much less 50.\n\n\"When you're working on a game, it's important to zoom out regularly to make sure you're not getting too lost in one small part of the project,\" he says. \"That's even more crucial when it's a collection of 50 games! What helped us zoom out was setting regular deadlines where we'd try to bring each game to a certain level of completeness.\"\n\nAs far as collection-wide design principles went, it was important to Yu and his team to connect games together when they could. However, the first priority from which everything else flowed was making sure that each game could generate its own unique appeal.\n\n\"The most important thing for us was that the games were fun and interesting to work on, so that's where we started when it came to design. But we were always looking for opportunities to connect the games together and reuse connections we'd already made.\"\n\nConnections between finished games is one thing, but how did the team go about structuring their collaborative efforts to create connective tissue between developers while UFO 50 was a work in progress? Yu says it all came down to setting expectations.\n\nWhile he and John Perry directed most of the games in the collection, Ojiro Fumoto specialized in one title: Sunset Drive. Even Suhrke, who did music for the game, has a few credits to his name, as do Hubans and Plummer. This kind of collaboration underscores the team's ability to work together and respect one another's ideas.\n\nThe collection's developers | Image credit: Mossmouth/UFO 50\n\n\"The understanding was that a director of a game would have final say on its design, but everyone was open to collaborating and sharing their work,\" Yu explains. \"By release, every game had gone through multiple passes by different people.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Everyone on the UFO 50 team has a broad set of skills, but we each have our individual strengths and areas of special interest, too. We leveraged those unique skills in a very organic way \u2013 there was a lot of encouragement to just take the initiative if you had a good idea.\"\n\nSeveral projects were scrapped during development, but Yu points out the underappreciated advantage indie game developers have: flexibility.\n\n\"I recall only around a half dozen games that were scrapped, and they were all scrapped early on in their development. So we didn't leave too much on the cutting room floor, in the end. I think that's an area where indies can really take advantage of their flexibility to work efficiently \u2013 you don't have to make it difficult to implement an idea or to cut one.\"\n\nAccording to Yu, this flexibility extended into UFO 50's 80s-inspired design. When we ask why the UFO 50 team chose the era, Yu emphasizes the DIY-spirit of games at the time and how their gameplay and interfaces often brought out creativity in players and designers alike. Basing UFO 50's lore on a fictional video game company that published titles from 1982 through 1989 felt like the natural choice then for such an ambitious celebration of what games can be.\n\n\"I think everyone on the team enjoyed the excitement and freedom of 80s gaming \u2013 when game design was less established and less dissected,\" Yu says. \"And even accounting for instruction manuals, I feel like games were less handholdy, sometimes for the worse but often for the better. There was a raw energy that was very adventurous and the technical limitations didn't get in the way \u2013 if anything, it bred a lot of creativity. We wanted to capture some of that feeling while also applying the good lessons we've learned since then.\"\n\nCapturing such a feeling in 50 games, though, took longer than expected. Yu had originally envisioned the project launching in 2018. He says a number of factors led to the game taking much longer to come out than he originally planned, part of which being the release of Spelunky 2 in 2020.\n\n\"Partly we just underestimated the work, which is common enough when you're working on one game, let alone 50 at once! Also, for me, that initial release window was based on a slightly different idea of the collection, where the individual games were allowed to be a little more raw. After we passed that date, though, it became clear that this was one of those projects that needed to cook as long as it needed to cook.\"\n\nUFO 50's title screen\n\nSo Yu and Suhrke decided to focus on Spelunky 2 and ship that first before turning their full attention back to UFO 50.\n\nIn spite of the delay, when asked if he'd do anything differently if he could go back in time, Yu's answer is definitive: \"I wouldn't change a thing, since both games [Spelunky 2 and UFO 50] launched and have been well-received. And sometimes you need to miss a deadline to put things in the right perspective.\"\n\nYu says that playtesters provided valuable thoughts on how to make the game feel like a fulsome experience in the year leading up to its release.\n\n\"We added most of our external playtesters in the last year of development \u2013 up until that point we had our hands plenty full just working off of our own thoughts. Once the games were all playable from beginning to end and it felt like a full collection, we started inviting friends to try it out.\n\n\"Sometimes you need to miss a deadline to put things in the right perspective\"\n\n\"For the most part, our testers validated the core principles behind UFO 50. Despite the overwhelming nature of having 50 games available at the start, the overall concept seemed compelling to people, especially as they engaged more and more with the fictional history. The hard part was massaging all of the details into the right places and making sure that everything \u2013 the games, the library, the fiction \u2013 worked well together and felt coherent. Design-wise, a lot of our discussions around the testing were about balancing different ways to approach the collection.\"\n\nThe team's approach struck us as a refreshing counterpoint to the usual industry story of games being crunched on and launched at the last minute to meet corporate earnings goals.\n\nHowever, in spite of this fascination and all the fulfillment he found making UFO 50, Yu would caution new indie developers against making such a vast project. While smaller games can still be a powerful vehicle for individuals looking to hone their craft, he says, treating game development as an iterative learning experience is far more rewarding (and sustainable) than banking on one encompassing idea for years on end.\n\n\"I don't think UFO 50 is a great example for new developers to follow, because ultimately it's still a single large game that took [over] eight years to make! That requires a lot of experience and runway. But you could plan to release, maybe not 50 games across eight years, but several games across a few years. Treating game development like a craft or discipline that needs to be learned over time, across multiple released projects, is a solid way to minimize your risk.\"\n\nBattling monsters in Valbrace, game 37 of 50 | Image credit: Mossmouth/UFO 50\n\nHearing Yu's philosophy on games as works of art contextualizes the prospect of future innovation in the indie space and where the craft is going from here. As far as the UFO 50 team is concerned, the game should stand on its own, and post-launch support will only come in to fix bugs and streamline the experience.\n\n\"To me the game itself is the main dialogue we're putting out there \u2013 as an artwork, UFO 50 wasn't designed to be something that keeps changing too much after release, barring any issues that are preventing players from engaging with it in the first place. Mostly we're enjoying watching the community experience the game together and are trying to make ourselves available to support that as best we can.\"\n\nYu lights up while discussing why he makes games. He puts forward a perspective brimming with the kind of empathy that permeates the often zany yet absolutely polished products for which he's known. His audience has only grown since he first released Spelunky, a game that has sold over a million copies and delighted fans across the world. According to Yu, games are a people-driven industry and should be treated as such, especially in the indie space.\n\n\"The game itself is the main dialogue we're putting out there \u2013 as an artwork, UFO 50 wasn't designed to be something that keeps changing too much after release\"\n\n\"Games are made by people more than skill sets, so find people you trust and enjoy working with first and foremost,\" he says.\n\nHe continues to espouse this approach when we ask him to elaborate on what he learned during UFO 50's development process.\n\n\"I obviously learned a lot from the other members of the team, who sharpened my eyes in pretty much every area of game-making. The experience also validated a lot of lessons I'd learned from previous projects. For example, the importance of working with people you trust and the joy of providing meaningful experiences that aren't necessarily what players expect or find immediately comfortable.\"\n\nYu has a radically simple vision for the games industry as informed by his experience working on UFO 50. He created the project with a close group of collaborators and friends, so \u2013 when we ask what value continuity has in game making \u2013 he quickly replies with the following: \"I think continuity can be valuable, for sure, but it shouldn't be forced \u2013 developers should work together because they want to.\"\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, Yu says the impetus for UFO 50 was born out of a desire to accomplish a simple yet lofty goal: to have fun making games."

        "article_content": "If I had to recommend a single indie release this year, it'd probably be Mossmouth's UFO 50, mainly because it's a retro game anthology that actually feels like it could've been made back in the NES era (for the most part) while offering a fresh package.\n\nAmidst the usual onslaught of huge releases towards the end of the year, it's hard to find time for smaller titles if you're in this line of work. Hell, I spend like half of my work hours consuming and writing about other stuff, yet video games are the medium that requires more time and attention. It's easy to get burned out, which is why smaller and breezier games are almost as important as the big ones to stay healthy.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nFor the last few weeks, UFO 50 (only available on Steam for now) has been my 'game to play while having something on in the background' and I couldn't be more impressed with what Derek Yu and the talented developers behind Downwell, Air Land & Sea, Skorpulac, Catacomb Kids, and Madhouse have put together over nine flippin' years (check out this report on the collection that VG247 published... back in 2017).\n\nOf course, almost everyone has had more projects in the works meanwhile. Chief among them was Spelunky 2, which Yu finally unleashed in 2020. Meanwhile, UFO 50 continued to evolve in silence, and this last September it dropped without making much noise until the press got on top of it. After spending some time (less than I'd like) with it myself, I'm happy to report folks were not exaggerating. This thing whips and should be in the GOTY conversations coming up.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nSure, plenty of solo developers and indie studios have totally nailed the NES-era aesthetic and overarching design philosophies over the years (I just won't stop here to name countless examples), yet a recurring feeling I have is that most of those either feel a tad too modern despite everything else or just old in the worst possible way (rusty and not very fun to play). UFO 50, meanwhile, while not a complete home run (I mean, it literally packs 50 fully-featured, old-ass titles), completely feels like one of those bootleg cartridges full of whatever.\n\nI'm not gonna lie: I noped the f**k out of a handful of the games I've played so far, mainly because I wasn't in the mood to figure out obtuse mechanics or perfect timings, but almost no title in this fictional collection has felt bland or uninspired. There's a clear intent and vision behind all of them, and even if many don't click with me, I can see someone else enjoying the crap outta them. After all, they cover all sorts of genres and even try to replicate the 'evolution' of a fictional game company during the 1980s. Of course, this has led players to discover a meta layer that only makes the package even nuttier.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nControls are kept pretty simple in most cases too, which definitely helps the accessibility factor that permeates the whole thing. I'd consider most of the games included 'hard' by today's standards, but in most cases, it all comes down to the unique game design and the developers going 'look, you gotta master this s**t like back in the day, no excuses' (which rocks). This also applies to titles that include a multiplayer option or are straight-up designed as local party games; they're meant to be easy to pick up and just play in quick sessions.\n\nThis ain't a review, so I won't pretend to have played the full collection nor I'll get into specifics. This is a super juicy bundle of joy that I'll be playing for a long time, and I'm taking my time with it. It shines brighter when played between larger gaming sessions or during lunch breaks, and I strongly believe it doesn't benefit from brain-rotting, sweaty marathons better suited for modern video games. This is the message I'm trying to get across; I want you to discover what it has to offer for yourself.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nThis also means it's sort of the perfect game to play on your Steam Deck; I'd be surprised if it doesn't reach the Switch sooner rather than later. Instead of \"one more round,\" you'll be saying \"one more game,\" as you never know what you'll come across next. It's okay if you never beat them, as the experience alone of booting them up and fumbling around is magical and enriching enough. In a way, UFO 50 brings back that magic of ancient games you booted up over and over again but rarely managed to beat. Achievements await true sickos though.\n\nOkay, maybe I'll let you have some of my personal recommendations so far before I leave: Mortol, Velgress, Attactics, Bushido Ball, Camouflage, Campanella, Warptank (this one is genuinely fantastic), and Porgy. Try not to look them up before jumping in, trust me. This wild ride shouldn't be spoiled by our modern model of consumption. Your list of favorites might look very different, and that's the entire point of this trip down a memory lane that doesn't quite exist."

        "article_content": "When GitHub Copilot launched and started autocompleting lines of code \u2014 and, later, entire code snippets \u2014 the question many people were asking was: how long until we can just describe an app in natural language and Copilot will build it for us? We\u2019ve seen quite a few experiments in this arena in recent months, but now, GitHub itself is throwing its weight behind this idea with the announcement of GitHub Spark at the company\u2019s annual GitHub Universe conference in San Francisco.\n\nSpark, which is officially an experiment the company is launching out of its GitHub Next labs, allows you to quickly build a small web app using nothing but natural language. Experienced developers can still see and edit the code \u2014 and underneath it all is a GitHub repository, GitHub Actions and Microsoft\u2019s Azure CosmosDB as the default database for applications that need one \u2014 but that\u2019s optional. Ideally, you\u2019ll be able to use a chat-like experience to create a prototype and then refine it in subsequent steps.\n\nTo build an app, you start with an initial prompt and Spark will show you a live preview within a few seconds. From there, you can finetune the app and iterate by going back and forth with the bot.\n\n\u201cWe truly believe this is the next step of personal software creation,\u201d GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke told me. \u201cThese micro apps, they\u2019re not intended to replace the professional developer. They\u2019re intended to be a tool for you to explore ideas, for you to build little bots, little helpers in your day-to-day \u2014 or to just explore software development with natural language\u201d\n\nWhile GitHub\u2019s materials talk about Spark as a tool for building \u2018micro apps,\u2019 Dohmke told me that he wasn\u2019t actually sure if there were built-in limitations to how complex a Spark application could get and a GitHub spokesperson confirmed that there are indeed no limits on prompts or capacity right now (though that may change after the technical preview). Dohmke noted that Spark can use any web API and leverage AI models itself and that he is excited to see how far GitHub\u2019s users will push this tool.\n\nImage Credits:GitHub\n\n\u201cIt will be very exciting to see, honestly, what users can do, how big of an application they can build with just the power of natural language and this simple user interface that really is designed for you to explore ideas, to spark new ideas,\u201d he said.\n\nSince GitHub Copilot now allows users to choose which large language model they want to use, it\u2019s no surprise that Spark offers the same capability, with users getting the choice between the recent versions of Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet and OpenAI\u2019s GPT models.\n\nImage Credits:GitHub\n\nUsers can easily share their Sparks with customized access controls. What\u2019s maybe even more interesting, though, is that those users can also take the shared code and build upon it themselves.\n\nDevelopers who want to take these applications even further can look at the code at any time \u2014 and edit it if there\u2019s an issue, which Dohmke acknowledges could happen. AI isn\u2019t perfect, after all. \u201cYou can, of course, look into the code base,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have an understanding of the code base, you can also look at the code directly and modify that, which is often helpful when the AI makes a mistake \u2014 which does happen.\u201d"

        "article_content": "click to enlarge RMPRS\n\nclick to enlarge The Croke-Patterson Mansion back when its ghosts might still have been drawing breath. YouTube\n\nThe first volume of the(RMPS) starts with this dedication: \"To all those whose lives are remembered through ghost stories and folklore.\"It's an appropriate mission statement for the dynamic duo of Denver authors Robert Lewis and Bryan Bonner, who say they do what they do \u2014 and write about it \u2014 to pay homage to the \"enduring presence\" of spirits they seek to record and document.Those tales of things that go bump in the night continue in their new book,, now available at local bookstores and on the Polymath Press website \"Our overall purpose is to do our best to get to the bottom of paranormal claims,\" says Lewis. \"If that means finally finding the real scientific proof or evidence of ghosts or aliens or whatever other paranormal entity, that\u2019s about the most exciting thing we can think of. On the other hand, if it means helping people understand that what they\u2019ve been experiencing has a natural explanation and they don\u2019t need to be afraid of something spooky in their house, that also seems like a good day\u2019s work.\"The RMPS was founded by Bonner more than 25 years ago, when he wanted to examine paranormal activity in the Rocky Mountain region but found himself disillusioned with how the process was being handled by others with similar interests. \"Most other groups out there at the time were either too eager to believe or too eager to dismiss rather than investigating with an open mind,\" says Lewis, who adds that Bonner started his own group to direct the investigations more analytically and scientifically. Lewis joined the project a few years later.\"We\u2019re dyed-in-the-wool horror nerds,\" Lewis says, \"so we\u2019re drawn to the spooky stories. But we\u2019re also dyed-in-the-wool science and history nerds, so we\u2019re looking for a certain quality of evidence. Therefore, we take a skeptical approach, but in the true sense of the word \u2014 that is, we insist on remaining neutral about whether any individual case is paranormal or not until the evidence is in. And we have to be comfortable with 'I don\u2019t know' as an answer.\"We\u2019re just almost-academics,\" he jokes. \"We\u2019re the kinds of people who read history books and scientific papers for fun, so when we investigate a case or set out to write up our findings, we\u2019re as interested in the historic background or technical side of things as we are in the ghost stories.\"But he quickly asserts that it's more than that: \"It\u2019s also partly a conscious decision to let that [science] shine through in the final drafts, because there don\u2019t seem to be many others out there who take that approach,\" he says. \"Most people who like the ghost stories tend to avoid the academic side of things, and most who write about the academic side of things don\u2019t tend to give the ghost stories their due.\"Thebooks are more recent additions to the RMPS to-do list \u2014 something for which Lewis claims credit. \"The idea for the book series started when I joined up,\" he says, in part because of his own studies in the writing undergraduate program at CU Denver, and a sincere passion for writing. \"Once we started discussing it, we quickly realized we had way too much for a single book, so we set about dividing the case files up into collections. We now have two books on the market, a third in the works, and enough case files left over for at least a fourth. And we\u2019re still out there gathering new stories.\"Those new stories come straight from old Denver. Lewis and Bonner continue to plumb the depths of phenomenons in many city staples: the Denver Press Club, the McClelland School, the County Jail, Union Station and more. And they don't limit themselves to just metro Denver; they've studied the Stanley Hotel and Elkhorn Lodge in Estes Park and the Phoenix Mine in Idaho Springs, as well.Lewis says that there are almost too many promising sites to cover, and many are personal favorites of his. \"It\u2019s honestly hard to choose,\" he admits. \"Even just limiting ourselves to the Denver area, there are so many, it\u2019s like trying to choose a favorite child. But I\u2019d have to say one of the biggest standouts is Cheesman Park [covered in Volume 1]. Partly that\u2019s because it has one of the richest histories we\u2019ve been able to write about, but also because that was a case that really brings together all the elements we like: We got to play historians digging up some of the lesser-known parts of its history, to play scientists working with forensic anthropologists to study some of the bodies that were unearthed in the park, and to play ghost hunters working on the various paranormal claims in the park.\"\n\nHis choice for most notable haunt from Volume 2 is the Croke-Patterson Mansion. \"That one has collected so many ghost stories it might very well be one of the most written-about haunts in Denver,\" says Lewis. \"Plus, it\u2019s a magnificent old building that, again, has a rich history. And perhaps one of the single most memorable odd things we discovered on an investigation, maybe actually the winner for just plain weirdest...but we\u2019ll leave that as a tease for people who want to read our second book.\"\n\n\n\nThe still-unreleased third volume, according to Lewis, will include one of Denver's most historic sites and one of its first brothels: Mattie\u2019s House of Mirrors, the Market Street legend that's now part of Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row.\n\n\n\n\"When we investigated, it was operating as a restaurant \u2014 though now it\u2019s unfortunately no longer open as an independent venue and most of the interior has been replaced,\" he says. \"But it\u2019s another of those places with not only a remarkable history, but a good number of weird occurrences during our investigation, including some strange anomalies with the lights and an audio recording of two distinct but unintelligible voices from an unknown source.\"\n\n\n\nIt's evidence such as those voices that Lewis and Bonner continue to search for \u2014 and Denver's past seems only too happy to provide."

The group has received calls from as far away as Minnesota.\n\nIt began shortly after LaFleur's father died in September 2008.\n\n\"I've always kind of been interested in it,\" he said. \"After my dad passed away, I think I got more interested in it. And that's kind of when I started doing the investigating.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there are any other paranormal investigators actively working in the Sioux City metro, but LaFleur's outfit is likely the best equipped:\n\nThe group primarily engages in investigations, rather than remediation work; however, they've done that too, to some extent.\n\n\"We have done a few cases where we did bring in like a psychic that had been very well-vetted before we brought them in,\" he said. \"In order to help somebody.\"\n\nThe Journal spoke with LaFleur for its Five Questions series. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAre ghosts real?\n\n\"That's a hard one to really answer, but -- I can honestly say that there is something after this life, that we experience, or someplace else that we go. Like, once we leave our physical bodies -- we're basically made of, what, water and energy, right? So, our bodies go back into the ground. The energy goes somewhere. So, to me, the energy just goes back into the atmosphere, or what have you. And that's what allows us to be able to travel after we pass on. Whether or not heaven exists or hell exists, I'm not sure, but, I can say that loved ones do come back and visit.\"\n\nAre there any non-ghost paranormal entities that you encounter?\n\n\"We've had some clients who've claimed to have demonic activity, or malicious-type activity. And we've never been able to substantiate that, or confirm that. Just because we don't capture any evidence for it. Normally if you have a demonic or malicious spirit, they're going to let you know. It doesn't matter who's there, it doesn't matter what time of day it is. We've never come across that. I'm kind of glad.\"\n\nYou use a lot of electronic equipment in your work. How do you feel about the more old-fashioned apparatuses, like Ouija boards, that have been in use for more than a century?\n\n\"Ouija boards, we tend to stay away from those. Just from the fact that, when you start messing around with those things, and if you're not careful, you can open up doors to things that you don't want opened. And if you don't close them correctly, whatever doors you opened stay open. Until somebody who knows what they're doing can close them. And by the time that comes around, you've probably had so much 'activity,' or things happening in your life, that -- you'd probably wish you'd never touched it.\"\n\nYou've said that not all paranormal entities are bad. Are the non-malicious ones friendly, or morally ambiguous, so to speak?\n\n\"I would say that a majority of the ones that we come across, that are what you would call an intelligent entity, is usually what we run across the most. Those are basically entities that know their surroundings, they know what's going on, they know what's happening.\n\nI would say most of the ones that we come across are intelligent, most of the time, and are friendly. Some of them are just hanging around, or they're just visiting, or trying to get attention. They're just trying to get the person's attention to let them know, 'Hey, I'm still here. Don't forget about me.'\"\n\nSo there are relatively few unpleasant ones?\n\n\"Yeah those are -- I wouldn't say that they were like an everyday occurrence. They're a special circumstances kind of thing. And what I mean by that is, if you give off a lot of negative energy, and say you're in a relationship for instance, and in that relationship you constantly fight, you're constantly arguing, you're constantly physically fighting and bringing a lot of negative energy into your atmosphere, your area, then chances are you could draw up something negative, like a poltergeist-type activity. And we've had a few cases where we've run into something like that.\n\nAnd once you have something like that going on, the best way to get rid of it is to stop the fighting, stop the negativity, have somebody come in, do a cleansing of the house and bless it. I'm not afraid to tell people, you know, 'Hey, if you guys are fighting that much and not getting along, you guys need to go get some counseling, go get some help, and try to solve that, so that you can get rid of this energy, and get rid of these things that are happening. Because if not, they're just going to continue happening.'\"\n\nBONUS QUESTION:\n\nSo, the behavior of living people can have an affect on these things?\n\n\"Oh, 100%.\""

        "article_content": "Researchers have uncovered a rare and intelligent fungus. The fungus is called Phanerochaete velutina, and while it isn\u2019t overly intelligent\u2014it won\u2019t be taking over the world anytime soon like the fungus in The Last of Us\u2014it still shows signs of recognizing shapes and even being able to communicate about its surroundings with the rest of its fungal network.\n\nThe researchers who made the discovery highlight their findings in a paper published in the journal Funal Ecology. In the paper, they discuss how they conducted various experiments, including one where they arranged small wood blocks in several different shapes and allowed the fungi to spread within the shapes.\n\nAs the rare and intelligent fungus spread, they found that it was able to make different decisions based on the type of arrangement the blocks had been set up in. Instead of just spreading out from a central point, they were able to change how they spread out to fit the shape more effectively. This suggests a rudimentary level of intelligence is found within P. velutina.\n\nAccording to the paper, when the fungi were placed in a circle arrangement of blocks, they were able to figure out where the blocks were and then pass that information to the rest of the network, as they never moved to the center of the circle. They seemed to realize that no blocks would be found there. The researchers say this means that the fungal mycelium can \u201crecognize\u201d the difference in the spatial arrangement of wooden blocks.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Composable technology decouples front-end systems and offers seamless, personalized customer experiences across multiple channels. Enhance operational agility . Modularity in composable technology allows businesses to quickly adapt to market changes without disrupting entire systems.\n\n. Modularity in composable technology allows businesses to quickly adapt to market changes without disrupting entire systems. Streamline employee tools. A unified operator experience ensures frictionless access to essential tools, which improves efficiency and customer service response times.\n\nBusiness leaders who want to support digital transformations must prioritize agility and responsiveness to meet market demands. It\u2019s also essential that they understand composability to maximize value and ROI.\n\nThe four pillars of composability \u2014 decoupling customer experience, modularity, unifying operator experience and application composition \u2014 provide a strategic roadmap for achieving digital transformation that directly impacts the bottom line.\n\nBy embracing these principles, enterprise teams can drive operational efficiency, unlock substantial value and enhance ROI, and they can ultimately position their organizations for long-term growth and success.\n\nTraditional monolithic systems often hinder agility and innovation, making it difficult for organizations to keep pace. Enter composable technology \u2014 a game-changing approach that enables businesses to create flexible, modular solutions tailored to their unique needs.\n\nThe Core Pillars of Driving Success With Composable Technology\n\nAt the core of this transformative strategy are four essential pillars that help organizations realize significant business value:\n\n1. Decoupling Customer Experience\n\nThe first pillar of composability is decoupling the customer experience from backend systems. This involves adopting a headless architecture, in which the front-end interface is separated from the back-end functionalities. By doing so, businesses can create a seamless, engaging customer experience that is not constrained by the limitations of a monolithic platform.\n\nHeadless systems allow organizations to deliver personalized content and experiences across various channels \u2014 websites, mobile apps and social media \u2014 without the need for extensive back-end modifications. This flexibility not only enhances user engagement but also improves performance and SEO rankings.\n\nWhen customers encounter a cohesive brand experience, regardless of the platform they use, it fosters trust and loyalty, ultimately driving conversion rates.\n\n2. Achieving Modularity\n\nThe second pillar emphasizes the importance of achieving modularity within a technology stack. In a composable environment, each component functions as a self-contained module, eliminating single points of failure that can disrupt operations. This modular approach ensures that businesses can adapt quickly to changes in the market or customer demands without overhauling their entire system.\n\nBy leveraging APIs, organizations can integrate various services \u2014 such as search, payments and inventory management \u2014 into a cohesive ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows for real-time data sharing, enabling businesses to provide accurate information to customers and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nMoreover, modularity promotes resilience. If one service experiences downtime, others can continue to function independently, minimizing disruptions and maintaining customer satisfaction.\n\n3. Unifying Operator Experience\n\nThe third pillar focuses on achieving frictionless experiences independent of platforms. In a composable architecture, businesses should create a unified portal where all employees \u2014 marketers, sales teams and customer service agents \u2014 can access the information and tools they need without navigating multiple systems.\n\nImagine a customer service representative who can quickly access a customer's order history, profile information and real-time inventory data from a single interface. This streamlined access not only enhances the agent's efficiency but also improves the customer experience. When employees have the right tools at their fingertips, they can respond to inquiries faster, resolve issues more effectively and drive higher customer satisfaction.\n\n4. Facilitating Application Composition\n\nThe final pillar of composability is application composition, which allows businesses to build new applications and features without extensive coding. This is particularly important in an era where speed and agility are paramount. By leveraging low-code or no-code platforms, organizations can empower non-technical users to create and modify applications quickly.\n\nApplication composition enables businesses to respond to market changes and customer needs with unprecedented speed. For example, if a new payment provider emerges or a new customer engagement feature becomes necessary, organizations can integrate these changes without lengthy development cycles. This flexibility not only enhances the customer experience but also drives innovation, allowing businesses to experiment and iterate on new ideas rapidly.\n\nRelated Article: How Stack Composability and AI Can Supercharge Martech Stacks\n\nWhy Composable Technology Drives Digital Success\n\nIncorporating the four pillars of composable technology empowers businesses to thrive in a competitive landscape. By adopting a composable approach, organizations can create agile, customer-centric solutions that drive value and foster growth.\n\nAs businesses navigate their digital transformation journeys, it is crucial to prioritize these pillars. By doing so, they can realize the full potential of their technology investments, enhance customer experiences and position themselves for long-term success.\n\nIn a world where adaptability is key, composable technology stands out as a vital strategy for any organization looking to stay ahead of the curve and meet the demands of today's consumers.\n\nLearn how you can join our contributor community."
