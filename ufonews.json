He is a foundational figure in the national pantheon and leader of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as it settled Boston.\n\nWinthrop\u2019s sensational account of \"a great light in the night\" was witnessed by a group of \"sober, discreet\" and \"credible persons\" over Muddy River in Boston \u2014 a trickle of a creek that today wraps around American sports landmark Fenway Park.\n\nMeet The American Who First Planted Apples In The Colonies: William Blaxton, Eccentric Settler\n\nWinthrop's leadership of the fledgling Massachusetts colony shaped the destiny of the United States, established more than a century after his death.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\nHe has serious street cred in academia, making his spectacular record of unexplained phenomena all the more remarkable.\n\nJohn Winthrop (1587 or 1588 to 1649) was an English-born Puritan who became governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony. He also recorded America's first UFO sighting in 1639. Image is from a 19th century engraving by C.W. Sharpe after Vandyke. On right, from \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\"\n\n\"John Winthrop\u2019s journal has long served as a cornerstone of Massachusetts historical scholarship,\" the Massachusetts Historical Society writes in a recent look at the Puritan's UFO sightings.\n\n\"He diligently recorded the events of his life, along with the trials and tribulations of the people of the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the first 19 years of its existence.\"\n\nWinthrop\u2019s incredible tales of aerial phenomena in early America, long unknown, generated sudden interest in recent years, after federal government and military officials admitted that it\u2019s been studying UFOs for decades.\n\nStories of paranormal and unexplained phenomena were effectively mainstreamed for academics and serious analysts.\n\nU.S. Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray explains a video of unidentified aerial phenomena, as he testifies before a House Intelligence Committee subcommittee hearing at the U.S. Capitol on May 17, 2022. Federal officials' recent admissions that the government has been investigating UFOs for decades generated interest in reports of unexplained phenomena by Massachusetts Bay Colony founder John Winthrop.\n\nFew Americans were more serious than Winthrop.\n\nHe was a devout Christian and an industrious nation builder. Despite the hardship of carving a new civilization from the wilderness, and governing a new society, he dutifully kept almost daily records of life in the colony for nearly two decades.\n\nOne 2005 biography is titled \"John Winthrop: America's Forgotten Founding Father.\"\n\n\"His energies seemed prodigious and inexhaustible,\" PBS Frontline said of Winthrop.\n\n\"Repeatedly elected governor, he was chiefly responsible for maintaining civic and social order.\"\n\nJohn Winthrop was born on Jan. 12, 1587 or 1588, in Edwardstone, Suffolk County, England, to Adam and Anne (Browne) Winthrop.\n\nThe Arbella, a copy of Gov. John Winthrop's flagship, moored in Forest River Park in Salem, Massachusetts, on the edge of a model pioneer village.\n\nBoth his parents came from prosperous families, according to various accounts.\n\nHe began journal-keeping in 1605 while still a teenager, chronicling his growing devotion to Christ. His faith was increasingly at odds with national sentiment after King Charles I, an Anglican sympathetic to Roman Catholicism, gained the throne in 1625.\n\nWinthrop departed for the New World in the spring of 1630 aboard the Arbella with an expedition of Puritans to establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony, about 35 miles north of the Plymouth Colony settled by the Pilgrims in 1620.\n\nWinthrop issued a message on the ship that has echoed through American history.\n\nIt\u2019s remembered today as the \"city upon a hill\" sermon \u2014 inspired by several biblical passages and delivered to a daring people fleeing decrepit old Europe to create a New World in service of Christ.\n\n\"For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us,\" Winthrop said.\n\nReception of a Narragansett warrior by John Winthrop, Massachusetts, c 1630s (c 1880). Winthrop was the leader of a group of Puritan settlers who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. A print from \"Cassell's History of the United States\" by Edmund Ollier, Volume I, Cassell Petter and Galpin, London, c 1880.\n\n\"So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world.\"\n\nThe \"city upon a hill\" sermon helped establish the concept of American exceptionalism \u2014 a new society that would be a \"model of Christian charity\" for the world to admire and emulate.\n\nMeet The American Who Inspired The Nation In Two World Wars: Christian Soldier Sgt. Alvin York\n\nThe phrase \"a city upon a hill\" has been widely quoted by following generations, most notably by President Ronald Reagan, who cited Winthrop by name in his farewell address.\n\n\"I've spoken of the shining city all my political life,\" Reagan said to the nation on Jan. 11, 1989.\n\nJohn Winthrop, Puritan founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, chronicled the minutiae of nation-building for 19 years in a detailed journal. His March 1, 1639, entry includes the first report of a UFO encounter in America. He recorded two other UFO sightings in Boston in 1644.\n\n\"In my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace \u2026 That's how I saw it, and see it still.\"\n\nWinthrop was God-fearing, intrepid, faithful, hard-working and diligent \u2014 serious in faith and deed. Few people in American history had less time, inclination or motive to devote to fantasy or foolishness.\n\nWinthrop\u2019s report of an eerie UFO encounter on a winter night in Boston is sandwiched between perfunctory passages about business dealings with the natives.\n\nThe subject turned suddenly.\n\nEngraving depicting a lighter, a type of flat-bottomed barge used to transfer goods and passengers to and from moored ships. Dated 19th century. Puritan leader John Winthrop recorded America's first UFO incident in 1639, witnessed by three men on a lighter similar to this one. His report hints they were also abducted.\n\n\"In this year one James Everell, a sober, discreet man, and two others, saw a great light in the night at Muddy River,\" Winthrop wrote on March 1, 1639.\n\n\"When it stood still, it flamed up, and was about three yards square; when it ran it was contracted into the figure of a swine.\"\n\nWinthrop went on, \"It ran swift as an arrow toward Charlton [Charlestown] and up and down about two or three hours. They were come down in their lighter [a small barge] about a mile, and, when it was over, they found themselves carried quite back against the tide to the place they came from. Divers[e] other persons saw the same light, after, about the same place.\"\n\n\"That's stunning,\" UFO researcher Nick Pope told Fox News Digital after hearing the story for the first time.\n\nNick Pope, a former UFO investigator for the U.K. Ministry of Defense and frequent contributor to \"Ancient Aliens\" on The History Channel, calls Puritan leader John Winthrop's passages on UFO's in early colonial Boston \"pretty stunning.\"\n\nPope is a former UFO investigator for the U.K. Ministry of Defense and contributor to \"Ancient Aliens\" on The History Channel.\n\nSeveral sources say ignis fatuus, a spark of swamp gas, is the likely cause of the strange light.\n\nAngels In Our Midst? One Scientist Explains Why The Bible Supports Extraterrestrials\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t explain how the phantom light raced across the river \u2014 or why Everell and the other men in the boat wound up a mile downstream.\n\n\"Some researchers would interpret this as a possible alien abduction if it happened today,\" authors Jacques Vallee and Chris Aubeck wrote in \"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times.\"\n\n\"Winthrop's UFO\" was an art installation placed in 2019 along Muddy River in Boston, where Puritan leader John Winthrop recorded America's first UFO sighting in 1639. Artists Ann Hirsch and Jeremy Angier of A+J Art+Design created it; it represents the figure of a light in the shape of a swine, as Winthrop described.\n\nWinthrop reported two more UFO sightings in 1644, the first on Jan. 18.\n\n\"About midnight, three men, coming in a boat to Boston, saw two lights arise out of the water near the north point of the town cove, in form like a man, and went at a small distance to the town, and so to the south point, and there vanished away.\"\n\nMeet The American Who Rowed Washington Across The Delaware On Christmas: Sailor-soldier John Glover\n\nA week later another supernatural encounter was \"seen by many,\" he wrote.\n\n\"A light like the moon arose about the N.E. point in Boston, and met the former at Nottles Island, and there they closed in one, and then parted, and closed and parted diverse times, and so went over the hill in the island and vanished. Sometimes they shot out flames and sometimes sparkles.\"\n\nWinthrop never mentioned the events again.\n\nHis journal was not published until 1825. The mysterious passages were ignored amid the insight into colonial history culled from his voluminous writings.\n\nMuddy River in Boston on Jan. 18, 2022. John Wintrhop, Puritan founder of Massachusetts Bay Colony, recorded America's first UFO sighting along Muddy River on March 1, 1639.\n\nThe eerie objects remain unidentified today, yet come from one of the most trusted sources in American scholarship.\n\n\"I think it speaks to the fact that those skeptics don\u2019t like to admit, but most UFO witnesses, like Everell or Winthrop, are serious, sober individuals,\" said Pope.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t surprise me you have these very historical figures seeing these things. It\u2019s vindication of what we see today. If you look at modern [UFO] accounts, very often they\u2019re [from] police officers, pilots, military personnel, radar operators.\"\n\nJohn Winthrop died of natural causes on March 26, 1649. He was 61 or 62 years old.\n\nHe\u2019s buried today in King\u2019s Chapel Burying Ground in the heart of downtown Boston.\n\nEstablished in 1630, it\u2019s one of the nation\u2019s oldest cemeteries.\n\nJohn Winthrop, Illustration, \"Ridpath's History of the World,\" Volume III, by John Clark Ridpath, LL. D., Merrill and Baker Publishers, New York, 1897.\n\nBoston to this day comprises the bulk of Suffolk County, Massachusetts \u2014 the area still carrying the name of Winthrop's homeland in England, some 400 years later.\n\nThe town of Winthrop, next to Boston, juts proudly out into the harbor today.

It goes back to the dawn of time,\" said Pope.\n\n\"What we\u2019re just beginning to realize is that people have always seen these strange things. We have fiery chariots in the Bible and we have strange images in medieval and renaissance paintings and in old petroglyphs.\"\n\nTo read more stories in this unique \"Meet the American Who\u2026\" series from Fox News Digital, click here .\n\nHe added, \"There\u2019s no smoke without fire.

        "article_content": "Pascagoula, Miss., is known for building Navy ships, but city officials say it's actually famous for two other things.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s the birthplace of Jimmy Buffett. The city put up a historical marker outside his childhood home.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the second thing: space aliens. The city put up a marker for them too.\n\n\u201cIt was the evening of Oct. 11, 1973 when two local shipyard workers went fishing,\u201d the marker says, at the edge of the Pascagoula River.\n\nThe sign says Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker spotted a football-shaped craft, which took them aboard.\n\n\u201cInside the craft, Hickson was examined by a robotic eye, then both men were deposited back on the river bank and the [spaceship] shot away,\u201d the marker says. Stamped at the bottom is the seal of the City of Pascagoula and the Jackson County Historical and Genealogical Society.\n\nMayor Jay Willis says when it came to writing this marker, authorities saw no reason to hedge.\n\n\u201cBecause these two guys had the same story of what happened, how it happened for the rest of their lives,\u201d Willis explains. \u201cThis marker is going to be there for a long, long time. It\u2019s a lasting tribute\u2026to what occurred right here in Pascagoula.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way to really know what happened that night in 1973, when the men waded head first into one of humanity\u2019s greatest mysteries: Are we alone?\n\nBut the marker is now one of at least 15 that say, without hesitation, that aliens have come to visit earth.\n\nThey join more than 180,000 other historical markers dotting the country\u2019s landscape, and NPR found they wouldn\u2019t be the first to claim something that may, or may not, be true.\n\nThere\u2019s a marker in Massachusetts that claims the town was once home to a real, live wizard. New York has a marker about a ghost that plays the fiddle on a bridge in the moonlight.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut locals say Pascagoula\u2019s alien marker is no tourist stunt.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be known for something, why the heck not?\u201d says Rebecca Davis who helped write the marker when she ran the development group Main Street Pascagoula.\n\nShe says at first most people in town didn\u2019t believe the men\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cThey thought they were just off their rockers,\u201d Davis says, standing next to the wooded area by the river where the men said they were abducted. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the Bible Belt, you know? Like my grandma told me, 'Girl, hush, we don\u2019t talk about that stuff.'\u201d\n\nLaura Sullivan / NPR / NPR Rebecca Davis, who used to run Main Street Pascagoula, helped write the marker. She says people today are more open to the idea that the story could be true.\n\nBut as time passed, Davis says, the feeling changed. There was also a recording of the men, who have since died, talking about their experience that believers say gives it credibility.\n\n\u201cPeople back then, I really think they wanted to believe, but they were scared to believe,\u201d she says, \u201cand now\u2019s a different time, a different age, and more openness.\u201d\n\nThat openness has spread across American society. Half of Americans now believe that military reports of UFOs are likely evidence of intelligent life outside earth, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey .\n\nBut openness is different than etching facts into a bronze or acrylic plaque, and staking it into the dirt.\n\nScott and Suzanne Ramsey put up one of the nation\u2019s first alien markers in 1999 in the high desert near Aztec, N.M., where they say a spaceship crashed in 1948.\n\n\u201cWe welded up a metal stand and had a local trophy shop do the engraving,\u201d Scott Ramsey says. They replaced it with a new version in 2007.\n\n\u201cI think it kind\u2019ve lends credibility to the fact that something did happen there,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s always been difficult to argue with historical markers. That\u2019s part of their allure. Rewriting them means taking the whole sign down and starting over.\n\nAnd that permanence has made alien markers an attraction. The Aztec visitor center now hands out maps and hosts the Alien Run mountain bike race .\n\nUFO enthusiasts say they pass around road trip ideas. Start in Lincoln, N.H., where a marker says Betty and Barney Hill were abducted. Head to Franklin, Ky., where another describes how a National Guard pilot died chasing a UFO. On to Shiloh, Ill., which tells of a \u201cconfirmed UFO sighting.\u201d\n\nFascination with extraterrestrials isn\u2019t new, but what was once left to low-budget sci-fi movies has taken on a new seriousness. There\u2019s declassified military reports, even interest from Congress.\n\nStill, none of it has amounted to much actual proof, and even as Frank Drake pointed the first radio telescope at the stars in 1960, and far more sophisticated probes have been searching for the last 20 years, those efforts have so far been met with silence.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped cities from stamping alien markers with official emblems and crests.\n\nOn a recent afternoon in Pascagoula Thearon Ephriam and his uncle David Ephriam took a break from fishing to read the sign.\n\n\u201cAs dusk fell a buzzing sound alerted them to a football-shaped craft hovering behind them,\u201d David Ephriam read from the sign as he started to chuckle. \u201cAin't this something?\u201d he asked.\n\nLaura Sullivan / NPR / NPR Pascagoula\u2019s alien marker is now one of at least 15 that claim extraterrestrials have come to earth.\n\nThearon Ephriam pointed to the City of Pascagoula logo. \u201cThey put a whole stand up,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cGotta be some truth in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have to be aware when we come out here,\u201d David said.\n\nThearon raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf we see a football-shaped craft we know to get low.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf one comes up behind you and looks like a football,\u201d David laughed, \u201cdon\u2019t look back, dive.\u201d\n\nHowever future researchers may view these signs years from now, even UFO enthusiasts wouldn\u2019t argue with that advice.\n\nCan't see the graphics in this story?

        "article_content": "Ever since ChatGPT made waves, tech companies have been racing to release their artificial intelligence competitors, and Google has stepped up its AI game with Gemini.\n\nLaunched in December 2023 by Google DeepMind, this next-generation model has been integrated across a range of Google products, including Google Search and Workspace and even Pixel phones, making these tools smarter and more responsive and intuitive.\n\nSo what is Gemini? It's a large language model developed to understand and generate text that is very similar to what a human might write. It was designed to integrate advanced AI into everyday user interactions and complex enterprise solutions, and you can interact with Google's LLM via the Gemini chatbot on the web or via mobile app.\n\nGemini has four models: Ultra, Pro, Flash and Nano, each designed for different use cases. One new standout feature is its expanded token context window, which allows for more extended and coherent responses. Gemini 1.5 Flash now offers a 1 million token window, while the 1.5 Pro model pushes that to a whopping 2 million. In comparison, ChatGPT caps at 32,000 tokens in the expanded version.\n\nIf you haven't yet developed a soft spot for everything AI-related and all of this sounds confusing, keep on reading.\n\nCommon AI Terminology: LLMs, generative AI, chatbots, tokens\n\nAs technology develops, new artificial intelligence terminology arises. Before we dive deeper, let's quickly break down some previously mentioned key terms.\n\nGenerative AI (or gen AI) refers to AI systems that can create content \u2014 think text, images or even music \u2014 based on the data they've been trained on. LLMs like Gemini are a type of generative AI. They learn from massive datasets of text and code and then use that knowledge to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nYou've likely interacted with an LLM before, whether through an online customer service chatbot, or even ChatGPT.\n\nThese chatbots use LLMs to engage in real-time conversations, provide you with information and solve problems \u2014 though sometimes, they miss the mark and give some weird answers. That is called AI hallucinations. And Google had its fair share of mishaps with them. But, more on this later.\n\nTokens are the building blocks of text that AI models use to process language. When AI reads and generates text, it breaks everything into small chunks called tokens. These can be whole words, parts of words or even punctuation. For example, in the sentence \"Hello, world!\" the AI might treat \"Hello\" and \",\" as separate tokens.\n\nSo when we talk about token limits (e.g., the aforementioned million token context window Gemini has), we're talking about how much the AI can \"remember\" from the conversation to keep things coherent and relevant.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: as with any new technology, Gemini is still under development, and artificial intelligence continues to improve practically daily.\n\nGemini on Pixel Phones and Google Search\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold James Martin/CNET\n\nSo how does Gemini play into the devices you use every day? For starters, it's built right into Google's Pixel phones, supercharging many of the phones' AI features.\n\nYou've probably used your Pixel to transcribe a voice message or generate a quick email response. That's Gemini doing its magic in the background. It basically helps Pixel get things done faster and more intuitively.\n\nGemini also plays a big role in AI Overviews on Google Search. If you've noticed more detailed, contextually rich answers popping up at the top of your searches, that's because of this integration. Gemini helps break down complicated topics into bite-size explanations in the search results.\n\nGoogle came under fire for some advice AI Overviews threw out to users at its launch, including things like eating rocks daily and putting glue in pizza recipes. Google reacted promptly and has since fine-tuned its tool.\n\nAll users in the US aged 13 and older who manage their own Google accounts can access AI Overviews. In other countries, such as the UK, India, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia and Japan, users aged 18 and above can also access this feature. Google plans to continue expanding it globally, with the goal of reaching over a billion users by the end of 2024.\n\nNow some people don't like this feature, and the downside is you can't disable AI Overviews. However, we've covered a few workarounds that might help with that.\n\nFixing the infamous image generation fiasco with new launches\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nWhen Gemini first launched, it didn't take long for things to go sideways. Google faced criticism over some hallucinations and how it depicted historical figures and different races. It made headlines for showing Black and Asian Nazi soldiers, which, as you can imagine, didn't go over well. Critics accused Google of trying too hard to show diversity, but instead, it made things worse. Google hit the brakes on Gemini's image generation, promising to clean up the mess.\n\nOn Aug. 28, after refining the technology, Google announced the latest version of its text-to-image tool, Imagen 3, which will soon be available to Gemini Advanced, Business and Enterprise subscribers. However, the ability to generate images of people is still on hold as Google plays it safe this time around.\n\nEarlier, on Aug. 13, Google launched Gemini Live for Advanced subscribers on Android devices, with plans to expand to iOS soon. Gemini Live offers hands-free, real-time conversations with 10 new voice options, even when the app is in the background or your phone is locked.

        "article_content": "15 years ago, this movie took the world by surprise \u2026 and scared everyone who saw it\n\nFifteen years ago, on September 25, 2009, Paranormal Activity was released in theaters and scared the pants out of audiences everywhere. Even before the movie\u2019s premiere, it had already become legendary. Instead of debuting via a massive theatrical release rollout, the micro-budgeted movie was screened in college towns across the country to drum up word of mouth.\n\nIt worked. Thanks to the (somewhat still new) popularity of Facebook and the prominence of texting on phones, Paranormal Activity didn\u2019t need a marketing campaign. Frightened audiences told everyone they knew about the scary movie they just watched. Soon, the internet was ablaze with word of this new movie that didn\u2019t have stars anyone had heard of before.\n\nThe birth of a new horror franchise\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nFilmed in the found-footage style, the movie centers around a young couple, Micah and Katie, who are determined to capture the paranormal activity happening in their house. But it\u2019s not just a ghost that\u2019s haunting them, it\u2019s a demon. Even worse, the more attention they give to it, the stronger and more active it becomes.\n\nParamount realized Paranormal Activity was destined to become a hit and picked it up for wide distribution. When the movie finally premiered in theaters across the country, audiences were terrified. When speaking to Empire, Jordan Peele recounted his experience seeing the movie in theaters. \u201cWhen the s*** hit the fan, Katie is dragged out of the room screaming. The audience absolutely lost it,\u201d the horror icon said.\n\nSince then, Paranormal Activity has received six sequels and has become one of the most prominent examples of found-footage movies ever. It\u2019s also just as scary as it was in 2009, and aside from the dated use of the camcorder, it still looks and feels terrifying.\n\nParanormal Activity was genuinely scary to a desensitized audience\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nPeele isn\u2019t the only one who was horrified by Paranormal Activity. In 2009 Roger Ebert even gave the movie 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \u201cIt illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x.\u201d\n\nThe movie was so scary that its trailers even used audience footage from its screenings to show how horrified moviegoers were. By the end of its box office run, Paranormal Activity had raked in over $193 million.\n\nSimilarly to The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity gets a lot of its horror from what audiences don\u2019t see. Strange sounds and small movements captured by the camera seem trivial, but when the movie\u2019s pacing is flawless, each small instance can feel monumental and the anticipation that builds between them is undeniable.\n\nAs the movie continues, the stakes get higher and the hauntings more intense. But the film never uses special effects or has some haggard-looking ghost running around. Even its \u201cbig moments\u201d are subtle compared to other horror movies. For example, at one point Micah scatters baby powder around the floor to see if something really is walking through their house at night. When he turns the lights on, the prints left behind look like some kind of lizard or bird.\n\nEven as someone who doesn\u2019t believe in the paranormal, this movie still gets to me. It utilizes our natural fears, like being in a big, empty, dark house at night \u2014 and then hearing a strange sound in the hallway.\n\nBut the movie definitely requires some patience. If you like being scared by CGI-generated monsters and loud musical cues, then this probably isn\u2019t the movie for you. But if you turn off all the lights in a quiet room late at night and watch Paranormal Activity, you will discover just how horrifying it is.\n\nParanormal Activity ushered in the paranormal horror era\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nThe success of Paranormal Activity was so massive it created a sea change in the horror genre. When the film premiered initially in 2007 and then had its full release in 2009, horror was in its full-blown \u201ctorture porn\u201d phase, where filmmakers were doing everything they could to have the goriest and grossest torture movie possible. The Saw franchise, Hostel, and The Hills Have Eyes reboots were proving to be box office hits, and The Human Centipede had just made its debut at FrightFest.\n\nBut after Paranormal Activity outgrossed all those movies (Saw II for example was the highest-grossing Saw film, making just under $148 million, which was $40 million less than Paranormal Activity), Hollywood realized a new horror trend may have just emerged. The torture porn trend ended almost immediately after Paranormal Activity, and by the following year, the paranormal era was hitting high gear and gore was gone.\n\nAfter Paranormal Activity, more paranormal horror films followed, including numerous Paranormal Activity sequels, as well as Insidious and The Conjuring, both of which would spawn their own massive franchises. There was also a wave of other low-budget found-footage paranormal movies that, while never making a huge splash, became notable hits within the horror community, like Hell House LLC, Grave Encounters, and The Taking of Deborah Logan.\n\nNow could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParanormal Activity was made and released during a period of massive change. Social media had just become a widely used tool by society, and smartphones had just started rolling out to the general public.\n\nNew technology that wasn\u2019t around at the time of its release could be used to make a really fun modern Paranormal Activity sequel or reboot. Between Nest cams, doorbell cameras, smartphones, drones, and even dashcams, there are so many new tools that could be used to reinvent the found-footage genre and add new touches.\n\nThe streaming era could also be helpful, since studios don\u2019t need to invest as much money into theatrical releases and instead can release low-budget movies on their streaming platforms for much less investment. With how cheap the Paranormal Activity movies are to make, they could be perfect for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Shudder, or even Tubi.\n\nAnother reason why now could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity movie is that belief in the paranormal has actually risen in recent years. There\u2019s a lot of really touchy topics that have probably caused this \u2014 largely America\u2019s regression into fanaticism and conspiratorial thinking \u2014 but modern studies have shown some shocking results. In 2021, it was reported that 57% of Americans believe in ghosts, and in 2023 another study revealed that over half of Americans think they\u2019ve actually been visited by a ghost.\n\nThese findings might make some of us question our fellow Americans and their belief systems, but for Hollywood and anyone wanting to make a paranormal movie to scare the crap out of people\u2026now seems to be the perfect time.\n\nYou can watch Paranormal Activity on Max."

        "article_content": "Church attendance has sharply declined, and the number of people who express interest in religion is decreasing. Vermont, New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, and Maine reported the lowest percentage of adults who say they attend church or religious services. The biggest drop in attendance in the past 20 years has been amongst U.S. Catholics.\n\nAt the same time, belief in the paranormal is becoming more common. Seventy-five percent of us believe in the paranormal and about 20 percent of Americans claim that they have actually seen a ghost. Research suggests that both belief in the paranormal and religiosity are characterized by similar brain states that also underlie anxiety, proneness to suggestion and fantasy, and limited critical thinking.\n\nWhy are atheism and belief in the paranormal becoming increasingly popular? Is the human brain evolving away from one form of fantasy beliefs while embracing another? Possibly, but it is impossible to ignore the fact that religious beliefs and acceptance of the paranormal have been a durable feature of the world\u2019s cultures for many millennia. Anthropologists estimate that at least 18,000 different gods, goddesses, and various animals or objects have been worshiped by humans since our species first appeared. Evolution has clearly selected for a brain that has the ability to accept a logically absurd world of supernatural causes and beings.\n\nRecent studies have investigated which resting state brain circuits and which frequency states are utilized by skeptical nonbelievers as compared to believers. Previous studies have demonstrated that a resting state analysis is objective, stable, and capable of revealing individual differences in how the brain functions. Essentially, the analysis provides a kind of \"neural fingerprint\" of which brain regions are involved in the processing of emotions, memories, and thoughts. The believers studied were Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, or other.\n\nNot believing in a god is due to the activation of distinct higher-order brain networks.\n\nThe results demonstrated that religious believers are more likely to use more intuitive and heuristic reasoning and that religious nonbelievers are more likely to use more deliberative and analytic reasoning. For example, nonbelievers are more likely to process sensory information, such as something they see, in a more deliberative manner that involves higher cortical areas, called top-down processing, involved in reasoning. In contrast, religious believers are more likely to interpret visual information in a more emotional or intuitive manner, called bottom-up processing, that involves more ancient brain systems. Religious believers share this bottom-up processing bias with people who believe in the supernatural or paranormal activity, such as telekinesis or clairvoyance. Recent evidence suggests that religious fundamentalists have a network of brain regions located in the right hemisphere that may be damaged by injury or simply inherited.\n\nParanormal believers' thinking is frequently biased by intuitive beliefs. An analysis of brain states showed that paranormal belief is related to the reduced power of the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands, all indicative of a reduced level of inhibitory control and critical analysis of incoming sensory information. (To learn more about alpha and beta waves, go here.)\n\nThe increase in the number of religious nonbelievers and paranormal believers may be in response to shifts in our culture as well as more accurate scientific explanations for natural phenomena that once depended on the intervention of mythical beings. The shift may indicate that our brain requires some form of fantasy belief and that gods are simply being replaced by ghosts."

Naked-eye theragnostics refers to a two-pronged approach to diagnosing and treating cancer that can be detected with the naked eye.\n\n\u201cFor example, if we can really make these molecules absorb sunlight very effectively and make their lifetime long enough, then they can be put on highways or pavements. They absorb the light in the daytime and emit at night. (This way) we will not need any power supply to see signals on the streets at night,\u201d Prob Liu told The Straits Times.\n\nThis discovery bagged her the 2024 President\u2019s Science Award, making her the first woman scientist to win the prize as an individual.\n\nThe award is part of the annual President\u2019s Science and Technology Awards given to scientists whose work has led to significant scientific, technological or economic benefits for the country.\n\nThree researchers and one team received this year\u2019s four awards, which were given out on Sept 27 at Nanyang Auditorium, located within the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) campus.\n\nThe other awards are the President\u2019s Science and Technology Medal \u2013 the nation\u2019s top scientific honour \u2013 and the President\u2019s Technology Award."

        "article_content": "For uncovering how a cell population helps ensure food, liquid and acid reflux are kept out of our airway \u2013 and instead sent to our GI tract \u2013 Laura Seeholzer is the winner of the 2024 Eppendorf & Science Prize for Neurobiology. Her findings, detailed in April in Science, have motivated her to study what\u2019s happening with these cells in diseases where this critical protective reflex is compromised.\n\n\u201cThese findings are crucial for understanding potentially life-saving reflexes that are activated in the airway, in response to noxious stimuli,\u201d said Peter Stern, Senior Editor at Science, who oversaw the prize.\n\nFor most every breath we take and most every morsel or sip we consume, the lungs are protected. Air enters the lungs, but food, liquid and stomach acid are sent to the GI tract.\n\nIn a flash, however, this process can go wrong \u2013 a foreign agent can get into our airway. This can cause discomfort, at minimum. And at worst it can lead to airway blockage, acid-induced lung damage, or aspiration pneumonia \u2013 outcomes that occur frequently in people with neurological or esophageal disorders and which are a leading cause of aspiration pneumonia and mortality in older people.\n\nScientists already know that sensory systems in the upper airway, namely the larynx and trachea, rapidly detect the things that we need to exclude from our lungs. Innervated with sensory nerve fibers, the larynx and trachea respond to foreign agents \u2013 and clear them.\n\nBut scientists don\u2019t know if the nerve fibers in the larynx and trachea act alone.\n\nSeeholzer\u2019s work uncovered another entity \u2013 neuroendocrine cells \u2013 that operate in the larynx and trachea, to play a protective role. In her prize essay, \u201c(Don\u2019t) take my breath away,\u201d Seeholzer \u2013 a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California San Francisco \u2013 writes, \u201cyou should thank your neuroendocrine cells the next time you clear water or acid reflux out of your airway.\u201d\n\nNeuroendocrine (NE) cells are a rare group of epithelial cells throughout the larynx and trachea. They have been understood for their important role in repairing the airway epithelium after injury.\n\nThey had not been thought to be involved in airway protection.\n\nHowever, because these cells are near sensory nerve fibers, Seeholzer and her colleagues speculated that they could be specialized sensory cells that play a role in protecting our lungs.\n\nSeeholzer said she wasn\u2019t even sure there were NE cells in the trachea and larynx when she started her work. \u201cI started from the ground up, learning how these cells operate. I then used that to generate a hypothesis about their importance in the airway.\u201d\n\nHer efforts involved work in cells and in mice \u2013 and methods including calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetics.\n\nThe road wasn\u2019t always easy.\n\n\u201cI had been studying NE cells for a year or two to figure out what they detect, which could inform what they do,\u201d said Seeholzer. \u201cI performed a sequencing experiment to see what the cells expressed. When I looked at the data, not many receptors were expressed that supported my hypothesis that these were sensory cells that could detect stimuli that could get into the airway. The sequencing led to all dead ends.\u201d\n\nSeeholzer did not give up, however. She spoke with David Julius, her mentor, and professor and chair of physiology at UCSF. She explained her sequencing work was not revealing what NE cells detected. \u201cHe encouraged me to step back and think about what they could be detecting, and to use that to nominate substances the NE cells could be frequently exposed to.\u201d\n\nThat led to an \u201cah-hah!\u201d moment she describes in her essay, where she changed how she set up her experiments. As a result, she discovered that water and strong acid solutions (like stomach acid) very consistently activated the NE cells.\n\nShe then sought to understand what the water and acid did to the cells. Using optogenetic techniques, she could specifically activate NE cells in mice. \u201cWhen I did that, the mice started swallowing very quickly.\u201d Seeholzer attached a device to the mice to study related changes in breathing. \u201cI very consistently saw that activating NE cells led to swallows and to cough-like reflexes.\u201d That supported her hypothesis that NE cells were detecting water and acid to elicit protective responses in the airway, to keep foreign substances out.\n\nShe says NE cells add another layer \u2013 on top of sensory neurons researchers have previously studied \u2013 giving full protection in the airway. This was further evidenced by experiments in mice in which the NE cells were knocked out; this led to the airway not being fully protected against foreign threats.\n\nNow having done work in mice, Seeholzer wants to understand how these cells operate in healthy and diseased humans. Her findings suggest these cells are not functioning properly in people with dysphagia, which is the inability to swallow well \u2013 a major cause of mortality. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in looking at patients who aspirate frequently to see if there\u2019s something going on with cells there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m interested in looking at what happens with these cells in people who smoke, where dysphagia is also more prevalent.\u201d\n\nThere are also implications for people with refractory chronic cough, where the NE cells may be hyperactivated.\n\n\u201cEppendorf and the journal Science have been awarding this prestigious prize since 2002,\u201d said Axel Jahns, Vice President of Corporate Citizenship & Governmental Affairs at Eppendorf SE. \u201cSince its initiation, the prize has acknowledged over 70 winners and finalists, who have gone on to become leading scientists in their field. Congratulations to Dr. Seeholzer on her amazing achievement in winning this year.\u201d\n\nSeeholzer expressed how her supportive lab environment made it possible to achieve the findings she did, even after significant obstacles. \u201cThe lab I\u2019m in really made all the work fun and enjoyable,\u201d she said.\n\nFinalists\n\nRosemary J. Cater is a finalist for the prize, for her essay, \u201cFood for thought.\u201d Cater received her undergraduate degree and PhD from The University of Sydney. After completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University, she started her laboratory at the University of Queensland\u2019s Institute for Molecular Bioscience in 2024. Her research uses an integrated structural biology approach to understand how nutrients obtained through the diet are transported across the blood-brain barrier.\n\nClaudia Kathe is also a finalist for the prize, for her essay, \u201cRewiring movements.\u201d Kathe received an undergraduate degree and PhD from King\u2019s College London. After completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), she started her laboratory in the Department of Fundamental Neuroscience at the University of Lausanne in 2024. Her research investigates the reorganization of neuronal networks in the spinal cord in neurological disorders and its impact on sensorimotor function."

While excavating the remains of a Gaulish town, they unearthed a little glass bottle hidden inside an earthenware pot, according to the BBC.\n\nThe bottle, which had been hidden for nearly 200 years, carried a note from a prior archaeologist who had worked at the same location. Guillaume Blondel, the chief of Eu's Regional Archaeology Service, was sent in to investigate the findings. Blondel opened the bottle and read the note.\n\nThe message reads: \"PJ Feret, a native of Dieppe, member of various intellectual societies, carried out excavations here in January 1825. He continues his investigations in this vast area known as the Cite de Limes or Caesar's Camp.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: facebook.com/villedeu\n\nPJ Feret was a local notable, and municipal records confirm that he conducted a first dig at the site 200 years ago.\n\nArchaeologists and historians are both excited and fascinated by the discovery. The message could provide insight into the history of the Gaulish village as well as the archaeological procedures used in the early nineteenth century.\n\n\"It was the kind of vial that women used to wear around their necks containing smelling salts,\" team leader Guillaume Blondel, who heads the archaeological service for the town of Eu, told BBC News.\n\n\"It was an absolutely magical moment,\" said Mr Blondel. \"We knew there had been excavations here in the past, but to find this message from 200 years ago... it was a total surprise.\n\n\"Sometimes you see these time capsules left behind by carpenters when they build houses. But it's very rare in archaeology. Most archaeologists prefer to think that there won't be anyone coming after them because they've done all the work.\""

He is eligible for free agency after this season, and he hasn\u2019t had any talks with the team about extending his tenure.\n\nNick Pivetta is trying not to think about it.\n\nWith his future employment undefined, Pivetta recognizes that his start against the Rays could be the end of an important chapter in his life.\n\nAs a kid, Pivetta fell in love with Fenway while watching games on TV. The Manny Ramirez homer against Francisco Rodriguez in the 2007 ALDS is one of his earliest baseball memories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Pivetta took up residence in the home clubhouse at Fenway, he said, \u201cis very surreal and very cool.

More important I think is there are still games to be played and still games to be won. I think I\u2019ve just got to focus on that.\u201d\n\nWhile Pivetta hopes to keep most of his thoughts on Friday\u2019s outing, he made a point of appreciating what the last four years have meant to him.\n\nHis career stood at a crossroads when he made his Red Sox debut at Fenway Park four years ago.\n\nHailed at one point as a cornerstone of the Phillies rotation, he had been bounced from it and then sent to the minors in 2020, viewed as a \u201cchange-of-scenery\u201d candidate whose ability to thrive amid the scrutiny of a big market was in question.\n\nPivetta has relished pitching in a market where baseball draws an intense spotlight. Danielle Parhizkaran/Globe Staff\n\nThe Sox landed him (along with Connor Seabold, now pitching in Korea) in a deadline deal for relievers Brandon Workman and Heath Hembree. After a month at the team\u2019s Alt Site in Pawtucket, Pivetta made his Sox debut in the last week of the 2020 season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, starting in 2021, Pivetta emerged as a mainstay of the staff. His 104 starts since the start of the 2021 season are 35 more than any other Sox pitcher. His 616\u2153 innings exceed any teammate by more than 200 innings in that time.\n\nHis performance has been uneven, but in the aggregate, it\u2019s solid: a 4.35 ERA and ERA+ of 102, with glimpses of both dominance (a 27 percent strikeout rate) and vulnerability (102 homers, tied for fifth-most in baseball). He was an important contributor in the 2021 ALCS run, punching the team\u2019s ticket to the playoffs with a strikeout of Juan Soto for the last out of Game 162, then stomping his way through an incredible four-inning relief appearance in Game 3 of the ALDS.\n\nHow would he characterize what all of that has meant?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like there\u2019s too many things that can be said and too many things that have happened to even depict it in a small amount of time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the amount of growth that I\u2019ve had in my career is a tribute to being able to have the Red Sox uniform on and to the people that the Red Sox organization has surrounded me with.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a bit of everything. Just to be able to put on the uniform and just go out and compete, and be given that opportunity to do that, and to be welcomed I think is very nice and a very great honor. I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the numbers and particulars of his performances, Pivetta said, he tried to pitch in a way to both channel and honor the atmosphere at Fenway. A pitcher whose ability to succeed in a demanding baseball market was questioned in Philadelphia relished precisely such an environment as a member of the Red Sox.\n\n\u201cThe bloodline of what it is to be a Red Sox is to give everything you have to this organization, to the fan base, and to just put your heart on the field every single time to win a baseball game,\u201d said Pivetta.\n\nAnd on Friday, he will not take for granted the opportunity to do so once more.\n\nAlex Speier can be reached at alex.speier@globe.com.

        "source": "Yahoo! Sports",
        "article_content": "Understanding that the development of Caleb Williams is at or near the top of Shane Waldron\u2019s job description, the Chicago Bears can share optimism in the fact the rookie quarterback has improved each of the last two weeks.\n\nWilliams\u2019 completion percentage, yards and yards per attempt have increased in the two losses since the season-opening victory against the Tennessee Titans, and he\u2019s coming off a 363-yard effort against the Colts on Sunday in Indianapolis that included two touchdown passes.\n\nWilliams looks to be improving incrementally, and while it\u2019s never going to be a linear progression, he already looks more comfortable than any Bears rookie quarterback has in a long time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of new as we all know,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWide receivers, running backs, quarterback, the offensive linemen and all these different parts. Us constantly having the encouragement mindset, but also the positivity that we see on the actual film \u2014 if you actually watch it and not get into all the emotions of the game.\n\n\u201cYes, we do need to get it going a little bit more efficiently than we are. But the growth and positivity that we have within the film that we\u2019ve seen and things like that over these past couple of weeks (is encouraging).\u201d\n\nThe overall picture for the offense, though, has been murky \u2014 to put it nicely. Waldron\u2019s unit has struggled to form any kind of identity. The offense has been particularly bad in a handful of areas and hasn\u2019t scored enough. It\u2019s a familiar movie and without improvements will offer a familiar ending.\n\nThe Bears have three offensive touchdowns, tying them for last in the NFL with the Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers. The Philadelphia Eagles have yet to score in the first quarter this season. The Bears and Sunday\u2019s opponent at Soldier Field, the Los Angeles Rams, are next worst with three points each.\n\nAsked if he uses a play script to begin games, Waldron labeled that \u201cscheme\u201d related during a fast-talking, 15-minute news conference Thursday morning. It\u2019s worth noting the Bears are No. 2 in the league in fourth-quarter scoring with 30 points.\n\nComing off a rough showing in the 21-16 loss to the Colts, Waldron opened with a statement complimenting the team\u2019s leadership group for being solution-oriented. Interestingly, one player said Waldron was more engaged seeking player input this week. If you heard a coach or player mention communication since Monday, you\u2019ve heard it 100 times.\n\nVeteran Marcedes Lewis is one of the players Waldron credited, along with fellow tight end Cole Kmet, Williams and wide receiver DJ Moore.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel like he can\u2019t point guys out,\u201d Lewis, 40, recalled saying to Waldron. \u201cFrom the oldest guy in the room \u2014 being me \u2014 to the youngest guy. Don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t coach us. I want to be coached. I want to be great. This is not for play. This is our job. We understand that. It\u2019s a highly stressful, production-based business, and we\u2019ve all got to be doing the same things or everybody gets fired. Ego is supposed to be left at the door.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very receptive to that. I think, obviously, coming in, we\u2019ve got a bunch of dudes. Not just guys on the team or on this offense. We have dudes \u2014 dudes who have done it at a high level. Sometimes as the coach coming in, you might be walking on eggshells. I just kind of put that to bed. Nobody\u2019s sensitive in here. We want to win games just as bad as you do. It\u2019s a collaborative effort. This is not Pop Warner.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Williams probably needed to look like a two-time Pro Bowl selection from the jump to meet some of the audacious expectations put on this offense. Folks dared to dream \u2014 and dream big \u2014 when the Bears chose him with the No. 1 pick in the draft, the most decorated quarterback to join the franchise in decades and the greatest signal of hope to enter Halas Hall perhaps ever.\n\nPredictably, Williams has encountered challenges that make the position difficult to navigate for rookie starters, including myriad pressures and a mixing of coverages with the intent to fool him or cause a delay in his reaction.\n\nAll of that was expected, but the cast of players surrounding Williams, perhaps as good or better than almost any rookie starter has discovered in the last decade or two, was supposed to ease the transition. The Bears invested heavily on offense in the offseason, trading for wide receiver Keenan Allen, who has missed the last two games with plantar fasciitis, drafting receiver Rome Odunze with the No. 9 pick and signing running back D\u2019Andre Swift and tight end Gerald Everett in free agency to join a cast that already included Moore, Kmet and a functional collection of running backs.\n\nEarly results \u2014 and a lot of football remains \u2014 have been discouraging.\n\nPass protection remains an issue. Williams has been sacked 13 times, the same number Justin Fields took through three games a year ago. Only the Cleveland Browns (16) and Tennessee Titans (15) have surrendered more. The line was supposed to look better with a quarterback that could play within the structure of the system a greater percentage of the time. Simply put, it has not.\n\nThe run game has been a mess. The failed goal-line sequence in the second quarter Sunday \u2014 when the Bears started with first-and-goal from the 4-yard line \u2014 is the symbol of what has gone wrong. Poor execution. Poor design \u2014 there\u2019s no other way to describe a play in which wide receiver DeAndre Carter is asked to block a defensive end. Waldron owned that when asked specifically about it. Poor decisions both in the speed option on fourth-and-1 and the failure to check out of the play.\n\nThe Bears are 31st in rushing offense, averaging 72.7 yards per game, and 31st in yards per attempt at a meager 3.03. The Las Vegas Raiders are the only team worse in both categories. The ground attack was expected to take a hit with the departure of Fields, whose ability to threaten defenses inflated rushing production the last two seasons, but it wasn\u2019t expected to be this bad.\n\nFirst down hasn\u2019t been profitable. The offense ranks 29th in the league, averaging 4.26 yards on first-and-10. So, they\u2019re not in desirable second-and-short situations with a lot of regularity, and when they\u2019re playing behind the sticks, it\u2019s tough sledding. According to @SharpFootball, 64% of Bears\u2019 first downs reach third down, the highest percentage in the league. The NFL average is 47%, and only three teams are over 57%. All of that makes it easier for opposing defensive coordinators to make calls on second and third downs.\n\nExplosive plays have been scarce. The Bears have five runs of 10 yards or more. Three are the result of Williams\u2019 scrambles, and Moore had a 14-yard gain on a jet sweep. The lone explosive rush by a running back was Swift\u2019s 20-yard carry in the Week 1 win against the Titans. The Bears have had only four pass plays of 20 yards or more \u2014 three to Odunze and the 44-yard Hail Mary to Moore last week that came 1 yard short of the goal line before halftime.\n\nFormer Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera used to say, \u201cfigures lie and liars figure,\u201d but you really need to spend time crunching numbers to paint a pretty picture of the offense overall. Again, it has been only three games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to live in the past but I\u2019m going to learn from it,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cI\u2019m going to move forward. And I believe in that. I\u2019m not going to flinch or blink on any of those things. I\u2019m looking forward for a solution to everything that we\u2019ve been through and can\u2019t wait for the next game.\u201d\n\nThe offensive coordinator taking heat even at this early juncture isn\u2019t surprising. The play caller can become the target of ire faster than you can say \u201cthree Mississippi.\u201d Waldron is the franchise\u2019s 13th coordinator in 26 seasons, and things turned so quickly for predecessor Luke Getsy that in about two months he went from being a guy fans feared was so hot he would be leaving quickly to become a head coach after the Bears averaged 29.6 points in a five-game stretch to the guy who was to blame for the offense\u2019s incompetence.\n\nWaldron is standing up in front of players expressing where he needs to be better. He\u2019s being accountable to his players and listening to them. It was a tough outing overall against a Colts defense that otherwise hasn\u2019t played well.\n\nIt would appear there are spots for improvement \u2014 although that was a good storyline at this time a week ago. The next four opponents have been as bad on defense as some of the areas the Bears have struggled offensively.\n\nSunday: Rams 32nd in yards allowed, 31st in scoring\n\nOct. 6: Panthers 24th, 32nd\n\nOct. 13: Jaguars 26th, 28th\n\nOct. 27, Commanders 29th, 29th\n\nSomething has to give, right?\n\n\u201cHe stands up there and lists the plays that he could have called better,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cPuts it up on the board. We all see it. And I think that\u2019s the best way to do it. I mean, we\u2019re not kids, right? We respect that. Because everything is evaluated, especially from a player\u2019s standpoint.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re getting evaluated with whatever we\u2019re doing out there. So when a coach throws himself in that pot of gumbo, then we\u2019re all vested, we all have some skin in the game. He\u2019s been doing that and highly appreciate it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if all the communication is a means to improvement \u2014 or just more talk."

Adaptive learning software provides personalized learning experiences tailored to the individual needs of students, helping them to master subjects at their own pace. As educators seek to close learning gaps and address diverse student needs, adaptive technologies have become indispensable. The shift towards remote and blended learning models has also accelerated the adoption of these tools in the K-12 segment. This trend is expected to continue as more schools recognize the benefits of personalized education through adaptive learning platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe higher education sector is another key driver of the adaptive learning software market, particularly as colleges and universities embrace technology-driven learning environments. Adaptive learning platforms help students in higher education by providing personalized content that aligns with their academic goals and learning styles. These tools offer colleges the ability to enhance student engagement, improve retention rates, and support personalized feedback. In addition, the growing need for scalable solutions in large academic institutions has increased the demand for adaptive learning software, which can cater to diverse student populations. This trend is shaping the future of education and driving the growth of the market.\n\nThe growing demand for personalized learning experiences is one of the primary factors driving the adaptive learning software market. Students and educators alike are seeking more tailored educational experiences that address individual learning needs and preferences. Adaptive learning software uses data-driven insights to adjust content delivery based on each learner's progress, strengths, and weaknesses. This personalized approach improves learning outcomes and engagement, making it a preferred choice in both academic and corporate training environments. As more institutions and organizations focus on student-centric learning models, the demand for adaptive learning platforms is expected to rise, fueling market growth.\n\nAdaptive learning software is gaining traction in the corporate training sector as businesses recognize the value of personalized employee development programs. These platforms enable companies to deliver customized training modules that address specific skill gaps and enhance overall performance.

Adaptive learning platforms offer the ability to deliver personalized learning experiences remotely, making them ideal for students and employees who are unable to attend in-person sessions. The shift towards digital learning has been accelerated by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and this trend is expected to persist, driving further adoption of adaptive learning tools.\n\nBuy Now: https://reports.valuates.com/api/directpaytoken?rcode=QYRE-Auto-0Y2692&lic=single-user\n\nADAPTIVE LEARNING SOFTWARE MARKET SHARE ANALYSIS:\n\nThe adaptive learning software market exhibits regional variations, with North America leading due to its advanced educational infrastructure and high adoption of digital learning tools.
