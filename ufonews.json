            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "He has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansjurgen Kohler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (Cenap), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says Kohler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office Cenap.\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" Kohler says.\n\nAccording to its director, Cenap has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, Kohler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines). Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa\n\nConspiracy theorists\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, Kohler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

            "article_content": "Strange footage captured over the US appeared to show a hovering UFO with an odd glow over a military base.\n\nAn anonymous user posted the footage from Tennessee to Reddit, showing the \u201cbright orange light\u201d over Fort Campbell, a base on the border with the state of Kentucky. The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

            "article_content": "You\u2019ve no doubt noticed artificial intelligence finding its way into every app, service, and hardware device. It\u2019s now unusual to see a tech product launch where AI isn\u2019t the main talking point. Meta is one of the companies pushing AI the hardest, with its own set of AI models, and a selection of AI bots and tools inside its own apps. (Experts and critics also say Meta may be taking their AI too far, which Meta responded to by removing multiple AI profile accounts.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram recently, then you may have spotted a new Meta AI bot, ready and waiting to be of assistance. Here\u2019s how you can make use of it\u2014and what your options are in terms of security and privacy.\n\nHow to find Meta AI\n\nYou\u2019ll find Meta AI front and center in Meta\u2019s apps: In the Facebook Messenger app, for example, tap Chats and you\u2019ll see a Meta AI input box right at the top, above your real life friends and family members. Tap inside that box, and you can start chatting about whatever topic you like. You can also tap Meta AI on the tab bar at the bottom.\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the WhatsApp app (you\u2019ll see the Meta AI logo on the Chats tab), and in the Instagram app (tap the message button, in the top right corner of the home tab, and Meta AI is at the top). The Meta AI logo is a glowing blue and purple circle, and it\u2019s hard to miss as you use the apps.\n\nMeta AI is prominently displayed in your chats. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get Meta AI up, inside one-to-one or group chats with real people: Tag @MetaAI in your conversation, type out a prompt, and you\u2019ll get the same response as you would if you were chatting to the AI bot directly\u2014except, of course, the other chat participants will be able to see the message and response.\n\nThe AI bot chats all use the same underlying model (called Llama), but your chats aren\u2019t synced between the three apps. Unfortunately for AI skeptics, there\u2019s no way to hide or turn off Meta AI: You just have to ignore it if you don\u2019t want to use it. However, you can delete, mute, and archive Meta AI chats just like any other conversation\u2014just long press on the AI chat in the main conversation list.\n\nHow to use Meta AI\n\nIf you\u2019ve used an AI chatbot like Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the way these tools work: You can ask Meta AI to look up facts from the web, write poetry, or suggest ideas for something. You can get recommendations for podcasts, inspiration for a birthday party, or suggestions about how to fix a faucet leak.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI for advice and instruction on just about any topic\u2014though as usual with generative AI, be careful of putting too much trust in the answers. These AI bots are built to imagine new text, and that can lead to hallucinations. Sometimes Meta AI will reference the web (when looking up facts, for example)\u2014and when this happens you\u2019ll see web links within the response. Tap on these links to check the facts.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions about just about anything. Screenshot: Meta\n\nImage generation is included here: Just ask Meta AI to create or draw an image of whatever you like. It could be a cat sat on a wall, a cabin in the woods, or a person exploring the surface of Mars. The more detail you can add, the more closely the result is going to match your original vision\u2014and you can specify the style of the image too, whether it\u2019s a photo, a painting, or something else.\n\nThere are some interesting image-related tricks you can try: For example, you can use it to create a new profile picture for yourself. Two suggestions from Meta are \u201cimagine me as royalty\u201d or \u201cimagine me in a surrealist painting\u201d, so you can see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019re also able to edit an AI-generated image by tapping and holding on it, then typing in your additional prompt.\n\nMeta AI can generate images for you as well. Screenshot: Meta\n\nMeta itself splits what you can do into three main sections: learn (\u201csummarize the history of the Universe\u201d), create (\u201cimagine dogs playing chess\u201d), and connect (\u201cplan a game night with friends\u201d). That gives you some idea of what\u2019s possible, and you can now interact with Meta AI with your voice if you want\u2014just tap the sound button to the right of the input box.\n\nOne of the features recently added to Meta AI is the ability to use photos in your chats\u2014either picked from your phone\u2019s gallery or taken through the camera. You can identify objects and landmarks, create AI images based on existing photos, and more: Try snapping a picture of a cake and asking how to make it, for example."

While both features can be handy, the summary tool is a little limited in that it can only be used for voice recordings and not calls. But it looks like that could soon change.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nIn One UI 7, Samsung introduced support for call transcriptions, giving the feature the ability to handle both voice recordings and calls. However, this capability was yet to be given to the summary feature.\n\nWhile digging into the Voice Recorder app (version 21.5.70.78), we discovered lines of code that suggest you\u2019ll soon be able to summarize calls as well. Below, you can see a description of what the feature can do and how it works.\n\nCode Copy Text <string name=\"app_name_assist_summary_with_call_recording\">Transcribe voice and call recordings into text, then summarize them for easy review.</string> <string name=\"summary_setting_description_1_call_recording_setting_common\">Use AI to automatically create summaries of voice and call recordings.</string> <string name=\"settings_recorder_assist_notice_2_for_call_recording_setting_global\">Call and voice recordings need to be transcribed before they can be summarized. When you summarize recordings, their transcripts will be processed online unless Process data only on device is turned on. Samsung won't store this data after processing.</string> <string name=\"summary_setting_description_2_call_recording_setting_global\">When you summarize calls and voice recordings, their transcripts, including any sensitive data in them, will be processed but not stored by Samsung.</string> <string name=\"transcription_assist_description_call_recording_transcript_setting_support\">Use AI to transcribe, summarize, and translate voice and call recordings.</string>\n\nAccording to the code, a transcription of the call needs to be created before any summarizing can happen. Notably, it also mentions that the transcript will be processed online to create the summary. You\u2019ll have to turn on \u201cProcess data only on device\u201d if you don\u2019t want the data to be processed online. It also points out that the tech giant won\u2019t store any of the data after processing.\n\nAs these summaries will be based on AI transcriptions, we hope Samsung will improve call transcriptions. As we noted in a previous post, these transcriptions are not always the most accurate.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

            "article_content": "When we think of the \u201cflying saucer\u201d film, we typically picture sci-fi terrors from the 1950s like Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, The Day The Earth Stood Still, and even War of the Worlds. It was an extremely popular subgenre at the time, and theaters were chock full of tales of mankind being threatened by spaceships shaped like dinner plates. But what is perhaps the first entry in the \u201cflying saucer\u201d genre is a far cry from what was to come: 1950\u2019s The Flying Saucer isn\u2019t about visitors from outer space \u2014 instead, it aims at replicating real world nightmares, and turning the paranormal into the paranoid.\n\nThe late 1940s had seen the craze over the flying saucer reach a fever pitch. People had reported seeing \u201cunidentified flying objects\u201d for centuries, but after World War II, it bloomed into an outright international obsession. This interest combined a lot of factors, the renewed popularity of science fiction in a post atomic world chiefly among them.\n\nBut also notable was the fear of foreign technology, only heightened by America\u2019s plummet into another \u201cRed Scare.\u201d The Truman Doctrine and other measures had taken aim at not just the Soviet Union from the outside, but what many Americans felt was a communist uprising from within. And nothing represented those anxieties on a mechanical scale quite like the flying saucer \u2014 a sleek, emotionless vehicle that was antithetical to what we knew of flying craft in the United States. Were they aliens from another planet planning for a global takeover? Dirty communists from across the world looking to spy on us? Considering the deranged highs achieved by this shared fascination, it was hard to tell them apart.\n\nThe Flying Saucer sought to comment on these blended fixations. It tells the story of rich playboy Mike Trent (played by Mikel Conrad, also the director) who, teaming with Secret Service agent Vee Langley, is tasked by American Intelligence to investigate reports of a flying saucer in Alaska. They soon discover that the saucer\u2019s creator is actually an American scientist, but his assistant is in connection with the Soviets, thus beginning a series of espionage-fueled encounters that place any science-fiction thrills in the backseat. Instead, The Flying Saucer zooms in on the burgeoning psychological warfare of the Cold War, and its stolen secrets and double agents.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why The Flying Saucer isn\u2019t as well-remembered as the more fantastical films to follow. The writing is scattershot \u2014 the Americans obviously have the moral and intellectual high ground in any situation, but they\u2019re also easily betrayed to a cartoonish extent, only realizing the subterfuge when it\u2019s staring them in the face. There\u2019s also not much spectacle to speak of \u2014 you gain more appreciation for scenic shots of the Alaskan wilderness than any special effects prowess. In the end, the Soviets are killed by an avalanche and the titular flying saucer blows up in midair due to a planted explosive, the result of which only garners a mild gasp from Vee Langley.\n\nA poster for The Flying Saucer. LMPC/LMPC/Getty Images\n\nBut though The Flying Saucer would disappear a few years after its release and its spot in pop culture was replaced by much more crowd-pleasing efforts, it did lay the seeds of a genre. A year later, The Day The Earth Stood Still would capture the rising tension of the feeling that the Earth was a button-push away from destruction, either from its own inhabitants or those from space. Two years after that, War of the Worlds would adjust H.G. Wells\u2019 original novel to fit the times, with an unfeeling enemy that might only be conquered with mutual nuclear destruction (though an atom bomb turns out to be of no use here). 1956\u2019s dual offerings of Earth vs. The Flying Saucers and Japan\u2019s Fearful Attack of the Flying Saucers (the latter directed by original Godzilla writer Shinichi Sekizawa) both reflect Cold War morbidities.\n\nInvaders from Mars, The Thing from Another World, and others joined in, many of which turned The Flying Saucer\u2019s plain-spoken anxious text into a subtext more palatable for the kids munching popcorn in the audience. Such was the path of the sci-fi laden \u201850s. Alongside the \u201cflying saucer\u201d genre was the \u201cgiant monster\u201d genre, and what started with potent odes to nuclear doom like Godzilla quickly devolved into a parade of enormous lizards and bugs trying to devour the countryside.\n\nHowever, one can find hints of something more culturally profound in The Flying Saucer. It is, by no means, an underrated or undiscovered classic, so filled as it is with exhausting dialogue and shots that look like they could\u2019ve come out of a commercial for an Alaskan Airbnb. But in a low-rent way, it stays true to something that had seeped into parts of America\u2019s collective consciousness \u2014 that we were not alone in the world and that something, be it spacecraft or Soviets, was watching us, either from within our midst or far, far up above."

            "article_content": "It has come to my attention that world leaders like JD Vance and Steve Bannon are avid and enthusiastic readers of a computer engineer named Curtis Yarvin. He has written mostly about politics but also about technology and current affairs.\n\nWhat might be most alarming to some that our future vice president is taking Yarvin\u2019s work as an influence, is that his writings are largely composed of anti-democratic and pro-authoritarian themes, along with some inclusion of racism (he claimed that some races are more suited for slavery; I invite you to guess what race he thinks that is).\n\nYou see, Yarvin is one of the founders of something called the \u201cDark Enlightenment\u201d movement, which \u201cargues\u201d against democracy and against egalitarianism \u2013 a school of thought that people have equal intrinsic value and are deserving of equal rights.\n\nThe reason I placed \u201cargues\u201d in quotes is because Yarvin\u2019s writings do not fall under the category of rigorous political philosophy. They are often written in a style that is purposefully and pretentiously difficult to understand that makes it nearly impossible to extract comprehensible arguments.\n\nInstead of concrete arguments, Yarvin\u2019s writings are mostly composed of unsubstantiated claims and obscure references that he doesn\u2019t explain to make it perfectly clear to his audience how well-read he is.\n\nDespite fashioning himself as a political theorist, he is far from a competent one. Here\u2019s a small sample where he is explaining that his \u201cdeep-right\u201d movement must involve authoritarianism:\n\n\u201cThe deep right knows that all government is absolute. Because of this, the deep right is only interested in paths to absolute power.\u201d\n\nWhy would all governments be absolute? If his primary reason for thinking that his deep-right movement should seek to bring about an authoritarian regime rests on this dubious assumption, then it\u2019s already completely undermotivated. He doesn\u2019t explain why a government like ours isn\u2019t a straightforward counterexample.\n\n\u201cIt treats all other paths as traps, since they are by definition dead ends.\u201d\n\nWhat definition? Why must they be dead ends? He doesn\u2019t explain or argue for any of this.\n\n\u201cThe more attractive the first steps into a trap, the deadlier the trap in the end\u2014and political traps can last decades.\u201d\n\nWhy would we believe that the attractiveness of the steps into a trap correlates with the deadliness of the trap? Again, there are no arguments to be found. This small passage is highly representative of Yarvin\u2019s writings in general: a lot of bold, eye-catching claims, and very few reasons provided to actually believe them. In most cases, philosophy of this kind is better categorized as bad poetry, not as a means to systematically examine theories and concepts or a means to form rational beliefs about them.\n\nThis is precisely where people like JD Vance and Steve Bannon have gone wrong. They have confused bad poetry that mentions the Dark Enlightenment, for reasons to believe in the goals of the Dark Enlightenment.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cIdealism is not Great\u201d, he attempts to \u201cargue\u201d that Idealism, and not religion, is to blame for the violence and destruction that has gone along with religious systems. The entire thing relies on him merely presupposing that this is the case, and a fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication of the concept of platonic universals (Idealism): a philosophical theory that identifies properties like \u201credness\u201d as abstract entities whose nature can be instantiated by concrete objects like apples.\n\n\u201cAn Idealist is a person who believes that universals exist independently. Specifically, in the modern sense, your Idealist believes in concepts such as Democracy, the Environment, Peace, Freedom, Human Rights, Equality, Justice, etc., etc. What do these concepts have in common?[\u2026]they are impossible to define precisely. It\u2019s fairly clear that they have no meaning at all. For example, John Rawls wrote a whole book called A Theory Of Justice which purports to be a rigorous rational derivation of the New Deal regime.\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect demonstration of his being well read enough to mention the concepts of academic disciplines but not educated enough to use them correctly. Subscribing to the theory of platonic realism has no bearing at all on political leanings or really, anything of practical concern at all.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with Rawls. Rawls\u2019 work does not deal at all with the general nature of properties. Instead, he attempts to explore the nature of Justice. Contrary to what Yarvin claims, he does indeed define it and it does not depend at all on Rawls being a Platonic Realist.\n\n\u201cA little while ago I explained that religion, if we define it as a system of belief involving anthropomorphic paranormal entities, cannot directly affect reality.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Opinion Columnists | The Senate should confirm Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence\n\nThe Senate should confirm Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence Opinion Columnists | Gavin Newsom is gaslighting Californians about homelessness and gas prices\n\nGavin Newsom is gaslighting Californians about homelessness and gas prices Opinion Columnists | Gavin Newsom is Democrats\u2019 potential 2028 frontrunner, but can he win?\n\nGavin Newsom is Democrats\u2019 potential 2028 frontrunner, but can he win?

Let\u2019s be as charitable as possible and say that he thinks that by defining religion as such, it becomes a platonic form, which itself could not have causal efficacy in the world. Why does this need to be expressed? A system of belief can certainly affect reality. My parent\u2019s adherence to the system of belief that tells them that God wants them to attend mass, directly causes them to attend mass.\n\nThis is nonsensical junk food for pseudointellectuals. If we were to someday depart from democracy, these idiotic ramblings should play no part in it at all. And yet, it is reportedly informing people in our highest offices.\n\nThere is a reason peer-review exists and it\u2019s not to stop the radical ideas of \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d that go against the system \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanism that filters out unrigorous nonsense like this so that we don\u2019t have to waste time on it. There are plenty of academics who have published legitimate attacks on the merits of democracy and egalitarianism. It\u2019s a good thing that JD Vance and Steve Bannon want to read about political philosophy, but why look to a computer scientist for answers?\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.

            "article_content": "Stephen King\u2019s favourite horror character from his books\n\nTo hit a debut novel out of the park like Stephen King did with Carrie in 1974 is to instantly establish yourself as one of the premier writers of the day. However, perhaps more impressive than simply getting a good book out to the public is that it was a uniquely poised piece of horror fiction.\n\nThe celebrated genre may be one of the most ardently mythologised, with fandoms strong enough to make Taylor Swift blush, but it isn\u2019t always the most marketable to a widespread audience. Stephen King changed all that, and his books became some of the most successful novels ever written. And, as cinema exploded into a new phase in the latter parts of the 20th century, King\u2019s books would be routinely leant on for inspiration.\n\nFew authors can boast as many movie adaptations as King\u2019s 65. The writer has given the cinematic world classics like The Shining and The Shawshank Redemption as well as It and Stand By Me, a range of stories that not only celebrate the unique talent of King but the widespread range of characters within them. The narrative may be what attract most filmmakers to his work, but it is the characters within them that make those movies unforgettable.\n\nWhen asked to pick out his favourite character from his oeuvre, King was quick to land on his favourite. Naturally, it came from one of his scarier books, but still, that\u2019s about the only thing one might have predicted. Many would have thought The Shining protagonist Jack Torrance would be number one, especially considering his issues with Stanley Kubrick over his portrayal. You might also be persuaded into thinking that Pennywise, the demon clown from It might be the writer\u2019s favourite.\n\nHowever, the character King called his favourite to write during a keynote speech at George Washington University was Annie Wilkes from Misery. The picture was directed by Rob Reiner, who had previously directed King\u2019s novella The Body into the definitive coming-of-age classic Stand By Me four years earlier, with stars James Caan and Kathy Bates playing a writer and one of his obsessed fans, respectively.\n\nBates steals the show as Annie Wilkes, the maniacal fan in question who not only engineers the near-fatal crash that leaves Caan in her carer but then proceeds to begin the battle of wits to try and keep him in her home. The movie and the book operate as a brutal reflection on fan culture, which may well have been drawn from King\u2019s heightened experiences of a new life under the spotlight as more and more of his books became global hits and cinematic spectacles.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Wilkes would become his favourite character. Not only is King\u2019s character an irredeemable villain, but she is able to deliver this terror through a less than usual presence. Previously, King\u2019s monsters would be either animalistic, paranormal or twisted men. Here, with a woman as the lead character, he was able to change the narrative entirely.\n\nThe movie would not only become a commercial success but also achieve the only Oscar that has been given for a Stephen King adaptation as Bates picked up \u2018Best Actress\u2019 in 1991, giving Wilkes a slightly more questionably vulnerable spin. While King would likely resist picking favourites too often, for the most part, it is easy to see how Wilkes may win out every time he is asked."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery by scientists at Japan\u2019s RIKEN Center for Brain Science has revealed an unexpected link between dopamine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

The first ones looked almost nothing like the mammals we are used to seeing today. Instead, they were tiny, shrew-like creatures that barely stood a chance against the massive dinosaurs that dominated the planet at the time. However, against all odds, they withstood their harsh surroundings as the last surviving descendants of an older group, the Therapsids, from which they evolved.\n\nNow, paleontologists in Mallorca, Spain, have unearthed what seems to be a fossil of a therapsid that could be the oldest ever discovered, dating back to nearly 280 million years ago. The research, which was published in the journal Nature Communications, describes this ancient creature as a vaguely dog-like predator with fearsome saber teeth. Yet to be named, the fossil is believed to belong to a group known as gorgonopsians\u2014ancient predators more closely related to mammals than any living animals."

When OpenAI achieves this, Microsoft will lose access to its technology, per an agreement between the two companies.\n\nSo which definition might Altman be referring to? He didn\u2019t specify, but the former seems likeliest. Altman wrote that he thinks AI agents \u2014 AI systems that can perform certain tasks autonomously \u2014 may \u201cjoin the workforce,\u201d in a manner of speaking, and \u201cmaterially change the output of companies\u201d this year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s also true that today\u2019s AI technology is significantly limited. It hallucinates, for one; it makes mistakes obvious to any human; and it can be very expensive.\n\nAltman seems confident all this can be overcome \u2014 and quickly. Still, if there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve learned about AI from the past few years, it\u2019s that timelines can shift.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cGiven the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company. How lucky and humbling it is to be able to play a role in this work.\u201d\n\nOne would hope that as OpenAI telegraphs its shift in focus to what it considers to be superintelligence, the company would devote sufficient resources to ensuring superintelligent systems behave safely.\n\nOpenAI has written several times about how successfully transitioning to a world with superintelligence is \u201cfar from guaranteed,\u201d and that it doesn\u2019t have all the answers. \u201c[W]e don\u2019t have a solution for steering or controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post dated July 2023. \u201c[H]umans won\u2019t be able to reliably supervise AI systems much smarter than us, and so our current alignment techniques will not scale to superintelligence.\u201d\n\nSince that post, however, OpenAI has disbanded teams that were focused on AI safety, including superintelligent systems safety, and seen several influential safety-focused researchers depart. Several of these staffers cited OpenAI\u2019s increasingly commercial ambitions as the reason for their departure. The company is currently undergoing a corporate restructuring to make it more attractive to outside investors.\n\nAsked in a recent interview about critics who say OpenAI isn\u2019t focused enough on safety, Altman responded, \u201cI\u2019d point to our track record.\u201d"

Sutskever, D'Angelo, Toner, and McCauley had voted for Altman's removal.\n\nD'Angelo was the only one of the four to remain on OpenAI's board following Altman's return as CEO. Sutskever left his position as OpenAI's chief scientist in May.\n\nAD\n\n\"It was just a crazy thing to have to go through and then have no time to recover, because the house was on fire,\" Altman told Bloomberg.\n\nWhen approached for comment, OpenAI told Business Insider that it had nothing further to add to Altman's interview.\n\nOpenAI saw multiple exits in its leadership ranks following Altman's return as CEO.\n\nAD\n\nSutskever's co-lead for OpenAI's superalignment team, Jan Leike, left his post at the same time Sutskever did, and joined the company's rival, Anthropic.\n\nThen, in August, the company's cofounder and head of its alignment science efforts, John Schulman, left OpenAI to join Anthropic too.\n\nIn September, OpenAI's CTO Mira Murati announced her departure from the company as well.\n\nAD\n\nOpenAI is in talks with California's attorney general's office about becoming a for-profit entity, Bloomberg separately reported. The company was launched as a non-profit research organization in 2015.\n\nIn October, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round, valuing it at $157 billion."

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery by scientists at Japan\u2019s RIKEN Center for Brain Science has revealed an unexpected link between dopamine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

            "article_content": "> Science\n\nArchaeologists at Universities of Oxford and Birmingham have confirmed discovering the UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackways with around 200 footprints. The trackways discovered in Oxfordshire are being described as part of a 'dinosaur highway' dating back to the middle Jurassic Period around 166 million years ago. The longest continuous trackway, according to University of Oxford statement, measures more than 150 metres in length.\n\nA timeless discovery\n\nThe footprints were discovered at a quarry in Oxfordshire by a worker who felt 'unusual bumps' on the surface. Experts were later called in and a team of more than 100 people investigated for a week in June 2024.\n\nThe Megalosaurus footprint. Image: University of Oxford\n\nResearchers revealed that four of the five trackways were made by the giant and long-necked Cetiosaurus which measured up to 18-metre-long. The fifth trackway was made by Megalosaurus, the carnivorous theropod which had distinct, large three-toed feet with claws.\n\nDr Emma Nicholls, Vertebrate Palaeontologist at Oxford University Museum of Natural History (OUMNH), says that Megalosaurus are the longest studied dinosaurs. \"And yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" Nicholls said.\n\nALSO SEE: 10-Year-Old Discovers Dinosaur Footprints From 200 Million Years Ago While Strolling On The Beach\n\nOne track showed the carnivores and herbivores crossing over, but it is unclear how the two interacted. Interestingly, the researchers have built detailed 3D models of the site using more than 20,000 pictures.\n\nKirsty Edgar, a professor at University of Birmingham, said that this discovery reveals details about the dinosaurs' movements, interactions and the tropical environment they inhabited.\n\nNotably, the tracks connect to the discovery made in the same area in 1997. Unfortunately, there is limited photographic evidence of the previous findings and the area is no longer accessible.\n\nALSO SEE: French Man Discovers 70 Million-year-old Dinosaur Skeleton Connected From Neck To Tail\n\n(Image: University of Oxford)"

            "article_content": "Reading Time: 9 Minutes \u2022 Print this page\n\nA wall of bright signs warn me before I step closer: \u201cDangerous Animals \u2013 Do Not Touch\u201d. As I carefully inch closer to the aquarium tank, I notice that sitting inside in a shell is an inconspicuous animal no bigger than a golf ball. A series of striking, metallic blue markings appear magically over its body, and it stretches its rubber-like arms to close the two shell pieces together, vanishing from view.\n\nOctopuses are the only invertebrate known to use tools. This coconut octopus uses empty shells and even coconuts as a mobile fortress. Image credit: Yury Ivanov/@diveivanov\n\n\u201cMeet the most intelligent invertebrate on the planet,\u201d Dr Wen-Sung Chung announces as he proudly introduces his \u201cblueys\u201d \u2013 blue-lined octopuses \u2013 that form part of his research. He\u2019s studying the nervous system and behaviour of cephalopods, the group of molluscs that includes octopuses and squids. Despite their appearance, these tiny little blueys can be deadly, especially if you\u2019re a crustacean. They carry tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin for paralysing prey that\u2019s 1000 times more potent than cyanide. But these creatures are far more astounding than the fearsome reputation that proceeds them. They have truly remarkable intelligence, evident in behaviours such as the tool use I just witnessed with a shell. It\u2019s a surprising sign of higher cognition usually only seen in vertebrates such as birds and mammals.\n\nNot so \u2018dumb\u2019\n\nAristotle, one of the greatest minds in history, claimed octopuses were \u201cdumb\u201d. But they have some serious sea smarts that seem to defy logic. They\u2019re unlike anything in the animal kingdom, having survived ice ages and asteroids, outliving dinosaurs and spreading their arms to survive in every part of our oceans. In captivity, tales abound of these marine masterminds navigating complex mazes, unscrewing lids and outsmarting aquarists by escaping their tanks and raiding neighbouring ones for food. In the wild they team up with fish to hunt, rewire their own brains when it gets too cold and can even change colour, despite being colour-blind.\n\nThe mimic octopus, which lives in sandy habitats devoid of any shelter, even impersonates some of the ocean\u2019s deadliest residents. Its repertoire includes lionfish and stingrays and it can choose which species to mimic based on the threat it faces. If harassed by a damselfish, for example, it transforms into a sea snake.\n\nCephalopod scientist Dr Wen-Sung Chung\u2019s work on the blue-lined octopus is providing valuable insights into octopus intelligence. Image credits: Sheree Marris\n\nWen-Sung\u2019s fascination with these otherworldly animals began at Taiwan\u2019s National Museum of Natural Science with a preserved giant squid. Their \u201cweirdness\u201d captivated him, inspiring a life-long career that has included some significant breakthroughs such as the discovery of cephalopod statolith structures, which allow octopuses and squid to detect sound pressures and hear.\n\nAn opportunity to take up a residency at The University of Queensland saw his journey come full circle when he became part of an international team filming the enigmatic giant squid at 750m using the deep-sea camera platform Medusa.\n\nWen-Sung is now an expert in cephalopod visual ecology and neurobiology. For the past decade, he\u2019s been on a mission to unravel the secrets of octopus adaptability and cognitive abilities. It\u2019s groundbreaking research that not only offers a window into the surprisingly sophisticated lives of cephalopods but is also inspiring human innovation.\n\nHidden beauties\n\nI join Wen-Sung on one of his research expeditions at Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), home to The University of Queensland\u2019s Moreton Bay Research Station. The island is the perfect location for his work. Its diverse habitats of sandy plains, seagrass meadows and vibrant reefs are home to more than 10 octopus species, including the blue-lined, reef, hammer, red-spot night, scribbled night, plain-spot, veined and southern star-eyed octopus. In fact, Australia could be considered the octopus capital of the world, boasting more than 70 of the 300 species documented globally.\n\nArmed with booties, gloves, buckets and nets, we make our way across the sandy flats, navigating around armies of soldier crabs, and shuffle out into ankle-deep water. Finding octopuses is like playing a game of hide and seek with the world champions of the game. They don\u2019t just blend in: they become part of their surroundings, breaking up the outline of their bodies in magical ways that is nothing short of marine sorcery.\n\nLuckily, Wen-Sung knows the telltale signs. \u201cYou really need to understand the biology of the animals to find them,\u201d he explains. It\u2019s not long until he calls me over with excitement, pointing to what looks like nothing more than a tuft of seaweed. Amused by my puzzled face, he traces the outline of eight arms. It\u2019s a cryptically camouflaged algae octopus. Not only has it taken on the colour of the surrounding seaweed, it\u2019s changed the texture of its skin to match. It\u2019s the ultimate 3D camouflage \u2013 unparalleled in the animal kingdom.\n\nThe cryptically camouflaged algae octopus, another of Wen-Sung\u2019s study subjects, uses remarkable 3D mimicry to blend seamlessly with marine plants by changing both the texture and colour of its skin Image credit: Alamy\n\nAt nightfall, we head back out with our underwater torches to search for nocturnal octopus species, which would now be emerging from their daytime slumber to feast. Fish are darting around us as we wade through the shallows and our torch beam lights up a resting wobbegong shark.\n\nIt draws our attention to something bright red nearby that quickly vanishes into the sand \u2013 the red-spot night octopus. It\u2019s an impressively large species nearly a metre long. Wen-Sung inspects the deep tunnel the octopus disappeared into. We need to be on the lookout as it may pop up elsewhere, because these crafty cephalopods often create multiple escape tunnels \u2013 another sign of intelligence.\n\nWhat drives this level of brainpower in an invertebrate? The simple answer is survival. Millions of years ago, octopuses followed a different line of evolution to their clam and snail relatives by shedding the hard shell, trading security for freedom and flexibility. It made them into a tasty piece of unprotected protein in an environment where just about everything is looking for a meal.\n\nWith no protective armour, octopuses, such as this day octopus, rely on ingenious strategies to deter predators, including making themselves seem larger and more intimidating. Image credit: Ernie Black/@ernieblackphoto\n\nTo survive in the diverse habitats they share with a range of predators, octopuses have developed ingenious survival strategies. They\u2019re also born into a world without parental guidance and have short lifespans, which means they must learn fast and constantly adapt. All this is done while processing multiple visual inputs, controlling eight agile arms with hundreds of information-gathering suckers, and coordinating millions of colour-changing skin cells. It\u2019s enough to make your head spin \u2013 and certainly requires serious brainpower.\n\nTo investigate how all of these behaviours can be coordinated, Wen-Sung has been mapping the brains of various species of octopus and studying the structure and organisation of their nervous system, from hatchling all the way through adulthood.\n\nTo achieve this, he\u2019s needed to modify existing MRI techniques by deviating from the standard protocol settings usually reserved for vertebrate brains such as those of humans and other mammals, which are more rigid with different neural pathways compared to the soft brain tissues of octopuses.\n\nAfter hundreds of hours and much trial and error, he was able to successfully scan the brains of various octopus species in high resolution and, in a world-first, capture and map their complicated neurology in 3D. The insights this provides have been ground-breaking and changed what we thought we knew about the brains of these marine masterminds.\n\nUpdating knowledge\n\nMost of our knowledge of the octopus brain has been based on research from the 1950s and the exploration of cognitive ability restricted to a single species, the common octopus, an accessible and abundant species that\u2019s easy to keep in captivity. With more than 300 octopus species worldwide, this research certainly hasn\u2019t painted a comprehensive picture of the intelligence or brains of the group as a whole.\n\nThis is why Wen-Sung\u2019s work and the incredible breakthroughs he\u2019s made are so important. One of his discoveries is that the octopus brain continues to grow throughout the lives of these animals. It can grow 100 to 5000 times in volume from hatching to adulthood, and the rate at which this growth proceeds is ridiculously fast, when you consider the average lifespan of an octopus is only two years. Compare that to human brains, which reach maximum size at 14 or 15 years of age, then start to gradually shrink.\n\nA pale octopus. Image credits: Sheree Marris\n\nAs with the human brain, however, and unique among invertebrates (excluding their squid relatives), octopuses exhibit brain-folding, which is a sign of intelligence. The more folding there is, the more surface area is created, allowing more neurological inputs and greater processing power. Octopuses have the largest brain size-to-body ratio of any animals, which makes sense, given all the multi-tasking they do. This also tells us that the octopus is investing a significant amount of energy into its nautical noggin.\n\nOne of Wen-Sung\u2019s biggest discoveries has been that not all octopus brains are the same. The design, level of folding and size of the visual processing centre of an octopus brain, are influenced by habitat and lifestyle and vary between species. For example, the reef octopus, which is only active during the day, has a more complex brain and larger optic lobes compared to the nocturnal blue-lined octopus.\n\nMasters of deception\n\nCoral reefs are busy and challenging environments to live in. The reef octopus has to process a large amount of information and camouflage is important to its survival. The species has the highest number of colour-changing cells of any species and has been recorded changing its appearance more than 300 times in a day. It\u2019s also the species that has been recorded cooperatively hunting with gropers to flush fish out of coral bommies.\n\nTo support his work and explore the ability for the brain to change, adapt and learn \u2013 known as neural plasticity \u2013 Wen-Sung has also conducted a range of experiments to test octopus intelligence. This involved food incentives and problem-solving challenges such as identifying different shapes. \u201cThe most compelling evidence of intelligence is just how quickly they learn,\u201d he says. He has even taught one octopus to count. It\u2019s evidence that octopuses have brain structures, such as memory and learning centres, that are functionally similar to those in mammals, positioning octopuses as a valuable model group for neurophysiological studies in other higher-order species.\n\nResearch on the southern sand octopus has uncovered a compound in its venom that shows real promise in slowing the growth of cancerous melanoma cells. Image credit: Sheree Marris\n\nScientists have even recently discovered octopuses can edit their own physiology to adapt to temperature change by editing their RNA (ribonucleic acid), which is responsible for reading and decoding information in the DNA, to build proteins to carry out cellular function. Unlike DNA-driven evolution, which takes generations, octopuses can make these changes in days, which is truly extraordinary.\n\nThe significance of Wen-Sung\u2019s work and the benefit of it, even to us humans, can\u2019t be underestimated. Creating a brain template that maps and understands octopus neurology will open the gate to understanding evolution of not only cephalopods but of land-based animals.\n\nA pale octopus with its own reflection. Image credit: Sheree Marris\n\nHis work is also opening up a wealth of opportunities for human innovation. Octopuses are fast becoming marine muses for us mere mortals, sparking innovation and inspiring us in ways we never thought possible. The hormones that spur rapid brain growth in an octopus could prove useful for people who need growth stimulants.\n\nUnderstanding the flexibility and remarkable autonomy of octopus arms that comes through a simple neural network (see below), could have applications for the engineering of soft robotics able to be used in natural disasters for accessing collapsed buildings or navigating terrain inaccessible to humans. Researchers are also exploring how octopuses can deliberately detach and regrow limbs \u2013 a process that could one day inform treatments for neural injuries or regenerative medicine.\n\nIllustration credits: Gilang Ayyoubi Hartanto\n\nFor all the danger signs on the tanks where Wen-Sung keeps his blueys, there\u2019s a deeper irony. The same venom that ensures humans keep their distance may one day help save lives. Research on the southern sand octopus has uncovered a compound in its venom that shows real promise in slowing the growth of cancerous melanoma cells.\n\nWen-Sung\u2019s work underscores how truly extraordinary octopus brains are and he\u2019s only just begun to unravel their mysteries. \u201cOctopuses are the epitome of discovery science,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more I find and watch, the more I realise how much is still to learn about these weirdly wonderful animals.\u201d It\u2019s impossible not to be swept along by his energy and enthusiasm.\n\nWe humans like to think we\u2019re the clever ones, but these eight-armed teachers have some valuable lessons to share, proving that brains come in all shapes and are sometimes even shaped like a donut. Who\u2019s dumb now, Aristotle?\n\nRead more\n\nThe latest book by Victorian-based marine scientist Sheree Marris, Octopuses: Underwater Wonders, is a stunning journey into the lives of these otherworldly creatures.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Sharon Theimer, Tribune News Service\n\nYou may be familiar with a range of tips for living a healthy life: Watch your weight, exercise, eat nutritious food and don\u2019t smoke, for example. What if you could combine these lifestyle factors with a host of other variables to learn your risk of developing specific diseases, to help catch and treat them early or prevent them altogether? Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D., associate director for the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualised Medicine in Arizona, explains how science is drawing ever closer to making such personal health forecasts possible. Previously inconceivable, such personal guides to well-being are becoming increasingly possible because of new and sophisticated genome-wide technologies that capture data spanning entire genomes, Dr. Ortega says. The complex scores are compiled from a combination of data from thousands to hundreds of thousands of a person\u2019s DNA sequence variants. This type of large genome-wide data has the potential to predict disease risks, such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma and specific cancers.\n\n\u201cImagine knowing your genetic predisposition for having a heart attack in your 50s, or if you\u2019re in the top 5% of the population for the risk of cancer or diabetes based on data from your whole genome. With this knowledge, you could make informed lifestyle choices and receive enhanced screenings to mitigate that risk,\u201d Dr. Ortega says.\n\nAs a pulmonologist and genomic scientist, Dr. Ortega is leading a charge to breathe new life into precision medicine advancements. His mission is rooted in a deep commitment to health equities and inspired by his grandmother. \u201cMy grandmother died of asthma, and that should not have happened. She was Puerto Rican like me, and Puerto Ricans have the highest severity and frequency of asthma of any ethnic group in the world,\u201d Dr. Ortega says. \u201cThey also represent less than 1% of people in genetic studies. So, I\u2019ve made it a life mission to develop cures and diagnostics for people like my grandma, and for all people.\u201d\n\nEach person has millions of genetic variants, each having a small effect. But together, these variants can increase the risk of getting a condition. A polygenic risk score estimates the overall risk someone has of getting a disease by adding up the small effects of variants throughout an individual\u2019s entire genome.\n\nPolygenic risk scores are not used to diagnose diseases. Some people who don\u2019t have a high-risk score for a certain disease still can be at risk of getting the disease or might already have it. Other people with high-risk scores may never get the disease. People with the same genetic risk can have different outcomes depending on other factors such as lifestyle which determine one\u2019s lifelong environmental exposures, also called the exposome. Dr. Ortega says that getting to the point where all people know their polygenic risk scores will require a solid foundation of \u201comics\u201d research and datasets, cutting-edge technologies and further discoveries of gene-disease links \u2014 all of which are within his team\u2019s expertise and capabilities.\n\nOmics is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take considerable work and planning, but it really is the way of the future,\u201d he says. In the shorter term, Dr. Ortega plans to transition more omics discoveries from research laboratories to the clinic. Omics data can help identify the molecular culprits driving a person\u2019s disease, as well as biomarkers that can lead to the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics.\n\nRecent omics discoveries at Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Individualised Medicine have enabled scientists to predict antidepressant response in people with depression and discover a potential therapeutic strategy for bone marrow cancer. Scientists have also used omics to pinpoint genetic variations that potentially increase the risk for severe COVID-19, uncover potential clues for preventing and treating gliomas and unravel the genetic mystery of a rare neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nDrawing from his years of extensive clinical experience in treating patients with severe respiratory illnesses, Dr. Ortega is also working to expand genomic testing to a broader set of diseases."

Pay that toll!\u201d But one opponent tried to drown them out by banging a cowbell. And the exchanges grew a bit testy at times across the congestion pricing divide.\n\nThe tolling program, the first of its kind in the nation, finally became reality on New York streets after decades of battles over efforts to unclog some of the most traffic-saturated streets in the world. In the weeks leading up to its start, the program survived multiple legal challenges seeking to derail it at the last minute, including from the State of New Jersey.\n\nIt will most likely be some time, however, before it becomes clear whether congestion pricing works, or whether it can withstand continuing attempts to overturn it by a broad array of opponents, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, who takes office later this month.\n\nNoel Hidalgo, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, was among the first drivers to pay the toll. As he drove his Mini Cooper across the threshold, toll supporters cheered and clapped from the curb.\n\nAnother driver posted a photo on social media of a silver car with metal cans dangling from the rear bumper. \u201cJust tolled\u201d was written on the rear windshield.\n\nMost passenger cars are now being charged $9 once a day at detection points set up along the borders of the new tolling zone, from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan.\n\nImage Congestion pricing scanners above First Avenue at East 60th Street in Midtown Manhattan on Sunday morning.

Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nShortly after noon, about 12 hours after tolling began, transportation leaders declared that the plan had rolled out without a hitch, but cautioned that the tolling system was complicated and that it was too soon to know how it was faring.\n\n\u201cWe will start to know specific numbers and have some comparatives within a few days, and we\u2019re going to share that information publicly,\u201d said Janno Lieber, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency overseeing the program.\n\nSo far, the M.T.A. does not intend to make any adjustments to the program, Mr. Lieber said.\n\nTraffic data for the congestion zone was mixed on Day 1. The average travel speed initially inched upward 3 percent to 15.1 miles per hour at 8 a.m. Sunday, compared with 14.6 m.p.h. at the same time on the first Sunday in January last year, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics firm. But by noon, the travel speed had fallen to 13 m.p.h., slightly slower than in 2024.\n\nImage The congestion pricing zone extends from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nStill, the real test for the tolling program will come during the workweek. The M.T.A. said it had chosen to introduce the program on a Sunday to be able to work out any kinks while traffic was sparse. Light snow was forecast for the region on Monday, which could affect commuter data if fewer people choose to drive.\n\nOn a typical weekday, at least half a million vehicles enter the congestion pricing zone, a metric that officials will be tracking \u201cvery, very closely,\u201d Mr. Lieber said.\n\nManoj Bhandari\u2019s car will no longer be among them. Though he normally drives into his Midtown office at least twice a week from New Jersey, he said he would now only take the train. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive for me and it\u2019s expensive for everybody,\u201d said Mr. Bhandari, 54, who was parked outside the Lincoln Tunnel on Sunday. \u201cWe won\u2019t be using our car anymore.\u201d\n\nTransportation officials have projected that congestion pricing will reduce the number of vehicles entering the congestion zone by at least 13 percent.\n\nOther drivers seemed to accept that there was no way around the new tolls. Oscar Velasquez, 54, a carpenter who lives on Long Island, said he was going to have to pay more now to haul his tools to jobs around the city. \u201cOne of these days, they\u2019re going to charge you for walking,\u201d Mr. Velasquez said as he idled on West 66th Street in his Chevy pickup truck.\n\nThe tolls are expected to help generate $15 billion to pay for crucial repairs and improvements to New York\u2019s aging subway system, buses and two commuter rail lines. The work includes modernizing subway signals, making stations more accessible for riders with disabilities and expanding the city\u2019s electric bus fleet.\n\nThose upgrades could improve the commute for Emily Rose Prats, 36, of Brooklyn, who supports congestion pricing. She has spinal degradation and standing for long periods can cause her great discomfort, so she has avoided the subway and the bus, which can be unreliable.\n\n\u201cThe improvements from congestion pricing are supposed to be an upgrade to the signals, which will mean faster trains, shorter headways, shorter commutes, less wait times,\u201d Ms. Prats said. \u201cAll of that is something that will help me be able to take advantage of a public amenity that we pay for.\u201d\n\nCongestion pricing is being introduced in New York at a time when traffic has surged on city streets since nearly disappearing five years ago in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. New York was named the world\u2019s most congested city, beating out London, Paris and Mexico City, in a 2023 traffic scorecard compiled by INRIX.\n\nThough congestion policy has successfully reduced traffic in other global cities, including London, Stockholm and Singapore, it has never gotten far in this country. Besides New York, a handful of other cities, like Washington and San Francisco, have explored the concept.\n\nThe program has been unpopular in the polls, and some transit experts noted that neither Mayor Eric Adams nor Gov. Kathy Hochul had commented on the start of congestion pricing by Sunday afternoon even though it will have a major impact on the city and state.\n\nMr. Adams has supported the plan while expressing reservations about it, and is running for re-election this year. Ms. Hochul paused the program in June over concerns that it would hurt the city\u2019s recovery and brought it back in November with a 40 percent reduction in the tolls, down to $9 from $15.\n\nThe tolls will increase to $12 by 2028, and to $15 by 2031. The new plan is set to generate about $500 million per year during its first three years, and then $700 million when fees first go up, then close to $1 billion when the original toll is restored. The money will be used to secure $15 billion through bond financing, which would be paid back with tolling revenue.\n\nImage Revenue from the tolling plan will be used to finance crucial improvements and upgrades to New York City\u2019s aging public transit system. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times\n\nMr. Lieber of the M.T.A. said that officials did not expect New Yorkers to change their behavior overnight.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to have to adjust to this as more and more people become aware of it and start to factor it into their planning,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a coffee shop near Lincoln Center, Terry Kotnour, a retired consultant, praised congestion pricing. \u201cThat\u2019s the cost of living here,\u201d said Mr. Kotnour, 82, who gave up his car long ago. \u201cWe have fairly good mass transit, so use it instead.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Kevin Chau, 27, a software engineer from Queens who rides Citi Bike, said that he hoped Manhattan would become safer for cyclists. \u201cLess cars on the road means it\u2019s less dangerous for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many critics, including suburban commuters, said the program will do little to reduce traffic while punishing drivers who live outside Manhattan.\n\nOn the same day that congestion pricing began, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also began to charge drivers higher fees to travel between New Jersey and New York on bridges and tunnels, which it controls. (The rate is now $16.06 for passenger vehicles during peak hours, up by 68 cents from the previous fee.)\n\nImage Empty lanes at the New Jersey entrance of the Holland Tunnel. New Jersey residents have been among the loudest critics of congestion pricing. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York Times\n\nRoselyn Cano, 21, just bought a car last week to commute from the Bronx to her job at an exercise studio on East 59th Street in Manhattan because she did not feel safe taking the subway. \u201cAnd then a couple of days later we get hit with the congestion toll,\u201d said Ms. Cano, who sat at a reception desk at the studio tallying up the costs of the new toll along with her car payment, auto insurance, parking and the toll she already pays crossing from the Bronx into Manhattan.\n\nSome New Yorkers were already devising workarounds to avoid paying the new tolls.\n\nCynthia Jones, who lives on the Upper West Side, was taking an exercise class at the studio. Her husband had dropped her off at 61st Street, one block north of the tolling zone. \u201cI walked the rest of the way here,\u201d she said.\n\nReporting was contributed by Wesley Parnell , Bernard Mokam , Nate Schweber , Olivia Bensimon , Anusha Bayya , Camille Baker , Sean Piccoli and Emma Fitzsimmons ."

            "article_content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in reshaping the educational landscape. Sandeep Kumar Nangunori, a thought leader in this field, highlights how AI-driven databases are setting new benchmarks in personalized learning and educational efficiency.\n\nThe Power of Intelligent Database Systems\n\nAt the core of the transformation lies the evolution of database systems from simple storage solutions to intelligent platforms. These systems now process vast amounts of multimodal data, including student interactions, assessment outcomes, and behavioral patterns. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, AI-driven databases enable institutions to move away from one-size-fits-all teaching methods, creating tailored learning pathways for each student.\n\nSuch systems provide real-time analytics, dynamic content delivery, and predictive insights, allowing educators to identify learning gaps and intervene proactively. This innovation not only enhances student engagement but also improves academic outcomes significantly.\n\nAdaptive Learning: The Key to Personalization\n\nAdaptive learning algorithms are a cornerstone of AI-powered education. They analyze diverse data points, such as performance metrics and engagement patterns, to adjust content complexity and pace. Features like \u201cdynamic scaffolding\u201d ensure that students remain challenged yet supported within their optimal learning zone.\n\nAdditionally, these algorithms integrate cognitive and emotional dimensions to recommend resources that align with individual learning styles. This dual focus on personalization and metacognitive development transforms the traditional learning experience into a highly interactive and engaging process.\n\nBehavioral Insights for Holistic Education\n\nAI-driven systems excel at capturing nuanced behavioral data, including navigation patterns, time-on-task, and peer collaboration. This data is used to construct detailed learning profiles that inform both short-term interventions and long-term educational strategies.\n\nFor instance, early warning systems powered by AI can identify students at risk of falling behind by analyzing subtle changes in engagement or performance. These systems trigger timely interventions, providing additional support before issues escalate. Such proactive measures foster a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.\n\nEnhancing Educator Efficiency\n\nAI-driven databases are not just beneficial for students; they also empower educators by streamlining administrative tasks and enhancing teaching effectiveness. Automated grading, real-time feedback mechanisms, and data-driven insights allow teachers to focus more on personalized instruction.\n\nFurthermore, professional development programs tailored for educators ensure that they can fully leverage these advanced tools. Training in AI-driven instructional design and adaptive teaching methodologies equips teachers to meet the demands of modern educational paradigms.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nWhile the potential of AI in education is immense, implementing such systems comes with its challenges. Data standardization remains a critical hurdle as institutions grapple with diverse formats and sources. Interoperability between existing systems and new AI-driven platforms is equally complex, requiring robust integration frameworks.\n\nEquity and access are also major considerations. Bridging the digital divide and ensuring that advanced learning tools benefit all students\u2014regardless of socioeconomic background\u2014are essential for the success of these technologies. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from policymakers, educators, and technology providers.\n\nThe Future of AI in Education\n\nEmerging technologies promise even greater possibilities for education. Concepts like Education 5.0 envision the integration of AI with immersive technologies, creating intelligent learning environments that adapt to the evolving needs of students. Future developments will likely focus on refining personalization algorithms, enhancing cross-platform compatibility, and developing sophisticated assessment tools.\n\nResearch in this area continues to expand, exploring innovative solutions such as integrating artificial and human intelligence, building adaptive learning ecosystems, and fostering student-centered educational models. As these advancements unfold, they will redefine the boundaries of what is possible in education.\n\nIn conclusion, as Sandeep Kumar Nangunori aptly demonstrates, AI-driven databases are more than a technological advancement\u2014they represent a paradigm shift in how education is delivered. By enabling personalized learning at scale, these systems enhance student outcomes, improve teaching efficiency, and pave the way for a more inclusive educational future. Moving forward, a balanced approach that prioritizes accessibility, privacy, and pedagogical effectiveness will be crucial in realizing the full potential of AI in education."

Source: Khartoum State Government/Handout via Reuters.\n\nSudan\u2019s army chief has welcomed a Turkish offer to resolve the brutal 20-month conflict between his forces and their paramilitary rivals, the Sudanese foreign minister said.\n\nIn early December, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a phone call with Sudan\u2019s Abdel Fattah al-Burhan that Ankara could help establish \u201cpeace and stability\u201d in the war-torn African state.\n\nAt a meeting in Port Sudan on Saturday, Burhan asked Turkey\u2019s deputy foreign minister Burhanettin Duran to \u201cdeliver the Sudanese leadership\u2019s welcoming of the initiative\u201d to Erdogan, Sudanese foreign minister Ali Youssef said in a briefing after the meeting.\n\n\u201cSudan needs brothers and friends like Turkey,\u201d Youssef said, adding that \u201cthe initiative can lead to\u2026 realising peace in Sudan\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErdogan said in his December call with Burhan that Turkey \u201ccould step in to resolve disputes\u201d between Sudan and the United Arab Emirates, and prevent Sudan from \u201cbecoming an area of external interventions\u201d, according to a statement from the Turkish presidency.\n\nSudan\u2019s army-backed government has repeatedly accused the UAE of supporting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \u2013 claims echoed by outside analysts, which the UAE has consistently denied.\n\nLast month, the Sudanese government accused the RSF of launching UAE-assembled drones from neighbouring Chad.\n\nUS lawmakers long critical of the Gulf power\u2019s role quoted the White House as saying late last month that the UAE had told the United States it would not arm paramilitaries in Sudan\u2019s war.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Burhan on Saturday, Turkey\u2019s Duran said that the peace process \u201centails concerted efforts\u201d, and that his country was ready to play a \u201crole in mobilising other regional actors to help overcoming the difficulties in ending this conflict\u201d.\n\nIn a statement last week, the UAE welcomed \u201cdiplomatic efforts\u201d by Turkey to \u201cresolve the ongoing crisis in Sudan\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe UAE is fully prepared to cooperate and coordinate with the Turkish efforts and all diplomatic initiatives to end the conflict in Sudan and find a comprehensive solution to the crisis,\u201d its foreign ministry said.\n\nThe war in Sudan, which has pitted Burhan against his former deputy and RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted 12 million more.\n\nIt has also pushed the country to the brink of famine, with analysts warning involvement from other countries will only prolong the suffering.\n\nAdvertisement"

The Nifty Midcap Select fell 2.00 per cent to 12,749.90, while the banking sector indices also faced significant losses with Nifty Bank down 1.61 per cent at 50,167.95 and Nifty Financial Services declining 1.35 per cent to 23,415.20.\n\nMarket breadth remained heavily negative with 3,223 stocks declining against 734 advances on the BSE. The number of stocks hitting lower circuit at 365 significantly outnumbered those touching upper circuit at 228. Despite the broad market weakness, 159 stocks managed to hit their 52-week highs, while 67 touched their 52-week lows.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals emerged as the top gainer on the NSE, rising 0.91 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank and Titan with modest gains of 0.15 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively. The major losers included Tata Steel (-4.18 per cent), BPCL (-3.46 per cent), Adani Enterprises (-3.22 per cent), Kotak Bank (-3.10 per cent), and Trent (-3.05 per cent).\n\nThe market sentiment was affected by news of two HMPV cases detected in Karnataka, both involving infants. The Union Health Ministry confirmed that the cases were identified through routine surveillance, with both patients admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, for bronchopneumonia. Neither patient had any international travel history.\n\nWhile the Health Ministry maintained that the HMPV strain is already in global circulation and that there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses, the news appeared to trigger concerns among investors, leading to broad-based selling across sectors.\n\nThe market reaction comes despite the Ministry\u2019s assurance of preparedness and ongoing monitoring through the ICMR and IDSP network, with support from the WHO in tracking the situation in China."

He\u2019s also concerned the global economy will soon collapse.\n\nHe has a private practice with a revenue of approximately \u00a3180,000 a year, which he is looking to expand, while the company also has cash reserves of \u00a350,000.

            "article_content": "The recently released Thelio Astra from American computer manufacturer System76 is being touted as \"the fastest Arm desktop computer in the world\" \u2013 or at least that's what developer and influencer Jeff Geerling declared after putting the system through its paces.\n\nIn Geerling's testing using the Cinebench 2024 benchmark, the top-tier variant of the Thelio Astra, powered by the 128-core Ampere Altra Max M128-30, achieved an eye-watering 5,003 points in multi-threaded mode. This score edges out the certified world record of 4,723 points set by AMD's EPYC 7713 chip with a similar number of cores.\n\nGiven these figures, it's no surprise that the Astra also excelled in Blender rendering workloads. Geerling specifically highlighted the system's impressive 1.7 TFLOPS of double-precision compute power.\n\nWhen it comes to the overall package, this is far from your average pre-built desktop. The entry-level $3,299 model already packs a serious punch with 64 cores, 64GB of RAM, and an RTX A400 GPU. However, the top configuration Geerling tested \u2013 priced just shy of $7,000 \u2013 pulls out all the stops with 128 cores, 512GB of octa-channel RAM, 40TB of storage capacity, and an RTX 6000 Ada GPU.\n\nAll this hardware is housed in a sleek, quiet tower, which again is a surprise considering the near server-grade specs. Patriots will also be pleased to know that it's an American-made system, coming straight out of System76's Denver facility.\n\nGeerling did highlight some downsides with the system though. Beyond its ultra-premium pricing, single-threaded performance is underwhelming and barely inches past AMD's 2017 Threadripper 1950X in the same Cinebench test. That's sad considering the prodigious multi-core muscle.\n\nThere are also platform limitations to consider. The system is restricted to PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 RAM, which may feel outdated to some. Geerling was also less than thrilled with the lack of front I/O ports and noted some rattling from the PCIe brackets. And if you're thinking about gaming on this machine while running Windows, think again \u2013 Nvidia has yet to release Arm-compatible drivers.\n\nBut then again, the Thelio Astra isn't designed to be a gaming rig or a general-purpose desktop PC replacement. System76 is squarely targeting developers, with a particular emphasis on the automotive software industry, where it shines as a platform for \"rapid dev prototyping.\"\n\n\"System76 and Ampere ride together to make Thelio Astra the driving force behind AV development,\" the company notes on its website. If you're in that niche and have cash to burn, this could be the latest must-have Arm toy for you."

            "article_content": "The task of astrobiologists who seek evidence for extrasolar microbes is as simple as imitation. Primitive forms of extraterrestrial life should exist under physical conditions that were nurtured in natural environments similar to those on Earth. Hence, astrobiologists plan to search for the molecular products of microbes-as-we-know-them on rocky exoplanets with atmospheres in the habitable zone of their host stars.\n\nThe latest Decadal Survey in Astrophysics of the National Academies, Astro2020, recommended a 6-meter space telescope operating in the infrared, optical and ultraviolet bands, capable of high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. Scheduled for launch by NASA in the 2040s, this Habitable Worlds Observatory will be designed to search for spectroscopic biosignatures of microbial life in roughly 25 habitable zone exoplanets at a likely cost of over 10-billion dollars.\n\nWhere to look becomes more subtle when dealing with intelligent forms of life because they can relocate and spread away from their birth exoplanet. Almost all forms of life, on Earth and beyond, died by now. Those who survive the longest on our cosmic street might have done so by escaping their home planet on artificially made space platforms to avoid existential risks from local catastrophes.\n\nAs much as nature is often viewed as a blessing, it could also be a curse. For example, there is strong evidence that Earth\u2019s surface became nearly entirely frozen with no liquid water exposed to the atmosphere during the Cryogenian period, more than 650 million years ago. Over the entire history of Earth, more than 99.9% of the over 5-billion speciesthat ever lived went extinct. Some of these species were wiped out by well-documented cataclysmic events, such as the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary event which was likely triggered by the impact of the Chicxulub meteor which eliminated 75% of plant and animal species on Earth including the non-avian dinosaurs. However, the majority of extinctions could have been the result of natural evolution with the livelihoods of some species destroyed by changes and unfavorable competition. The situation resembles political views which lose their livelihood after a devastating Presidential election.\n\nThe typical lifespan of a terrestrial species is 1-10 million years. This is an interesting factoid, since humans evolved from great apes through the lineage of hominini \u2013 which arose 5-7 million years ago. Keeping these facts in mind, the human species is getting close to the end of its expected natural lifespan. Will technology save us?\n\nAs much as technology could delay the existential threats from a snowball or a globally-warmed Earth, the evolution of the host star itself sets a time limit on the ability of a natural nuclear furnace to support life on a planet. Most stars formed billions of years before the Sun, and the Sun will boil off all oceans on Earth within a billion years. Recognizing this and other existential risks, a sufficiently advanced technological civilization would prefer to migrate away its birth habitat. This rationale inspires Elon Musk\u2019s vision to occupy Mars and make humanity a multi-planet species.\n\nHowever, once a technological civilization develops the ability to migrate away from its birth planet, it might also be capable of pursuing its goals far away from its host star on an artificial space platform, potentially powered by its own nuclear energy source. This could lengthen considerably the most important parameter in the Drake equation, namely the lifespan of a technological civilization.\n\nTraditionally, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) targeted the vicinity of stars. However, once technology allows escape from natural habitats, all bets are off. Space platforms carrying biological entities or hardware with artificial intelligence may be found anywhere. Technological probes that can self-replicate could fill up interstellar space in less than a few billion years using conventional chemical propulsion.\n\nGiven this realization, it makes most sense to start the search for technological debris around the nearest lamppost, our Sun. This is the rationale behind the Galileo Project, which under my leadership searches for technological artifacts within the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. Our research team operates a new observatory at Harvard University and constructs two additional observatories in Pennsylvania and Nevada. My students and postdocs also plan to analyze forthcoming data from the Rubin Observatory in Chile and the Webb telescope in the coming years. Finally, we hope to conduct expeditions in search for materials from crash sites of interstellar meteors.\n\nWhat other civilizations accomplished may exceed our imagination. Therefore, it is best not to anticipate what we might find but instead search for unfamiliar objects, not produced by nature or human-made technologies.\n\nWe must hedge our bets in the search for life. This means investing billions of dollars not only in seeking biological signatures of microbes in atmospheres of exoplanets but also in the search for technological artifacts that arrive near the Sun from interstellar space. With all these efforts, the keys of life might first be discovered around the nearest lamp post on our cosmic street.\n\nAvi Loeb is the head of the Galileo Project, founding director of Harvard University\u2019s \u2013 Black Hole Initiative, director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and the former chair of the astronomy department at Harvard University (2011-2020).

The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery by scientists at Japan\u2019s RIKEN Center for Brain Science has revealed an unexpected link between dopamine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

            "article_content": "A new breakthrough may help scientists solve some of the mysteries of the quantum realm.\n\nFor the first time, physicists have been able to measure the geometrical 'shape' a lone electron adopts as it moves through a solid. It's an achievement that will unlock a whole new way of studying how crystalline solids behave on a quantum level.\n\n\"We've essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn't be obtained before,\" says physicist Riccardo Comin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThe research was led by physicists Mingu Kang \u2013 formerly of MIT and now at Cornell University \u2013 and Sunjie Kim of Seoul National University.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWithin the physical Universe, matter behaves in ways that are well described by classical physics.\n\nHowever, on a more fundamental level of particle interactions and methods of measurement, things can get a little weird. On the finest of scales, precision must give way to a more fuzzy description represented by waves of possibility known as quantum mechanics.\n\nWe refer to objects like electrons as particles, and that conveys the impression that they are like teeny tiny little balls. Given their size, the properties and behaviors of electrons are far more accurately described by their wave-like quantum nature.\n\nTo describe the wave aspect of electrons, physicists use wave functions: mathematical models that describe the properties of the wave as evolving possibilities of finding the particle in a specific place with specific features.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome of these features we can think of as a kind of geometry, often not unlike a curve or sphere that rotates in an infinite number of directions. Other forms of quantum geometry, like those of electrons in a lattice of atoms, are as complicated as a Klein bottle or a M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nDetermining some aspects of the messy quantum geometry of an electron in a solid has previously involved a lot of guesswork based on properties that physicists can measure.\n\nTo measure the quantum geometry of electrons, Kang, Jie, and their colleagues sought the measurement of a property known as the quantum geometric tensor, or QGT. This is a physical quantity that encodes the entire geometric information of a quantum state, similar to the way a two-dimensional hologram encodes information about a three-dimensional space.\n\nThe technique they used is called angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in which photons are fired at a material to dislodge electrons and measure their properties, such as polarization, spin, and angle.\n\nTheoretical (j, m) and real (k, l) measurements of quantum geometry. (Kang et al., Nat. Phys., 2024)\n\nThis was directed at single crystals of a cobalt-tin alloy, a material known as a kagome metal \u2013 a quantum material whose properties the team had previously investigated using the same technique.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe results provided the researchers with the first measurement of the QGT in a solid, and from this, they were able to infer the rest of the quantum geometry of the electrons in the metal.\n\nThe team compared this to theoretically derived quantum geometry for the same material, allowing them to determine the usefulness of estimating the geometry compared to measuring it directly.\n\nAnd, they say, their technique will be applicable to a broad range of materials, not just the cobalt-tin alloy used for this study. It's a result that will have some interesting implications. For example, quantum geometry could be leveraged to discover superconductivity in materials where it is not usually found.\n\n\"The geometric interpretation of quantum mechanics underpins many recent advances in condensed-matter physics,\" an anonymous expert told Nature Physics.\n\n\"These authors have pioneered a methodology to experimentally access the quantum geometric tensor, which fundamentally characterizes the geometric properties of quantum states. The developed methodology is straightforward, applicable to various solid-state materials, and has great potential for boosting experimental activity in pursuit of geometric understanding of novel quantum phenomena.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe team's research has been published in Nature Physics.\n\nRelated News"

            "article_content": "Swami Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna |\n\nHaridwar, January 5: In the presence of Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj, the President of Patanjali Yogpeeth, and Acharya Balkrishna, the General Secretary, the 30th foundation day of the Patanjali institution was celebrated at the Yog Bhavan Auditorium, located at Patanjali Wellness, Haridwar. In the program, with the presence of more than 6,000 officials from the Patanjali Yogpeeth organization across the country, Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj gave an introduction to the 30 years of service, struggle, and dedication and shed light on the future plans of Patanjali Yogpeeth. While announcing the five revolutions after the success of the Yoga Revolution, he said that Patanjali will initiate significant work for freedom in education, healthcare, economy, intellectual-cultural freedom, and liberation from diseases, indulgences, shame, and frustrations.\n\nFirst Revolution: Freedom in Education\n\nHe said that today, 50 to 90, and in some places, 99 percent educated individuals are unemployed, addicted, characterless, and dull children, whose childhood, youth, and our lineage are in danger. We have decided that first in India and then in the entire world, a new education system will be introduced, and its leadership will be done by India. Patanjali Gurukul, Acharyakulam, Patanjali University, and the Indian Education Board will now establish new benchmarks. Our resolution is that in the next five years, we will connect 500,000 schools with the Indian Education Board. This will be an innovative revolution in education.\n\nWe want to give children not only literacy but also subject knowledge, self-awareness, truth-oriented patriotism, and awareness of their pride and glory. We will include knowledge from across the world in Hindi, English, and Sanskrit, keeping up-to-date with the world, but 80% of the content will be from Vedas, philosophy, Upanishads, Puranas, and the pride of India. It will include spiritual sciences, Sanatan awareness, and Indian pride. This will not be Macaulay\u2019s education system. When the Indian Education Board affiliates first 100,000 schools and then 500,000 schools, India's childhood and youth will be secure. This is the resolution for freedom in education. Through the Indian Education Board, we will not teach the false greatness of foreign invaders, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or the British, but rather the true history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, and revolutionaries.\n\nSecond Revolution: Freedom in Healthcare\n\n\"Disease is not our nature; Yoga is our nature.\" Today, around the world, due to the consumption of synthetic medicines, steroids, and painkillers, people\u2019s bodies are deteriorating. For healthcare freedom, through Patanjali Wellness, Yoggram, Niramayam, hospitals, and health centers, and modern research, we are advancing the legacy of sages and science. We have published more than 5,000 research protocols and 500 research papers in world-class international journals, presenting solutions to incurable diseases before the world. Our resolution is to prevent people from becoming diseased and to liberate them from diseases through Yoga and Ayurveda.\n\nThird Revolution: Economic Freedom\n\nToday, the entire economy is trapped in the cruel claws of a handful of people. Our goal is prosperity for service and wealth for welfare. So far, Patanjali has done charity worth \u20b91 lakh crore in education, healthcare, research, character-building, and nation-building. With over 10,000 centers, 2.5 million trained Yoga instructors, and 1 crore workers selflessly serving, this is the service work of nation-building and character-building. Our resolution is to make the Swadeshi movement so powerful that India can emerge from economic exploitation, slavery, and poverty, and become supremely prosperous. By eliminating diseases like BP, diabetes, thyroid, asthma, arthritis, stress, and depression and saving on medicines, we save \u20b9700 to \u20b92,000 lakh crore annually for the country.\n\nFourth Revolution: Intellectual and Cultural Freedom\n\nIndia, which first gave the message of spiritual world knowledge to the world, cannot afford to endure intellectual and cultural slavery. Today, India depends on impoverished countries for everything, which have nothing but paper money, dollars, or pounds. True wealth is not just money but also good health, a happy family, character, spiritual wealth, and divine virtues. We must liberate India from intellectual and cultural slavery. Hence, we aim to elevate Sanatan Dharma, Vedic Dharma, Sage Dharma, and Yoga Dharma as the new religion of the era. More than 500 crore people worldwide have faith in Yoga Dharma and Sanatan Dharma. If we walk together, we will end religious terrorism, political terrorism, and the terror being perpetuated in the name of education and healthcare.\n\nFifth Revolution: Freedom from Addictions, Diseases, and Indulgences\n\nA dangerous game of addiction is spreading worldwide. In India, addiction has destroyed lives through diseases, intoxication, and obscenity. Our resolution is freedom from diseases, addictions, and obscenity. On completing 30 years, Patanjali resolves to make the world Yoga-oriented and create ideal global citizens through character-building.\n\nRemarks by Acharya Balkrishna Ji Maharaj\n\nAcharya Balkrishna remarked that with Swami Ji's unrelenting and extraordinary efforts, Patanjali's contribution is inspiring the world. Patanjali runs campaigns for charity using profits from its business. Patanjali is not a market but a family for India. With a team of over 500 world-class scientists, Patanjali is making evidence-based Ayurvedic medicines like juices, herbs, and tablets accessible worldwide. By integrating India\u2019s ancient knowledge with modern science, Patanjali has brought Yoga from caves to the masses, reaching millions in over 200 countries."
