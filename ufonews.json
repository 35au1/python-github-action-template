        "article_content": "Watch live! 2nd UFO hearing held by US congress, witnesses include fmr. miltary - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs today, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You can watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

        "article_content": "The media industry today may not have a very favorable view of AI \u2014 a technology that\u2019s already been used to replace reporters with AI-written copy, while other AI companies have scooped up journalists\u2019 work to feed their chatbots\u2019 data demands, but without returning traffic to the publisher as search engines once did. However, one startup, an AI newsreader called Particle from former Twitter engineers, believes that AI could serve a valuable role in the media industry by helping consumers make sense of the news and dig deeper into stories, while still finding a way to support the publishers\u2019 businesses.\n\nBacked by $4.4 million in seed funding and a $10.9 million Series A led by Lightspeed, Particle was founded last year by the former senior director of Product Management at Twitter, Sara Beykpour, who worked on products like Twitter Blue, Twitter Video, and conversations, and who spearheaded the experimental app, twttr. Her co-founder is a former senior engineer at Twitter and Tesla, Marcel Molina.\n\nFrom the consumers\u2019 perspective, the core idea behind Particle is to help readers better understand the news with the help of AI technology. More than just summarizing stories into key bullet points for quick catch-ups, Particle offers a variety of clever features that let you approach the news in different ways.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nBut instead of simply sucking up publishers\u2019 work for its own use, Particle aims to compensate publishers or even drive traffic back to news sites by prominently showcasing and linking to sources directly underneath its AI summaries.\n\nTo start, Particle has partnered with specific publishers to host some of their content in the app via their APIs, including outlets like Reuters, AFP, and Fortune. These partners receive better positioning and their links are highlighted in gold above others.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nAlready, beta tests indicate that readers are clicking through to publishers\u2019 sites because of the app\u2019s design and user interface, though that could shift now that the app is launching beyond news junkies to the general public. In time, the company intends to introduce other ways to work with the media, too, in addition to sending them referral traffic. The team is also having discussions with publishers about providing its users access to paywalled content in a way that makes sense for all parties.\n\n\u201cHaving deep partnerships and collaboration is one of the things that we\u2019re really interested in,\u201d notes Beykpour.\n\nTo help with its traffic referral efforts, the app\u2019s article section includes big tap targets, making it easy for readers to click through to the publisher\u2019s site. Plus, Particle includes the faces of the journalists on their bylines, and readers can follow through links to publisher profiles to read more of their content or follow them.\n\nUsing the app\u2019s built-in AI tools, news consumers can switch between different modes like \u201cExplain Like I\u2019m 5,\u201d to get a simplified version of a complicated story or those that summarize \u201cjust the facts,\u201d (or the 5W\u2019s \u2014 who, what, when, where, and why). You can have the news summarized in another language besides English, or listen to an audio summary of a story or a personalized selection of stories while on the go. Particle can also pull out important quotes from a story and other links of reference.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nBut two of the more interesting features involve how Particle leverages AI to help present the news from different angles and allows you to further engage with the story at hand by asking questions.\n\nIn Particle, one tool called \u201cOpposite Sides\u201d aims to break users\u2019 filter bubbles by presenting different viewpoints from the same story. This model has been tried before by other news apps, including the startup Brief and SmartNews. Unlike earlier efforts, Particle includes a story spectrum that shows how news is being reported across both \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d-leaning sites, with bubbles placed to indicate how far to the left or right the news\u2019 positioning is, and how outsized the coverage may be from one side or the other. The AI will also summarize both sides\u2019 positions, allowing news consumers to reach their own opinions about the matter.\n\nImage Credits:Particle\n\nHowever, the app\u2019s killer feature is an AI chatbot that lets you ask questions and get instant answers about a story. The app will include suggested questions and those asked by others. For example, if you\u2019re reading about Trump\u2019s immigration policy plans, you could ask the chatbot things like \u201cWhat are the potential legal challenges to Trump\u2019s deportation plans?\u201d or \u201cWhat are the potential costs of mass deportation?\u201d among other things. Particle will then use its AI technology to find those answers and fact-check them for accuracy.\n\n\u201cThe chat function uses OpenAI as well as\u2026our own pre-processing and post-processing,\u201d explains Beykpour, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cIt uses the content, searches the web a little bit \u2014 if it wants to find extra information on the web \u2014 to generate those answers.\u201d She says that after the answer is generated, Particle includes an extra step where the AI has to go find the supporting material that matches those answers.\n\nOverall, the app encompasses tech like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, Anthropic, Cohere, and others, including more traditional AI technologies, which are not LLM-based, from Google.\n\n\u201cWe have a processing pipeline that takes related content and summarizes it into bullet points, into a headline, sub-headline, and does all the extractions,\u201d she continues. \u201cThen\u2026we pull out quotes and links and all sorts of relevant information about [the story]. And we have our own algorithms to rank, so that the most important or relevant link is the one that you see first \u2014 or what we think is the most important or relevant quote is the one that you see first.\u201d\n\nThe company claims that its technology reduces AI accuracy problems that would otherwise occur one out of 100 times, and reduces their likelihood to one out of 10,000 times.\n\nParticle will also use human editors as it grows to help better manage the AI content and curate its homepage, she notes.\n\nThe app is a free download on iOS for the time being and works across iPhone and iPad.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

The AI then fills in the empty space, making it look like the object was never there.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"With generative fill, you can make edits and additions with just a few words while maintaining the existing art style of your project.

This tool allows users to rephrase sentences, adjust the tone of their text, and modify the content's length based on their preferences.\n\nThe Rewrite feature in Notepad is currently available in preview to Windows 11 users in select countries, including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, and Germany. Users need to sign in with a Microsoft account to access this feature.\n\nIf the generative fill turns out to be as good as what Adobe has for Photoshop, it can be a real changer for Microsoft Paint. Maybe I'll start using it again after last using it in 5th grade."

I believe there are more things in this world that we don\u2019t understand, and I don\u2019t discount the possibility at all,\u201d said Fran Walters, who has lived next door for the last 28 years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first moved out here, I\u2019d walk by there and I could not believe there was a little girl playing in the front, and I remember thinking, \u2018How could a family with little kids buy this house?'\u201d she said.\n\n5 On Nov. 13, 1947, Ronald DeFeo, 23, walked through his Amityville home and executed his sleeping family Newsday via Getty Images\n\nThe house has long attracted curiosity seekers over its claims that it is haunted, but the legends began with a real-life crime on Nov. 13, 1974.\n\nAt around 3 a.m., 23-year-old Ronald \u201cButch\u201d DeFeo rose from bed with a .35 caliber rifle in his hands and executed his parents and four siblings as they slept.\n\nHe then got dressed, and went to work. It wasn\u2019t until hours later that DeFeo burst into a neighborhood bar and claimed somebody had attacked his family.\n\nThe next year DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, but he spent his life blaming a long list of others \u2014 at one point reportedly claiming \u201cvoices\u201d coming from the house urged him to do it.\n\nThough DeFeo was believed to be a heavy drug user, famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren \u2014 who have since been fictionalized in \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d series of movies \u2014 came to believe he was performing satanic rituals, and those voices may have been demonic forces he unleashed on the house.\n\n5 DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, and died in 2021 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\u201cDeFeo was into Satanism,\u201d said Tony Spera, the Warrens\u2019 son-in-law, who now leads the couple\u2019s New England Society of Psychic Research. \u201cHe had a little room they called the red room because it was painted red, and there\u2019s a little cubby hole and he kept his satanic artifacts in there.\n\n\u201cThings were happening in the home,\u201d Spera told The Post. \u201cSomething was going on in that house that was nefarious, and we believe it was Ronald DeFeo Jr. doing these satanic rituals.\u201d\n\nAs DeFeo was being sentenced, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the Amityville house with their three kids at a bargain price of $80,000.\n\nOver the next 28 days, the family claimed they were harassed by a host of terrifying happenings \u2014 including levitations and visions of hags, the children sleeping face-down just as the DeFeos bodies were found, freezing temperatures while fireplaces raged, and slime oozing from walls and doors.\n\n5 Tony Spera, the son-in-law of Ed and Lorraine Warren, cautioned that the Amityville house could still be haunted Matthew McDermott\n\nThey fled the home before the month was out, and after a local news station camped out at the house for a segment the Warrens showed up to investigate \u2014 but the Lutzes reportedly refused to go back inside with them.\n\n\u201cThere was an arrangement for George to meet Ed and Lorraine at a pizza place about five blocks away from the Amityville house,\u201d Spera recounted. \u201cEd said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go to the house and check it out.\u2019\n\n\u201cGeorge stands up, pulls out the keys to the house. He goes, \u2018Here\u2019s the keys. I\u2019m not going in that house \u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere near that house. Do me a favor, Ed, in such-and-such a drawer there\u2019s a deed to the house. Just get me that, will you?\u2019\u201d\n\nMonths later the Lutzes inked a book deal to tell their story, with \u201cThe Amityville Horror: A Story,\u201d which came out in 1977 and was an immediate success, sparking an even more successful film and sequels.\n\nThough many wrote it off as a hoax \u2014 DeFeo\u2019s own attorney, William Weber, later claimed he and the family concocted the story over several bottles of wine \u2014 the Lutz parents stood by their story for life.\n\n5 George and Kathy Lutz stood by their haunting story their entire lives Getty Images\n\nAnd while the house has changed hands numerous times since the Lutzes left, none of the owners have ever reported any hauntings over those five decades \u2014 something Spera thinks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Lutzes were lying, or that whatever haunted them is really gone.\n\n\u201cEd used to not want to talk very much about it, because he said the more recognition you give to it, the more likely something would happen. It depends on the entity, too, that might be at that house. It may lay dormant for years,\u201d Spera said.\n\n\u201cThere could possibly \u2014 and I\u2019m emphasizing the word possibly \u2014 still be something dormant in that structure that could reignite with either recognition, or somebody doing rituals in the house, incantations, or a family that is susceptible to hauntings \u2014 in other words, a family that\u2019s weak-willed, or someone in the house that\u2019s weak-willed.\n\n5 The Amityville house has changed hands numerous times since 1974, but nobody has reported a haunting since Getty Images\n\n\u201cSo in other words, I can move into a house. I can make it haunted. I can make the house haunted by dabbling in occult practices, by doing witchcraft, incantations, satanic rituals, using a Ouija board in the house,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you do things like that, you\u2019re inviting things into your life. You\u2019re inviting the unknown in.\u201d\n\nThe current residents of the house \u2013 along with one of the Lutz children \u2013 declined to comment.\n\nAs for Walters \u2014 who \u201cmade it a point to never ever, ever watch the movie\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s ventured inside the \u201cbeautiful\u201d home once during an estate sale, but wouldn\u2019t consider living there.\n\n\u201cIn the back of my head, the Amityville Horror would always be there. You\u2019d hear a little creak in the night and it might set you off. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said."

Vendors outdid themselves and showcased their creativity by blending both of the seasons.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Museum of Orange County has hosted the festival since it first began in 2022.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who live spooky all year long, which I do, it\u2019s great, big way for us to transition out of Halloween and into the holiday season,\u201d said Darcy Staniforth, the museum\u2019s paranormal coordinator. \u201cHistorically, people used to tell ghost stories at Christmas. A creepy event during the holiday season only makes sense.\u201d\n\nGhostface and Michael Myers cosplayers get into the Christmas spirit at Creep it Real Festive.

        "article_content": "10 real-life destinations straight out of a Tim Burton movie\n\nFew directors working today have a visual style as distinctive as Tim Burton. The writer-director has been building gothically surreal and whimsically macabre worlds for decades, blending darkness, oddball energy, and the downright bizarre to create darkly funny, unmistakable movies for viewers of all ages.\n\nAlthough his feature debut was Pee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure in 1985, his true coming out as an auteur was 1988\u2019s Beetlejuice. Full of gallows humour, eccentric paranormal beings, and a truly surreal version of the afterlife, it set a high watermark for Burton\u2019s career and offered actors like Winona Ryder, Michael Keaton, and Catherine O\u2019Hara some of the most delightful roles of their careers.\n\nAlthough Burton\u2019s visual style is unmistakable, he\u2019s used it in a wide variety of settings. From mist-shrouded forests in Sleepy Hollow to the secluded castle in Edward Scissorhands and the wild skeleton party in Corpse Bride, he\u2019s found all the ways to make horror tropes as stylised and charming as possible.\n\nGiven their darkness, it might seem strange that anyone would want to live in or even visit the world of a Tim Burton film, but as any of his fans could tell you, there is more beauty, mystery, and quirkiness in that cloak of doom than you might imagine, and spending just a few moments in those fantastical settings would be worth a trip around the world.\n\nHighgate Cemetery, London\n\nA lot of business happens in the cemetery in Beetlejuice. It\u2019s where the freelance bio-exorcist of the title dwells, waiting for someone to call on him for assistance. And as a result, it\u2019s where Michael Keaton does the most\u2026 enthusiastic acting of his career. The graveyard may be nothing more than a model come to life, but the atmosphere is set by all those tombstones, even if they are made of cardboard. Then, there\u2019s Halloween Town in The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is full of sinister grey stones and curling mist.\n\nAny self-respecting Burton fan should make a trip to a graveyard, and few are as scenic as Highgate Cemetery in north London. Designed by architect Stephen Geary nearly two centuries ago, it is home to about 170,000 bodies and covers 15 hectares (37 acres). It features winding pathways lined with towering crypts, moss-covered gravestones, and almost certainly supernatural activity. It may not be the location of any of Burton\u2019s films, but it definitely feels like one.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Joanna Penn)\n\nHallstatt, Austria\n\nOne of Burton\u2019s favourite stylistic touchstones in the gothic period. Whether drawing on architecture or simply putting all his characters in dark eyeliner, he is committed to all things goth, in both the capitalised and lowercase sense of the word. Many of his settings also feature isolation, especially tall houses on hills above a town. This architecture gives his main characters an added element of loneliness. He loves characters who are ostracised, and putting them in whimsically haunted houses far away from civilization adds to their charm and moroseness.\n\nHallstatt in Austria is just such a place. Tucked away in Austria\u2019s mountainous Salzkammergut region, it sits on Lake Hallstatt and features 16th-century architecture that is both beautiful and haunting. With a population of less than 800 people, it feels cloistered and remote, just like the best of Burton\u2019s locales.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Free Walking Tour Salzburg)\n\nSedlec Ossuary, Czech Republic\n\nLet\u2019s not beat around the bush. Burton has a love of the macabre, specifically skeletons, so it stands to reason that you\u2019d need at least one travel destination that leads you to human bones. Under most circumstances, this sort of adventure could get you arrested, but not if you visit Sedlec Ossuary, a Roman Catholic chapel in Kutn\u00e1 Hora, Czech Republic.\n\nThe location began as a burial site around 1278. During the Black Plague, thousands of bodies were buried there, and when workers began to build a church on top of them in the 15th century, many of them were exhumed, and the bones were stacked in piles. Eventually, those bones were turned into art. There are garlands of skulls, a bone chandelier, and a general atmosphere of extreme eeriness. You can imagine Tim Burton feeling right at home.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Nan Palmero)\n\nHoia-Baciu Forest, Romania\n\nKnown as the most haunted forest in the world, the Hoia-Baciu Forest is located near the Transylvanian capital of Cluj-Napoca. It\u2019s only three square kilometres, but it has more than its fair share of legends, from classic ghost stories to modern claims of paranormal activity. Regardless of what you believe about the supernatural, the forest is full of tall, twisted trees that are often shrouded in mist.\n\nBurton has used shadowy woods in his movies, both animated and live-action. Like the misty forest in Corpse Bride or Western Woods in Sleepy Hollow, the Hoia-Baciu Forest gives the impression that those trees disappearing into the fog are hiding more than branches.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Cristian Bortes)\n\nOaxaca, Mexico\n\nIn Corpse Bride, Victor accidentally makes a young dead woman believe he has married her, and she takes him down to the world of the deceased. There, they visit the Ball and Socket Pub and are serenaded by Bonejangles and his band, who tell her story through song.\n\nThe upbeat nature of the music is wonderfully out of sync with the macabre setting, but Burton didn\u2019t invent the idea of colourful, joyous depictions of death. In Mexico, Dia de los Muertos is a days-long holiday honouring loved ones who have died. Instead of being a sombre occasion, it is full of colour, music, and ecstatic pageantry. Decorative skulls are everywhere, and people paint their faces to look like skeletons and erect shrines covered in bright orange marigolds to celebrate those who have passed. In the city of Oaxaca, Dia de los Muertos is as vibrant and busy as Carnival in Rio. Full of colour and dancing, it\u2019s like a bigger, more joyful, citywide version of the Ball and Socket Pub in Burton\u2019s stop-motion classic.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Cidades para Pessoas)\n\nNeuschwanstein Castle, Germany\n\nChilly mansions situated far from the cosy streets of civilization is one of Burton\u2019s most common tropes. Often, these buildings aren\u2019t haunted; they\u2019re just a metaphor for the isolation of his characters. Edward Scissorhands is the primary example. Sweet and innocent, he becomes a curiosity when he is brought down to suburbia, but being different has tragic consequences in a world of conformity.\n\nNeuschwanstein Castle in Germany is known for being the inspiration behind the Disneyland castle that appears before all the studio\u2019s movies, but one look at the real castle, and you\u2019ll see that there is nothing twee or sweetly fantastical about it. Located on a steep section of the foothills of the Alps, it appears chilly and inaccessible, exactly the sort of place where characters like Edward Scissorhands are banished.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Thomas Wolf)\n\nAshikaga Flower Park, Tochigi, Japan\n\nOne of the most gorgeously surreal destinations to visit is the Ashikaga Flower Park in Tochigi, Japan. Bursting with carefully manicured gardens featuring flowers of all shapes and colours, it looks fantastical and otherworldly. One part of the park features a ceiling of dangling purple wisteria blossoms, and at night, LED lights illuminate sections of the gardens with even more colours.\n\nIf Burton had been looking for real-world settings for Alice in Wonderland instead of relying so heavily on CGI, he could have done worse than get a filming permit for the Ashikaga Flower Park. Short of that, we can all aspire to visit the real location.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Hiroaki Kaneko)\n\nLa Petite Venise, Colmar, France\n\nIn the northeastern French city of Colmar, there is a historical neighbourhood called La Petite Venise that features colourful Alsatian half-timbered houses lining a canal. The Alsace region is close to Germany and Switzerland, giving it a distinct style of architecture that isn\u2019t governed by a single national identity.\n\nWith their steeply pitched roofs, stepped gables, and pastel walls, the houses look like they belong in any number of Burton films. The colours are reminiscent of his stylized version of suburbia in Edward Scissorhands, while their half-timbered facades are reminiscent of the Dutch houses in Sleepy Hollow. You could even imagine Bonejangles bursting out of the Ball and Socket Pub to play jazz in the streets.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Infrogmation of New Orleans)\n\nThe Dark Hedges, Northern Ireland\n\nOne of the most distinctive elements of Sleepy Hollow is the Western Woods, the misty forest where the Headless Horseman was murdered and the Crone Witch lives in a hollow. It is full of atmosphere \u2013 trees with twisted branches, leaves covering the ground, and fog so thick you can only see the spectral outlines of limbs.\n\nThe world of the film takes place in Upstate New York, but if you want to visit a group of trees that is at least as atmospheric as the one in the movie, you need to visit the Dark Hedges in Northern Ireland. Although they only form an avenue along a road rather than a forest, their undulating shape and towering height feel completely immersive. The trees may not bleed like the Tree of the Dead, but when they\u2019re shrouded in mist, they seem just as supernatural. Not surprisingly, they have already been a boon for filmmakers, specifically for the crew behind Game of Thrones.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Colin Park)\n\nPark G\u00fcell, Barcelona\n\nBurton\u2019s more recent forays into colourful, psychedelic fantasy may not be nearly up to the cinematic calibre of his earlier work, but they can\u2019t be accused of lacking style. If you\u2019re looking for a place that mimics the garish, surreal worlds of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Alice in Wonderland, Park G\u00fcell in Barcelona is a close approximation.\n\nDesigned by pioneering Modernist architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, the park is famous for its colourful mosaics, rounded edges, and geometric shapes. Walking through it feels like stepping into another world, just like Charlie and Alice do in their respective movies.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Bernard Gagnon)"

(NASDAQ: BIDU and HKEX: 9888), a leading AI company with strong Internet foundation, today hosted its annual flagship technology conference Baidu World 2024 in Shanghai. At the event, the company announced a range of new AI technologies and solutions to accelerate the boom of AI applications, featuring iRAG (Image-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a new technology designed to tackle hallucinations in image generation, and Miaoda, a no-code tool that empowers businesses and individuals to create applications.\n\nThe launch comes amid surging demand for Baidu's AI offerings, as evidenced by the ERNIE foundation model's daily API calls reaching 1.5 billion by early November. This represents a substantial 30-fold increase from the 50 million announced a year ago.\n\n\n\nERNIE's daily API calls reach 1.5 billion by early November 2024\n\n\"The growth rate exceeded my expectations,\" said Robin Li, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, who described the steep increase as a reflection of the explosive growth in generative AI applications in China over the past two years.\n\n\n\nRobin Li, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, speaks at Baidu World 2024\n\nLooking ahead, Li emphasized that agents will serve as the predominant form of AI applications and are approaching a tipping point of explosive growth. Underscoring this point, Li introduced the Top 100 Agents and Top 100 Industry Applications on the ERNIE AgentBuilder platform.\n\nBaidu World 2024 also highlighted the latest user growth for ERNIE Bot, ERNIE's expanding role in enterprise applications, and featured the debut of Xiaodu AI Glasses by Xiaodu Technology.\n\nNew iRAG Technologyto Mitigate Hallucinations in Image Generation\n\nHallucinations, a phenomenon in which AI generates false or misleading information, have remained one of the most intractable barriers to the widespread adoption of generative AI. In text generation, RAG technology has largely resolved the problem of hallucinations, greatly enhancing the accuracy of generated answers. However, in the field of multimodality, hallucinations remain a key obstacle, often manifesting as inaccurate depictions of people or landmarks.\n\nBaidu's newly launched iRAG technology can mitigate hallucinations in text-to-image generation. Leveraging Baidu Search's vast collection of hundreds of millions of images and the company's strong foundation model capabilities, the new technology enables text-to-image models to deliver hyper-realistic visuals while also significantly reducing the cost of image production. The ability of the iRAG to reduce hallucinations boosts the applicability of images generated by text-to-image models across visual mediums, including comics, storyboards, posters, among others. Li described the reduction of hallucinations as laying the groundwork for the coming boom in AI applications.\n\nMiaoda: Building Applications with Natural Language\n\nBaidu also unveiled Miaoda, a no-code tool that makes it possible to build entire applications simply by describing them in natural language. Miaoda provides no-code programming, multi-agent collaboration, and multi-tool invocation. No-code programming allows anyone to generate code without writing a single line, lowering barriers to AI development and making it accessible to all. Its multi-agent collaboration leverages ERNIE's thinking and planning capabilities to coordinate and manage different agents effectively, while its multi-tool invocation taps into ERNIE's tool invocation abilities, extensively utilizing web search, iRAG, maps API, and other tools for a seamless workflow.\n\n\"Baidu isn't aiming to launch a 'super app'; instead, we aim to help more people and businesses create millions of 'super useful' applications,\" Li said.\n\nMirroring the real-world product development process, Miaoda draws on the abilities of different agents across multiple domains such as project management and planning, content editing, programming and quality control. Miaoda can even automatically identify bugs and use a range of tools. Li called it \"the most complex application case of multi-agent collaboration to date\".\n\nMiaoda empowers everyone with the capabilities of a programmer \u2013 anyone who can speak, can create applications, greatly enhancing human productivity.\n\nAgents as the Next Frontier in AI Application\n\n\"Today, while all leading global tech firms are paying attention to agents, few have made them as central to their strategy as Baidu has,\" Li said at the event. He likened the potential of agents to websites in the PC era and social media accounts in the mobile age.\n\n\"Agents are more human-like, more intelligent, and act like your sales, customer service representatives, or assistants. Agents will become a new vehicle for content, information and services,\" Li added.\n\nFour types of agents \u2013 company, character, tool, and industry \u2013 were highlighted at the event to demonstrate the potential of agents in the AI era. Company agents, for example, differ from traditional websites that only show static company and product information, and can instead proactively recommend products based on customer needs and respond promptly to service requests, greatly improving the efficiency of interactive marketing. After deploying an agent powered by ERNIE, automaker BYD saw a 119% increase in lead conversion.\n\nLi also offered the example of the tool agent Free Canvas, developed in collaboration between Baidu Wenku and Baidu Drive. It allows users to drag and drop documents, audio, video, and other materials onto a canvas-like interface to quickly generate multimodal content. Similarly, the industry agent Faxingbao was specifically developed for the legal field.

Global emissions from coal, oil and gas are all projected to increase.\n\nThe news comes as global leaders gather at the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan \u2014 talks which have been overshadowed by anxiety over what a new Trump administration will mean for global climate action. The urgency is clear, however, this year is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to be the hottest on record, and has seen back-to-back hurricanes, catastrophic flooding, devastating typhoons and severe drought.\n\n\u201cThe impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly dramatic, yet we still see no sign that burning of fossil fuels has peaked,\u201d said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter, who led the study, published Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of scientists.\n\nWhile fossil fuels make up the bulk of planet-heating pollution, the other main source is land-use change, including deforestation. Those emissions are also set to go up in 2024, according to the report, exacerbated by this year\u2019s severe droughts and fires.\n\nThere was some more positive news: emissions are set to decline in the US and Europe, and China\u2019s emissions are slowing, and could even see a decline this year, the research projected. But that progress is offset by increases in much of the rest of the world, including India.\n\nTotal global climate pollution will reach 41.6 billion metric tons this year, up from 40.6 billion metric tons last year, according to the report.\n\nThe increase may not seem huge, but it puts the world way off track for tackling the climate crisis.\n\nA UN report published in October said global carbon emissions were slowly plateauing and had raised the possibility they could fall this year.\n\nFossil fuel pollution needs to roughly halve over this decade to keep global warming lower than 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold countries have pledged to try to stay below in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nClimate change is already having catastrophic impacts. But scientists warn that at 1.5 degrees, it begins to exceed the ability of humans and the natural world to adapt \u2014 including potentially triggering devastating climate tipping points.\n\nHumanity has already lived through 12-month periods above this critical climate limit but scientists are more concerned about longer timeframes. Tuesday\u2019s study estimates that at current rates of emissions, there is a 50% chance the world will breach 1.5 degrees consistently in about six years.\n\nSome companies and governments have emphasized carbon removal as a key way to bring global temperatures down, but current technology is only removing around one-millionth of the carbon pollution produced by fossil fuels, the report found.\n\n\u201cTime is running out,\u201d Friedlingstein said, adding, \u201cworld leaders meeting at COP29 must bring about rapid and deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions.\u201d"
