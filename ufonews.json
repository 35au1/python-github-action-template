It was Pajama Day at school but 6-year-old Levi didn't have any PJs.\n\n\"As he saw that I was upset, he saw my head looking down, and when I got on the bus he asked me what was wrong,\" Levi said. \"When I looked up tears came out of my eyes.\"\n\nLevi's bus driver later surprised him at school with some brand new pajamas.\n\nPeople as far as England and Portugal reached out to JCPS after their photo went viral.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nYared Nuguse takes bronze medal with a furious rally in historic Olympic 1500m\n\nIn August, Louisville watched one of its own race in the Olympics.\n\nManual graduate Yared Nuguse won a bronze medal in the men's 1500 meter race in Paris.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a long time since the Olympics, and I've just been taking it in for what it is, and just really believing internally that I am an Olympic bronze medalist,\" Nuguse said.\n\nThe runner got his start in high school when a teacher noticed him sprinting to McDonald's. Several years later, he sprinted across the finish line at the summer Olympics.\n\n\"Honestly, it's been pretty normal,\" he said. \"I only just finished my running season this weekend, so a lot of it has been normal training and stuff. But I'll get recognized at the grocery store a lot more, or little things like that. People are like, 'Oh my God, it's Yared.' And I'll be like, 'Oh, hi. What's up?'\"\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville's littlest lunch lady | Kind 2-year-old makes meals for trashmen every week\n\nTrash day was more than that for a 2-year-old girl in south Louisville.

This is why it\u2019s been hard to get facts from any US Agency,\u201d DeLonge wrote on social media Saturday. \u201cSome of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nLocal, stat and federal authorities have thus far been mystified about the nature of the drones, with the White House saying Thursday that the objects do not appear to be of foreign origin, but their investigation.\n\nOver the past week alone, the drones \u2014 which are reportedly bigger than most recreational drones, according to some witnesses \u2014 have been seen by hundreds of Garden State denizens, with Governor Phil Murphy admitting that there were nearly 50 sightings alone last Sunday, NPR reports.\n\nThe situation reminded DeLonge, an expert on the subject of UFOs and UAPs, to similar mass sightings that happened in the 1960s \u2014 \u201cThere is a good chance that these things could potentially be \u2018mimicking\u2019 other aircraft,\u201d the guitarist said \u2014 and shared documents from 1965 about a military base that \u201cexperienced a considerable number of reports pertaining to unidentified flying objects.\u201d\n\nThen and now, the UFOs/drones flew in formation, had \u201cred and green flashing lights,\u201d and made \u201cno sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all something to consider, and although we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time,\u201d DeLonge speculated.\n\n\u201cWhy? To get us to notice them without a major freak out? Who knows\u2026 but well, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d"

            "article_content": "No chipmaker has benefited more from the rapid rise in artificial intelligence (AI) spending than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential for any company looking to develop and train large language models and build generative AI applications.\n\nNvidia flew past the $1 trillion milestone in May 2023. It's more than tripled since that point, becoming one of just three companies with a market capitalization above $3 trillion. But Nvidia isn't the only company that's seen its market capitalization soar as AI spending booms. In fact, AI advancements are virtually inseparable from the success of nearly every company valued at over a trillion dollars. The newest member, which both complements and competes with Nvidia, is no different.\n\nThe newest artificial intelligence chip stock in the $1 trillion club is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). The stock passed the milestone after a stellar fourth-quarter earnings report on Dec. 12. Here's how the company became a leading AI chipmaker worth 13 figures.\n\nA graphic of a computer chip in a circuit with the letters AI standing on it.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company making the next generation of AI chips\n\nBroadcom is a well-diversified business. It has an enterprise software segment, led by VMWare and Symantec. It also makes semiconductors for applications, including wireless phones, WiFi, and Bluetooth. But what's really driving the business are two specialized semiconductor applications: Its networking chips, and its AI accelerators.\n\nBroadcom's networking chips are essential infrastructure for AI data centers. While hyperscalers are paying billions for Nvidia's GPUs, they need Broadcom's chips to get the most out of their processing power. Broadcom's Tomahawk and Jericho switches ensure that data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another. That means there's less redundancy and downtime in processing. And when you're trying to make the most out of billions of dollars' worth of chips, every second counts.\n\nThere's no company that's even close to Broadcom's technology when it comes to developing these chips. Moreover, there's nobody in charge of a hyperscale data center who's going to risk their job by switching to a competitor's offering, no matter how much money it could save the business. So, as data centers grow the number of expensive GPUs and other chips in their server racks, Broadcom's business has grown exponentially.\n\nEven more promising is its custom AI accelerator business. These are the next generation of AI chips.\n\nBroadcom works with several companies to develop purpose-built AI chips for their data centers. Its three biggest customers are Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. Management estimates that these three companies will present an addressable market of between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027. Considering all three companies' potential gains from advancements in AI, the high end of that number seems more likely than the low end.\n\nManagement also announced that it signed deals with two new customers building their own next-generation chips. Broadcom won't disclose the details, but many believe those customers to be Apple and OpenAI.\n\nApple is familiar with Broadcom's work. It used Google's TPUs to train Apple Intelligence. Apple's big push to incorporate AI into its devices at a system level could lead it to become Broadcom's biggest customer in short order. That leaves tremendous upside in management's addressable market outlook, which doesn't include the new customers.\n\nIndeed, with its networking chips and AI accelerators, Broadcom looks well-positioned to benefit from the maturing development of artificial intelligence. Going forward, management plans to split its semiconductor reporting into AI and non-AI segments. The growth of the former will drive results for the entire business for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's not too late to buy\n\nDespite shares soaring more than 24% after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings, the outlook for the business remains strong enough to justify its current price.\n\nManagement's $60 billion to $90 billion addressable market outlook represents a compound annual growth rate for the AI semiconductor segment of greater than 60%. And with the upside of two potential new customers, the growth could be significantly higher by 2027.\n\nWhile AI semiconductors remain a small part of Broadcom's business today, they're the driving force behind its future. Even after tripling AI sales in 2024, management still expects AI chips to account for roughly one-quarter of the company's total revenue in the first quarter of 2025. But as AI chips become a bigger part of Broadcom's business and continue to grow at a rapid pace, the company's earnings growth should remain strong for a very long time. Analysts currently expect 28% earnings growth next year and 20% growth in 2026.\n\nAs a result, investors should be willing to pay a premium valuation today for a stock that's already growing earnings at a strong pace. Shares trade for about 36 times forward earnings as of this writing. That's definitely a premium price, and investors should consider the risks of investing at this price. Specifically, AI spending may not continue at the rampant pace it's seen in the last two years. But the stock traded at a similar valuation earlier in 2024, and management just showed why it was worth the price then. Investors looking for an alternative to Nvidia may want to consider Broadcom for their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "article_content": "Apps infused with AI are being marketed to schools across the world and governments are rushing to embrace the technology, despite experts raising serious doubts.\n\nThe sector known as Ed Tech exploded during the Covid pandemic as schools closed to stop the spread of infection and millions of children were forced to learn in front of screens at home.\n\nAs demand dried up after schools reopened, Ed Tech startups tried to win back investment by adding AI to their products and marketing.\n\nTech titans like Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI have also spied an opportunity, promoting their AI products to schools or partnering with startups.\n\nWhile many education ministries have announced plans to deploy AI apps, there are plenty of dissenting voices.\n\nThe UN's education body UNESCO last year eviscerated the record of online learning during Covid, saying the rapid rollout of tech solutions was a \"tragedy\" that had increased inequality and worsened learning outcomes.\n\nUNESCO's Manos Antoninis told AFP that AI might have some utility in education but right now it \"seems to be creating more problems than it is solving\".\n\nHe cited concerns that companies were using data for commercial purposes, deployed biased algorithms and overall were less concerned with educational outcomes than with their bottom line.\n\n\"I think the unfortunate thing is that education has been used as a bit of a Trojan horse to access future consumers,\" he said.\n\nDuring the pandemic boom in 2021, venture capitalists pumped more than $17 billion into Ed Tech. But that has slumped to $3 billion this year, about the same as last year, according to analysts PitchBook.\n\nBut from North Carolina to South Korea it is a different story, where education officials have been encouraging teachers to use generative AI.\n\nBritain has already rolled out a homework app called Sparx Maths that uses algorithms to tailor children's learning.\n\nIt recently announced a further multimillion-dollar outlay on AI programmes to \"ease the pressure\" on hard-working teachers by helping with lesson plans, marking and assessment.\n\nThe European Union supports several learning apps, and several EU countries have experimented with them.\n\nChina is a huge booster of AI in the classroom and has a national strategy for digitising education -- its centrepiece being a national education platform of tools and online courses.\n\nYet the on-the-ground reality is often messy.\n\nIndia boasted one of the liveliest startup scenes in the sector during the pandemic, including a firm called BYJU's which was once the world's most valuable Ed Tech startup.\n\nYet when schools in New Delhi were forced to close because of smog last month, there were no flashy apps to help.\n\n\"It is not feasible for them to take online classes,\" 29-year-old teacher Vandana Pandey told AFP, saying many of her pupils had no smartphones or connectivity at home.\n\nBYJU's has faced allegations of financial misconduct and only narrowly avoided bankruptcy in a recent court hearing.\n\nIn richer countries, the arrival of AI has received a tepid reception.\n\nOnly six percent of US secondary school teachers polled by Pew Research Center in May thought using AI in education would do more good than harm.\n\nFrance announced it would roll out an AI-powered homework app called MIA in secondary schools earlier this year, but quietly dropped the project as a political crisis rumbled on.\n\nMany British parents are also not keen on Sparx Maths."

In three words: deep learning worked.\"\n\nAI is still a highly contentious piece of tech for millions across the globe.\n\nMany fear it will soon become too powerful with humans potentially being over reliant on the system.\n\nOthers have concerns over how it may affect various industries and workplaces if robots or chatbots could replace humans.\n\nEthics, privacy and misinformation worries are also some of the most common objections to the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\n4 The AI voice is described as 'merry and bright' and closely follows the speech patterns used by Hollywood depictions of old Saint Nick"

Fossils of their faces and jaws revealed a mosaic of traits, some reminiscent of Neanderthals, combined with others unseen in Denisovans, Homo erectus, and even modern humans. These distinctions led Wu and Bae to propose the Juluren as a distinct form of ancient humans who coexisted with various hominins in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"What really sets the Juluren apart is their brain size, which surpasses that of other known hominins of the era, including early Homo sapiens,\" said Wu.\n\nThis characteristic, along with their diverse physical traits, underscores the complexity of human evolution, particularly in eastern Asia.\n\nFor decades, fossils from this region that didn't fit neatly into categories like Homo erectus or Homo sapiens were often grouped under the broad label of \"Denisovans.\" However, Wu and Bae\u2019s research now suggest that these human fossils represent a far more diverse evolutionary history of ancient human forms than previously assumed.\n\nExperts in the field have responded with intrigue. emphasizing how much still remains to be uncovered about the human story in Asia. He agreed that the name Juluren may help researchers better contextualize the fossils, offering a clearer picture of their place within the human family tree.\n\nThis discovery added to the growing complexity of our evolutionary history. Discoveries in recent decades have turned the human family tree into a tangled web of interrelated branches going in every direction."

            "article_content": "A small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning to reveal an 18-line Christian inscription in Latin dated to the third century.\n\nA 1,800-year-old silver amulet discovered in a burial in Germany is the oldest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers made the discovery by digitally unrolling a tiny scroll inside the amulet, which revealed an unusual Latin inscription. The finding may upend historians' understanding of how Christianity was practiced in the early Roman Empire .\n\nMeasuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters) long, the amulet contains a wafer-thin sheet of silver foil that's rolled up tightly. Archaeologists discovered it in the grave of a man who died between A.D. 230 and 270 and was buried in a cemetery on the outskirts of Frankfurt. The man likely wore the amulet on a cord around his neck, as it was found just below his chin.\n\nThe purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, \"was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces,\" Tine Rassalle , an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\"\n\nThe location of the artifact's discovery is rare, she added.\n\n\"These amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world,\" Rassalle said, but \"they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity's early centers of growth.\"\n\nRelated: 1,500-year-old Anglo-Saxon burial holds a 'unique' mystery \u2014 a Roman goblet once filled with pig fat\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAlthough the object was discovered in 2018, experts at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology (LEIZA) in Mainz spent several years conserving, restoring and analyzing it before announcing their findings in a statement Wednesday (Dec. 11).\n\n\"The challenge in the analysis was that the silver sheet was rolled, but after around 1800 years, it was of course also creased and pressed,\" Ivan Calandra , head of the imaging platform at LEIZA, said in the statement. \"Using CT , we were able to scan it at a very high resolution and create a 3D model.\"\n\nThe virtual 3D model enabled scientists to digitally unroll and analyze the inscription. The 18-line inscription was deciphered by Markus Scholz , a professor at the Goethe University Institute of Archaeological Sciences in Frankfurt. He said it's unusual that the writing is in Latin. \"Normally, such inscriptions on amulets were written in Greek or Hebrew,\" Scholz said in the statement.\n\nThe \"Frankfurt inscription\" reads as follows (the question marks signify areas of uncertainty):\n\n(In the name?) of Saint Titus. Holy, holy, holy! In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of God! The Lord of the world resists with [strengths?] all attacks(?)/setbacks(?). The God(?) grants entry to well-being. May this means of salvation(?) protect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses (Jesus Christ).\n\nIn the early days of the Roman Empire, practicing Christianity could be risky. The Roman emperor Nero persecuted Christians in the first century A.D.; some were crucified, and some were forced to fight in the Colosseum . This created an atmosphere of fear among early Christians, which forced them to practice in secret, in places like the catacombs in Rome. The fact that this man in third-century Germany was buried with his amulet meant his faith was very important to him, according to the researchers.\n\nA similar silver amulet was discovered in 2023 in Bulgaria. Dated to roughly the same time, the Bulgarian amulet was also found in a grave near the person's skull. The inscription mentioned the archangels Michael and Gabriel and referenced the \"guardian\" Christ. Experts studying the Bulgarian amulet suggested this language as well as the placement of the amulet in a grave stemmed from the need for early Christians to conceal and guard their faith.\n\nOther early metal amulets that have been found in the early Christian world often mix different faiths, including elements of Judaism and paganism alongside Christianity. According to the researchers, the Frankfurt amulet does not mention any other faith; it is purely Christian.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian god,\" Rassalle said, which is unusual because most amulets \"also appeal to angels, demons, or other supernatural entities.\"\n\nThe text of the Frankfurt amulet is therefore incredibly important for scholars of early Christianity, the researchers noted, particularly because it contains the earliest example of certain phrases, including \"Holy, holy, holy!\" \u2014 which is not known in Christianity until the fourth century \u2014 and an early quotation from Paul's Letter to the Philippians.\n\n\"This takes our understanding of Western Christianization and Christian monotheism to a whole new level!\" Rassalle said."

            "article_content": "Two breakthroughs in material science, both related to manipulating the arrangement of atoms in a material, were reported recently.\n\nThe first is the discovery of a new way of changing the phase of a material, from crystalline to amorphous, using an electrical pulse, which has the potential to revolutionise data storage in gadgets, mainly computer RAM. This new method consumes \u201ca billion times less electricity\u201d than the traditional melt-quench process, according to a paper published in Nature by researchers of IISc-Bengaluru, University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nElectronic storage devices use a type of glass called chalcogenide, which can change its phase from crystalline to amorphous (and back, when needed). In a solid, the atoms are in an ordered state. In an amorphous phase, the atoms are disordered, as in a liquid, but frozen into solid state \u2014 sort of a \u2018liquid in solid form\u2019. These two phases of a material are used to attribute the values \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for storing data. The phase change from crystalline to amorphous is achieved by highly localised application of laser pulses, which consumes a lot of electricity. The crystals must be heated beyond 800 degrees C and then rapidly cooled. If there is a way to convert crystal directly to glass without the intermediate liquid phase, then the power required for memory storage can be greatly reduced.\n\nA group of 12 researchers have demonstrated amorphisation of indium selenide using pulsed electric current. The localised electric pulse causes the weakly bonded layers of the material to slide over each other, like tectonic plates \u2014 and, like the plates, they too generate a shock wave, explains one of the researchers, Dr Pavan Nukala of the Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering, IISc, Bengaluru. The wave propagates through the material and causes amorphisation.\n\nThis new process has immediate application in microelectronics, but is really a breakthrough in material science as it shows a new way of thinking about amorphisation, he tells Quantum.\n\nDesired misfit\n\nThe second discovery \u2014 by a team led by Prof Kanishka Biswas, New Chemistry Unit, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru \u2014 has led to the synthesis of a new material with high potential for conversion of waste heat into electricity. The group researched into ferecrystals, a class of \u2018misfit layered compounds\u2019 (MLC) \u2014 so called because their atomic layers are misaligned, like an uneven stack of cards.\n\nMLCs have an interesting property \u2014 they do not allow the smooth conduction of heat and thereby block heat transfers. This ultra-low thermal conductivity creates a heat gradient across the material. According to the \u2018Seebeck effect\u2019, discovered in 1821, wherever there is a heat gradient, the material can also generate electricity.\n\nThe ferecrystal material shows a \u2018thermoelectric figure of merit\u2019 of 2.3, a high number that means the material can convert a lot of heat into electricity.\n\n\u201cThe material is already generating electricity in the lab. However, it needs to be scaled up for practical use,\u201d Biswas says.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

Image by OpenAI\n\nDec. 14 (UPI) -- OpenAI has launched Sora, a new video tool powered by artificial intelligence technology that has generated controversy in recent months. The Sora Turbo product, available since Monday, makes it much easier and faster for users to generate high-definition videos lasting up to 20 seconds. Advertisement\n\n\"We're introducing our video generation technology now to give society time to explore its possibilities and co-develop norms and safeguards that ensure it's used responsibly as the field advances,\" OpenAI said in an online announcement.\n\n\"We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories and push the boundaries of what's possible with video storytelling.\"\n\nUsers can use the A.I.-powered technology to incorporate existing digital information and extend, remix, blend or generate new content from text.\n\nA storyboard tool enables users to control the outcomes for every frame while adding text, images or video, and two community feeds provide new and continually updated content.\n\nOpenAI said it is blocking content that is illegal or otherwise highly controversial, such as child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes.\n\nStill, the app has faced criticism long before it was released to the public with some experts alarmed about how A.I.-generated video could be used and others concerned with legal issues regarding things like copyright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty artists who had early access to the Sora app in November opposed the Sora app in an open letter to OpenAI and accused the tech firm of using artists as a way to make the app appear more accepted among the global artist community.\n\n\"Artists are not your unpaid R&D,\" they said. \"We are not your free bug-testers, PR puppets, training data, validation tokens.\"\n\nThe artists addressed the open letter to \"A.I. corporate overlords\" and included a leaked code for Sora. Just weeks later, the company rolled out the product to the masses, possibly influenced by that leak.\n\n\"We are being lured into art-washing to tell the world that Sora is a useful tool for artists,\" the artists had said.\n\nOpenAI in February announced the roll-out of the text-to-video Sora app as a follow-up to its ChatGPT chatbot tool for generating textual content.\n\nSora said artists would be part of its development team for the Sora app that is intended to compete with Meta's Make-a-Video tool, which was previewed by Facebook's parent in a 2022 white paper but has seemingly not been released to the public.\n\nAt the time, UPI reported that the success of Meta's model would be likely to spur an increase in investments by other companies into videos generated by A.I.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI in March also rolled out its A.I. tool called Voice Engine, which can clone someone's voice after hearing several seconds of audio. The company has said Voice Engine can help people who have lost their voices and be used in other beneficial ways."

            "article_content": "Los Angeles Chargers have proven that they shouldn't be slept on when it comes to AFC opponents, but they will be put to the test once again in a Week 15 matchup against the NFC's Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nPhoto By - Imagn Images. Pictured: Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert makes a throw against the Falcons.\n\nAfter three straight wins, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are in pole position in the NFC South, but we\u2019ll get a better sense of their playoff credentials on Sunday as they visit the well-drilled Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\n\nA friendly schedule has masked some erratic Tampa Bay performances over the past month, so my Buccaneers vs. Chargers predictions point to L.A. edging this one and all but clinching a wild-card spot.\n\n\n\nTake a closer look at today's marquee matchup with my NFL picks and betting tips for this 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff on FOX.\n\nBuccaneers vs Chargers prediction\n\nWho will win Buccaneers vs Chargers?\n\nBoth these teams are on course for the playoffs, but I\u2019m putting more faith in what we\u2019ve seen from the Chargers against elite AFC opposition.\n\n\n\nThey were inches away from toppling the Kansas City Chiefs last time out, and their defense provides a well-rounded threat to keep Baker Mayfield off balance.\n\n\n\nPrediction: Buccaneers 16, Chargers 22\n\nMy best bet\n\nChargers -3 (-105 at BetMGM)\n\nMy analysis\n\nIt\u2019s rarely been pretty, but this is the new Los Angeles Chargers. The days of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory are over with Jim Harbaugh at the helm, and this is the type of gritty, no-nonsense team that no one should want to face in the postseason.\n\n\n\nThis Week 15 showdown is shaping up to be another tight battle, but I\u2019m sticking with the Chargers as slight favorites. They\u2019re 9-4 ATS this season, while covering six of their last seven games.\n\n\n\nThe one big vulnerability on either team is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 pass defense. The visitors are leaking 253.4 yards per game, third most in the league, and that could tilt the third down tussle in L.A.\u2019s favor, with Justin Herbert throwing 335 passes since his last interception.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Chargers have held 11 of their 13 opponents to 20 points or fewer, and they\u2019re allowing the fewest points per game in the NFL this season (15.9).\n\n\n\nThat L.A. strength will be tested here against Mike Evans and a talented Buccaneers run game, but I\u2019m wagering on the hosts to cover this small spread. After all, each of their eight wins this year have come by at least four points.\n\nBuccaneers vs Chargers same-game parlay\n\nChargers -3\n\n\n\nJustin Herbert Over 20.5 completions\n\n\n\nRachaad White anytime touchdown +700 at BetMGM\n\nL.A. has greatly reduced the burden on Justin Herbert to conjure up plays in the passing game this year, but this matchup calls for a larger dose of the aerial attack.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay arrives with a decimated secondary, and Ladd McConkey\u2019s expected return is timely for the hosts. I see the Chargers dialing up more chances for Herbert to drop back, and he\u2019s reached 21 completions in two of his last three outings.\n\n\n\nThe Buccaneers\u2019 backfield committee continues to impress, and it was Rachaad White who stepped up last weekend after Bucky Irving left the game with back and hip issues.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s every chance that Irving is on a more limited snap count if he\u2019s cleared to play on Sunday, so White looks like a high-value anytime touchdown pick. He\u2019s found the end zone eight times in his past seven outings.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nNew Users\n\nUp to $1,500 in bonus bet insurance at BetMGM Make your football plays at BetMGM, which is offering new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets (if your first bet doesn't win)!

            "article_content": "A small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning to reveal an 18-line Christian inscription in Latin dated to the third century.\n\nA 1,800-year-old silver amulet discovered in a burial in Germany is the oldest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers made the discovery by digitally unrolling a tiny scroll inside the amulet, which revealed an unusual Latin inscription. The finding may upend historians' understanding of how Christianity was practiced in the early Roman Empire .\n\nMeasuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters) long, the amulet contains a wafer-thin sheet of silver foil that's rolled up tightly. Archaeologists discovered it in the grave of a man who died between A.D. 230 and 270 and was buried in a cemetery on the outskirts of Frankfurt. The man likely wore the amulet on a cord around his neck, as it was found just below his chin.\n\nThe purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, \"was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces,\" Tine Rassalle , an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\"\n\nThe location of the artifact's discovery is rare, she added.\n\n\"These amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world,\" Rassalle said, but \"they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity's early centers of growth.\"\n\nRelated: 1,500-year-old Anglo-Saxon burial holds a 'unique' mystery \u2014 a Roman goblet once filled with pig fat\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The 18-line inscription was deciphered by Markus Scholz , a professor at the Goethe University Institute of Archaeological Sciences in Frankfurt. He said it's unusual that the writing is in Latin. \"Normally, such inscriptions on amulets were written in Greek or Hebrew,\" Scholz said in the statement.\n\nThe \"Frankfurt inscription\" reads as follows (the question marks signify areas of uncertainty):\n\n(In the name?) of Saint Titus. Holy, holy, holy! In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of God! The Lord of the world resists with [strengths?] all attacks(?)/setbacks(?). The God(?) grants entry to well-being. May this means of salvation(?) protect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses (Jesus Christ).\n\nIn the early days of the Roman Empire, practicing Christianity could be risky. The Roman emperor Nero persecuted Christians in the first century A.D.; some were crucified, and some were forced to fight in the Colosseum . This created an atmosphere of fear among early Christians, which forced them to practice in secret, in places like the catacombs in Rome. The fact that this man in third-century Germany was buried with his amulet meant his faith was very important to him, according to the researchers.\n\nA similar silver amulet was discovered in 2023 in Bulgaria. Dated to roughly the same time, the Bulgarian amulet was also found in a grave near the person's skull. The inscription mentioned the archangels Michael and Gabriel and referenced the \"guardian\" Christ. Experts studying the Bulgarian amulet suggested this language as well as the placement of the amulet in a grave stemmed from the need for early Christians to conceal and guard their faith.\n\nOther early metal amulets that have been found in the early Christian world often mix different faiths, including elements of Judaism and paganism alongside Christianity. According to the researchers, the Frankfurt amulet does not mention any other faith; it is purely Christian.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian god,\" Rassalle said, which is unusual because most amulets \"also appeal to angels, demons, or other supernatural entities.\"\n\nThe text of the Frankfurt amulet is therefore incredibly important for scholars of early Christianity, the researchers noted, particularly because it contains the earliest example of certain phrases, including \"Holy, holy, holy!\" \u2014 which is not known in Christianity until the fourth century \u2014 and an early quotation from Paul's Letter to the Philippians.\n\n\"This takes our understanding of Western Christianization and Christian monotheism to a whole new level!\" Rassalle said."

            "article_content": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Scientists have introduced what they believe may be a new ancient human species.\n\nThe Juluren, or \"large head people,\" are believed to have lived in eastern Asia over 100,000 years ago.\n\nsuggesting that the Juluren, formally named Homo juluensis, possessed significantly large brains and unique traits that could dramatically alter our understanding of human evolution.\n\nThe Juluren exhibit has features unlike any other hominins previously identified. Fossils of their faces and jaws revealed a mosaic of traits, some reminiscent of Neanderthals, combined with others unseen in Denisovans, Homo erectus, and even modern humans. These distinctions led Wu and Bae to propose the Juluren as a distinct form of ancient humans who coexisted with various hominins in Asia between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\n\"What really sets the Juluren apart is their brain size, which surpasses that of other known hominins of the era, including early Homo sapiens,\" said Wu.\n\nThis characteristic, along with their diverse physical traits, underscores the complexity of human evolution, particularly in eastern Asia.\n\nFor decades, fossils from this region that didn't fit neatly into categories like Homo erectus or Homo sapiens were often grouped under the broad label of \"Denisovans.\" However, Wu and Bae\u2019s research now suggest that these human fossils represent a far more diverse evolutionary history of ancient human forms than previously assumed.\n\nExperts in the field have responded with intrigue. emphasizing how much still remains to be uncovered about the human story in Asia. He agreed that the name Juluren may help researchers better contextualize the fossils, offering a clearer picture of their place within the human family tree.\n\nThis discovery added to the growing complexity of our evolutionary history. Discoveries in recent decades have turned the human family tree into a tangled web of interrelated branches going in every direction."

Your ears, too, in the case of the Origin PC Eon17-X v2. This formidable gaming machine costs a fortune and demands headphones, thanks to its very loud (though very capable) fans that start blasting air over its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU even before your favorite game's introductory cutscene gets a chance to load.\n\nAt more than $3,500 after a substantial discount, the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 is one of the more expensive gaming laptops we've tested recently, but it's not the fastest. The Alienware M18 R2 still holds that title, but the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 still offers plenty of 3D muscle -- and it has the better display of the two in the form of a 4K, 144Hz panel.\n\nIf you build the Origin PC Eon17-X v2 to the exact specs of the Alienware M18 R2 we tested, it costs about $250 more, which is a reasonable sum for the superior display. Alienware's 18-inch monster is still the one to beat in terms of raw performance, but the Origin's 4K display is super sharp and saturated, and the laptop can easily dish out triple-digit frame rates for today's demanding titles at their highest quality settings.\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 Price as reviewed $3,568 Display size/resolution 17.3-inch 3,840x2,160 144Hz IPS LCD CPU Intel Core i9-14900HX Memory 64GB LPDDR5-4800 Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Storage Two, 2TB SSD Ports Thunderbolt 5 (x2), USB-C 3.2 Gen1, USB-A 3.2 Gen1 (x2), HDMI 2.1, Mini DisplayPort 1.4, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, combo audio Networking Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 Operating system Windows 11 Home 24H2 Weight 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg)\n\nConfiguration options are plentiful\n\nSince Origin is a boutique PC builder, its laptops are customizable, and it gives you a good amount of leeway to adjust your system to your exact needs and budget -- and you can really push the limit for the latter. The Eon17-X v2 laptop we reviewed costs an eye-opening $3,568, and that's after Origin's $700 discount. But the system builder doesn't slouch on parts; you're getting some of the best components you can stuff into a 17-inch gaming behemoth.\n\nOur laptop came with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, which has a whopping 24 cores and 32 threads and runs at 2.2GHz by default (with its turbo clock boost maxing out at 5.8GHz). The CPU is paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, which ensures that even opening a web browser has a decent chance of making the laptop sound like a passenger jet at takeoff.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOur test system also included a near-overkill 64GB of DDR5-4800 memory and 4 terabytes of storage (split across two 2TB SSDs). That's the most memory offered, but far from the most storage, with 4TB and 8TB drives also available and three total M.2 slots.\n\nYou can choose from one of two 17.3-inch displays: a 2,560x1,440-pixel panel with a 240Hz refresh rate or a 3,840x2,160, 144Hz screen. The former locks you into an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, whereas the latter is the only option for the faster RTX 4090 GPU. We received the latter. It's a better setup, but it'll cost you an extra $523 from the laptop's base configuration.\n\nOrigin also offers custom UV prints for the top of the laptop, a $30 upgrade that's nice to have if one of the 19 designs really catches your eye. You can also send in your own custom art to print, but that's a $140 charge. This level of customization isn't offered by a more conventional manufacturer like Dell, but I'd recommend going with a lighter print than a darker one. The Starfield print on the laptop I reviewed looked quite a bit murkier in person compared with the bright, beautiful image on Origin's site.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nOrigin PC Eon17-X v2 performance\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 is a beast in size and performance. Across the board, it delivered scores and frame rates on our benchmarks that were competitive with the highest-performing laptops we've tested, the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16, each of which features the same CPU/GPU duo in the Core i9-14900HX and RTX 4090.\n\nOn Geekbench 6, the Eon17-X v2 put out single- and multicore scores that were in line with those of the Alienware M18 R2 and Razer Blade 16. It had the fastest single-core score of the three, and its multicore score was 4% slower than the Alienware M18 R2's. It fell back a bit on our Cinebench 2024 tests, especially on the multicore CPU test, where it was 33% slower than the Alienware M18 R2.\n\nThe Eon17-X v2 performed well on our 3D graphics and gaming tests, but it still trailed the Alienware and Razer. I checked to make sure thermal throttling wasn't to blame for the Origin's consistent third-place finishes of this trio since all three laptops share the same CPU and GPU configuration. When I repeated our Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark back to back to back, the average temperature of the laptop's CPU and GPU was under 80 degrees Celsius the entire time, which I expected given how much fan noise the laptop puts out. That's a great reading, since you may start to experience performance drops as you inch closer to triple-digits.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nBig, bulky and beautiful\n\nThe Origin Eon17-X v2 is not the laptop to buy for your daily commute, both due to its weight (7.5 pounds) and the fact that you'll enrage everyone on your train or subway with its noise once you fire up a game. It's a great desk companion that feels incredibly sturdy and solid to use, and its 17.3-inch display is big enough to make your games feel immersive and fun.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe huge footprint, including a near-1-inch thickness, provides plenty of room for both a regular keyboard and numpad. While they're centered on the laptop's palm rest, the laptop's gigantic touchpad (at 6 inches wide by just over 3.5 inches tall) is centered below the regular keyboard. This feels slightly awkward, as your left hand is a bit cramped for space when you rest it on the lower-left side of the laptop's palm rest, whereas your right has plenty of room. And this design puts your hands slightly off-center from the screen, which feels a little wonky.\n\nThe keys themselves are incredibly comfortable to type on, with great travel (and resistance) for everything from casual gaming to first-person shooters. They light up, too, but you have to use Origin's Control Center app to manage your look; you can't adjust the colors using Function key shortcuts, including their brightness. It's a bit annoying to have to launch an app when you want to make modifications on the fly, and while the app lets you change the backlight color of any individual key or pick from one of nine preset effects that apply to all your keys at once, it's not as comprehensive as what you might get with most gaming keyboards.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nParent company Corsair and its iCUE software allows for a lot more creativity, but that doesn't work on Origin's laptop. With Origin's Control Center, you can't, for example, create your own effects or patterns, set up reactive lighting for games, or import color profiles.\n\nThe laptop's touchpad, though huge, is much more responsive toward its bottom than its top. You really have to push to register a click within an inch of the touchpad's top, which is annoying but not uncommon on a mechanical touchpad. I dislike that the laptop's arrow keys -- typically critical for gaming -- bleed right into its numpad. It's an awkward design to have the right arrow sit directly below the laptop's 1 key, and I question the usefulness of the numpad, in general, on a gaming laptop.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nI was slightly concerned that the laptop's vents, located on the upper half of its left and right sides, would cause some unpleasant hand-warming during game sessions. My fears were unfounded; the laptop's loud cooling system is nothing if not effective. Fan noise may be ever-present and thunderous, but I had no issues gaming on a couch. It's much more comfortable, however, to plop the heavy laptop on a desk than on your lap.\n\nMinor shortcomings aside, the Eon17-X v2 is built like a tank. Its downward-facing speakers, which sit on the laptop's bottom (closest to your lap), sound decent, with bass ever-so-slightly better than the meh quality most laptops dish out. They give you a pleasant, enveloping sound when you're checking out an errant TikTok or YouTube video, but there's absolutely no way you're going to use these for gaming. You're going to need to budget for a headset, possibly even noise-canceling, with this beast.\n\nMassive 17-inch 4K display\n\nThe 17.3-inch display isn't an OLED, which is a letdown, given the laptop's price and noteworthy specs, but having a huge, gorgeous 4K display is nothing to be sad about. The display -- presumably IPS, though Origin doesn't detail this anywhere -- supports both the DCI-P3 and regular sRGB color spaces. Though folks who prefer color accuracy above all else might not care for the overly saturated look of DCI-P3, it makes games, movies and pictures absolutely pop. Unfortunately, the display doesn't support HDR, so you don't get those superrich scenes and dark-as-night black levels you might otherwise find on your living-room TV.\n\nThe laptop's white levels hit 30 nits at its lowest brightness setting and an impressive 556 nits at its highest. You should have few, if any, issues seeing the screen in daylight, even if you're unlikely to commute with it because of its heft. The minimum luminance is right in the sweet spot: not too dim to look bad but not too bright to cause annoyance to those who are particularly sensitive when staring at screens all day long.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nThe laptop's 4K resolution is a great fit for its humongous screen, making everything look sharp and crisp. I had as much fun (as one possibly can) mucking around in spreadsheets and Google Docs as I did gaming on the Eon17-X v2, and I would absolutely use this laptop as my daily driver -- just at my desk, not carried around my house.\n\nTo that point, it's also great that the laptop, big as it is, comes with a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity (supporting 160Hz-wide wireless channels for those of you living far away from any neighbors). I don't foresee moving it around very much, so it's great that you can hardwire yourself into blazing speeds on your home network, especially if you're rocking a higher-than-gigabit setup. The rest of the laptop's ports cover all the bases, from USB-A and USB-C to HDMI and DisplayPort -- no issues there. The most noteworthy inclusion among the ports are the two USB-C ports that offer the latest Thunderbolt 5 connectivity.\n\nDavid Murphy/CNET\n\nIs the Origin Eon17-X v2 gaming laptop worth it?\n\nMy only qualm with the Eon17-X v2 is that it's very expensive for the performance it delivers. If you build Alienware's M18 R2 with the same specs as this Origin laptop, you're already saving around $250 (limited-time discounts notwithstanding) for a system that's a step faster for gaming by a not-so-insignificant amount (though it lacks a 4K screen). Match an Eon17-X v2 configuration to the M18 R2 that we reviewed, and it's the same deal: Origin's system costs around $250 more, but you get a much better, if slightly smaller, display.\n\nIf all you care about are frame rates, Alienware's M18 R2 remains the gaming laptop to beat. But for an overall experience, especially when you can find it on sale, Origin's Eon17-X v2 wins out for its superior display and slightly better customizability when you're building the laptop to begin with. Resist the urge to configure more laptop than you really need, and it's worth the extra cost you'll pay for everyday use.\n\nHide our expert take Photo Gallery 1/1 How we test computers Photo Gallery 1/1 The review process for laptops, desktops, tablets and other computerlike devices consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our expert reviewers.

            "article_content": "To capitalise on this potential, companies should assess their current technology stack and identify B2B functionality gaps\n\nIndia's online B2B marketplaces have the potential to reach $200 Bn by 2030\n\nIndian businesses seeking growth beyond traditional methods are increasingly adopting B2B marketplace models. This approach offers expansion opportunities without the risks associated with conventional strategies. For executives and technology leaders aiming to implement or refine a B2B marketplace, grasping the nuances of this model is paramount.\n\nIndia\u2019s online B2B marketplaces have the potential to reach $200 Bn by 2030, based on the latest projections from the Economic Diplomacy Division of IndBiz. This growth stems from key technological advancements reshaping B2B interactions. As India progresses with its Digital India initiative, B2B marketplaces will play an increasingly significant role in the country\u2019s digital economy.\n\nTechnological Foundations For B2B Marketplaces\n\nAPI-first architecture stands at the forefront, enabling seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. This approach creates a unified ecosystem where data moves effortlessly between the marketplace, ERP systems, CRMs, and other mission-critical software.\n\nMicroservices architecture complements this shift, allowing businesses to adapt swiftly to market changes and scale functionalities independently.\n\nAdvanced marketplaces often rely on cloud-native solutions to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and reliability. This is particularly relevant for B2B platforms handling high transaction volumes and intricate business logic. Cloud infrastructure facilitates the implementation of AI and machine learning technologies, which are increasingly applied to predictive analytics in inventory management, product recommendations, and fraud detection.\n\nEmerging trends such as blockchain integration for supply chain transparency, IoT devices for real-time inventory tracking, and voice-activated ordering systems for hands-free procurement are set to further advance the B2B landscape.\n\nKey Features Driving B2B Excellence\n\nModern B2B marketplaces require sophisticated features to meet complex buyer and seller needs. A multi-tier pricing engine is indispensable, accommodating customer-specific pricing, volume-based discounts, and market-driven dynamic pricing. This pricing flexibility allows businesses to remain competitive while maintaining profitability.\n\nConfigurable approval workflows are equally significant. B2B transactions often involve multiple stakeholders and intricate approval processes. Implementing role-based access control with customisable approval chains allows marketplaces to align with clients\u2019 organisational structures, streamlining operations and reducing purchase friction.\n\nThe efficacy of a B2B marketplace hinges on its ability to help buyers locate products efficiently. This necessitates an advanced search and filtering system with faceted search capabilities, custom attributes, and technical specification filters.\n\nIn the B2B sector, where purchases are often highly specific and technical, the ability to pinpoint exact product specifications significantly impacts user satisfaction and conversion rates.\n\nA comprehensive quote management system is another critical feature. The capability to handle requests for quotes (RFQs) with integrated negotiation tools and CRM system connectivity can significantly improve the sales process. This is particularly relevant in industries with complex, customised products or services where standard pricing may not apply.\n\nReal-time inventory visibility across multiple warehouses or suppliers is indispensable. In B2B transactions, where large orders and just-in-time delivery are common, accurate inventory information is critical. Advanced systems should support backorder and pre-order management, providing businesses with the flexibility to meet varied customer requirements.\n\nBest Practices And Considerations\n\nImplementing these advanced features requires adherence to proven best practices. Data migration and cleansing is a critical process often underestimated in its complexity. A comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is necessary to ensure consistent data across the marketplace, particularly when consolidating information from multiple legacy systems or integrating various supplier databases.\n\nPerformance optimisation significantly impacts success. Employing caching strategies, content delivery networks (CDNs), and lazy loading techniques ensures swift page loads, even for extensive product catalogues.\n\nIn B2B transactions, where buyers often review detailed technical specifications, performance directly influences user satisfaction and sales outcomes.\n\nThe increasing trend of mobile usage in B2B transactions, particularly in the Indian market, cannot be overlooked. A mobile-first approach using responsive design and progressive enhancement techniques is necessary to cater to B2B buyers who prefer mobile transactions.\n\nLocalisation is a critical consideration, especially in India\u2019s diverse market. Supporting multiple languages and currencies is fundamental. Adherence to regional tax regulations, such as India\u2019s GST system, is crucial for compliance and building user trust.\n\nB2B marketplaces require stringent security measures due to high-value transactions and sensitive data. Multi-factor authentication, SSL encryption, and regular security audits should be standard. In an era of increasing cyber threats, demonstrating a strong commitment to security can be a significant differentiator in the B2B space.\n\nReal-World Applications And Future Outlook\n\nB2B marketplace implementations have yielded impressive results across various industries. In the food distribution sector, companies have successfully digitalised their B2B operations by developing specialised platforms for different customer segments.\n\nBy implementing flexible pricing systems and integrating with existing ERPs, these businesses have achieved round-the-clock order placement capabilities, reduced operational costs, and expanded their customer bases.\n\nIn the wholesale distribution space, companies have optimised operations by creating self-service portals with custom catalogues and pricing. Automating quote-to-order processes and implementing advanced analytics for personalised product recommendations has led to significant reductions in order processing times and increases in average order values.\n\nA prime example of the transformative power of B2B marketplaces comes from one of our customers, a food distribution company in Europe. They have highlighted two major benefits of shifting to B2B online ordering:\n\nReduced Cost Per Order : B2B businesses are encouraged to calculate their cost per order, factoring in all necessary expenses such as agents, devices, petrol, and consumables. They proudly report that they have decreased their cost per order by over 50% through the implementation of their B2B marketplace. Impact On Average Order Value (AOV) And Product Quantity : A positive outcome identified is that customers, when presented with a digital catalog, are discovering and ordering from more product categories compared to traditional ordering methods. This contrasts with the tendency of sales agents to focus on replenishing products that customers typically buy.\n\nFurthermore, owning the digital customer relationship has emerged as a key factor in the B2B marketplace model. The customer data gathered through these platforms is an invaluable asset. For instance, owning a network of 50,000 restaurant customers can drive significant GMV growth in a marketplace model as the category offer expands.\n\nThis is because customers tend to consolidate their ordering processes, preferring to use a single platform for multiple product categories.\n\nThe B2B marketplace model presents a significant opportunity for Indian businesses to overcome growth constraints and expand their reach. To capitalise on this potential, companies should assess their current technology stack and identify B2B functionality gaps. Selecting technology partners with proven expertise in B2B marketplace development is crucial for successful implementation.\n\nA phased implementation plan, beginning with core B2B features and gradually expanding, can help manage the transition\u2019s complexity. Investing in staff training and change management is crucial to ensure smooth adoption of the new B2B platform. Ongoing feedback collection from B2B buyers and sellers should inform continuous improvements to the marketplace.\n\nThe advanced B2B marketplace model represents a transformative opportunity for Indian businesses. By embracing these sophisticated digital platforms, companies can position themselves at the forefront of India\u2019s digital commerce sector, driving growth, efficiency, and innovation in the B2B arena.\n\nThe current moment presents an opportune time to act \u2013 businesses that swiftly adopt and optimise B2B marketplace strategies will be well-positioned to thrive in tomorrow\u2019s digital economy, leveraging reduced costs per order, increased AOV, and the invaluable asset of customer data ownership."

I actually can't believe it,\" she said in the video. \"Apparently, the first two letters on your number plate - so, like, my old car was MV - mean that car was registered in Manchester.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"They all have different codes, so it goes from MA to M- whatever, and that's all from Manchester.\"\n\nCourtney went on to explain: \"The first two letters actually mean something. You've got where the car was registered, the year it was registered, and then just a random sequence. I'm literally mind blown.\"\n\nHer video has since sparked a flurry of comments, with other people either sharing her amazement or confessing they had no idea about the system themselves.\n\nOne user wrote: \"How did I not know this? Mind blown too,\" while another joked: \"I've been driving for years, and this just made me feel like I missed an entire class on life.\"\n\nWhat do UK number plates actually mean?\n\nIf you've ever wondered about the seemingly random assortment of characters on UK number plates, Jon Kirkbright, the sales director of Private Number Plates, broke it down.\n\nAdvert\n\nCourtney shared her discover with TikTok (TikTok/@courtneywrightxxx)\n\nSpeaking to Diamond Advanced Motorists last year, Jon said: \"To the untrained eye, number plates may look like a random combination of letters and numbers.\n\n\"While many people are aware that the numbers indicate the year the car was made and registered, fewer people realise that the letters better them serve as 'regional identifiers.' These refer to the DVLA office where the car was registered.\"\n\nFor instance, plates beginning with MV, MA, or MB originate from the Manchester and Merseyside region, LA, LB, LV, etc., are assigned to London and BA, BB and BC indicate registration in Birmingham.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"This may be why your number plates start with the same letters if you buy more than one car from the same dealership - it's not just a coincidence,\" Jon added.\n\nWhat are the rules around private plates?\n\nFor those with private plates, the rules are a little stricter. Jon highlighted that while it's legal to make a car seem older using a dateless plate, it's illegal to make it look newer.\n\nEach car's number plate are assigned to where the car was registered (Getty stock image)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"For example, you cannot put an '11' number plate on a car registered in 2007,\" he said. \"It is an offence to misrepresent the registration in any way.\"\n\nThose wanting to hide the age of their car often opt for dateless plates, which allow for complete customisation while avoiding this issue.\n\nIf you're curious about your own car's registration, you can find a full list of regional number plate identifiers online - and join the ranks of those whose minds have been well and truly blown by the hidden meaning behind UK plates."

            "article_content": "A small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning to reveal an 18-line Christian inscription in Latin dated to the third century.\n\nA 1,800-year-old silver amulet discovered in a burial in Germany is the oldest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers made the discovery by digitally unrolling a tiny scroll inside the amulet, which revealed an unusual Latin inscription. The finding may upend historians' understanding of how Christianity was practiced in the early Roman Empire .\n\nMeasuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimeters) long, the amulet contains a wafer-thin sheet of silver foil that's rolled up tightly. Archaeologists discovered it in the grave of a man who died between A.D. 230 and 270 and was buried in a cemetery on the outskirts of Frankfurt. The man likely wore the amulet on a cord around his neck, as it was found just below his chin.\n\nThe purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, \"was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces,\" Tine Rassalle , an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\"\n\nThe location of the artifact's discovery is rare, she added.\n\n\"These amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world,\" Rassalle said, but \"they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity's early centers of growth.\"\n\nRelated: 1,500-year-old Anglo-Saxon burial holds a 'unique' mystery \u2014 a Roman goblet once filled with pig fat\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAlthough the object was discovered in 2018, experts at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology (LEIZA) in Mainz spent several years conserving, restoring and analyzing it before announcing their findings in a statement Wednesday (Dec. 11).\n\n\"The challenge in the analysis was that the silver sheet was rolled, but after around 1800 years, it was of course also creased and pressed,\" Ivan Calandra , head of the imaging platform at LEIZA, said in the statement. \"Using CT , we were able to scan it at a very high resolution and create a 3D model.\"\n\nThe virtual 3D model enabled scientists to digitally unroll and analyze the inscription. The 18-line inscription was deciphered by Markus Scholz , a professor at the Goethe University Institute of Archaeological Sciences in Frankfurt. He said it's unusual that the writing is in Latin. \"Normally, such inscriptions on amulets were written in Greek or Hebrew,\" Scholz said in the statement.\n\nThe \"Frankfurt inscription\" reads as follows (the question marks signify areas of uncertainty):\n\n(In the name?) of Saint Titus. Holy, holy, holy! In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of God! The Lord of the world resists with [strengths?] all attacks(?)/setbacks(?). The God(?) grants entry to well-being. May this means of salvation(?) protect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses (Jesus Christ).\n\nIn the early days of the Roman Empire, practicing Christianity could be risky. The Roman emperor Nero persecuted Christians in the first century A.D.; some were crucified, and some were forced to fight in the Colosseum . This created an atmosphere of fear among early Christians, which forced them to practice in secret, in places like the catacombs in Rome. The fact that this man in third-century Germany was buried with his amulet meant his faith was very important to him, according to the researchers.\n\nA similar silver amulet was discovered in 2023 in Bulgaria. Dated to roughly the same time, the Bulgarian amulet was also found in a grave near the person's skull. The inscription mentioned the archangels Michael and Gabriel and referenced the \"guardian\" Christ. Experts studying the Bulgarian amulet suggested this language as well as the placement of the amulet in a grave stemmed from the need for early Christians to conceal and guard their faith.\n\nOther early metal amulets that have been found in the early Christian world often mix different faiths, including elements of Judaism and paganism alongside Christianity. According to the researchers, the Frankfurt amulet does not mention any other faith; it is purely Christian.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian god,\" Rassalle said, which is unusual because most amulets \"also appeal to angels, demons, or other supernatural entities.\"\n\nThe text of the Frankfurt amulet is therefore incredibly important for scholars of early Christianity, the researchers noted, particularly because it contains the earliest example of certain phrases, including \"Holy, holy, holy!\" \u2014 which is not known in Christianity until the fourth century \u2014 and an early quotation from Paul's Letter to the Philippians.\n\n\"This takes our understanding of Western Christianization and Christian monotheism to a whole new level!\" Rassalle said."

            "article_content": "A team of researchers from Switzerland and France and theoretical physicists in Canada and the U.S., including Rice University, believe they have found evidence of a theorized quantum phenomenon called quantum spin liquid. Observed in a material called pyrochlore cerium stannate, this discovery could yield discoveries in fundamental physics and open doors to breakthroughs in other things like quantum computers.\n\nQuantum spin liquid, in case you are unaware, is a theoretical special state of matter where tiny magnetic particles don't settle in a fixed pattern. It is believed this can even occur at the coldest temperatures possible.\n\nAccording to the theory, these spins can stay in constantly changing, interconnected states that behave oddly, similar to those in quantum mechanics. This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThe neutron scattering experiment was performed on a highly specialized spectrometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France, allowing us to obtain extremely high-resolution data,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNeutron scattering is a well-established tool in analyzing the behavior of spins in magnets,\u201d added Andriy Nevidomskyy, associate professor of physics and astronomy at Rice, who conducted a theoretical analysis of the acquired data. \u201cIt is challenging, however, to develop an unambiguous \u2018smoking gun\u2019 signature that would prove the material harbors a quantum spin liquid,\" he added.\n\nIn our current understanding of quantum mechanics, electrons possess a property known as spin. This means that they behave in a manner akin to tiny bar magnets.\n\nWhen electrons interact, their \"spins\" align or anti-align (align in the opposite direction). However, this alignment/anti-alignment can be disrupted in some materials, like pyrochlores.\n\nThis is called \u201cmagnetic frustration\" and can lead to conditions where, the researchers say, quantum mechanics can be created in interesting ways, like the creation of quantum spin liquids. Yet, despite the name, this phenomenon can manifest in various states of matter, including solids.\n\nTalking quantum particles\n\nThe effect is so significant, the researchers explained, that electrons can form quantum mechanical superposition that results in fluidlike correlations between electron spins as if the spins are immersed in a liquid.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt a quantum level, the electrons interact with one another by emitting and reabsorbing quanta of light known as photons. Similarly, in a quantum spin liquid, the interaction between spinons is described in terms of exchanging lightlike quanta,\u201d said Nevidomskyy.\n\nThe team explained that these spinons could even \"talk\" to each other by exchanging waves similar to light but much slower. This interaction is somewhat like how electrons exchange photons in the quantum theory of light.\n\n\"After this discovery, it is all the more exciting to search for evidence of monopolelike particles in a toy universe formed out of electron spins in a piece of material,\u201d said Nevidomskyy.\n\nThe team is now looking for other exotic particles, like \"visons,\" which could act like magnetic monopoles\u2014a theoretical idea from decades ago. These discoveries could deepen our understanding of the universe and how matter works at the smallest scales.\n\nYou can view the study for yourself in the journal Nature Physics."
