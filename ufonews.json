        "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 An annual report released Wednesday by the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence revealed hundreds of cases of unidentified anomalous phenomena. But even with the sightings, there is still no direct link to aliens.\n\nOf the 757 reports, 485 occurred between May 2023 and June 2024, while around 272 occurred between 2021 and 2022.\n\nAccording to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), 21 of the cases still remain under investigation and require further data and analysis.\n\n\"It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report stated. \"None of the reports AARO received during the reporting period indicated that observers suffered any adverse health effects.\"\n\nMost of the sightings turned out to be balloons, birds, aircraft and even satellites in outer space.\n\nHow Thunderstorms Hundreds Of Miles Away Can Wreak Havoc On Air Travel\n\n\"AARO increasingly receives cases that it is able to resolve to the Starlink satellite constellation,\" the report stated. \"For example, a commercial pilot reported white flashing lights in the night sky. The pilot did not report an altitude or speed, and no data or imagery was recorded. AARO assessed that this sighting of flashing lights correlated with a Starlink satellite launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the same evening about one hour prior to the sighting. This sighting occurred in the known orbital path of the satellites. AARO is investigating if other unresolved cases may be attributed to the expansion of the Starlink and other mega-constellations in low earth orbit.\"\n\nWhile the number of reported UAP incidents has risen in recent years, government officials contend it is because of the public\u2019s greater awareness and tendency to report such objects than actually a growing trend.\n\nThe AARO was established in 2022 to oversee the investigation and analysis of UAPs and help determine their threats to national security.\n\nOf the nearly 400 reports received from pilots during the period, only one incident appeared to pose a potential safety risk, in which the AARO continues to look into the case.\n\nAdditionally, 18 reported events occurred near U.S. nuclear infrastructure, weapons and launch sites, prompting the involvement of law enforcement.\n\nAviation Experts Concerned 5G Rollout Near Airports Could Compromise Safety\n\nGovernment agencies, including the Department of Defense and the National Intelligence Program, use the broader term of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) rather than Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) to identify cases.\n\nUAPs include any unexplained phenomenon that occurs on land, sea or space, while UFOs specifically refer to objects that fly through the sky.\n\nRecent spotting of an UFO reported to the Department of Defense.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Hundreds of UFO-like sightings revealed in US Department of Defense report"

The sightings are then investigated by multiple agencies.\n\nOnce the Pentagon puts together the report, it\u2019s sent to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office for review.\n\nThis year, the AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 from this past year and an additional 272 from 2021-2022 that were not sent. The Pentagon says after being reviewed, the majority of the sightings were found to be ordinary objects.\n\nAs of today, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has received over 1,600 UAP reports, 757 of which came to AARO during the period covered by this report. \u201cAARO has successfully resolved hundreds of cases in its holdings to commonplace objects such as balloons, birds, drones, satellites and aircraft,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, the Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary.\n\nDuring that press briefing, the head of the AARO acknowledged that there were 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can\u2019t explain. The agency added that all 21 happened near national security sites, were recorded on video, and had multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability recently held its second hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, as they call them."

        "article_content": "Newly released documents have revealed that Canadian police collected debris of a UFO that was shot down over Lake Huron last year.\n\nThe object was taken down on February 12, 2023 by a US F-16 fighter jet, marking the third such incident over North America that month.\n\nWitnesses described the object as 'octagonal' with strings hanging off it before the jet fired two missiles, striking the UFO that then slowly descended into Canadian waters.\n\nDocuments obtained by CTVNews.ca stated that 'wreckage' was found on 'the shoreline of Lake Huron' weeks after search efforts were suspended.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) partnered with the American and Canadian Coast Guard to conduct a brief search following the incident.\n\nBy February 16, it was called off due to 'deteriorating weather and the low probability of recovery, according to an RCMP statement.\n\nBut the partially redacted emails acquired by CTVNews.ca revealed that the RCMP collected 'both material and a module' from the site of the incident roughly three weeks after the object was shot down.\n\nNational security officials have criticized the effort for a 'lack of transparency.'\n\nNewly released documents have revealed that Canadian police collected debris after an unidentified object was shot down over Lake Huron on February 12 2023\n\n'The module is from a company who sells weather monitoring equipment,' a senior RCMP member told a Canadian military brigadier-general in an email sent on March 13, 2023, according to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'It will be analyzed to determine if there is anything unusual with it but I suspect not given the size. Whether or not it is from the shoot down is uncertain,' the email continued.\n\nAn RCMP spokesperson further confirmed the debris collection in a statement to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'The RCMP confirms that debris was recovered from the shores of Lake Huron, and we continue to work in close collaboration with our domestic and international partners in furthering the investigation,' the spokesperson said Friday.\n\n'As the investigation is ongoing, additional details cannot be provided at this time.'\n\nThe RCMP would not confirm whether the debris was ever definitively linked to the Lake Huron object, and Canada's Department of National Defense also declined to comment, CTVNews.ca reported.\n\nIain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that the lack of transparency could be because the US and Canadian governments were embarrassed of shooting down objects that did not pose national security threats.\n\nThe object was taken down by a US F-16 fighter jet, and was the third unidentified object to be shot out of the sky over North American that month\n\nThe incident occurred just days after the downing of a Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4, which garnered widespread media attention.\n\n'To have expended significant military time and resources to shoot down benign objects does not look good, even though there may have been many factors we are still unaware of,' he speculated to CTVNews.ca.\n\n'I am not surprised that the Canadian government did not share more information about the Lake Huron debris.'\n\nThe incident, and three others that month, occurred just days after the downing of a Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4, which garnered widespread media attention.\n\nThe other two were downed in Alaska and Yukon, Canada.\n\nAll three were reported to be smaller than the Chinese balloon, which measured 200 feet tall, according to US General Glen D. VanHerck.\n\nThe balloon carried an underslung payload described as a 'technology bay' that was roughly the size of two to three school buses.\n\nIt flew across North America from January 28 to February 4, 2023, passing over Alaska, western Canada and the contiguous US before it was shot down by the US Air Force off the coast of South Carolina.\n\nAnalysis of the debris determined that the balloon carried intelligence-gathering equipment, but it did not appear to have sent information back to China.\n\nThe three UFO incidents that followed did not appear to be related to the Chinese balloon, and there was no evidence to suggest that they were surveillance vehicles from any other country, President Joe Biden stated on February 16."

        "article_content": "The Pentagon provided new details today about how its deployable, readily reconfigurable suite of sensors called GREMLIN works to help set the stage for figuring out what unidentified objects in our skies are and are not, if they appear at all.\n\nIn its annual report released on Thursday, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) shared a graphic that gives us our best look yet at what its GREMLIN system is. It was developed by Georgia Tech Research Institute specifically to help gather data about so-called unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs. That\u2019s the DoD\u2019s new parlance for what used to be called UFOs.\n\nWhen AARO last discussed GREMLIN back in March, the office said the system was designed to provide \u201chyperspectral surveillance to try to capture these incidents.\u201d However, no details were given about what kind of sensors were being used to capture data across different areas of the electromagnetic spectrum simultaneously.\n\nNow deployed, GREMLIN includes 2D and 3D radars, long-range electro-optical/infrared sensors, GPS, satellite communications, aircraft tracking systems and radio frequency spectrum monitoring. It all feeds into a central node where the data can be fused to get a better sense of what\u2019s out there. The system is something of an integrated air defense apparatus \u2018in a box,\u2019 allowing for multiple sensor types and open-source data to be captured on single targets within its view.\n\nAARO began using GREMLIN \u201cfor detecting, tracking, and characterizing UAP,\u201d the report noted. \u201cGREMLIN demonstrated functionality and successfully collected data during a test event in March of 2024. The next step for GREMLIN is a 90-day pattern of life collection at a site of national security.\u201d\n\nAARO\u2019s official logo. (DoD)\n\nOne of AARO\u2019s first missions for GREMLIN is to help establish a baseline for what would be considered normal activity, especially because so many UAPs have been reported either through sensors near military installations or by pilots. According to today\u2019s report, nearly half of the 485 UAP sightings reported from May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024 came from locations near U.S. military assets and sensors at home and abroad. This could be due to the objects being tasked to surveil those locations or due to sensor bias, as these areas are more heavily monitored than others, or more likely a mix of both.\n\nEast Asian seas were the hottest spot, providing 100 reports of which AARO resolved 40 as balloons or drones. AARO placed the remaining cases in Active Archive due to insufficient information to facilitate analysis, the report states.\n\n\u201cRight now we have this geographic bias where we are getting reports near the national security sites, but we also have a bias from pilots and other security personnel,\u201d AARO\u2019s new Director Jon Kosloski told reporters today. \u201cSo we want to have a better understanding of what normal looks like near those national security sites, and then eventually we\u2019ll be expanding our baseline investigations to other areas in the US to look at what normal looks like away from national security sites.\u201d\n\nAARO\n\nKosloski refused to divulge where GREMLIN is located.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s currently deployed,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019d rather not say exactly where it is, because we want it to be an unbiased test, and don\u2019t want to invite folks to come and do flyovers and test against the system.\u201d\n\nThe location was chosen, he added, \u201cbecause of the environment. We expect there to be a lot of variety in the types of things that we\u2019re going to see. And there have been UAP reports in that general area. And we\u2019re trying to build a baseline.\u201d\n\nOnce a pattern of life is established, the report suggested that AARO could use that to go back over some of the 444 cases placed in the Active Archive \u201cbecause they lacked sufficient data to facilitate analysis.\u201d\n\nAll told, AARO found that 49 cases during the reporting period were objects like balloons, birds and drones. \u201cAn additional 243 cases were recommended for closure as of June 1, 2024, pending peer review,\u201d the report pointed out. \u201cThese cases also resolved to prosaic objects including balloons, birds, UAS, satellites, and aircraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cAARO determined 21 cases merit further analysis by its IC [intelligence community] and science and technology (S&T) partners,\u201d the report acknowledged.\n\nAARO\n\nOne thing AARO did not find was any indication that UAPs are either extraterrestrial or from an adversary here on Earth.\n\n\u201cAARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology,\u201d Kosloski said. \u201cNone of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies.\u201d\n\nJust because no evidence has been found of breakthrough technology does not mean the possibility doesn\u2019t exist, he emphasizes.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely anomalies,\u201d Kosloski explained. \u201cWe have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not ruling it out,\u201d he added.\n\nThough the report found that there were 18 incidents of drones near U.S. nuclear infrastructure, weapons, and launch sites, Kosloski said there is no indication that either those or reported UAPs belonged to adversaries.\n\n\u201cWe have not been able to correlate any UAP activity to adversarial collection activities or advanced technologies,\u201d he posited.\n\nThe report also didn\u2019t cover the drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base last December that we were the first to report back in March. You can read more about it in our exclusive story here.\n\n\u201cIt was known to be UAV activity, so we were there in a supporting role, but it was not our responsibility to address that,\u201d Kosloski stated.\n\nAARO\u2019s new Director Jon Kosloski (DoD Image)\n\nAs it has been since UFOs first burst into the public\u2019s consciousness back in the 1950s, the stigma of reporting them continues to keep people from coming forward to say what they\u2019ve seen. Kosloski said he is concerned that could give adversaries an opening to collect data over sensitive locations. This is something TWZ has long highlighted as a major strategic awareness failure.\n\nKosloski is \u201cconcerned that somebody could use the potential stigma to try and take advantage of that. If there is a stigma associated with reporting UAP, then that\u2019s an opportunity for the adversary to maybe conduct collection operations and not have folks report on it. But we haven\u2019t seen evidence of that yet.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to help diminish the stigma of reporting UAPs, Kosloski said AARO is working with partners in the intelligence community and other government agencies to downgrade the classification ratings of incidents to make them more available to the public. Video of some of the cases AARO has discussed publicly will be released on Nov. 19.\n\n\u201cBut there are interesting cases that I \u2013 my physics and engineering background and time in the IC \u2013 I do not understand, and I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that we will be able to release as much of that content as we can to the public so that we can get help in resolving them,\u201d Kosloski commented.\n\nMore quickly and accurately identifying what some of the objects are is the hope for GREMLIN as well.\n\nAARO has been under heavy ridicule by some proponents of UAP action, with claims that it is part of a coverup and has not executed its duties in good faith. Kosloski has taken over the office from its previous head, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, who has repeatedly stood by his office\u2019s investigations and methods.\n\nAARO\u2019s recent report on the history of the US government and UAP was perhaps the worst government report I've ever seen. Adding insult to injury, its findings were uncritically reported by the mainstream press. To help set the record straight, I consulted a group of UAP\u2026 \u2014 Christopher K. Mellon (@ChrisKMellon) April 12, 2024\n\nThe fact that AARO has not shared satellite imagery of UAP with Congress is itself evidence of an effort to keep Congress in the dark. #uaphearing \u2014 Christopher K. Mellon (@ChrisKMellon) July 26, 2023\n\nThe release of AARO\u2019s latest report also comes a day after another UAP was held on Capitol Hill, with witnesses making claims that appear at odds with AARO\u2019s past findings, especially in regard to secret UAP recovery programs.\n\nAnother congressional hearing on Nov. 19 will put AARO and its latest findings specifically in the spotlight.\n\nCONGRESS UFO/UAP UPDATE\n\n\n\nSenate Armed Services Cmte posts notice of closed hearing, followed by open hearing, Nov. 19, 2024, \"to examine the activities of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office,\" in Emerging Threats & Capabilities Subcmte.

With the government supporting initiatives for homegrown AI Startups, the country is witnessing some big changes in the tech and business sectors. By integrating local languages, cultural relevance, and practical applications, AI models this year have empowered Indian businesses and set benchmarks for the global AI ecosystem.\n\nThis article describes the best Indian AI models launched in 2024, focusing on how they help India advance AI developments worldwide.\n\nBharatGen\n\nThe Indian government recently unveiled BharatGen, the first government-funded initiative for developing multimodal LLMs. BharatGen stands for building \u201cGenAI for Bharat, by Bharat.\u201d\n\nThe initiative recently unveiled e-vikrAI\u2014an advanced solution powered by Vision Language Models, designed for product images in Indic e-commerce. e-vikrAI simplifies cataloguing for sellers, eliminating the need for manual input. By simply uploading a product image, sellers receive auto-generated titles, descriptions, features, and pricing suggestions, all with a deep understanding of Indic culture.\n\nNVIDIA Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi-4B\n\nDuring his visit to India, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang launched the Nemotron-4-Mini-Hindi-4B model, a small but powerful Hindi language model designed to help businesses create AI solutions for regional demands.\n\nThis model, part of NVIDIA\u2019s NIM microservice, can be deployed on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems, optimising performance for various applications.\n\nTech Mahindra is the first to implement this model, creating Indus 2.0, which focuses on Hindi and its dialects. The Nemotron Hindi model has 4 billion parameters and was derived from a 15-billion-parameter multilingual model, Nemotron-4. It was trained with real-world Hindi data and synthetic data, including English.\n\nAfter fine-tuning with NVIDIA NeMo, it leads on multiple accuracy benchmarks for AI models with up to 8 billion parameters. Packaged as a microservice, it supports various industry applications, including education and healthcare.\n\nKrutrim\n\nEarlier this year, Bhavish Aggarwal\u2019s Ola Krutrim launched its first AI model, Krutrim. The model can understand 22 Indian languages and generate text in 10, including Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Odia, Gujarati, and Malayalam.\n\nKrutrim has been trained on over 2 trillion tokens, with a strong focus on Indian data, making it uniquely suited to reflect the nuances of India\u2019s heritage and culture.\n\nSarvam-1\n\nIndian AI startup Sarvam AI has launched Sarvam-1, the first LLM optimised specifically for Indian languages.\n\nDeveloped with 2 billion parameters, Sarvam-1 supports 10 major Indian languages\u2014Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu.\n\nOne of Sarvam-1\u2019s key features is its computational efficiency. The model offers four to six times faster inference speeds compared to larger models like Gemma-2-9B and Llama-3.1-8B while maintaining competitive performance levels. This makes Sarvam-1 particularly suitable for deployment in production environments, including edge devices where computing resources may be limited.\n\nSurya OCR\n\nSurya OCR is a comprehensive optical character recognition (OCR) toolkit developed to handle a wide range of document types and languages.

The crime was so horrifying it inspired a slew of movies and books dedicated to exploring the conspiracy theory that the property was left \"haunted\" by the spirits of the six family members who died inside it.\n\n\"The Amityville Horror\" has become part of true-crime lore over the years\u2014first brought to life in the pages of a book of the same name in 1977, before it was adapted for the big screen in 1979, starring Hollywood A-listers Margot Kidder and James Brolin.\n\nSince then, dozens of follow-up books and movies have been released, most recently in October 2024, which saw the premiere of the latest horror flick in the series, \"Amityville: Where the Echo Lives.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMuch of the pop culture references to the real-life murders that took place inside the five-bedroom, four-bathroom Dutch Colonial property center on the family who moved in after convicted murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot and killed his parents and four siblings on Nov. 13, 1974.\n\nDeFeo was tried and convicted of the murders of both his parents, Ronald Sr. and Louise, as well as his siblings Dawn, 18, Allison, 13, Marc, 12, and John, 9, all of whom were found dead in their beds having been shot with a .35-caliber lever action Marlin rifle.\n\nIt has been 50 years since mass murderer Ronald DeFeo Jr. brutally killed six members of his family inside their home in Amityville, NY. Realtor.com\n\nIn the five decades since the heinous crimes took place, the home has become a local tourist attraction for fans of the horror movie franchise inspired by the murders. Paul Hawthorne/Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeFeo was convicted of six counts of second-degree murder and handed six sentences of 25 years to life. He died in prison in March 2021.\n\nThree years after DeFeo murdered his parents and siblings, a book was written about the family that moved into his former home and claimed they were haunted by spirits. Amazon\n\nDeFeo, also known as \"Butch,\" was 23 at the time of the killings. He initially tried to blame the murders on a mob hitman\u2014however, police later found serious holes in his story and turned their attention to him as their main suspect.\n\nHe was tried and ultimately convicted of six counts of second-degree murder. He was given six sentences of 25 years to life, and later died in jail on March 21, 2021, at the age of 69. In the years before his death, he claimed that he had heard voices telling him to kill his family.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nHowever, his crimes continue to haunt his former home and his neighborhood, with the name \"Amityville\" now synonymous with horror films and ghostly conspiracy theories.\n\nThe home where he shot and killed his family members still stands to this day\u2014a sinister reminder of the horrors that once took place inside its walls, despite efforts to wipe its slate clean.\n\nFirst, the property's address was officially changed from 112 Ocean Avenue to 108 Ocean Avenue, a common practice in cases where homes have been involved in gruesome crimes.\n\nMORE FROM REALTOR:\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nJust over a year after the DeFeo family was murdered, George and Kathy Lutz purchased the Amityville property for the reduced price of $80,000 and soon moved into the home with their three children.\n\nHowever, they moved out after just 28 days, alleging that they had experienced numerous paranormal phenomena while living there\u2014from strange odors and slime oozing from the walls to George waking to find Kathy levitating over their bed.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThey even claimed that a priest who had been to bless the home had heard a voice screaming at them to \"get out,\" per Biography.com.\n\nGeorge also alleged that he suddenly began waking at 3:15 a.m., which was the exact time that DeFeo is understood to have begun killing his family members, all of whom were found in their beds.\n\nThat book served as the basis for the hit 1979 movie \"The Amityville Horror.\" The film did not feature the DeFeo's former home and instead used a lookalike property. YouTube\n\nThe movie starred Hollywood A-listers Margot Kidder and James Brolin as George and Kathy Lutz, who moved into the DeFeo home with their children and claimed it was haunted. YouTube\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn the years since the home became the source of pop culture lore, it has passed hands multiple times\u2014most recently in 2017, when it was purchased for $605,000. Stan Wolfson/Newsday RM via Getty Images\n\nIt wasn't long before the Lutz family fled the property, leaving all of their belongings behind.\n\nThey faced a barrage of skepticism from the public, with critics accusing them of fabricating a series of spooky stories in a bid to gain national media attention; however, their experiences served as the basis for a book, \"The Amityville Horror: A True Story,\" which was later source material for the popular 1979 movie.\n\nNeither the original movie or any of its many sequels and prequels were filmed inside the DeFeo's former home. Lookalike properties were instead used as filming locations.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIt would take more than a year for the home to sell again\u2014this time to Jim and Barbara Cromarty, who paid just $55,000 for it in April 1977, not long before the book about the Lutz family's experiences was released.\n\nAlthough Jim and Barbara never reported witnessing any paranormal activity, they were plagued by the home's history\u2014revealing that their house was besieged by unwanted visitors at all hours of the night, a nightmare that led them to change the address in a bid to throw people off.\n\nAfter a year, they put the home on the market for $100,000; but by this point, interest in the Amityville case had reached fever pitch, and no legitimate buyer could be found. So, they chose to embrace the home's heritage, speaking out about it publicly and working with the local authorities to figure out a way to manage the influx of fascinated visitors.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad"

        "article_content": "Since her public debut in 1978, Lucy has been on a first-name basis with the world. Not bad for someone from rural Ethiopia who had been an unknown for 3.2 million years or so.\n\nPaleoanthropologists Donald Johanson and Tom Gray had discovered Lucy\u2019s fossilized bones a few years earlier (SN: 1/4/75, p. 4). That spectacular moment 50 years ago quickly upended how many scientists thought about human evolution. Until then, the history of our species was drawn as an orderly progression, with one member of the big-brained Homo species leading to the next. The famed anthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey, and later their son Richard, had spent decades excavating fossils that they said supported that theory. Lucy, who walked upright like a human but had a petite brain and other apelike features, didn\u2019t fit in. Her existence proved that the story was more complicated \u2014 and much more interesting.\n\nTell us about your Science News experience Help us improve by taking our 15-question reader survey. Take the survey now\n\nAs Bruce Bower, Science News\u2019 behavioral sciences writer, reports in this issue, scientists knew of only a few hominid species when Lucy\u2019s partial skeleton was discovered in 1974 (SN: 11/13/24, p. 18). Today, scientists recognize more than 20 hominid species, including Lucy\u2019s Australopithecus afarensis. \u201cJohanson calls that particular point in time the beginning of a golden decade in paleoanthropology,\u201d Bower told me. \u201cIt was changing the way everyone thought.\u201d\n\nEven for those of us who have been reading about Lucy for decades, Bower\u2019s retelling of the tale is a treat. Lore has it that she was named after the Beatles song \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\u201d which was playing on repeat at a celebration in camp the evening of her discovery. Bower, a longtime Beatles fan, doesn\u2019t shirk from further invoking the Fab Four. He notes that other fossils discovered nearby helped Lucy top \u201cthe hominid hit parade with a little help from her friends.\u201d And he uses the lyric \u201cI thought I knew you, what did I know?\u201d from the song \u201cI\u2019m Looking Through You\u201d to address hot-topic questions about Lucy, including whether she climbed trees, what she ate and whether she and her compatriots used stone tools.\n\nThe gully where Lucy was found lies in a parched, treeless desert. But when I look at the photos from the 1974 dig, the people toiling away in that heat and dust look so happy. Perhaps the photos were taken after they found Lucy, a major discovery made after weeks, months \u2014 who knows, possibly years \u2014 of fruitless toil. It was the day when they finally found a fossil that changed everything. Or maybe the photos were taken before the debut of our celebrity hominid, and those smiling, dusty people were just happy to be doing the work.\n\nToday, scholars of human evolution have many more tools at their disposal than did the crew in Ethiopia. That includes ancient DNA analysis that has revolutionized our ability to better identify hominid populations and the relationships between them, including the genetic connections between Neandertals and present-day humans.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if Lucy and her kind are among our direct distant ancestors; like many things in the study of human evolution, it\u2019s debated. But she can count me among her many fans."

        "article_content": "You may or may not know this, but certain online retailers and various small brands will actually increase prices before a huge sale, like early Black Friday sales, actual Black Friday, or even Cyber Monday and Cyber Week. Let\u2019s say, for example, they discount the product by $20. Weeks before, they might raise the price by $30 to make the discount look bigger. So, the reality is you\u2019re not actually getting a great deal \u2014 they trick you. There is a way to combat this and find the best early Black Friday deals and beyond. There\u2019s a tool I use called CamelCamelCamel, which works wonders to help you find the real deals and steals. Well, anyway, I used the tool to find the best deal prices for Black Friday, and the holiday discounts. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of those deals. Spoiler: They\u2019re so, so good.\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max \u2014 now $33, was $60 45% off\n\nIt makes a lot of sense that Amazon\u2019s devices would be discounted heavily for Black Friday and the holiday sales, so no surprise here. But if you\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade your streaming game you can\u2019t go wrong with the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max.\n\nDewalt 20V Max Cordless Drill and Impact Driver \u2014 now $129, was $239 46%off\n\nWe\u2019ve covered this drill set a lot in the past because, well, I have it. I also love it. It\u2019s great for just about anything drill-related. I use it to hang pictures, and TVs, and build various things around the home \u2013 my most recent project was building a wooden box around a TV on my outdoor patio. It worked wonderfully. Anyway, it comes with a regular electric drill and a hammer drill, the latter of which makes it so much easier to punch through hard materials like stone or concrete. This deal is one of the best in a while.\n\n27-inch Sceptre IPS 2K Gaming Monitor \u2014 now $169, was $200 16% off\n\nNeed a new gaming monitor or just want an extra one? You can\u2019t go wrong here. It\u2019s 27 inches, supports 2K QHD resolutions \u2014 2560 by 1440 \u2014 with HDR400, and at 165Hz with a 1ms response time. If you don\u2019t know any of those numbers, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a decent monitor, even more so at the current deal price.\n\nSony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones \u2014 now $198, was $348 43% off\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones earned a full five stars from our audio reviewer back when they launched. They\u2019re still that good. This deal price makes them super enticing, especially if you don\u2019t have a comparable pair handy. They\u2019re comfortable, offer excellent sound quality, offer great noise cancelation features, and include a bunch of extras. At least check them out.\n\nGarmin Vivoactive 5 Smartwatch \u2014 now $200, was $300 33% off\n\nWe gave the Garmin Vivoactive 5 four stars in our review and for good reason. It offers exceptional fitness and health tracking, long-lasting and reliable battery life, doesn\u2019t require any needless subscriptions, and has a beautiful AMOLED display. Garmin\u2019s software can be a little trick for new users, but once you get the hang of it, you\u2019re all set. Don\u2019t let that scare you away from his incredible fitness and health-oriented smartwatch. Garmin makes some of the best out there on the market today and this one is no exception. Plus, you know, that\u2019s a great deal price.\n\nNintendo Switch OLED with White Joy-Cons \u2014 now $349, was $350 1% off\n\nThis is actually less than a 1% discount which will probably lead many of you to ask why I even included it. The answer is that it\u2019s still the best price out there right now, even by a small margin. If you have Amazon gift cards or some money saved up, you can save quite a bit on it. Maybe you earned some money doing Amazon tasks or surveys? Bam, then the best place to buy is Amazon already and now you\u2019ll save even more.\n\nMSI Claw Ultra 7-155H PC gaming handheld \u2014 now $471, was $749 37% off\n\nLook, the MSI Claw isn\u2019t the best gaming handheld on the market right now \u2014 that\u2019s fairly evident. But this deal price does put it on our radar. Instead of the usual AMD chipset like the Steam Deck and its competitors, the MSI Claw opts for an Intel Ultra 7-155H, with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 512TB solid-state drive, a microSD card reader, and a 7-inch FHD 120Hz display. Then there\u2019s that snazzy RGB around the joysticks. I don\u2019t know, think about it.\n\n65-inch LG C3 Series Class OLED evo 4K smart TV \u2014 now $1,297, was $1,500 14% off\n\nYou know as well as I do that during these huge sales there are TV deals and discounts flying all over the damn place. It\u2019s difficult to keep up at times, that\u2019s for sure. But this LG smart TV deal is one of the best out there right now according to sources. It\u2019s a 4K OLED with a sweet spot size \u2014 65-inches \u2014 making it suitable to place in bedrooms, game rooms, garages, living rooms, you name it. The deal price doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n2024 Apple MacBook Air 15-inch with M3 \u2014 now $1,299, was $1,499 13% off\n\nAt one of its lowest prices in a long while, this Apple MacBook Air features 16GB of unified memory, a 512GB solid-state drive for storage, and the Apple M3 chip. It\u2019s lean, mean, and one of the most powerful MacBooks released. The portable design lends itself well to creatives, with 18 hours of battery life on a single charge despite having a beautiful 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display. This is a great deal, folks."
