        "article_content": "Taylor Swift showed up at the 2024 MTV VMAs wearing a UFO-themed Monse outfit, but there\u2019s something alien about the style. She wore a surprise custom-made minidress with a UFO print from the brand, which is known for its deconstructed tailoring and graphic prints. The pattern, symbolic of her popular track \u201cDown Bad,\u201d doubled as an unexpected easter egg for the event. However, she made one last outfit change on Wednesday night for the VMA afterparty, and this time, it was a UFO-themed corset top, a boyfriend jacket, and a mini skirt.\n\nBoth dresses are from Monse\u2019s Resort 2025 collection and have been inspired by the sci-fi films from the 1950s. The UFO-themes print adds a hint of nostalgia with playfulness, retro charm, and sophistication to the outfits for an \u201cout of the world\u201d look.\n\nTaylor Swift opts for another UFO-themed outfit at the VMAs afterparty\n\nIMAGE | ROBERT KAMAU/GC IMAGES VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nTaylor Swift opted for a second UFO-themed Monse outfit for the MTV VMAs night as she made her way to the Electric Lady Studios after-party in NYC. After a winning streak of seven awards, she hit the event in style after an outfit swap to celebrate her victories with friends.\n\nAccording to Marie Claire, she was styled by Joseph Cassell Falconer. The singer wore a UFO print top and pleaded miniskirt from the brand, uncannily similar to her previous outfit from the night, and paired it with a similar-pattered tapestry jacket. The outfit came in earthy tones of blue and green. Additionally, her look included smokey eye makeup, orange-red lip shade, and black-edgy Vivienne Westwood boots with some sparkly jewelry.\n\nBefore her final VMAs look, Taylor Swift rocked a similar space-themed sparkling minidress during the awards ceremony from Monse. The custom-made dress had a visible UFO montage scene and her choice of outfit has now sparked speculation about whether the theme was one of Swift\u2019s infamous easter eggs. They can be a nod to her famous song \u201cDown Bad\u201d from the \u201cTortured Poets Department\u201d given the very obvious lyrics, \u201cDid you really beam me up? In a cloud of sparkling dust / Just to do experiments on / Tell me I was the chosen one / Show me that this world is bigger than us / Then sent me back where I came from / For a moment I knew cosmic love.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s outfit was either a look back at her hit song or a hint at what\u2019s coming. Here\u2019s to hoping for this easter egg to climax into something new and to get answers sooner than ever!\n\nThe post This Time It\u2019s a UFO-Themed Miniskirt Outfit for Taylor Swift at VMAs party appeared first on theFashionSpot."

Since the sighting, Meireles said his home was raided by \"soldiers camouflaged in black.\"\n\nDespite the apparent military threat, Meireles boasted on Facebook in 2022 that his candid snaps were the only selfies with the spaceship.\n\nHe also spoke about his experience in his book Fieldworkers: Pesquisadores de Campo in 2016, which attracted further attention from the military.\n\nSpeaking to Museu da Pessoa, a Brazillian non-profit group, Meireles said: \"The result of the interrogation was [...] Fractures: 4 left ribs and left knee [...] Perforation with bleeding in the left lung.\"\n\n\"I was hospitalised for 12 days at the Chapada Regional Hospital, in Seabra-Ba, my medical history is there for anyone who wants to investigate.\"\n\nChapada Diamantina National Park was established in September 1985 to protect a host of rare, endangered species native to these Atlantic Forest plateaus 3,000 feet above sea level.\n\nIt is home to a giant armadillo, a giant anteater, a Chaco eagle and potentially home to extraterrestrials.\n\nTaking to social media platform Reddit where the image was posted, one user described his experience.\n\nHe said: \"Holy F***, this is identical to what I saw right before Covid hit.\n\nTrump vows to release new Pentagon UFO videos if he wins after admitting there \u2018could be life on other planets\u2019\n\n\"The bottom rotated when it glowed red with an orange centre, and then it did a quick zig-zag and it was gone.\n\n\"I screamed laughed and cried.

        "article_content": "The opportunity arose for Swallow after a chance meeting with Gerry's son Jamie Anderson, now head of his late father's company Anderson Entertainment \u2013 with the two men sharing an agent, Swallow arranged a meeting with Jamie to express his enthusiasm for Gerry's works.\n\nThe conversation eventually turned to the idea of crafting new stories set within the timeline of the original shows, with Swallow keen to explore the worlds of UFO and Space: 1999, two series which had \"the strongest impact\" on him in the early 1970s.\n\n\"Jamie came back to me and said, 'We've got this idea about doing these novellas \u2013 would you like to take a crack at it?'\" Swallow recalls. \"I pretty much bit his hand off.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"It's been a lot of fun for me \u2013 It gave me a great excuse to go back and rewatch the shows and kind of steep myself in them again. I tried very hard to make sure that I wrote these new stories in the style of that early 1970s sci-fi.\n\n\"I wanted to make it feel like these two manuscripts had been lying in a box somewhere since 1972... so if you love these shows, you could watch the TV show and then pick up the book, and it would feel like a seamless experience.\"\n\nThe cast of Space: 1999. Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nFirst aired in 1970-71, UFO \u2013 the first wholly live-action show produced by the Andersons following the Supermarionation success of Thunderbirds, Stingray and others \u2013 followed the covert efforts of top-secret military agency SHADO to prevent an alien invasion of Earth.\n\nThough a second season never materialised, initial concepts for further episodes eventually formed for the basis for the next show on the slate: Space: 1999 (aired 1975-1977) saw the moon, and the 311 inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha, sent hurtling out of Earth's orbit towards the unknown dangers of the galaxy.\n\nSwallow's new efforts, he says, \"dovetail with the source material\", with the hope being that you \"feel like you're reading an episode of the TV show that never got made\".\n\n\"I tried to do a little more than maybe they could have done on the TV shows, so I've got a few elements in both books which would have blown the budget had it been the television episode,\" he adds. \"But I've got the best budget ever, which is my readers' imagination.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine sees Commander John Koenig (as played on television by Martin Landau) and the people of Moonbase Alpha face an uncertain fate when a planet-killing alien weapon at the heart of a sinister cloud diverts their lost moon on to a fatal trajectory, while UFO - Shadowplay see SHADO commander-in-chef Ed Straker (played by Ed Bishop in the series) awaken from a coma with missing memories and suffering from strange hallucinations that threaten his grip on reality.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn telling these stories, Swallow was allowed to \"play with somebody else's toys\", but knew he couldn't \"leave sticky fingerprints all over them\" \u2013 and that the continuity of the television shows imposed certain limitations.\n\n\"In terms keeping inside the canon, I think that's part and parcel of taking on one of these jobs,\" he explains.\n\n\"You're not going to break it. You're going to work inside the lines. And some people have said to me, you know, isn't that like a straightjacket for you? Isn\u2019t it an intellectually bereft way of writing? And I think the exact opposite is true.\n\n\"It's challenging to me working inside the box. My first thought is, how do I push at the edges of that box? How do I kind of work inside the lines but still deliver something that reveals something new about these characters while acting in respect to the core material?\"\n\nCould these two books be just the beginning of a range of new adventures? Swallow is certainly hopeful, and suggests there's a hunger among other authors to engage with the worlds of Gerry Anderson.\n\nUFO and Space: 1999 novellas. Anderson Entertainment\n\n\"I had an absolute blast doing this \u2013 sometimes working on these type of projects can be a real pain, if you're working with somebody who's watching every tiny little detail, but there was such great creative freedom here, and it was such a fun bunch of people to work with.\n\n\"I would love to do it again, and I've heard from friends of mine who are other writers who are saying, 'Oh, that's a great franchise, we\u2019d love to be part of that.' So I think there's a market for it, there's an audience for it, and there's definitely a love for these stories, so we could tell more.\"\n\nGiven that UFO and Space: 1999 are effectively sister series, albeit a shared continuity was never established between the shows on television, might a crossover story even be on the cards in future?\n\n\"I've always thought these two shows feel like they took place in the same world,\" says Swallow. \"If you look at the timeline of it, Ed Straker was running SHADO in 1980 and Moonbase Alpha\u2019s in 1999\u2026 maybe these guys knew each other?\n\n\"I think that would be fun, to explore the idea of finding some sort of way to connect them... because of course UFO\u2019s story was never brought to a conclusion. You had this ongoing sort of Cold War story with these alien invaders and the show finished after one season and we never found out... were they defeated? What happened? And then Space: 1999 rolls along, [set] a decade later...\n\n\"Well, did something happen between the point of those stories?

I think that would work, definitely. You could update that to the modern day and you wouldn't really need to change an awful lot.\"\n\nAs for Space: 1999, though he argues you'd need \"brush over the scientific elements that were maybe a bit wobbly in the show\" \u2013 chiefly a nuclear explosion blowing the moon out of Earth's orbit \u2013 he adds: \"The core concept about a group of people stranded in this satellite moving through space, who have no control where they're going, coming up against danger and meeting people, and finding a way to survive again... that's a compelling idea.\"\n\nSpace: 1999 - The Armageddon Engine and UFO - Shadow Play novellas are available to buy from gerryanderson.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out more of our Sci-Fi coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on.

While much of his work is classified, the memoir promises to reveal all that can be lawfully disclosed, providing a first-hand account of the shocking discoveries, challenges, and breakthroughs that have marked the U.S Government\u2019s investigation and understanding of UAP and non-human intelligence, as well as the profound effects on Stratton and his family.\n\n\u201cWe are at the beginning of a new chapter for humanity. The process of disclosure is complex but it has begun,\u201d said Jay Stratton.\n\nStratton served for 32 years in the Army, Air Force, Naval Intelligence, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he was Chief of Air & Space Warfare in the Defense Warning Office.\n\nHe was involved in the creation of the U.S. government\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Applications Program, the first official U.S Government program to investigate UFOs since Project Blue Book was shuttered in 1969.\n\nJay Stratton also created the U.S. government\u2019s UAP Task Force at the request of the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense.\n\nOne of the members of that team was David Grusch \u2013 a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), who claimed in front of Congress that the United States had retrieved and studied UFOs of non-human origin."

        "article_content": "University of Waterloo student Rastin Rassoli's own struggles with his mental health inspired him to combine two of his passions \u2014 computer science and psychology \u2014 to help more young people access care and support. At an early co-op placement, for instance, he helped develop an app called Joyi, which delivers bite-sized psychology lessons to help teens manage stress and anxiety.\n\nA new idea emerged, however, as he heard first-hand accounts about difficulties fellow students had accessing care on campus and began learning about the subclinical stage of mental health disorders in his classes. At the same time, he saw stunning leaps being made with large language model artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT.\n\nThose elements coalesced in Rassoli's latest creation: Doro, an app that aims to coach students in tackling their mental health concerns early on, before symptoms escalate.\n\n\"LLMs can make things very accessible. And in the mental health industry, we really have this problem of accessibility,'\" he said.\n\nAbout one in five Canadian youth who reported having \"good,\" \"very good\" or \"excellent\" mental health in 2019 downgraded that status to \"fair\" or \"poor\" by 2023, Statistics Canada said this week. People aged 15 to 24 are already more likely to experience mental illness and/or substance use disorders than any other age group.\n\nAs young people struggle to find care, a new wave of AI mental health and wellness apps have emerged of late, offering support at one's fingertips, 24/7. Yet experts warn that an app can't replace conventional treatment, especially in serious or emergency situations.\n\nWhat kind of apps are out there?\n\nThe general idea behind these apps is for users to type out messages sharing their concerns, as if \"chatting\" to a real-life therapist.\n\nThe technology can draw from a database of knowledge, reference what a person has shared or discussed across multiple past sessions and deliver responses in a convincingly conversational way. An app might encourage further reflection, for instance, or lead a user through guided meditation. Another could prompt you with some cognitive behavioural therapy techniques.\n\nWATCH | This app coaches students on tackling mental health concerns at an early stage: A quick walk-through Doro, a chatbot mental wellness app Duration 3:49 University student Rastin Rassoli gives CBC News a brief demo of Doro, his app using chatbot technology to coach students on tackling mental health concerns at an early stage.\n\nRassoli envisions Doro as an early intervention tool for youth starting to experience challenges: maybe someone struggling with disrupted sleep, or a person anxious over an upcoming school presentation. Perhaps this student got waitlisted when seeking help on campus, or didn't reach out in the first place, fearing stigma.\n\n\"We try to identify these specific things \u2014 the specific risk factors, behaviours and symptoms [shared by the user] \u2014 and focus on each of these,\" he said.\n\nThen, he says, Doro pulls from a variety of techniques to suggest how to manage those symptoms and offers small tasks for improvement, while also tracking each session. It might suggest journalling, for instance, or TIPP, a method for managing panic attacks.\n\nCan it replace a human therapist?\n\nIf a user's described symptoms cross a certain threshold into a crisis or emergency, however, Doro immediately refers them to a real person.\n\n\"For people with serious disorders, we immediately stop the chat. We ask them to please use the helpline or one of the available therapists in your region,\" he said.\n\nWATCH | A chatbot can feel easy to talk to, but it's not the same as therapy, says researcher: A chatbot can feel easier than talking to a therapist. But it's not the same thing, says researcher Duration 3:33 New mental health apps using AI chatbot technology promise more access to mental health support for young people, but Rachel Katz, who is researching ethical issues of using AI for psychotherapy, questions whether users truly get the help they need.\n\nFor those who've never seen a mental health professional before, an AI app might seem like an easy starting point, given that it's indeed tough to share mental health struggles, noted Rachel Katz, a PhD candidate researching ethical issues of using AI for psychotherapy.\n\n\"My concern though is that these [apps] don't actually effectively bridge that gap. It sort of reinforces the isolation of a mental health struggle,\" said Katz, who is based at the University of Toronto's Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.\n\n\"It reinforces this hyper-independence and kind of further entrenches people in this inability to reach out and actually talk to a person.\"\n\nHow could these apps benefit young people?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, close to one billion people worldwide \u2014 including 14 per cent of the world's adolescents \u2014 suffer from a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression among the most common. Most mental health professionals focus on adults; there aren't enough serving young people, according to Eduardo Bunge, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, who first began exploring AI chatbots in the mental health space about six years ago.\n\nEven if students do connect to support, help isn't available at all hours every day, added Bunge, who believes clinicians working alongside AI apps could help increase young people's access to care.\n\nWATCH | 'Making this human feel better' is what matters: Whether an app is 'making this human feel better' is what matters, says researcher Duration 2:48 Different mental health concerns require different interventions, says Palo Alto University Professor Eduardo Bunge, but if people find talking to a chatbot helpful, why shouldn't professionals add that technology to their toolbox?\n\nMental health professionals can create and curate the knowledge bases feeding into these AI platforms and set limits for them, and should also conduct ongoing monitoring of the user interactions, he said, which could help ease many people's concerns.\n\nA chatbot \"is like a very good first line of treatment \u2014 that may not be sufficient [alone]\u2026 but it's better than doing nothing. And it could be a perfect segue, if we use it carefully, to lead them to have better outcomes.\"\n\nCan you trust a chatbot?\n\nThere's definite potential in the technology, says Dr. Michael Cheng from Ottawa children's hospital CHEO. A chatbot could be used to easily point a young person toward specific mental health resources or information, for instance.\n\nStill, he's concerned about issues of safety, privacy and confidentiality, use of patient data and an overall lack of regulation at the moment.\n\n\"It's a bit of a Wild West right now,\" said the child and adolescent psychiatrist. \"Anyone can just [release] an app and say it does whatever.\"\n\nDr. Michael Cheng, a child and family psychiatrist at Ottawa children's hospital CHEO, sees promise in using AI chatbot technology in the mental health care space, but he's concerned with a host of issues, including safety, how patient data is used and lack of regulation on apps. 'It's a bit of a Wild West right now.' (Marc Robichaud/CBC)\n\nCheng is also wary of young people turning to an app rather than building healthy human connections, which are necessary for mental wellness.\n\n\"We are seeing an epidemic of children, youth and families who are disconnected from people.\u2026 They're spending excessive time in front of screens.\n\n\"The challenge with generative AI is that it can be used to create experiences which are even more addictive.\"\n\nAt this point, chatbots shouldn't be used without supervision by human therapists, believes Katz, the medical ethicist. She pointed to high-profile instances of chatbots delivering problematic or harmful suggestions, like the case where a chatbot replacing an eating disorder hotline suggested dieting and weight loss to users.\n\nWhat do students think?\n\nJason Birdi, who studies biotechnology at Waterloo, has tried chatbots for generating ideas, but he draws the line at other uses, including anything health-related.\n\n\"I don't trust the system. I don't know where that information is going,\" he said.\n\nKaden Johnson, a University of Toronto Mississauga student, sees promise in them, since he knows some peers have a hard time opening up to another person and worry about being judged.\n\nYet new tools like this should be an option and not a replacement for traditional services or professionals, said the second-year political science student.\n\n\"Mental health specialists or [resources] where people can go to access those services shouldn't be cut back as we roll out AI. I think they should continue to increase.\""

        "article_content": "Days away from the resumption of contract negotiations that will help determine how animation firms can use generative artificial intelligence in the next few years, the Animation Guild has released a report detailing the threat that the technology poses to its members.\n\n\u201cCritical Crossroads: The Impact of Generative AI and the Importance of Protecting the Animation Workforce,\u201d produced by the union\u2019s member task force dedicated to AI, finds that generative AI applications and programs create outputs \u201cthat can target most of the job categories of TAG members, spanning from design to production, animation to scriptwriting.\u201d Currently, 3D models, full-color 3D sets, blue sky concepts and full-color renderings are all work that can be produced with the technology in its current state.\n\nAccording to a survey of company executives commissioned by the Animation Guild and the Concept Art Association earlier this year, 78 percent of companies doing animation work will be \u201cearly adopters\u201d of generative AI in the next three years. Fifty-one percent of firms anticipate using the technology to create 3D assets, while 41 percent expect to employ it to generate 2D artwork. About one-third anticipate using generative AI in their productivity organization and management strategies, while one-quarter foresee using it to generate film and TV scripts.\n\nThe report states that entry-level positions will be most at risk for disruption, by consolidation or elimination in the near future. \u201cAI systems are likely to disproportionately affect those\n\nfrom less affluent backgrounds and underrepresented communities who have traditionally used these roles as a means toward economic mobility,\u201d the document adds.\n\nThe report arrives at a strategic point for the union, as the Animation Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers remain deadlocked on the issue of AI in their ongoing contract negotiations. The parties are set to return to the bargaining table Monday.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s report, the Animation Guild affirmed that tackling generative AI is its top priority in those talks. Per the union, an AI survey of its members conducted in March found that 100 percent of respondents supported adding provisions to the union contract barring the use of generative AI from displacing members\u2019 work. Eighty-seven percent sought to prohibit employers from using unionized work to train generative AI systems, while 75 percent wanted to institute staffing minimums and employment duration minimums to offset any job disruption caused by generative AI.\n\nBeyond fighting for strong contract provisions in this year\u2019s negotiations, the union\u2019s AI task force recommended responding to the advancement of generative AI by engaging legislators on the issue, advocating for animation tax incentives that favor human-created work, tracking possible regulation, launching awareness campaigns and considering how the courts will help shape the future of the technology.\n\n\u201cOur research highlights the potential risk that GenAI systems pose to animation workers, underscoring the need to be involved in discussions and decisions about GenAI to protect our rights and the integrity of our work,\u201d the task force stated in the conclusion to its document. Through the union\u2019s efforts at the bargaining table and beyond, the task force stated, \u201cTAG aims to ensure that the industry adapts to AI advancements without sacrificing the rights and jobs of its workers.\u201d"

        "article_content": "On Thursday, Google made Gemini Live, its voice-based AI chatbot feature, available for free to all Android users. The feature allows users to interact with Gemini through voice commands on their Android devices. That's notable because competitor OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode feature of ChatGPT, which is similar to Gemini Live, has not yet fully shipped.\n\nGoogle unveiled Gemini Live during its Pixel 9 launch event last month. Initially, the feature was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers, but now it's accessible to anyone using the Gemini app or its overlay on Android.\n\nGemini Live enables users to ask questions aloud and even interrupt the AI's responses mid-sentence. Users can choose from several voice options for Gemini's responses, adding a level of customization to the interaction.\n\nGemini suggests the following uses of the voice mode in its official help documents:\n\nTalk back and forth: Talk to Gemini without typing, and Gemini will respond back verbally.\n\nBrainstorm ideas out loud: Ask for a gift idea, to plan an event, or to make a business plan.\n\nExplore: Uncover more details about topics that interest you.\n\nPractice aloud: Rehearse for important moments in a more natural and conversational way.\n\nInterestingly, while OpenAI originally demoed its Advanced Voice Mode in May with the launch of GPT-4o, it has only shipped the feature to a limited number of users starting in late July. Some AI experts speculate that a wider rollout has been hampered by a lack of available computer power since the voice feature is presumably very compute-intensive.\n\nTo access Gemini Live, users can reportedly tap a new waveform icon in the bottom-right corner of the app or overlay. This action activates the microphone, allowing users to pose questions verbally. The interface includes options to \"hold\" Gemini's answer or \"end\" the conversation, giving users control over the flow of the interaction.\n\nCurrently, Gemini Live supports only English, but Google has announced plans to expand language support in the future. The company also intends to bring the feature to iOS devices, though no specific timeline has been provided for this expansion."

        "article_content": "TV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit in the Worcestershire attic of pop icon Toyah Willcox in Pershore on TV show Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted on Discovery\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai had a terrifying encounter with an 'evil spirit' in the attic of pop legend Toyah Willcox's Worcestershire home. The paranormal expert was left 'gasping for air' after being 'strangled' by a ghoul during filming for the new series of Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted. Ghai, along with his colleagues Ian Shaw and Jayne Harris, had set up a special 'REM' recording device at the historic Pershore residence of the 1980s singer for the popular TV show on Discovery+. Viewers will witness Ghai seemingly restrained while conducting an investigation in the attic. The team attempted to communicate with a ghost named 'George', believed to be a soldier from the English civil war in the 1600s. Willcox, who has experienced \"persistent paranormal activity\" since moving to the picturesque Worcestershire town two decades ago, signed up for the show. The punk pop icon, famous for hits like It's a Mystery, I Want To Be Free and Echo Beach, resides in a historic Georgian house with her guitarist husband Robert Fripp. During the ghost hunting visit, Ghai can be seen clutching his throat before hastily exiting the attic, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nTV ghost hunter Barri Ghai was filmed being 'strangled' by an evil spirit\n\nGhai recounted: \"Something just grabbed my windpipe. F**king scared the s**t out of me. I couldn't get breath in, that's what scared me.\" \"I thought I was gonna die. I actually thought I was going to die.\" This is what Barri Ghai, one of the nation's leading paranormal investigators, confessed after a chilling encounter during a haunted house visit. His colleague Harris urgently intervened, pleading with the unseen presence, \"Whoever's doing that, can you step away please? You do not have permission to do that. Step away from Barri.\"\n\nA paranormal team with Toyah in Pershore\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I couldn't breathe, I was actually really scared.\" The thrilling TV programme spotlights the expertise of three of Britains top ghost hunters: Ian Lawman, known for his skills as an exorcist and medium; Barri Ghai, who provides profound insights as a paranormal consultant; and Jayne Harris, a researcher and historian deeply immersed in paranormal lore.

Commentators were on edge when discussing the fifth episode shot in Pershore, with a spokesperson alluding to the gripping nature of Toyah's case on her website: \"To lend a helping hand, the team undergo one of their most terrifying investigations to date.\" What they unearth is staggering, connecting dots between an ancient medieval tragedy and the malicious ghost plaguing the property. Toyah, the seminal punk-pop starlet of the '80s, became enamoured with Pershore over twenty years ago, having been familiarised with it through holidays spent there with her family, a stark contrast to her urban Birmingham roots. Toyah Wilcox, the renowned singer, has lavished praise on Pershore, hailing it \"very friendly\" and \"one of the best places she's ever lived in the world\". Having spent her childhood weekends in the adjacent Wyre Piddle with her family, she became well-acquainted with the charm of the area.\n\nToyah Wilcox with her husband Robert Fripp"

The 2024 views show a dynamic volcano where, just decades ago, there was a featureless region.\n\n\"Our recent JunoCam images show many changes on Io, including this large, complicated volcanic feature that appears to have formed from nothing since 1997,\" Michael Ravine, the advanced projects manager at Malin Space Science Systems, which operates the spacecraft's JunoCam instrument, said in a statement. The discovery was just presented at the 2024 Europlanet Science Congress.\n\nProdigious amounts of lava have clearly poured from this new volcano; you can see it running to the left of the vent in two potent streams some 100 kilometers (62 miles) long. The lava, overlain over a map of the city of Berlin in another graphic below, would dominate a large swathe of Germany.

The first-ever observations of Io, captured by the pioneering Voyager 1 craft, spotted at least eight different active volcanoes. The most recent flybys in 2023 and early 2024 spotted nine plumes from volcanoes.\n\nIt's a vicious world, inhospitable to life. And beneath its volcanic surface, it may harbor a sea of magma."

        "article_content": "Artificial intelligence has been the topic of conversation in recent years, growing quickly in different sectors and making progress in solving difficult problems. AI is quickly creating value for many organizations through risk management, automation, reducing human error, analyzing large volumes of data, generating insights, etc. Through technological leaps and mass investment, AI has also become a reality and a key part in everyday life.\n\nAI has become more accessible to the general public through the use of well-known tools available for public consumption. For example, ChatGPT has become an extremely popular tool and a household name allowing users to do many things with it, such as analyzing reports, creating budgets, building virtual assistants, writing code, etc. The reliance on AI tools has had a significant impact on individual knowledge, livelihood and even personal health. AI tools have saved its users time and often money through immediate and creative solutions.\n\nAlthough AI is often spoken about, it is not always understood. At a high level, AI is a technology that enables machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity and autonomy. There are also different types of AI, such as reactive, general, super, limited, theory, etc. All include the ability to process large volumes of data very quickly.\n\nWhat is the relationship between AI and data?\n\nThe relationship between AI and data is crucial. AI relies heavily on data for operation and evolution. AI uses data to learn, improve and to make different predictions. The quality of the data has a significant impact on how the system learns and adapts. This is why data governance is essential in ensuring effective and even ethical use of AI.\n\nData governance looks at the data lifecycle management through availability, integrity and security of the data in enterprise systems. This also includes compliance with legal frameworks, such as data privacy laws and enabling ethical data practices through accountability, fairness and transparency.\n\nEffective data governance helps organizations mitigate potential risks, including producing flawed insights, generating biases and making wrong decisions. These further impact customer trust, overall reputation and could end up costing organizations a lot of money.\n\nAs organizations look to introduce AI into their environments, they need to shift their focus on their overall data foundation. What does their data governance and data strategy program look like? Is the data fit for purpose?\n\nOrganizations need to audit data sources to ensure accuracy and quality. Consider the sensitivity of the data and potential biases. Review security and privacy requirements, including global laws and industry best practices. Ensure transparency and accountability by documenting an audit trail and how the data will be used in the context of AI systems.\n\nShift the focus, and remember that it all starts and ends with data.\n\nEditor\u2019s note:Maria will share additional insights on this topic as a co-presenter at the session, \u201cData Governance for AI: It Starts and Ends with Data\u201d at ISACA 2024 Europe Conference, to take place 23-25 October in Dublin, Ireland."

        "article_content": "There\u2019s been a lot of talk about AI PCs this year. But so far, it\u2019s been a lot of hype \u2014 and not much else.\n\nI\u2019ve just returned from a trip to Berlin to see the best laptops at IFA powered by new chipsets from Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. Alongside many new products launching soon, I saw a concept highlighting a distant future for computers and a vision of how useful AI could actually be.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Lenovo AI Twist PC is a concept that allows you to open and close the lid with a simple voice command. Other notable features right now include being able to follow you around the room \u2014 ideal if you like to pace during a video call \u2014 taking a panorama of the room and syncing with a ballerina movie that showcases the flexibility of the unique hinge mechanism.\n\nFinally, this wasn\u2019t just another device with Copilot. No \u2014 it was a laptop that actually took the idea of AI seriously, built into the hardware itself. It was just a concept, but it certainly made me excited for the future of AI PCs.\n\nThe challenge for the mobility-impaired\n\nThe key feature on the Lenovo AI Twist PC that stood out was opening and closing the lid with a simple voice command. Millions of people have health conditions that impair mobility, and as some diseases develop over time, many will have used a laptop at one point in their lives.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced firsthand how useful a product with a voice-controlled hinge would be.\n\nImagine waking up one day and realizing it\u2019s now too painful to open a laptop lid, especially if it doesn\u2019t have an easy lip to grab onto. Beyond major health conditions, there are also incurable diseases such as arthritis that can make typing and simple actions like opening a laptop incredibly difficult. Over time, these conditions become progressively worse, and I\u2019ve seen firsthand how suddenly being unable to do things you used to can affect your mental health as well.\n\nFor all of these users, opening and closing your laptop with just your voice can provide a freedom that didn\u2019t exist before this concept. Windows and Mac have long provided accessibility and voice control features to help navigate the OS with your voice, but none have been able to affect the hardware, just the software once you are logged in. The Lenovo AI Twist PC shows that a voice-activated hinge could still be the solution that\u2019s needed.\n\nWhat else could you control with your voice?\n\nThe AI Twist PC is a limited proof of concept, and there are no guarantees that Lenovo will make this product a reality for anyone to buy. However, if they were to, what other features could you control with your voice, and what problems could it solve?\n\nFor the same people who have mobility issues, what about adjusting the position of the hinge? Instead of just saying, \u201cHey, Twist, open the lid,\u201d what if you could say, \u201cHey, Twist, open the lid for a video call,\u201d and it recognized the exact angle at which it needed to be opened? I\u2019ve previously had spinal fusion surgery, and for several months, simple actions like adjusting the lid of my MacBook proved to be quite painful.\n\nThe Follow feature is quite impressive as it takes a similar approach to features like Center Stage or Reframe in Google Meet in that it follows you around during a video call. Those features by Apple and Google crop sensors and adjust your positioning accordingly, but if they were to be paired with a hardware hinge with the flexibility of the Lenovo AI Twist PC, we could have the ideal solution for great video calls: hardware and software working in tandem for the best experience. This would prove beneficial for everyone, not just those with mobility impairments.\n\nThe challenges with a hardware-only approach\n\nThe success of Apple hardware has always been down to its integration with the software. With control over both parts, Apple can integrate features deeply to achieve specific goals. Lenovo has proven that it can do so \u2014 the Aura Edition announced at IFA in partnership with Intel is a great example of this \u2014 but to achieve a true voice-controlled computing future, Microsoft would need to build support directly into Windows.\n\nImagine a world where you say, \u201cHey, Twist, open,\u201d it opens the lid, adjusts the angle, and Windows Hello automatically logs you in. Perhaps we go further, and it knows that you have a video call, so it automatically launches Meet, Zoom, or Teams based on the calendar invite. The power of a movable hardware hinge is that it can enable an entirely new experience controlled by voice that could bring freedom to those without.\n\nNow imagine the same hinge but in a convertible product like the Yoga XYZ. If you have loved ones who live alone, a voice-controlled version of one of those products could enable you to be their remote support. Need help cooking? A quick voice command fires up a video call and flips the keyboard over so it\u2019s in tablet mode.\n\nThe same could apply to helping solve any task. Having experienced severe mobility issues after my spinal surgery and having dealt with elderly people who struggle to carry or adjust their positioning without enduring pain, the future of voice control has me truly excited about its potential impact in helping people. None of these are new use cases, but using a laptop instead of a tablet could be a unique solution.\n\nIs this the first step toward a voice-controlled AI PC in the future?\n\n\n\nMany concepts don\u2019t become viable products, but this time feels uniquely different. The hinge on the Lenovo AI Twist PC seemed to work fairly well, with strong flexibility in terms of movement and the ability to adjust the angle. The ballerina demo was a great example of how flexible this hinge is, and its mobility in following you around the room has applications that extend far beyond video calls.\n\nThe Lenovo AI Twist PC feels like a big step in the right direction. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen a company attempt something like this, and it has spurred me to think of all the different people it could have a marked impact upon. Whether it\u2019s an ongoing chronic condition or a freak occurrence that disrupts your life \u2014 like the PT visit that resulted in my spinal surgery \u2014 I\u2019ve experienced firsthand how useful a product with a voice-controlled hinge would be.\n\nThis concept was designed with very specific demos in mind. Even with two PCs playing the same video, each acted slightly differently regarding response time and fluidity. It\u2019s called a concept for a reason, but the best part of a concept is imagining how it could change our lives. Many concepts often lack clearly defined use cases \u2014 Motorola\u2019s phone as a watch concept at MWC is a good example \u2014 but the Lenovo AI Twist PC is different, as it\u2019s clear just how useful it could be.\n\nIt also shows that true artificial intelligence is about more than just creating funky graphics, removing objects, and editing to create a specific persona: When done right, AI could help the world embrace technology in new and wonderful ways. I long for a future where technology is truly intelligent, and the Lenovo AI Twist PC is a step toward making that future a reality."
