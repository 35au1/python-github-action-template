        "article_content": "Jimmy Kimmel. and Aaron Rodgers (Images Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAaron Rodgers has had his share of controversy. Despite being an absolute legend on the field, Rodgers has been quite vocal outside of the NFL realm as well. From admitting to spotting a UFO to making bold vaccination claims, Rodgers has always been in the news. One of his major feuds included the one he had with Jimmy Kimmel back in 2023.\n\nHere\u2019s everything that you need to know about the famous controversy.\n\nWhat Happened Between Jimmy Kimmel And Aaron Rodgers?\n\nIn a February 2023 episode of \u2018The Pat McAfee Show,\u2019 Rodgers discussed the incident of the US military taking down several unidentified aerial objects. However, otherwise known to be a UFO enthusiast, Rodgers did not seem interested. He insisted that the event was fabricated to take away focus from the Epstein client list.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Jeffrey Epstein has an alleged client list that reportedly visited his private island, Little Saint James. As a matter of fact, the island was notorious for allegedly abusing underage girls and several young women. Speaking about the same, Rodgers stated, \u201cThere\u2019s some files that have some names on it that might be getting released pretty soon.\u201d\n\nThis is the full timeline of the Jimmy Kimmel and Aaron Rodgers feud.\n\n\n\nI assumed Rodgers was trying to make a joke because he wasn\u2019t a fan of Kimmel\u2019s jokes about him.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Should Rodgers apologize or is Kimmel overreacting? pic.twitter.com/OmAclp8Eyb \u2014 Mike Ro \ud835\udd4f (@nuro_mike) January 3, 2024\n\nApparently, Jimmy Kimmel heavily criticized such a statement. Taunting the Green Bay Packers legend, Kimmel called him a \u2018tin foil hat.\u2019 This further escalated the situation, leading to further verbal back-and-forth between the two.\n\nWhat Did Aaron Rodgers Say To Jimmy Kimmel?\n\nFollowing Kimmel\u2019s taunt, Aaron Rodgers accused Kimmel of being on that dreaded list. Sparking a huge controversy, A-Rod said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, that are really hoping that doesn\u2019t come out.\u201d Such remarks further enraged Kimmel, who threatened to take legal action against the NFL star, while asking him to apologize.\n\nClick on \u2018Follow Us\u2019 and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google! Follow Us\n\nDisappointed by McAfee\u2019s approach!\n\n\n\nDisney/ESPN won.\n\n\n\nAaron Rodgers suspended from \"The Pat McAfee Show\" after his comments on Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n\n\nMcAfee said he was \"happy\" Rodgers wouldn't be back on the show because of the drama it caused.\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/xSZUSdHbfu \u2014 Patrick Bet-David (@patrickbetdavid) January 10, 2024\n\nAlthough Rodgers did not apologize, he did tone down his narrative against Jimmy Kimmel significantly. Rodgers said, \u201cI\u2019m glad that Jimmy is not on the list. I really am, and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s the P-word.\u201d Looking at Kimmel\u2019s reactions, another Packers star, David Bakhtiari, sided with A-Rod.\n\nTaking a dig at Kimmel, Bakhtiari wrote on X, \u201cTell me you\u2019re on the Jeffrey Epstein client list, without telling me you\u2019re on the Jeffrey Epstein client list\u2026.\u201d Thus, with the rumors doing the rounds for quite a while, things did return to normal. And as for now, the main controversy Rodgers is facing is his form. It will now be interesting to note whether he can get it back soon or not.\n\nAlso Read: NFC Team Shocks Everyone By Acquiring Jets QB Aaron Rodgers In Blockbuster Trade Proposal That Would Turn The NFL Upside Down"

        "article_content": "The LTSC edition of Windows adopts a lean, more stable approach. Windows 11 LTSC is now available with the third-version update, aka 24H2. However, it still maintains the simplistic design approach with the classic version of the system apps and outdated UI. AI, now the most precious thing for Microsoft, isn\u2019t included with Windows 11 LTSC.\n\nWindows Latest installed the latest version of the official Windows 11 LTSC ISO and then put it to test on a PC. The installation is smooth for the most part, except when it asks you to enter a work or school account. Note that Windows 11 LTSC is available for Enterprise users, so you cannot use a personal Microsoft account to set it up.\n\nBypassing the Work/School Account Requirement\n\nWe used a few techniques to bypass the work/school account requirement in Windows 11 LTSC. First, we tried the oobe\\bypassnro command, which used to work in previous versions of Windows 11. But its charm failed to deceive the setup, and we landed on the same page after the automatic restart.\n\nThen, we turned off the internet connection and tried again, but the account requirement page didn\u2019t let us pass. After that, we launched the command prompt using Shift + F10, opened Task Manager, and ended the Microsoft Account process. The screen flashed for a few seconds, and the much-awaited \u201cI don\u2019t have internet\u201d option appeared.\n\nWe proceeded with a local account setup. It didn\u2019t even ask us to set up security questions.\n\nOne thing that we liked about this was that there was no mention of adware, tracking, or promotional items on the OOBE page. It would be best if Microsoft adopted this approach for Windows 11 consumer editions (Pro and Home) as well, but we all know that it won\u2019t improve.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC is clean.\n\nAfter booting to the desktop, at first glance, it doesn\u2019t look like a simple, less-modern version. But when you open the Start menu, the difference becomes clear.\n\nThere are few system apps, unlike the clutter and promotions that you get with consumer editions. Windows 11 LTSC 2024 includes the new Outlook web app by default.\n\nWe checked a few system apps to verify if they have been updated. Most of them look like legacy apps from Windows 7, especially Snipping Tool and Paint. Microsoft is keeping the latest version of both these apps limited to Pro, Home and other editons.\n\n1 of 2\n\nThe new inbox apps multiple new features, like the background remover and layers in Paint and OCR in Snipping Tool.\n\nMicrosoft is making it challenging to customize Windows when the OS is not activated.\n\nIn Windows 11 24H2, most personalization options are locked, and it has patched the existing loopholes. For example, previously, you could apply a dark theme by clicking on the theme box, as shown in the image below. It doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nPreviously, some customization was available, but Microsoft really wants you to buy a license. This phenomenon is common in all editions of Windows 11.\n\nWindows 11 LTSC\u2019s File Explorer packs all the latest improvements. You can duplicate tabs; labels appear below commonly used actions, compressions formats support for TAR, and more. But the overall UI doesn\u2019t look as polished as the regular editions.\n\nHowever, LTSC promises a no-nonsense approach that doesn\u2019t overload the OS with newer features. So, users don\u2019t have to accustom themselves to unnecessary apps, design, or UI changes ship with each feature update. It doesn\u2019t include any AI component, so no Copilot app or any other bloatware.\n\nYou can still access Copilot via Edge, which is preinstalled in LTSC.\n\nMicrosoft Store isn\u2019t available, so you\u2019ll have to download the programs from the official sites and wait for updates to improve the system apps. We suggest trying it only if you don\u2019t need feature updates and the bugs that come with it and want a clean OS with a bare minimum of system apps.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of apps installed on our Windows 11 LTSC PC:"

He recalled, \u201cThere was a big mansion, it was dark, and the whole atmosphere felt eerie. Just before our shot, I was talking to someone when, out of nowhere, someone scratched me from behind! Triptii thought I was improvising or acting before the shot, but then I told her, \u2018No, someone actually scratched me.\u2019 But\u2026 there was no one behind us.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u2019 to cross Rs 100 crore mark within 3 days\n\nAccording to trade analyst Taran Adarsh, \u2018Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u2019 put on a solid show of strength on Saturday, which was an extension to the festive weekend. From metros to non-metros, and from multiplexes to single screens, the film continues its dream run. That being said, the horror-comedy is set to cross the Rs 100 crore mark within three days of its release. There is also a strong chance that the film might surpass the lifetime business of \u2018Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2\u2019 in the first week itself.\n\n\u2018Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u2019 is Kartik Aaryan's biggest opener\n\nDirected by Anees Bazmee, 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3' not only outperformed expectations but also marked a significant milestone in Aaryan's career, surpassing his previous best opener, 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2', which earned Rs 14.11 crore. This marks the third successful horror-comedy release of 2024, joining the ranks of 'Munjya' and 'Stree 2', setting a promising trend for more films in this genre in the future.\n\nSpeaking of 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3', it is the third installment in the popular 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa' franchise. The first part Bhool Bhulaiyaa, released in 2007, starred Akshay Kumar and Vidya Balan in the lead roles. The second part Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 (2022) starred Kartik Aaryan, Kiara Advani, and Tabu in the lead roles."

MANY people will have heard about the legend of the Enfield Poltergeist as it has featured in various articles and appeared in films. The claims derive from supposed supernatural activity at 284 Green Street - a council house. Still standing, the property sits in Enfield, London, and the alleged poltergeist activity took place between 1977 and 1979. Single mother, Peggy Hodgson, called the Metropolitan Police after experiencing suspicious activity, including hearing strange noises and witnessing furniture move on its own. Her daughters Janet, 11, and Margaret, 13, have spoken out about the events since. There is even a picture of Janet seemingly lifted off the ground. While she claims to have been hurled from her bed by a supernatural force, others have suggested the image could also be explained by her jumping. Over the 18 month period, thirty different witnesses are thought to have experienced some level of the activity, including neighbours, paranormal investigators and journalists.\n\nJeffrey Smith, 43, a painter who lives a few doors down, has described how the frustrating situation \u201cis definitely a nuisance\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cYeah, people are knocking on our door all the time, wanting to take pictures and ask questions.\n\n\u201cPeople are always knocking on her [284 Green Street] door, every five minutes and it\u2019s nothing to do with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying they\u2019re taking photos and they\u2019re in the way all the time.\n\n\u201cBefore the family moved in, people used to trash the house as it was abandoned for a long time.\n\n\u201cYou should come back at Halloween, it\u2019s always busy then but it\u2019s all year round now.\n\nI turned my tiny front garden into a spooky haunted house for Halloween - all you need is a \u00a3xx B&Q buy, people are obsessed\n\n\u201cBack in the days after the documentary we used to have buses filled with tourists because it\u2019s very very popular, but it\u2019s just a nightmare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most famous house in the world but it\u2019s really painful to see as it attracts crazy people at all hours of the day, which means my dog is barking at all hours, at two or three in the morning because these people want to park outside my house and take pictures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s constant but I just feel sorry for the people who live in the house, they\u2019re just living and don\u2019t have any peace.\u201d\n\nHas the Enfield house ever featured in a documentary? THE BBC released its first episode of Hauntings earlier this month with the series looking into various unexplained events. Presenting the story using recorded film and audio, the first installment was called The Enfield Poltergeist and looked to investigate the \"extraordinary events\" that occurred between 1977 and 1979. Following a police report in September 1977, officers attending the house could not find a reasonable explanation for furniture moving independently and tapping on the walls. Back in 2018, Sue MacGregor reunited a group of witnesses to \"paranormal events\" that occured at the council house in Enfield. The resulting conversation led to a 45 minute show being published on BBC's Radio 4 and even featured Janet and Margaret Hodgson, the two daughters at the centre of the case.\n\nAnother resident, Sharifa Wilson, 42, suggested the number of visitors has declined since the movie but that their behaviour has not changed.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 20 years and it\u2019s annoying but after a while you get used to it.\n\n\u201cAs the years progressed, people still drive past and slow down, I want to say something but you can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe lady that used to live there [284 Green Street], she lived there for years pretty much her whole childhood.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s left now, moved out with her kids and husband because they had people peering through windows.\n\n\u201cThe woman next door to me, she\u2019s lived here the longest and says it\u2019s rubbish but she can\u2019t move out, she\u2019s been here all her life.\n\n\u201cI did see a passerby stop and ask the current owner to give her a tour, they even offered her cash.\u201d\n\n13 Sharifa Wilson spoke of the frustrations she has living just a few doors down Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 The property is situated in the middle of the road, opposite a primary school Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Sun reporter Charlotte Bend went to investigate at the scene Credit: Louis Wood\n\nThe neighbour that Sharifa spoke of did not want to speak to the Sun for too long, tired from the activity and attention right outside her front door.\n\nShe explained: \u201cI don\u2019t want to highlight it anymore in the media than it already is.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say but I\u2019d rather just ignore it.\u201d\n\nOthers were happy to comment but wanted to remain anonymous out of the fear of complicating their relationship with neighbours in such close proximity.\n\nA mother and school worker who has lived on the street for nearly 20 years said she has met people visiting from \u201call over the world\u201d including China, Australia, America, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople drawing attention to the house, it\u2019s not good for the kids.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked the family that live there if they knew about the history before they moved.\n\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t know and now people knock on my door and people want to ask about the house.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, it\u2019s even at 1am in the morning, and it\u2019s anyone, not just kids.\n\n\u201cEven now, people slowing down when they\u2019re driving and they look.\n\n\u201cMy son once even let a woman in thinking I knew her. When I came downstairs thinking she was one of my Somali ladies, and I saw a white woman, I wondered why she was there.\n\n\u201cShe just sat there and I said I can\u2019t help you with information, people have children, they deserve their quiet private lives.\n\n\u201cBack when the film was released, it was really bad, you know like a tourist bus in central London.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how bad it was, and they were all photographing themselves outside.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just phone the police and ask them to move them on which is why the neighbours just won\u2019t open the door if they don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d\n\nWhat is The Conjuring 2? THE Conjuring 2 was a horror film released in 2016 and centred around the story of Peggy, and her four children. Much like the Enfield Poltergeist case, the single mum looks to investigators for help after her children report paranormal activity. Famed detectives, Ed and Lorraine Warren, that feature as characters in the film did visit the house in real life while the unexplained events took place. The film was directed by James Wan, an Australian filmmaker also known for Saw, Insidious, Aquaman and Malignant. The Conjuring 2 is known as The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case in the UK, and is the first sequel to The Conjuring, which was released in 2013.\n\nNear the semi-detached property that many have flocked to over the years, neighbours have made security their focus with one property boasting six CCTV cameras from the outside and black-out style curtains drawn across.\n\nMany others peered out of the corner of their front room window when having someone knock on their door - it was clear most were used to regular attention and shied away from it.\n\nSituated opposite a primary school, the busy main road does not particularly lend itself to a mass of fans hoping to park up and spend some time on the street.\n\nWhile the current inhabitants of the house were approached by the Sun, they very gently explained that they no longer talk to visitors or media.\n\nAnother man residing in a property nearby explained that he \"regularly\" saw \"people trying to peer through\" on \"a daily basis\".\n\nAnother told of how visitors \"don't just knock on our door\" but they \"ask us questions about the house\" and whether the story is true.\n\nHe added: \"We just have to tell them we don't know\".\n\nOthers refused to speak to us, with one woman living down the road exasperatedly noting: \"I am tired of this sh*t.\"\n\n13 Local residents were quick to explain how the situation worsened after the release of the film based on the property Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Tash Wilson lives further down the street and is still stopped by visitors, hoping to ask her questions Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Curtis Hart grew up being told about the property by his family Credit: Louis Wood\n\n13 Amir Hosaimi works in a pizza takeaway shop just round the corner Credit: Louis Wood\n\nTash Wilson, a 24-year-old working in admin for HMRC, explained how she thinks the attention will \"start again\" this week \"because it's Halloween\".\n\nShe said: \"I've had a few people ask me where it was but I've not actually known as I don't like scary films so I haven't watched it.\n\n\"But it's crazy that it's just there, someone's actually living there.\n\n\"Last time someone asked me where it was, I actually didn't know where to direct them as I live further down.\"\n\nCurtis Hart, a local builder who has lived in the area his whole life, told of how his mum used to explain the folklore surrounding the former council house years before any filming took place.\n\nLocal business owners were also keen to talk after regularly meeting lost or inquisitive tourists heading inside to ask questions.\n\nAmir Hosaimi, who works at a Pizza takeaway store just around the corner of the street, explained how he \"sees people every day\" and so it is \"not even worse on Halloween\".\n\nHe said: \"It's every afternoon, I see the cars parked up and they're stood there taking pictures.\n\n\"Always different people, every day from all around the world.\n\n\"It's mostly young people, many many students and sometimes they come to the shop to ask questions but I can only tell them to watch the movie.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about it in the area, even when you go for a coffee somewhere you'll always hear someone talking about it.\n\n\"I think lots of old neighbours know the story about the house and they like talking about it but others ignore it.\"\n\nHas the Enfield Poltergeist ever been proven false? ALTHOUGH there has never been anything proven or discounted officially, one expert revealed the case could be a hoax. Psychology professor, Chris French, explained five reasons to TimeOut in 2016. The girls \"admitted they faked\" some of the activity Janet's photo where she can be seen levitating above her bed could be explained by jumping Bill, the old man who possessed Janet, was obsessed with periods and Chris believes a young girl would be more likely to be interested on this Eyewitnesses can be incredibly unreliable According to Chris, there are other cases of schoolgirl pranks that have gotten out of hand\n\nAnother resident explained how it must be \"terrible for the people that live\" at the house itself.\n\nHe has seen people \"going round the back\" looking for \"other ways in\".\n\nMore recently, he told of spotting three people staring at the house trying to convince each other to go and knock on the door.\n\nHe continued: \"We've had people ask us about the house, most of them will just stand around and stare at it or take pictures in front of the thing.\n\n\"It's a regular thing, I mean a couple weeks ago there were two groups sitting out on blankets with candles around them and all sorts.\n\n\"I presume to protect themselves from whatever.\n\n\"We don't talk about it with the people who live there though, we have always known the people involved over there as neighbours and if they spoke to us about it they spoke to us about it but we never asked questions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a couple who parked their car in front of the house got out to take pictures and admire the exterior of the property.\n\nNicos Aoennou, 53, told the Sun how they regularly visit and even stay in places believed to be haunted.\n\nOther spooky places in the UK Pendle Hill - A hill in England that is believed to be the most haunted place in the UK. It is the burial site of the twelve Pendle Witches who were hanged in 1612. Tower of London - A popular historic attraction in London that is also considered one of the most haunted places in the UK. The tower has a dark history of torture, imprisonment, and execution. Chillingham Castle - A 13th-century fortress in Northumberland that is said to be home to many ghosts and ghouls. Berry Pomeroy Castle - A castle in Devon that is said to be haunted by the Blue Lady and the White Lady. Blickling Hall - A grand hall in Norwich that was once home to the Boleyn family and is said to be one of the most haunted houses in Britain. Hampton Court Palace - A palace in England that is known for being one of the most haunted attractions in the UK.\n\nThey have explored castles and hotels which claim to be inhabited by ghosts and spirits.\n\nTwo weeks out from undergoing a hip operation, Kate Fortune, 50, explained how attractions like this make for the perfect activity to fill some time while braving her new set of crutches under each arm.\n\nShe said: \"We like to find haunted places and go to stuff like this all the time.\n\n\"It's just to get out for a bit and I am quite open minded to stuff like ghosts - although apparently there's no haunting there anymore.\n\n\"I find it really interesting and I've always loved history, and so that comes with it.\"\n\nKate even spoke of an experience when she was younger where she believes to have seen a ghost.\n\nIt freaked her out so much at the time that she ran down a set of stairs and broke her ankle.\n\nDespite this, she \"loves haunted stuff\", including films, saying \"there's not enough of them\".\n\nShe added: \"Nothing bad has happened to me but I don't quite know how I'd be if there was a poltergeist flying around the house, that would freak me out.\"\n\nExplaining how the pair discovered the property, Nicos added: \"I used to drive past every day as I lived locally but I wasn't taking it in, to be honest.\n\n\"Then she mentioned she wanted to go and I said I'd take her down.\n\n\"I've watched the film and all that stuff so knew it was here.\"\n\nI photographed that terrifying snap of the Enfield Haunting - I thought it was nonsense until chilling moment GRAHAM Morris was a sceptical photographer when he was sent down to snap the apparent haunted family home in Enfield. He previously told the Sun that he \"initially thought it was going to be a load of rubbish\" when he was on his way to 284 Green Street in North London. At the height of the so-called supernatural activity, Graham was in his twenties and headed to the location with a reporter. He said: \"The children came in one after the other with adults but nothing happened until Janet walked in. \"It was unbelievable - things were just flying all over the room. Little things like toys, marbles, and Lego bricks. I tried to get a picture of something flying across the room, but everything was moving so fast. \"You couldn't pre-empt where the next object would come flying from. It was coming in from all angles. \"I was hit in the eyebrow, and although it didn't draw blood, I got one hell of a lump. Whatever this was, you had the feeling that it was out to get you. \"It didn't like the fact that I was taking pictures. I could see the fear on the family's face.\"\n\n13 The history of the property has attracted tourists from all over the world including China, Australia and America Credit: Louis Wood"

        "article_content": "Evolution has always been seen as a complex, random, and unpredictable process, shaping life on Earth in ways we could hardly anticipate.\n\nBut what if there\u2019s more order to it than chaos? That\u2019s exactly what a team of scientists is suggesting in a new study.\n\nThis research, led by Professor James McInerney and Dr. Alan Beavan from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham, hints that evolution might not be as random as we\u2019ve long thought.\n\nTheir research could have big implications for tackling issues like antibiotic resistance, diseases, and even climate change.\n\nEvolution, genes, and the pangenome\n\nSo, what\u2019s this all about? The team analyzed the pangenome \u2014 the complete set of genes within a species \u2014 to see if evolution follows any predictable paths.\n\nThey wanted to know: Is evolution just a series of accidents, or is there a pattern influenced by a genome\u2019s history?\n\nWhat is the pangenome?\n\nIn simple terms, the pangenome is the complete set of all genes found within a species.\n\nIt includes every gene present in all the different strains or individuals, covering both the common genes shared by everyone (the core genome) and the unique ones found only in some (the accessory genome).\n\nSo even though individual members might have different genetic makeups, the pangenome represents the full genetic diversity that the species has.\n\nAnalyzing the pangenome allows researchers to identify which genes are essential for survival and which ones offer specific advantages, opening up possibilities for new medical and environmental applications.\n\nBig computing power required\n\nThe team used a machine learning approach called Random Forest to sift through a massive dataset of 2,500 complete genomes from a single bacterial species.\n\nMachine learning algorithms like this are great at finding patterns that might be too complex or subtle for humans to detect on their own.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a quick job \u2014 it took several hundred thousand hours of computer processing.\n\nEvolution and \u201cgene families\u201d\n\nFirst up, they created \u201cgene families\u201d from each gene in every genome. \u201cIn this way, we could compare like-with-like across the genomes,\u201d explained Dr. Maria Rosa Domingo-Sananes from Nottingham Trent University.\n\nOnce they had these families sorted out, they focused on the genes and gene families inside the genomes.\n\n\u201cWe found that some gene families never turned up in a genome when a particular other gene family was already there,\u201d said Dr. Domingo-Sananes.\n\n\u201cAnd on other occasions, some genes were very much dependent on a different gene family being present.\u201d\n\nHidden gene ecosystem driving evolution\n\nIn other words, they discovered an invisible ecosystem where genes either get along or clash with each other, making evolution predictable.\n\n\u201cThese interactions between genes make aspects of evolution somewhat predictable and furthermore, we now have a tool that allows us to make those predictions,\u201d added Dr. Domingo-Sananes.\n\nA paradigm shift\n\nProfessor McInerney, the lead author of the study, is excited about the possibilities, to say the least.\n\n\u201cThe implications of this research are nothing short of revolutionary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy demonstrating that evolution is not as random as we once thought, we\u2019ve opened the door to an array of possibilities in synthetic biology, medicine, and environmental science.\u201d\n\nReal-world applications\n\nThis research isn\u2019t just about understanding evolution for curiosity\u2019s sake. It has real-world implications that could affect our lives in significant ways.\n\nBut how could this affect us in practical terms?\n\n\u201cFrom this work, we can begin to explore which genes \u2018support\u2019 an antibiotic resistance gene, for example,\u201d Dr. Beaven explained.\n\n\u201cTherefore, if we are trying to eliminate antibiotic resistance, we can target not just the focal gene, but we can also target its supporting genes.\u201d\n\nFighting antibiotic resistance\n\nThis approach could be a game-changer in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nBy understanding the network of genes that work together, scientists could develop more effective treatments.\n\n\u201cWe can use this approach to synthesize new kinds of genetic constructs that could be used to develop new drugs or vaccines,\u201d Dr. Beavan continued.\n\n\u201cKnowing what we now know has opened the door to a whole host of other discoveries.\u201d\n\nImplications for climate change\n\nThe study\u2019s insights might also help in the fight against climate change.\n\nBy engineering microorganisms that can capture carbon or break down pollutants, we could develop new tools to reduce our environmental footprint.\n\nAdvancing personalized medicine\n\nThe predictability of gene interactions could also revolutionize personalized medicine.\n\nImagine doctors being able to predict how a disease might progress in your body based on your genetic makeup, or which treatments would be most effective for you.\n\nThis research could bring us one step closer to that reality.\n\nEvolution, gene manipulation, and the future\n\nTo sum it all up, this new research is shaking up how we think about evolution. Instead of seeing it as a series of random events, the study suggests there\u2019s a level of predictability influenced by gene families and genetic history.\n\nThis is obviously a very big deal for many other reasons besides the fact that it upends everything we thought we knew about evolution since Charles Darwin burst onto the scene.\n\nThis discovery means that we might be able to anticipate and even guide evolutionary changes in ways we never thought possible.\n\nThe practical applications are vast. From developing new strategies to combat antibiotic resistance to engineering organisms that can help fight climate change, the possibilities are exciting.\n\nThe idea that we can target not just harmful genes but also their \u201csupporting cast\u201d opens up new avenues in medicine and environmental science.\n\nOverall, this study invites us to rethink some fundamental assumptions about life and evolution. It\u2019s not just about chance anymore; there\u2019s a pattern and order we can tap into.\n\nAs we learn more, who knows what other doors might open? It\u2019s an exciting time to be alive, and an exciting time to be a scientist.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

With inconsistent play and a heavily scrutinized self-substitution, second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson is benched for now.\n\nHowever, my focus for the best bet right now is on the Vikings sideline. I like Sam Darnold to go over his 20.5 completions line (-120 at FanDuel).\n\nThis Colts defense has allowed over 20 completions to every starting quarterback they\u2019ve faced except for Will Levis. The other four, much more established starters, passed that total easily.\n\nCombine that with the fact that Joe Flacco\u2019s gunslinging ways could create a shootout, and the opportunities to throw should be there all night for Darnold."

        "article_content": "Orange County\u2019s fastest growing public companies are a diverse mix of real estate, biotech, software and hospitality industries. The 25 fastest-growing public companies headquartered in Orange County based on revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 generated $33.6 billion in revenue combined for 2023 \u2013 that\u2019s an increase of 27% from the $26.5 billion reported for 2022.\n\nFive Point Leads\n\nThe fastest growing public company headquartered in Orange County is Five Point Holdings LLC, an owner and developer of residential mixed-use developments in Orange County, Los Angeles County and San Francisco. The Irvine-based company reported revenue of $212 million in 2023, up by 396% from 2022. Revenues were primarily generated from land sales at its Valencia site, where it closed the sale of land entitled for an aggregate of 729 homesites on approximately 72 acres for $162.4 million. In total, Five Point communities are designed to include approximately 40,000 residential homes and approximately 23 million square feet of commercial space.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor the market and interest rates; however, we believe that the ongoing housing supply shortage will help sustain strong demand for our land,\u201d said Dan Hedigan, Five Point chief executive, in a statement.\n\nNext-Level Automotive\n\nElectric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive Inc. was the second-fastest-growing company with $4.43 billion in revenue last year, up 167% from the prior year. The Irvine-based automaker produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, which more than doubled the totals from 2022. However, growth for 2024 was tempered due to higher interest rates and the company projects to match vehicle production from 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Rivian unveiled the newest version of its inventory. The midsize platform underpins R2, R3 and R3X vehicles. Pricing for R2 is expected to start around $45,000, and R3 will be priced below R2 with deliveries expected in 2026.\n\n\u201cOur design and engineering teams are extremely focused on driving innovation into not only the product features but also our approach to manufacturing to achieve dramatically lower costs,\u201d said Rivian founder and chief executive RJ Scaringe, in a statement.\n\nBiotech Growth\n\nBiotech, pharmaceutical and medical device companies account for six of the top 10 fastest-growing public companies headquartered in Orange County. RxSight Inc., an ophthalmic medical device company based in Aliso Viejo, had its initial public offering in 2021 and recently raised an additional $115 million through a secondary public offering that closed in May. The company is dedicated to providing customized vision to patients following cataract surgery.\n\nAxonics Inc., a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated devices to treat urinary and bowel dysfunction, announced plans to be acquired by Boston Scientific Corp. in January for $3.7 billion. This deal had not yet closed as of print time, because the Federal Trade Commission has asked for additional information during the acquisition review process.\n\n"
