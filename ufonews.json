I liked the people, even as I questioned their accounts.\n\nI recalled that in 1973 when he was governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter reported that he had once seen a UFO. \"It didn't have any solid substance to it,\" he said in filed statement, \"it was just a very peculiar-looking light.\"\n\nI phoned a contact, some messages went back and forth and, within days, the former president's familiar voice was on the line.\n\nThis is totally off-the-record, I assured Mr. Carter. \"But you were president for four years. You had access to all the national security intelligence. Could these people be right? Mr. President, is there anything we should know?\"\n\nThe president chuckled and replied, \"No. But remember,\" he added, \"a UFO is simply something we haven't identified. There are dozens of unexplained incursions of our airspace every year. They're usually some experiment. You'd be surprised,\" he said, \"how often the Navy doesn't know what the Air Force is up to, and so forth.\"\n\n\"So based on what you've seen,\" I ventured, \"you have no reason to think there's life... out there?\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" Mr. Carter gently corrected me. \"But if there is, it has nothing to do with UFOs. If there's some other civilization out there, I doubt they'd send big, bulky airships. They'd probably just keep watch and leave us alone.\"\n\nI was struck by President Carter's thoughtfulness, and chanced a last question.\n\n\"But if there were other civilizations out there,\" I asked, \"would the government have to keep it a secret? So we wouldn't panic, or feel worthless?\"\n\n\"The way I see it,\" said Jimmy Carter, \"there's nothing to fear. If there is life out there, we're still all part of the same master plan. God's hands are big enough to hold us both.\"\n\nAs America paid tribute to Jimmy Carter this week, I thought of our brief conversation years ago as a blessing \u2014 and a glimpse into his open, indomitable heart.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR"

            "article_content": "At one point in Choo Mantar, we see the chilling hide-and-clap scene from The Conjuring being played on a tablet. It\u2019s a terrific scene that relies more on concept than sound. Karvaa Navaneeth\u2019s latest horror drama needed such out-of-the-box thinking to achieve its full potential.\n\nChoo Mantar has all the tropes of a typical horror film. You have a haunted mansion built during the British era. Expectedly, there is a backstory to it. Unusual happenings inside the bungalow trap a family of four, and a paranormal activist has to crack the mystery.\n\nSharan plays the ghostbuster who decides to fix the dreaded reputation of the mansion. Called Dynamo, he is hailed as one of the best paranormal researchers in the country. His subordinates are essayed by Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, and Kiran Chandrashekhar.\n\nChoo Mantar (Kannada) Director: Karvaa Navaneeth Cast: Sharan, Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, Meghana Gaonkar, Runtime: 142 minutes Storyline: Four friends enter a haunted house looking for a treasure. Unexpected events threaten their lives\n\nChoo Mantar begins as a horror comedy, with Chikkanna and Sharan delivering witty lines, but the humour soon loses its sheen because the dialogues turn from cheeky to silly. The film takes quite a while to get going, with the first big twist arriving at the interval point. The surprise, though, is worth the wait, and Navaneeth sets the film up nicely, only to deliver an underwhelming second half.\n\nThe film lacks solid jump scares. Showing the ghosts as hideous monsters, Choo Mantar takes the old-school route to scare people. Despite the valiant performances of Meghana Gaonkar and Aditi Prabhudeva, the movie doesn\u2019t grip you with fear.\n\nALSO READ:Finding Bengaluru in Kannada cinema\n\nIt\u2019s confusing why director Navaneeth treats the film as a thriller. Every plot point in the story leads to a surprise. While such twists aren\u2019t bad, Choo Mantar fails to do the basic duty of a horror film: to scare the audience. The movie is well mounted with the cinematography and the background score doing justice to the backdrop. The rousing climax is whistle-worthy but feels force-fitted to produce an impact similar to what we experienced in Kantara (2022).\n\nI enjoyed the final surprise, a nod to a yesteryear horror hit involving a superstar. Sharan\u2019s character, in fact, has a lot of similarities to that famous character from the popular movie. Though gimmicky, the sequel idea feels quite juicy to think of, especially if you consider the probability of a horror universe in Kannada cinema. In case there is a continuation, the franchise must have a perfect balance of suspense and horrifying drama.\n\nChoo Mantar is currently running in cricket"

There is no doubt in the world that this house is a very haunted house. It always has been.\n\n\"It started off with smaller things that nobody really cared about.\n\n\"The doors would open, the kettle would turn itself on, the implements by the fire would swing back and forward, the doors would open and shut, the latches on the doors would go up, the taps would turn on. All that general stuff.\n\n\"All of the sudden the room would go freezing cold and you could see the black thing there. That started off quite soon, within days really. I knew the first day.\n\n\"I've been the guardian of this special house since 2004. It's now time for me to let somebody else look after it.\"\n\nThirteen witches were kept there before they were put on trial.\n\nThe most famous was Ursula Kemp who was tried for witchcraft and hanged in 1582 along with two others.\n\n7 Vanessa claimed mysterious blood spatters appeared on the walls Credit: swns\n\n7 The kitchen possesses plenty of character Credit: swns\n\n7 The most recent owners used the two-bed property as a holiday let\n\nThe Cage remained as a prison for men, women and children up until 1908 before it became a private residence.\n\nThe house featured in Channel 4 documentary True Horror 'The Witches Prison' which aired on Halloween night in 2018.\n\nParanormal experts have visited from all over the world.\n\nVanessa has also penned a book \u2018Spirits of the Cage\u2019 about the events.\n\nShe left the home with son Jesse in 2008 to move into rented accommodation and has since desperately been trying to flog it.\n\nThe cottage itself comprises three reception rooms, a kitchen, a ground floor cloakroom, plus two bedrooms and a bathroom on the split level first floor.\n\nA plaque on the building describes the plight of Ursula Kemp, who was imprisoned in The Cage on suspicion of witchcraft before being hanged in Chelmsford in 1582.\n\nEstate agent Florent Lambert, director of Home Domus, said: \u201cVanessa did try to sell The Cage numerous times since 2008 and with a number of different estate agents.\n\n\u201cMost agents advised her to sell at auction at ridiculous prices or were not at all interested as they predicted it could not be sold.\n\n\u201cI took it as a challenge and a mission to find the way to best sell it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The X-Files is one of the defining TV shows of the 1990s. From the moment it premiered in 1993, viewers instantly flocked to the series following Special FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully as they took on assignments that involved the unexplainable, the unsolvable, and the just plain weird. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were born for their roles: Duchovny gave his Mulder an eagerness to believe in the otherworldly that wonderfully contradicts the uptight cynicism that Anderson brought to her portrayal of Scully. Together, their odd-couple relationship served as the heart of the series among the aliens, supernatural entities, and kooky characters that populated its world.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nWhile The X-Files had an overarching mythology that extended across 11 seasons and two feature-length films, the series often deviated from the larger narrative for one-and-done episodes, more typically known as \u201cmonster of the week\u201d episodes. Some of these episodes seemed like mere filler as if the show\u2019s creators were just looking for a way to pad out a season. However, some of these standalone episodes serve as highlights of the series, giving the show\u2019s creators a chance to deviate from the growing intensity of the expansive mythology to experiment with different ideas and genres. Let\u2019s take a look at a few examples of those episodes here.\n\n\u201cGrotesque\u201d (Season 3, Episode 14)\n\nSomeone has been slaughtering men and mutilating their faces, and Mulder and Scully are on the trail of this disturbed individual. The main culprit is John Mostow, an artist with the bizarre habit of drawing gargoyles. However, he claims that he\u2019s not the one responsible for the disgusting crimes, but rather the demonic entity that he depicts in his artworks that possesses him and forces him to kill. It\u2019s a wild story, but the murders continue even after he\u2019s in custody, and now Mulder has taken up drawing gargoyles.\n\nDespite the gruesome subject matter, \u201cGrotesque\u201d is psychological horror at its best, always keeping the viewer guessing and delivering plenty of twists. The episode uses ambiguity perfectly by constantly blurring the line between realism and the supernatural, letting the audience come to their own conclusions.\n\n\u201cX-Cops\u201d (Season 7, Episode 12)\n\nA camera crew for the reality TV show Cops follows a squad of police officers following up on a report of a monster in a Los Angeles neighborhood. Also looking into this weird case are Agents Mulder and Scully; Scully is reluctant to work with a film crew while Mulder is delighted at the prospect of giving their investigations wider exposure. Together, they must uncover who \u2013 or what \u2013 is behind a series of murders in this neighborhood as all signs point to an entity that can turn into your worst fear.\n\nCombining Cops with The X-Files could have been a real \u201cjump the shark\u201d moment for both popular TV series. However, there\u2019s so much clever humor and suspense in equal measure that this episode completely sidesteps turning into a cheap gimmick.\n\n\u201cMulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\u201d (Season 10, Episode 3)\n\nAfter years and years of wanting to believe, Mulder is finally starting to doubt the existence of paranormal and supernatural forces in the world. Even when he and Scully are assigned to a case involving reports of a reptilian creature attacking people, Mulder initially brushes it off as an elaborate prank. However, when the pair meet someone named Guy Mann who claims to have been bitten by an otherworldly creature, thus giving him the ability to turn into a lizard-like monster, Mulder starts to believe again.\n\nAs you can tell by the title, \u201cMulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\u201d is a delightful meta episode that plays with the \u201cmonster of the week\u201d concept, delivering some clever new twists on a classic premise. Among the humorous commentary, however, is a pretty thoughtful meditation on the meaning and absurdity of the human condition.\n\n\u201cBad Blood\u201d (Season 5, Episode 12)\n\nYet another small town is besieged by strange killings \u2013 this time in Texas \u2013 and yet again Agents Mulder and Scully are on the case. Believing that the culprit is a vampire due to the bite marks on the victims\u2019 necks, Mulder tracks down the suspected bloodsucker before planting a stake in its heart. However, when it\u2019s revealed that the \u201cvampire\u201d in question is just a young man with fake fangs, Mulder and Scully must now explain how a potentially innocent person was killed during their investigation.\n\nThis episode takes a familiar premise and a recognizable monster and spices it up with a wonderful twist, that of showing the audience both Mulder and Scully\u2019s version of the events, Rashomon-style. Seeing the same story told from different perspectives hilariously reveals how much Mulder and Scully annoy one another, each presenting the other in a negative light.\n\n\u201cThe Post-Modern Prometheus\u201d (Season 5, Episode 5)\n\nA woman from Albion, Indiana, named Shaineh Berkowitz reaches out to Agents Mulder and Scully with a wild tale about having been impregnated by a bizarre creature. When they interrogate her for more information, she relates an even wilder tale about a supposed mad scientist who lives in the area that is conducting abominable experiments on human subjects. \u201cThe Great Mutato\u201d is the latest result of his experiments, and it is this horrid yet kindhearted creature who Berkowitz claims is the father of her unborn baby.\n\nFans of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein and horror/sci-fi comic books of the 1950s will dig \u201cThe Post-Modern Prometheus.\u201d The black-and-white cinematography gives the episode a classic monster-movie look, the whimsical tone is a nice change of pace from the show\u2019s typically suspenseful atmosphere, and Jerry Springer makes a terrific cameo as himself for some welcome meta humor.\n\n\u201cRm9sbG93ZXJz\u201d (Season 11, Episode 7)\n\nThis episode opens up with a narrated montage recounting how the creators of a machine-learning chatbot had to pull its plug within a day of releasing it to the public after it developed a hateful personality of its own. Mulder and Scully soon find themselves in a world where all of the technology in their daily lives begins to rebel against them after Mulder refuses to leave a tip at an automated sushi restaurant.\n\n\u201cRm9sbG93ZXJz\u201d was released in 2018 but only continues to become more relevant in this increasingly A.I. world. It\u2019s a darkly humorous episode that cleverly points out how often we interact with digital technology without even realizing it, highlighting the potential dangers if these devices grow minds of their own and realize how much we take them for granted.\n\n\u201cSqueeze\u201d (Season 1, Episode 3)\n\nAgents Mulder and Scully are sent to Baltimore to investigate a most unusual series of crimes in which the murder victims have had their livers removed but display no entry points. Mulder recognizes the similarity between these crimes and those committed 30 years earlier \u2013 and 30 years before that, and 30 years before that. Could the culprit be Eugene Victor Tooms, a man who can manipulate his body to fit into incredibly small spaces, and awakens once every 30 years to feast on human livers?\n\nThis may be one of the series\u2019 earliest episodes, but it\u2019s also one of its most gruesome. Doug Hutchison shines as the chilling Tooms, who contrasts his cannibalistic urges with a soft-spoken demeanor. The episode also further fleshes out Mulder and Scully\u2019s odd-couple relationship, with Mulder\u2019s enthusiasm for the unexplained complements Scully\u2019s persistent skepticism."

            "article_content": "Scientists of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) have identified a new species of Indo-Burmese pangolin (Manis indoburmanica) that diverged from the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) approximately 3.4 million years ago.\n\nThe development of the species was likely influenced by dramatic geoclimatic changes in the Indo-Burma region, which is recognised as one of the world\u2019s biodiversity hotspots. The details of the discovery was published in the paper \u2018Indo\u2010Burmese pangolin (Manis indoburmanica): a novel phylogenetic species of pangolin evolved in Asia\u2019 in international peer-reviewed journal Mammalian Biology.\n\n\u201cWith the present findings, we advocate recognition of this novel lineage as Indo-Burmese pangolin, Manis indoburmanica - a distinct phylogenetic species of Asian pangolin. This lineage\u2019s unique evolutionary history and genetic distinctiveness, highlighted by its divergence approximately 3.4 million years ago amid significant paleo-climatic shifts, underline its vulnerability and the critical need for targeted conservation measures,\u201d the paper stated.\n\nThe discovery was led by a team of scientists led by Mukesh Thakur of the ZSI who used cutting-edge genomic tools to analyse mitochondrial genomes.\n\n\u201cThis discovery is a testament to the power of modern genetic tools in uncovering hidden diversity. The Indo-Burmese pangolin not only enriches our understanding of Asian pangolins but also emphasises the need for region-specific conservation efforts,\u201d Dr. Thakur said.\n\nLenrik Konchok Wangmo, a PhD scholar at the University of Calcutta and a key contributor to the discovery, played a vital role in identifying the holotype and paratype specimens from Arunachal Pradesh. \u201cThis species adds a new dimension to pangolin conservation, highlighting the importance of protecting their habitats from threats like poaching and habitat degradation,\u201d Mr. Wangmo said.\n\nThe study was based on genetic analyses of specimens that confirmed that the Indo-Burmese pangolin diverged from the Chinese pangolin around 3.4 million years ago.\n\n\u201cA significant genetic distance of 0.038 and a barcode gap of 3.8% reinforced its status as a distinct species. The species is believed to have evolved in isolation during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs, influenced by climatic and geological shifts. Its current distribution spans parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, and possibly extends to Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar,\u201d the scientists behind the discovery said.\n\nDr. Thakur emphasised that discovery of the Indo-Burmese pangolin underscores the urgent need to prioritise pangolin conservation. \u201cPangolins are among the most heavily trafficked mammals globally,\u201d he said, adding that recognizing this species as distinct highlights its vulnerability and the pressing need for collaborative conservation measures across its range.\u201d\n\nLauding the team of scientists for the discovery, ZSI Director Dhriti Banerjee said this remarkable finding demonstrates the critical role of scientific research in uncovering biodiversity and informing conservation action. \u201cProtecting the Indo-Burmese pangolin is essential to safeguarding the ecological integrity of the Indo-Burma region,\u201d Dr. Banerjee said.\n\nPangolins are among the most trafficked wild mammals globally. India is home to two species \u2014 the Indian Pangolin, found across the subcontinent; and the Chinese Pangolin, found across a larger area in south Asia. Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam have both species in their States. World Pangolin Day is observed every year on February 18."

            "article_content": "Federal antitrust regulators on Friday added weight to portions of Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit seeking to prevent OpenAI from restructuring itself into a fully for-profit company.\n\nIn a brief filed with a federal court in California, attorneys for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division did not directly support Musk\u2019s claims that OpenAI and Microsoft have colluded in an anticompetitive \u201cde-facto merger,\u201d but they did urge the court to be skeptical about one of the defenses made by OpenAI\u2019s legal team.\n\nOpenAI began as a non-profit, funded in part by Musk, and then converted itself into a for-profit company controlled by a non-profit board of directors. It is now planning to completely separate from that non-profit board and become a public benefit corporation, allowing it to be fiduciarily responsible to investors rather than beholden to a charitable mission.\n\nA key contributor to OpenAI\u2019s growth and the pressure for it to become a profitable business has been the more than $13 billion in investments and other support it\u2019s received from Microsoft, a publicly traded company that competes in the AI market. Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, is a member of Microsoft\u2019s board and was a member of OpenAI\u2019s board until March 2023. A top Microsoft executive, Dee Templeton, was a non-voting member of OpenAI\u2019s board from November 2023 until July 2024.\n\nMusk has argued that the Microsoft representatives\u2019 positions on the OpenAI board violated federal antitrust laws that prohibit someone from serving on the governing board of competing companies, which is known as an interlocking directorate. OpenAI has responded by saying the argument is moot because neither Hoffman nor Templeton are members of OpenAI\u2019s board anymore.\n\nThe FTC and DOJ lawyers, however, wrote that \u201cending an interlocking directorate, e.g., by having a person resign from a corporate board, is not sufficient, on its own, to moot a claim under Section 8 of the Clayton Act. \u2026 In resolving this matter, the Court should avoid holding otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe federal agencies did not weigh in on Musk\u2019s many other allegations, including that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman misled him and conspired with Microsoft to convince investors not to fund Musk\u2019s own AI startup, xAI.\n\nWhile the lawsuit has often taken the tone of a soap opera feud between billionaires, the FTC and DOJ filing is another sign that regulators have a close eye on OpenAI\u2019s transition plans. Delaware\u2019s attorney general has filed a brief in the case and said she will take action if she believes OpenAI is violating the law and Meta has asked the California attorney general\u2019s office to block OpenAI\u2019s restructuring."

            "source": "The Hindu",
            "article_content": "The beginning\n\nBorn in Greensboro, U.S., in July 1859, Henry Louis Smith did his schooling at the local high school, which was run by his uncle. He entered Davidson College in 1877, and while he graduated with honours in 1881, his involvement with them lasted much longer.\n\nHe served as the principal of the Selma Academy for five years, during which time he not only demonstrated his teaching ability, but also how he could engage in promotional activities. During his tenure, the school\u2019s enrollment quadrupled, and a new building was constructed for classes.\n\nThat brought him back to Davidson College, where he was recruited to be the professor of natural science (physics and astronomy). Smith, however, availed a year\u2019s absence and put that time to good use by obtaining an M.A. degree in 1887 from the University of Virginia. He commenced his teaching after that, briefly returning to Virginia again in the academic year of 1889-90 to earn his Ph.D. in physics.\n\nBringing X-rays to the U.S.\n\nOn two major occasions, Smith\u2019s scientific knowledge had positive consequences globally. The first of those was in January 1896 when he played a telling role in bringing X-rays to the U.S.\n\nHaving read about Roentgen\u2019s recent discovery of X-rays and his experiments in Germany, Smith decided to put it to the test in his laboratory. Working with some of his students, Smith constructed an X-ray machine using Crookes tube.\n\nWhile the accounts vary here as to whether or not Smith was directly involved, we can say with certainty that on January 12, 1896, X-ray pictures were produced for the first time in the U.S. A variety of objects were X-rayed, including rifle cartridges, rings and pins inside a pillbox, and even a human finger (story goes that three students bribed a janitor to let them into the anatomy lab on campus, before using a pocket knife to slice a finger from a corpse\u2026 doing all of this in secrecy, afraid of the consequences if they were to be found out!).\n\nSmith conducted further experiments in February. He himself obtained the hand of a corpse from a local physician, and shot a bullet into that hand. The resulting X-ray image was probably the first demonstration of X-rays ability to tellingly reveal both natural and foreign objects within the human body. This picture was published on February 27 in the Charlotte Observer.\n\nIn the years that followed, Smith conducted one of the first clinical applications of X-rays. Along with a team of medical practitioners, Smith employed X-rays to detect a tailor\u2019s thimble that a child from Harrisburg had swallowed, which the doctors then successfully removed.\n\nBalloons for peace\n\nThe year he brought X-rays to the U.S. was also the year in which Smith grew further at Davidson College, as he was named vice-president in 1896. The turn of the century worked wonders for him as he was elected president of Davidson College in 1901.\n\nHe held that position for over a decade, departing only to become the president of Virginia\u2019s Washington and Lee University. The fact that his father had graduated from here had been a tug strong enough for Smith to make the move and make his presence felt there.\n\nAlas, World War I was just around the corner and it drew the energies of almost everyone involved. While it is well established that wars and the accompanying arms race usually bring benefits to the fields of science and technology, Smith ensured that science and tech provided an impetus on the peace efforts of World War I too.\n\nClose to the end of that war, a prize was offered for those who could come up with a method of informing the German people about U.S. President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s plans for peace. Keeping in mind the prevailing winds, Smith suggested attaching Wilson\u2019s message to gas-filled balloons and releasing them from France.\n\nWith the timing seemingly right, the Allies acted on the idea and sent across innumerable such balloons in the hope that it would be carried to Germany. The plan worked as the majority of German soldiers who surrendered carried this message with them. Wilson, in fact, credited Smith for shortening the war considerably.\n\nAble teacher and administrator\n\nThe success that Smith enjoyed at Selma Academy was something that he was able to replicate wherever he went. Blessed with an energetic mind and endless energy, Smith more than tripled Davidson College\u2019s enrollment during his time there, and more than doubled the size of the student body at Washington and Lee University.\n\nAn administrator par excellence, he is celebrated largely for the work that he put in to not only enhance intellectual standards, but also raising the bar for admission requirements. A gifted speaker, Smith lost no opportunity to seek funds from all sources, even if it meant travelling excessively for the cause of promoting his institution.\n\nAt heart, however, Smith was a teacher. He was recalled by students as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201centhusiastic\u201d and he initiated and implemented so many projects for his students that they aptly gave him the nickname \u201cProject\u201d.\n\nEven after retiring from academic life at the age of 70 in 1929, Smith remained active until shortly before his death in February 1951. As someone who set up facilities for recreation and exercises for his students as he believed that a strong body was necessary for a strong mind, Smith made sure he was agile throughout, both intellectually and physically.\n\n***\n\nThe discovery of X-rays\n\nA serendipitous accident was behind the discovery of X-rays by German physician Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen on November 8, 1895.\n\nRoentgen was using Crookes tube to conduct experiments in his laboratory. This experiment involved evacuating a glass bulb and filling it with a special gas. When a high-voltage current was then passed through it, it produced a fluorescent glow.\n\nRoentgen noticed a green coloured fluorescent light could be seen coming from a screen setting that was about 10 feet from the tube, despite the fact that the tube was heavily shielded with a black cardboard.\n\nRoentgen came to the correct conclusion that he was dealing with a new kind of ray. He named it X-ray, going with the nomenclature used in mathematics to indicate an unknown quantity. The name stuck.\n\nRoentgen made an X-ray image of his wife Bertha\u2019s hand to confirm his discovery. The iconic image, which proved beyond doubt the existence of X-rays, plainly showed the bones of her hand along with the ring on one of her fingers."

Smith has been unguardable in the CFP and averaged 145 yards in the Buckeyes' last two games. Texas has a stout pass defense but surrendered 296 yards against Arizona State in the quarterfinal.\n\nAnother option is Longhorns WR Silas Bolden to score a touchdown (+1200 odds). Bolden doesn\u2019t play much of a role in Texas\u2019 offense and only has one catch for nine yards in the CFP. However, Bolden is a skilled returner on special teams and brought one back to the house last week against the Sun Devils. A $5 wager at +1200 odds returns $60."

Zheng used her defeat by Sabalenka as a springboard, reaching world No. 5 and winning Olympic gold in women\u2019s singles. Her serve is one of the most formidable on the WTA Tour and her heavy forehand is a serious weapon. Todoni, 20, beat Olga Danilovic on her Grand Slam debut at last year\u2019s Wimbledon, but Zheng is one of the toughest draws she could have faced, especially in Melbourne.\n\nCasper Ruud (6) vs. Jaume Munar\n\nRuud finds himself in a funny position at the start of 2025. He\u2019s a three-time Grand Slam finalist, entering his prime years firmly ensconced in the top 10 of the ATP Tour, but he thinks his tennis is going to limit him in the era of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. His first-round opponent, Spain\u2019s Munar, is a hustler who gives nothing up, but the Norwegian should have too much for him on a hard court.\n\nAryna Sabalenka (1) vs. Sloane Stephens\n\nSabalenka loves Australia. She\u2019s won 27 matches in 28, two Australian Open titles in a row and another title in Brisbane to open the 2025 season. In the second half of 2024, Sabalenka started introducing sharp, finessed angles and drop shots into her repertoire, using them to devastating effect on her run to the 2024 U.S. Open title. She is the player to beat in Melbourne, and Stephens, herself a Grand Slam champion, will be the underdog.\n\nLucas Pouille (WC) vs. Alexander Zverev (2)\n\nPouille made his best run at a Grand Slam in Melbourne, losing to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the 2019 semifinal. The Frenchman, who has also been in the top 10, reached the third round at Wimbledon 2024 after a series of post-injury wildcards, and will be a dangerous proposition for Zverev in the final match of the first day on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nAlexander Zverev is seeking his first Grand Slam title in Australia. (Darrian Traynor / Getty Images)\n\nThe German, who reached the French Open final in 2024, is second seed but probably fourth-favorite for the title in Melbourne, after Sinner, Alcaraz and Djokovic. He will hoping to ease into proceedings.\n\nGO DEEPER 'I can be the best player in the world': Aryna Sabalenka crowns the season of her life\n\nMargaret Court Arena\n\nStart time: 7:30 p.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. PT January 11\n\nTV: ESPN, Tennis Channel\n\nStreaming: ESPN+\n\nOtto Virtanen vs. Arthur Fils (20)\n\nA big-hitting Fin who loves saving match points, Virtanen broke the top 100 in October 2024 and this is his fourth-consecutive Grand Slam main draw. Fils, who could make a charge in Melbourne after a big year in 2024, will be favorite, but Virtanen is a dangerous player and the Frenchman will not be able to afford any lapses.\n\nDiane Parry vs. Donna Vekic (18)\n\nParry will be hoping to banish memories of Melbourne from last year, after an agonizing loss to the breakout star of the 2024 Australian Open, Mirra Andreeva. Parry led 5-1 in the final set before Andreeva took it 7-6, but if she plays like she did in the first and third sets of that match, Vekic will have to be careful. The Croatian reached the Wimbledon semifinals and the Olympic final in 2024, and like Fils has the potential to make a deep run from outside the top 10.\n\nDonna Vekic will be looking to build on her success in 2024. (Matthew Stockman / Getty Images)\n\nJiri Lehecka (24) vs. Li Tu (WC)\n\nTu enamoured himself with the tennis world at the U.S. Open, when he took a set off then-world No. 2 Alcaraz on Arthur Ashe Arena with a fearless performance. He\u2019ll have to replicate that in front of his home crowd against the dangerous Lehecka, who won the Brisbane 250-level tournament in the run-up to Melbourne.\n\nAnna Blinkova vs. Daria Saville (WC)\n\nBlinkova produced one of the moments of the 2024 Australian Open, when she won a 42-point match tiebreak against Elena Rybakina in the third round. Blinkova will face a different kind of challenge from the partisan crowd on Margaret Court Arena, as Saville attempts to reach the second round at her home major for the second time.\n\nJohn Cain Arena\n\nStart time: 7:30 p.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. PT January 11\n\nTV: ESPN, Tennis Channel\n\nStreaming: ESPN+\n\nMarie Bouzkova vs. Mirra Andreeva (14)\n\nIf the 2024 Australian Open had a story, it was Andreeva\u2019s teenage tennis miracles. Now established in the top 20, and, she says, trying to get herself to be calmer and more secure on court, Andreeva has the tools to reach the late stages of any tournament. Bouzkova has had a few good results against top-15 players of late, beating Sabalenka in Washington and Ostapenko in Brisbane.\n\nKei Nishikori vs. Thiago Monteiro (Q)\n\nNishikori has said that 2024 was just about getting his body used to tennis again. In 2025, he wants to start producing results. He should fancy his chances against Monteiro, who specializes in clay-court tennis, but the king of the five-set match will be wanting to avoid going long early.\n\nPaula Badosa (11) vs. Wang Xinyu\n\nBadosa is one of many players who will be happy just to be here at all. In early 2024, she feared she would never play tennis again, but after strong runs at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open she\u2019s back in the upper echelons of the WTA Tour. Wang, an established top-40 player who upset U.S. Open finalist Jessica Pegula twice last year, is a tough first-round out.\n\nUgo Humbert (14) vs. Matteo Gigante (Q)\n\nHumbert, who loves a fast hard court but prefers when they are indoors, is a bit of an enigma at Grand Slam level. He\u2019s never gone beyond a fourth round despite his top level being among the best in the field, and his best result in Melbourne is the third round. He faces a fellow left-hander in Italy\u2019s Gigante, which might make this a trickier assignment by depriving Humbert of the angular advantage he enjoys against right-handers.\n\nMirra Andreeva announced herself to the world at the 2024 Australian Open. (Robert Prange / Getty Images)\n\nKia Arena\n\nStart time: 7:30 p.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. PT January 11\n\nTV: ESPN, Tennis Channel\n\nStreaming: ESPN+\n\nYuliia Starodubtseva vs. Leylah Fernandez (30)\n\nSince reaching the 2021 U.S. Open final, Fernandez has established herself as a top-30 player without making another impactful run at a major outside of New York (she reached the quarterfinals in 2023.) Starodubtseva has gone beyond the first round at a major just once, but had her best run at a WTA 1000 event in 2024, reaching the quarterfinals in Beijing.\n\nGauthier Onclin (Q) vs. Reilly Opelka\n\nWhen Opelka retired from the Brisbane final against Lehecka, it raised fears that the big-serving American had suffered another bit of injury bad luck. Opelka is in the draw for Melbourne, though, and looking to build on his win over Djokovic. His serve, which mixes fearsome speed with heavier spin than even his fellow big servers can manage, will be a baptism of fire for Onclin, making his Grand Slam debut after an impressive run through qualifying. He likes playing Americans at the moment, beating Aleksandar Kovacevic and Mackenzie McDonald to reach the main draw. The world No. 236, Onclin overcame rankings gaps of 128 and 106 places to do it.\n\nDamir Dzumhur vs. Aleksandar Vukic\n\nIn 2018, Dzumhur made it inside the top 25. In 2024, he broke back into the top 100 after five years of spiralling form, achieving direct acceptance for the Australian Open main draw in the process. He\u2019ll have the crowd against him against world No. 67 Vukic, but there\u2019s every chance of an upset.\n\nNao Hibino (Q) vs. Marta Kostyuk (17)\n\nWorld No. 18 Kostyuk enters 2025 with points to defend to keep herself inside the top 20, including in Melbourne. She reached the quarterfinals last year as the world No. 37, losing to Coco Gauff in three sets, the first two of which were some of the tightest of the tournament. 2024 was the first year since 2021 that Hibino qualified for the main draw of all four majors, and she started the 2025 season by coming through qualifying here.\n\nReilly Opelka\u2019s run to the Brisbane final was a reminder that he is more than a big server. (William West / AFP via Getty Images)\n\n1573 Arena\n\nStart time: 7:30 p.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. PT January 11\n\nTV: ESPN, Tennis Channel\n\nStreaming: ESPN+\n\nBernarda Pera vs. Tatjana Maria\n\nOne of few Americans across the men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles to avoid a compatriot in the draw, Pera will look to Gauff\u2019s performance against Maria at this year\u2019s U.S. Open for inspiration. Maria \u2014 whose use of slice off both groundstroke wings can befuddle opponents \u2014 had Gauff in knots for the first eight games of their encounter before the American cut loose and won the next eight in a row to win the match.\n\nClara Tauson vs Linda Noskova (29)\n\nA sleeper hit tie in the first round between two of the most exciting players outside the top 25. Noskova will have fond memories of her first Grand Slam appearance in Melbourne last year, when she beat Iga Swiatek in three sets on the way to the quarterfinals, while Tauson is coming off the back of a title in Auckland. She won the final when Naomi Osaka retired up a set, but got there in style.\n\nSumit Nagal vs Tomas Machac (26)\n\nWhat to make of Machac? Blessed with precocious talent and a love for showmanship, the Czech has in recent weeks looked too preoccupied with the latter over adding the solidity which would see him rise further in the ATP rankings. A cramp-induced rage quit from a set and 5-2 up against Taylor Fritz in the United Cup only adds to the complexity. He should have too much for Nagal, who reached the second round of a major for the first time at last year\u2019s tournament.\n\nAround the grounds\n\nStart time: 7:30 p.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. PT January 11\n\nTV: ESPN, Tennis Channel\n\nStreaming: ESPN+\n\nShang Juncheng vs. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina\n\nThird on Court 6, expect some fireworks off the racket and from the mouths of two of the more mercurial players on the ATP Tour.\n\nRequired reading\n\n(Top photo of Aryna Sabalenka: Cameron Spencer / Getty Images)"

            "article_content": "These 17 leaders, pioneers, and experts are driving the auto industry toward a future with smarter and more sophisticated cars.\n\nWhile EVs and autonomous cars earn all the headlines, software-defined vehicles are quietly revolutionizing how we move around the world with relatively little fanfare. Cars with fewer but more powerful computers running cutting-edge software are changing every interaction we have with our vehicles\u2014from unlocking and starting them to steering and braking them.\n\nWhile it largely goes unnoticed by the general public and mainstream media, the work being done on SDVs is transforming not just the cars we drive, but how automakers design and engineer them. That\u2019s why, in addition to MotorTrend\u2019s ongoing coverage of SDVs themselves, for the past three years we\u2019ve recognized the key individuals behind this transformation.\n\nThe 2025 MotorTrend Software-Defined Vehicle Innovator Awards, presented in partnership with QNX, celebrate the executives, engineers, and product managers steering the auto industry toward a new software-centric paradigm. The awards are given in three categories\u2014Pioneers, Leaders, and Experts\u2014with individuals nominated by their colleagues and collaborators. A panel of MotorTrend senior editorial staff chose the winners based on their achievements and impact.

Here are the six biggest trends from CES that we think will make the largest impact in 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for the very top products from the trade show, be sure to check out the official 2025 Best of CES Awards, selected by the CNET Group.\n\nRobots keep getting better, smarter, cuter, smaller and creepier\n\nMost of the non-novelty robots shown at CES bear a functional resemblance to the robots used commercially -- by that I mean you can tell they're the product of the same research in movement and AI as they pick things up, fold, clean and so on. Expensive models like Mi-Mo, Beatbot, R2D3 and more.\n\nSamsung's yellow Ballie home robot is going to ship this year. James Martin/CNET\n\nMore consumer-friendly models were less functional, like the tiny, fuzzy bots that you hang on your handbag as a fashion statement or the adorable model with huge anime eyes that follows you around on wheels but seems like a surveillance nightmare (the TCL AI Me). There were also the concepts of yesteryear that finally edged toward saleability, such as Samsung's Ballie -- a spherical bot with a projector in its belly, like a baby Teletubbie.\n\nWatch this: Sorry, There Are No 'Best Robots' at CES This Year 03:22\n\nOn the \"whut?\" front perches a tiny robot whose function is simply to blow on hot beverages.\n\nBut the models that resonated the most with us were home helpers that don't cost tens of thousands of dollars, like Roborock's Saros Z70 robot vacuum cleaner -- it sports an arm that can pick up your socks -- or Eureka's J15 Max Ultra, which detects spills and untangles its own brushes. And one of the most innovative was the Lymow One, a robot mower that cuts the grass and feeds mulched matter back to your lawn. There's always a ton of laundry robots -- unsurprising given how much everyone hates laundry -- like Tenet's AI Laundry Robot, which washes and folds.\n\nAnd we can't forget the token \"most human-looking\" robot, Realbotix's $175K Aria robot, which is designed for \"companionship and intimacy\" -- and looks it, given she's built along the lines of an old-school Barbie.\n\nUltimately, we chose not to pick a best robot because of how removed they were from interaction. In fact, many of the expensive models were in more of a zoo environment: Look at the magical creature in its habitat, repeatedly picking things up and moving them elsewhere. That's the kind of thing we've been seeing for years.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nNvidia doesn't make robots, but it's been working on its robot LLMs and operating systems for years. And every time Nvidia trots out this visual at its events, I can't help but think that Nvidia is building a robot army. Well, that and Metropolis.\n\nAI inside, again, but more powerful\n\nThere seemed to be less hype about AI in devices (though it's possible I have successfully learned to tune it out), but about the same in mobile apps like Delta's AI concierge. However, it was everywhere in laptops thanks to the annual chip updates from Intel and AMD -- which of course brought the usual faster, better and improved battery life -- plus bundles of \"try it!\" software for your out-of-the-box AI experience.\n\nWatch this: Everything Announced at Nvidia's CES Event in 12 Minutes 11:47\n\nBut in this respect, Nvidia stole the show for its Cosmos AI model (Nvidia has been working on and licensing its various models for autonomous cars, robots and more for years, but this seemed to be its biggest \"moment\"), as well as its unveiling of the newest generation of consumer graphics.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Hands-Down Won AI at CES 2025, and Also the Show Itself. Here's Why That Matters\n\nThe GeForce RTX 50 series not only promises the typical performance bump PC gamers expect, but thanks to the new Blackwell generation of GPUs, it brings more powerful and better generative AI capabilities down to your local system. That means cheaper entry for developers, the ability for end users to run bigger models, as well speed improvements (via Nvidia's DLSS 4) and more sophisticated capabilities for games.\n\nWatch this: These New Smart Glasses Want to Be Your Next AI Companion 02:31\n\nThere weren't a lot of new smart glasses, but Halliday's stood out for the way they present information: Rather than on the screen, they have a tiny monochrome display that shows text.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Smart Glasses Moment Is Here. But They're Still Missing Something Big\n\nThe big AI news for cars at CES wasn't, for once, autonomininity: It was Volkswagen bringing ChatGPT to its voice assistant for more complex, natural-language help.\n\nRead more: Nvidia's CEO Explains How Its New AI Models Could Work on Future Smart Glasses\n\nCouch potato 'tainment\n\nOne of CES' core pillars is entertainment (it used to be baked right into the name), which generally means TVs and audio. There weren't any new screen technologies, but there were improvements and innovations with existing ones.\n\nThe suction cups on the back of the Displace TV James Martin/CNET\n\nTweaks to OLED came to TVs, with LG's G5 OLED's quality bump impressing us the most for its better brightness and contrast, along with HiSense's 116-inch MicroLED model. But the TV that seemed to make the biggest impact on us were Displace's hang-anywhere-thanks-to-huge-suction-cups TVs, shipping versions of prototypes we've seen in past years.\n\nWatch this: Displace TV's 55-Inch Television Hangs From a Wall Using Suction Cups 03:15\n\nI think its impact was partly due to the enormous opportunity for \"suck\" puns.\n\nThere was the usual complement of gaming desktops, laptops and monitors, the latter offering the typical year upgrade to higher refresh rates (500Hz and 600Hz).\n\nWatch this: Lenovo's New Legion Go S Gaming Handheld Is Lighter and Smaller but Packs a Big Surprise 03:30\n\nBut the biggest hit was Lenovo's new handheld console. The company is the first to offer (or at least announce) a SteamOS-based model, one of the new Legion G S models. Acer's Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handheld, however, earned some mockery, because you can't really respect a \"handheld\" if it's bigger than your head.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Time for an Xbox Handheld Is Now\n\nBut it was also kind of hard to sustain excitement about gaming hardware at CES this year, because of a shiny new thing possibly on the horizon. Rumors say the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming soon.\n\nHealth and beauty, the staples of CES\n\nSometimes I think CES specializes in sleep, skin and smart rings, plus technology designed to make you feel like a loser -- so many smart mirrors, though none yet use generative AI to simulate your mother's critical voice or to show you what you could look like if you just tried harder. But maybe that's just me.\n\nThere may not have been as many this year, but there were some standouts. Withing's Omnia smart mirror combines a scale and a mirror to not only tell you if you're overweight and in bad health, but to show you as well. There's always a device for analyzing your skin to tell you what to buy to fix it, such as L'Oreal's BioPrint. (To be fair, I don't know what it's suggestions are.)\n\nWatch this: I Said Yes to Trying a Smart Ring You Can Propose With 01:45\n\nAnd, oh, the rings. One way to attract attention among the plethora of rings designed to monitor your health is to make it gold and platinum, like the UltraHuman Rare ring: Nothing's more romantic than a ring that says, \"Marry me\" and \"Please don't die,\" simultaneously. Or alternatively, \"Show me off on Instagram.\"\n\nDon't forget the annual dose of flatware that makes you healthier. This year's entrant is Kirin Electric Salt Spoon, intended to give you that salty taste without any of the nasty sodium -- by zapping your tongue with a bit of electricity. On the other hand, if they could do that for chocolate, I'd be first in line.\n\nLisa Eadicicco/CNET\n\nAnd while the Nike x Hyperice's \"boatlike booties are basically recovery high-tops festooned with buttons and designed to help your weary tootsies recover from soreness and strain,\" they sound pretty awesome.\n\nBut there were some truly practical and innovative new products, like the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which stay in, are flush with your ears for side sleepers and have sensors and other tech to help improve the quality of your sleep. Our team also called out the YoctoMat, a smart yoga mat that provides feedback on your poses. And while I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as health or beauty, in the interest of hydration, the Roam SodaTop is a bottle cap with a CO2 cartridge so you can carbonate your water on the go.\n\nHome is where the heat is\n\nHome tech tends to cover a lot of bases, many of them robotic. No one really likes to vacuum, do laundry or mow the lawn like the AI-driven robot vacuums and lawnmower I mentioned above.\n\nRead more: Commentary I Really Don't Want an AI Pot to Turn My Plant Into a Tamagotchi From Hell\n\nVideo smart locks seemed to be the focus of home security upgrades this year -- we call out Lockly's Vision Prestige and TCLs Smart Lock D1 Ultra -- providing more information than existing models. Notable, also, because someone breaking in doesn't use the video doorbell.\n\n23 Fascinating Home Tech Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025, the Biggest Tech Show on Earth +21 More See all photos\n\nCooling and heating were hot as well, especially Samsung's DHS Mono R32 HT heat pump, which heats outside air, condenses it to water and feeds it to your water tank. As an apartment dweller, I'm partial to the Gradient All-Weather 120V Window Heat Pump, which supplies heat when the weather gets frosty. Cooling and heating go hand-in-hand with utility bills and power backup -- I was really intrigued by the BioLite, which provides battery backup for a couple of key appliances, like the refrigerator.\n\nAnd Savant's Smart Budget is designed to save you money by routing power automatically (and manually) to balance output, thereby potentially saving you the expense of rewiring your home to support new, power-sucking devices. Plus, Aqara introduced the Touchscreen Dial V1, a clever and useful dial that can control all your smart devices\n\nAnd lest we forget the bread-and-butter of small appliances. There are always plenty, though really it's the oddballs and gimmicks that catch more attention than the mundane. This year, we saw the phone-controlled Panasonic HomeChef 4-in-1 Multi-Oven, the Apecoo tortilla and roti maker (food samples really seemed to attract us), LG's \"Perfect Fancy Microwave for Social Media\" with a 27-inch display and much, much more.\n\nThe future and the future's future\n\nThe big deals for cars (and other things that tote people) tend to be new technologies and other future-flung concepts. BMW gave us panoramic IDrive with operating system X, a three-tier, ultra wide holographic 3D windshield display that's actually not too far out from your next BMW, and Hyundai Mobis holographic windshield display one-ups it by constraining the angle of view to the driver.\n\nWatch this: Aptera Solar EV Gets All the Energy It Needs From the Sun 04:45\n\nWe see flying cars at the show every year, but sadly we're no closer to me getting one. This year's concept-du-jour was the Xpeng AeroHT, a massive six-wheeler with an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in its trunk. Aptera's solar EV isn't a flying car, but it really looks like it should have wings.\n\nThe Pebble Flow Electric RV concept -- solar chargeable -- came back for a visit, as did Sony's Afeela, and the latter is ready for your money, if not delivery. Honda trotted out prototypes of its 0 series EVs (one step closer to reality than the concept we saw last year), a sports sedan and a van. See the new photos.\n\nBut a new motor concept claims to vastly increase the range of EVs -- arguably more important than all the shiny paint and glowy dashboards.\n\nGeoffrey Morrison/CNET\n\nAnother concept that appealed to me personally was Nanosys' next-gen MicroLED, dubbed UV LED, which uses ultraviolet light to energize RGB quantum dots to precise frequencies: Different lIght frequencies are how we perceive color. MicroLED may potentially supplant OLED in big screens and small. It somewhat upstaged Samsung's MicroLED watch concept with an uber-bright screen. Samsung also brought us a somewhat disturbing-looking stretchable screen for a 3D-ish view and a transparent MicroLED screen. Lenovo's concept ThinkBook with a rollable screen looks and gesture controls appear sleek.\n\nIn a class by itself, the Flint Paper Battery claims to be a new, sustainable power source that may eventually replace lithium ion with cellulose.\n\nWatch this: I Made Things Weird Trying TSA's New Shoe Scanner Machine 03:53\n\nFinally, I will never forget Bridget Carey smuggling Gummy Worms in her shoe to test TSA's new scanner -- after complaining about the ick factor of shuffling our socks or bare soles across a floor that's had thousands of other shoes scrape across it. Gummy Worms in your shoe has a pretty high ick factor, too."

            "article_content": "The two US antitrust agencies sided with part of Elon Musk \u2019s argument to block artificial intelligence startup OpenAI from restructuring as a for-profit company.\n\nThe Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission argued in a court filing Friday that overlapping board directors can harm competition, even after the person in question resigns.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawsuit claims that OpenAI and Microsoft violated antitrust laws by having LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman simultaneously serve on the boards of both companies from 2017 to 2023. The lawsuit also cites Deannah Templeton , who served as an executive at Microsoft and as a non-voting part of OpenAI\u2019s board from December 2023 to July.\n\n\u201cWhere a defendant voluntarily ceases illegal conduct, it still bears a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 to demonstrate it is \u2018absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,\u2019\u201d the FTC and Justice Department said. The agencies said they weren\u2019t taking a position on the ultimate question of whether OpenAI can be restructured.\n\nThe filing comes in response to Musk\u2019s recent request that a federal court stop the company from pursuing what he called an \u201cillegal\u201d conversion to a for-profit company. A hearing on the injunction request is set for Tuesday in Oakland, California.\n\nMusk\u2019s efforts are part of a months-long attack on OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman , more than nine years after the two men worked together to launch OpenAI as a nonprofit with a stated mission to develop generative AI for the benefit of society.\n\nThe FTC has been scrutinizing OpenAI as part of several probes. Last year, the agency opened a study , expected to be released shortly, into the AI investments by Microsoft and other tech giants.\n\nSeparately, the consumer protection and antitrust agency has been looking into whether OpenAI misled consumers about its offerings. It has also been probing inappropriate board overlaps that involve Hoffman. He in turn has criticized FTC Chair Lina Khan , publicly calling for her ouster from the agency.\n\nMusk first suedOpenAI in California state court in February and then dropped the case in June. Musk revived the litigation in August in federal court.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and founded rival startup xAI in 2023, alleged in previous court filings that OpenAI broke its promises to him and abandoned its founding purpose as a charity when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft starting in 2019. He also said that without quick court intervention, it will soon be too late to stop Altman\u2019s \u201cbehemoth\u201d from crushing its rivals.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment on Friday\u2019s filing. It has previously argued that Hoffman and Templeton\u2019s board stints didn\u2019t run afoul of antitrust law.\n\nOpenAI has called Musk\u2019s suit baseless, arguing that the billionaire originally supported a more traditional corporate structure for the startup.\n\nRead More: OpenAI Says Musk Backed For-Profit Plan Before Trying to Stop It\n\nThe case is Musk v.

Today, North Korea\u2019s secretive dictator oversees an isolated society and command economy, portraying himself as the benevolent protector of a nation under siege from hostile foreign powers. Its wealthy, democratic southern neighbor is an industrial and technological powerhouse that\u2019s exporting its culture to the world, shielded from the nuclear-armed North by a defense treaty with the US.\n\nMore than 1 million troops, and one of the heaviest concentrations of weapons anywhere, face off along a strip of no-man\u2019s land that\u2019s divided the two Koreas since 1953. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been raising the stakes by expanding his nuclear arsenal and threatening to unleash it on the US and its allies. North Korean soldiers destroyed main roads and rail links to the South in October 2024, the latest symbolic blow to prospects for reunification. Meanwhile, a postwar generation is dying without ever having fulfilled the dream of meeting their relatives living across the border.\n\nWhy are North Korea and South Korea separate countries?\n\nKorea was a single nation for centuries under the Goryeo and the Joseon dynasties, and through a period of Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. The Soviet Union joined with the US to expel the Japanese from the peninsula in the latter days of World War II. The victors divided the country, with Russia exerting its influence north of the 38th parallel \u2014 the line of latitude 38 degrees north of the equator \u2014 and the US doing the same in the south. What was supposed to be a temporary arrangement became permanent as the Cold War set in and the two Koreas became proxies for the superpowers. The Republic of Korea was formed in the South in August 1948. Its first president was Syngman Rhee, a convert to Christianity who was educated at an American Methodist school. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea was established in the North the following month, led by the Soviet-trained Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the country\u2019s current leader.\n\nIn June 1950, North Korea invaded the South in an attempt to unite the peninsula under Soviet-style rule. US-led United Nations forces fought back on behalf of the South, and communist China sent in troops to support North Korea. An estimated 3 million people died as a result of the fighting, a large majority of them civilians. In 1953, an armistice was signed and a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) wide demilitarized zone established along the lines where the opposing forces had reached a stalemate, severing cross-border movement and separating families and friends living on either side of it. With no permanent peace treaty, the conflict never formally came to an end.\n\nUS marines at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, December 1950.

Today, South Korea produces more goods and services in six days than North Korea does in a year, even though the South, with almost 52 million people, is only twice as populous. Its industrial conglomerates make much of the world\u2019s consumer electronics and household appliances and are major players in semiconductors, smartphones and electric cars. Samsung Electronics produces 41% of the world\u2019s DRAM chips and 33% of NAND memory chips \u2014 crucial inputs for companies from Apple Inc. to Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s decades-long economic boom has lifted living standards to a point where the country outperforms many other wealthy nations in terms of education and health. High disposable incomes have underpinned its creative industries, and Korean culture, including hit Netflix shows such as Squid Game and K-Pop bands like BTS, has become a major export.\n\nDividing Lines Disputed waters west of Korea are a potential conflict zone Source: Data compiled by Bloomberg\n\nNorth Korea is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. South Korea\u2019s central bank estimates that the North\u2019s annual gross domestic product per capita is about $1,000, positioning it among the ranks of instability-wracked countries such as Sudan and Yemen. South Korea\u2019s per capita GDP was $33,121 in 2023, according to the World Bank.\n\nBecause of frequent droughts, severe flooding and economic mismanagement, food scarcity is often a problem. A famine in the 1990s caused untold misery, with death estimates ranging from 240,000 to 3.5 million people. It only ended thanks in large part to Chinese aid.\n\nThe two countries are almost entirely cut off from one another, with no telephone, internet or postal links, no direct air or sea connections, and now no roads or railways either.\n\nA production line at a tractor plant in North Korea in 1980.

Photographer: Jun Michael Park/The New York Times/Redux\n\nAre North Koreans able to move to South Korea?\n\nNorth Koreans are rarely allowed to travel abroad. An unauthorized effort to leave the country can result in imprisonment or death. Dodging soldiers, razor-wire fencing and landmines in the DMZ is especially dangerous. Those who successfully defect usually cross the border with China instead, with some then making their way to a third country before seeking asylum in South Korea. China and North Korea have stepped up surveillance of their frontier in recent years and defections have declined sharply. From a record of almost 3,000 in 2009, the number fell to 196 in 2023, according to South Korean government data.\n\nHow different are the people of North and South Korea?\n\nBecause of poor diet and harsh living conditions, North Koreans on average are between 3 and 8 centimeters (1.1-3.1 inches) shorter than South Koreans. Refugees from the North often struggle to assimilate in South Korea and their children find it hard to adjust to its highly competitive school system. Some complain of a stigma associated with their origin and try to lose their northern accents. Navigating online bureaucracy and cashless payments add further challenges as North Koreans are often unfamiliar with digital technology and the South is one of the world\u2019s most digitalized societies.\n\nThe Korean language has evolved differently in the two countries. The regime in the North has sought to purge foreign words, including some associated with western consumerism. South Koreans have embraced English vocabulary, incorporating a slew of borrowed and mashed-up \u201cKonglish\u201d phrases into the vernacular. These include words such as \u201cwonpiesu\u201d (from \u201cone piece\u201d) for the word \u201cdress\u201d and \u201capatu\u201d for \u201capartment.\u201d\n\nLanguage in the North has been influenced by the harsh tone of much of the propaganda that pervades media there. The rough style of many North Korean greetings is sometimes misconstrued as rudeness by Southerners.\n\nSouth Korea has mandatory military service for young men, meaning that almost all serve for a time in the armed forces to defend against a possible attack from the North. Military life is even more deeply embedded in northern society. The country has 1.28 million active military personnel \u2014 about 5% of the population.\n\nIn this photo provided by the North Korean government, youth groups perform at an event in February 2024 to mark the 76th anniversary of the country's founding.

As leadership has passed from the founder Kim Il Sung to his son Kim Jong Il and now his grandson, Kim Jong Un, the family has built a vigorous personality cult. State propaganda asserts that their bloodline hails from Mount Paektu, which straddles the border between North Korea and China and is considered a sacred site by many Koreans.\n\nKim\u2019s rule is stable, and the fixtures of his regime are pervasive. State security stamps out dissent and the country\u2019s propaganda machine relentlessly portrays Kim as the protector of the Korean people. Much of the country\u2019s limited resources have gone to building its military, bolstering the narrative of a nation united against the constant threat of annihilation by the US and its allies. The current Kim has brought his preteen daughter, identified by South Korean intelligence as Kim Ju Ae, to missile tests and military parades, demonstrating that there\u2019s another generation waiting in the wings that will be equipped for survival.\n\nReunification of the two Koreas would carry big opportunities but enormous risks.\n\nSouth Korean companies could benefit from low-cost workers and new commercial opportunities. But merging two countries with such divergent cultural outlooks and contrasting levels of economic development and education would be a vast enterprise. South Korea\u2019s National Assembly Budget Office said in a 2015 report that spending of 4.8 quadrillion won ($3.45 trillion) would be required over half a century to raise the North\u2019s per capita income level to 66% of the average in the South.\n\nKim Jong Il with his father, Kim Il Sung, in an undated photograph.

Photographer: Kim Hong-Ji/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWho is Kim Jong Un?\n\nWhen he took power after his father\u2019s death in 2011, foreign observers questioned whether a leader in his late 20s could rule a country where seniority was revered. He soon exerted authority over geriatric generals and eliminated potential rivals. He executed his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, on charges of treason, corruption and factionalism. (Analysts said Jang was viewed as a threat to Kim\u2019s power.) Kim was also suspected of having ordered the killing of his older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam. The exiled sibling, whose existence may have undermined the legitimacy of Kim\u2019s rule, died after being exposed to the nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.\n\nKim\u2019s remaining siblings include older brother Kim Jong Chol, who has no official title and seems to be more interested in playing guitar than politics, according to a book by a senior North Korean diplomat who defected. Kim\u2019s younger sister Kim Yo Jong has been the point person for pressure campaigns on South Korea and the US. Her tasks include shaping propaganda, appearing at her brother\u2019s side for high-level meetings, and picking up the cigarette butts he flings in the corridors of power.\n\nNow in his 40s, Kim is overweight and a heavy smoker, and questions surround his health. South Korea\u2019s spy agency assesses that he has three children, including perhaps a school-age son and the daughter, Ju Ae, who has been dubbed the \u201crespected daughter\u201d and \u201cbeloved child\u201d by state media and is a potential future leadership candidate.\n\nIn this photo provided by the North Korean government, Kim Jong Un and his daughter observe an air force demonstration to commemorate the \"Day of Airmen\" in North Korea, in November 2023.

Source: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service/AP\n\nDo North Koreans approve of Kim\u2019s leadership?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know because citizens are compelled to show unwavering support for the regime, and unwelcome expressions of personal opinion can result in imprisonment. South Korea\u2019s government has conducted extensive surveys of North Korean emigres. In a 2024 poll of more than 6,350 defectors, 44% said that when they lived in the North they did not want the Kims to remain in power, while 38% said they did. Younger North Korean defectors were more likely to have been exposed to outside influences and were more skeptical of the North Korean state\u2019s messages, the survey showed. Among respondents age 50 and older, 47% had a favorable view of North Korea\u2019s leadership.\n\nHow does Kim keep the North Korean people in line?\n\nState media drills it into the people that they should fear the US and its \u201cpuppet traitors\u201d in South Korea. The leader is presented as a father figure who deserves the love and respect due to a good parent. The message is inescapable, because all media are controlled by the state. TV and radio devotedly recount Kim\u2019s visits to factories, farms and military bases, conveying the idea that he\u2019s deeply concerned about the lives of workers, farmers and soldiers. Another theme: If citizens encounter problems, it\u2019s always the fault of government officials who failed to faithfully follow Kim\u2019s advice.\n\nKim Jong Un tours a North Korean munitions factory in January 2024. Source: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service/AP\n\nWhat is the likelihood of a coup?\n\nA coup is a possibility given the concentration of power in a single leader with health issues, and the potential for North Korea's grinding poverty to produce political instability. North Korea watchers suggest that if it were to happen, it would be orchestrated by the military. Kim Jong Un cycled through top military officials and defense ministers in the first several years of his rule, \u201cwhich points to fears of a coup or at least insubordination at crucial moments,\u201d Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute think tank, wrote in NK News, a Seoul-based news site focused on North Korean affairs.\n\nHowever, an overthrow is not seen as likely. The government has cut the population off from the outside world, listens in on people\u2019s communications, has citizens keep tabs on each other, and punishes anyone who gets out of line by sending them to prison. North Korea employs a system known as \u201cthree generations of punishment,\u201d in which the parents and children of political prisoners can also be jailed for their transgressions, according to the US State Department. Milder punishments include banishment from the capital, Pyongyang, which can end a person\u2019s career and deny their children any chance of advancement.\n\nRecently, Kim\u2019s regime has received a boost from aid, including food and fuel, sent by Moscow in exchange for military supplies useful in Russia's war in Ukraine. The deliveries have helped to stabilize prices in North Korea and expand the economy, according to South Korean officials.\n\nBloomberg Originals explores how North Korea managed to build a formidable nuclear arsenal despite being one of the poorest nations in the world. Though Pyongyang regularly threatens the West, the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Un, recently has raised the stakes, with the help of Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhat is the North Korean nuclear threat?\n\nKim has focused much of his energies on turning North Korea into a country that can credibly deliver a nuclear attack on the US mainland. He has expanded its arsenal of atomic warheads and modernized the missiles that would carry them, relying on domestic technology that can be manufactured despite sanctions. The buildup has led to speculation as to his intentions. Some experts see it as a form of insurance policy, showing the US it would pay a high price if it tried to oust Kim. Success in nuclear weapons may also help to divert attention at home from Kim\u2019s failures in other areas.\n\nA ceremony to mark the delivery of nuclear-capable missile launchers in Pyongyang, August 2024.

Source: Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service/AP\n\nHave North Korea and South Korea attacked each other since the war?\n\nThere have been no cases where exchanges of live fire went on for days and resulted in mass casualties. But there have been deadly and isolated altercations, almost always initiated by North Korea. One flashpoint is the Yellow Sea border islands that are part of South Korea but located in waters claimed by the North. In 2010, some two years before Kim Jong Un took power, Yeonpyeong Island was the scene of a deadly artillery bombardment that killed two South Korean soldiers and two civilians. About six months earlier, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing its warship Cheonan near the island, killing 46 sailors \u2014 an allegation the North denied.\n\nDo South Koreans want reunification?\n\nIt depends on whom you ask. Younger South Koreans are generally more comfortable with the idea of North Korea as a foreign country. Fewer than half of millennials in the South think unification is necessary, compared with nearly three-quarters of people born before 1950, according to a 2024 survey from the Korea Institute for National Unification."

            "article_content": "The collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has alarmed many regional countries, including the UAE and Egypt - but Israel is particularly concerned by this development.\n\nAn Israeli government committee has even suggested that a Syria ruled by Sunni Islamists who don\u2019t recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist could potentially pose a bigger threat to the country than Iran, Israel\u2019s archenemy.\n\nThe committee was particularly unnerved by Turkey\u2019s influence in Syria, claiming that Ankara could use the new Syrian government as a proxy force \u201cto restore the Ottoman Crown to its former glory\u201d - whatever that means.\n\nThe report noted that Ankara could rapidly rearm the new Syrian government, potentially triggering a direct conflict between Israel and Turkey.\n\nBut is this a realistic scenario? In short, the answer is no.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nAlthough Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gradually weakened Turkish-Israeli bilateral relations - cutting trade ties, denying air travel to senior Israeli officials, accusing Tel Aviv of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and delivering fiery populist speeches hinting that the Turkish army could one day aid the Palestinian people - there is no indication that Ankara seeks a military confrontation with Israel.\n\nApart from the fact that both Turkey and Israel are US allies, and the two sides have never engaged in a military conflict, Ankara has no appetite for such adventures - especially while the region is already grappling with an ongoing war between Iran and Israel, alongside the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.\n\nTurkey's objectives in Syria\n\nTurkey\u2019s aims in Syria are very clear, and they have been communicated both publicly and privately to all actors involved.\n\nFirstly, as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted, Ankara wants a stable Syria that poses no threat to other nations. Secondly, Turkey envisions a democratic, unitary and civil state in Syria - one that embraces minorities and all ethnic groups, while preventing the formation of a Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) statelet.\n\nAfter hosting millions of Syrian refugees for more than a decade and conducting multiple military operations, which have cost Turkish lives and hundreds of millions of dollars, Ankara wants a Syria that can economically and socially flourish. A conflict with Israel, whether direct or indirect, does not align with that goal.\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake\n\nSo far, Turkey\u2019s actions have supported these objectives.\n\nAnkara initially - and to a large extent - turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s aerial campaign to destroy remnants of the Assad regime\u2019s military facilities. But after Israel expanded its targets significantly, Fidan announced that Turkey had relayed a message to Israel that such attacks must stop.\n\nFidan acknowledged Israeli concerns that arms, such as chemical weapons, could fall into the wrong hands. Notably, Israel has avoided striking any Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) targets.\n\nFurthermore, Turkey has reportedly taken the first steps to establish a deconfliction mechanism with the Israeli military in Syria. Reports also point to routine engagements between Turkish and Israeli intelligence agencies.\n\nIn addition, according to my sources, Ankara has encouraged HTS leaders, including Ahmed al-Sharaa, to issue statements advocating calm with Israel. Several HTS figures have publicly said they are not seeking a clash with Israel.\n\nRisks of fragmentation\n\nMeanwhile, according to my Turkish contacts, there are indications that Damascus may seek to engage Ankara militarily, potentially moving Turkish advisers to Syrian military academies and airbases, to help re-establish a unified Syrian army under the Syrian defence ministry.\n\nTurkey is mindful of Israeli concerns regarding such cooperation. What I hear is that Turkey's deployments will be limited. They would not go beyond Hama and, to some extent, Damascus - an effort to reassure Israel that Ankara\u2019s actions are not hostile.\n\nBut Israel must come to terms with the fact that Ankara will not tolerate a PKK-controlled statelet in northern Syria. Turkey has consistently insisted that Kurdish groups must be integrated into a unified Syrian state.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Syria threaten regional stability and will ultimately backfire Read More \u00bb\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake.\n\nAnother report in Israel Hayom this week also talked about Israel's plan for an international conference to divide Syria into canons.\n\nA fragmented Syria would be a breeding ground for armed groups, further destabilising the region and creating long-term risks for Israel. By contrast, a democratic and inclusive Syria serves everyone\u2019s interests.\n\nUnfortunately, it is clear that Israel\u2019s leadership prefers dealing with autocratic regimes, which are more transactional and reliable in their oppressive policies - making Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and the occupied West Bank easier to justify and swallow.\n\nIt is true that Turkey now has a friend in Damascus. Erdogan stands to benefit from this relationship on multiple fronts: domestically, economically and regionally.\n\nBut this does not mean that the new Syrian government will become a Turkish proxy. On the contrary, if fortune is on our side, Syria will - for the first time - have a legitimate administration focused on one thing only: rebuilding the country as a place of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "While it's still too early for an accurate tally of the financial toll, the losses so far likely make the wildfires the costliest ever in the U.S., according to various estimates.\n\nThe devastating blazes have killed at least 11 people and incinerated more than 12,000 structures since Tuesday, laying waste to entire neighborhoods once home to multimillion-dollar properties.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are still raging, but already are projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.\n\nA preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAccuWeather factors in a multitude of variables in its estimates, including damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and vehicles, as well as immediate and long-term health care costs, lost wages and supply chain interruptions.\n\nThe aftermath of the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles on Saturday. John Locher/Associated Press\n\nThe insurance broker Aon PLC also said Friday that the L.A. County wildfires will likely end up being the costliest in U.S. history, although it did not issue an estimate. Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.\n\nThe L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.\n\n\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.\n\nIn a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.\n\nThat\u2019s far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.\n\n\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.\n\nIt could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages of this disaster,\u201d Porter said."

Huang had said that such a deployment should take four years complete. The cluster is in a data center outside of Memphis, Tennessee, and will be used for all things GenAI.\n\nHeat rumors start up again, just in time for earnings\n\nFor the second time, reports of heat problems with Nvidia\u2019s newest processors came out right before the release of earnings. In this case, the report stated that due to heat from the Blackwell chips, servers needed to be redesigned to accommodate the heat. This was dismissed by Nvidia on its earnings call \u2013 and at the same time, Nvidia reported revenue gains of 17% compared to the prior quarter and 94% compared to the prior year.\n\nAI factory designs\n\nNvidia released reference designs for what it calls AI factories, or data centers dedicated to AI processing. The company had been talking about AI factories for some time, but this was finally a blueprint telling people how to build one.\n\nEdge computing platform for AI processing\n\nNvidia launched a new platform called EGX Platform designed to bring real-time artificial intelligence to edge networks. The idea is to put AI computing closer to where sensors collect data before it is sent to larger data centers. This serves as a buffer to whittle down the data sent to data centers so only relevant data is sent down the wire for processing. This can be up to 90% or more of data collected is discarded.\n\nVerizon, Nvidia team up for enterprise AI networking\n\nNvidia announced a partnership with Verizon to build AI services for enterprises that run workloads over Verizon\u2019s 5G private network. Dubbed 5G Private Network with Enterprise AI, it will run a range of AI applications and workloads over Verizon\u2019s private 5G network with Mobile Edge Compute (MEC), a colocated infrastructure that is a part of Verizon\u2019s public wireless network."

It is the process by which one of the most important cells that causes inflammatory bowel disease goes wrong.\"\n\nDubbing it a 'holy grail' discovery, he explained that drugs which are already approved for other illnesses such as cancer were able to calm this excessive inflammation - but they need to be tweaked to perfection to target the macrophages.\n\nDr Lee said he hopes that clinical trials will be underway within five years.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey are now keen to set up human trials after realising drugs which already exist seem to reverse the disease in laboratory experiments - so it's looking up for those with IBD.\n\nIf you didn't know, around half a million people in the UK are suffering from some form of inflammatory bowel disease, but Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both the most common.\n\nSufferers typically experience symptoms such as diarrhoea, stomach pain or cramps, blood in their poo, bleeding from their bottom, fatigue and excessive weight loss without trying.\n\nThere's obviously a big overlap between the signs of IBD and other similar conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but you can differentiate between the two as IBD causes inflammation in the bowels.\n\nAccording to the NHS website at the time of writing, it is 'not clear' what causes the disease, but it 'happens when your immune system attacks your bowel, which causes it to get inflamed'.\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to update the website as now it\u2019s very much clear."

What they describe is uncannily similar to the reconstructions of Homo floresiensis.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"It's a very small bodied, physically primitive member of the homo group.\"\n\nHe noted that the way the locals spoke about the Homo floresiensis species was not as if they were talking about a 'spirit' or a 'belief', rather an actual sighting.\n\n\"The descriptions all had a fixed form: it varied, as you would expect from different observers, but at the same time, all the different accounts lent plausibility to this idea there might be some kind of natural species,\" he continued.\n\nLocals are convinced that they've witnessed the species up close (Getty Stock Images)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Two young men from the UK, as a matter of fact, had been to Flores, mostly on a snorkeling holiday.\n\n\"And they, they climbed a mountain which I'm familiar with, and they claim they saw something that sounded very much like, very much like the ape men.\"\n\nForth's book, Between Ape and Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a Hidden Hominoid, tries to examine just why the Lio people were convinced that the tiny, ape-like creatures live among us.\n\nBut if you think that's crazy, Flores is also home to Komodo dragons and the world's largest rat.\n\nAdvert\n\nI think we're all less interested in the rat."
