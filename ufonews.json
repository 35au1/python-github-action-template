        "article_content": "We are not alone in the cosmos. Why isn't UFO hearing tearing up Google trends? | Opinion\n\nYou would think if anything could break through the noise of our news cycle, UFOs could.\n\nThis needs to be a bigger deal folks because the American people, nay people of the world, need this right now.\n\nLast week, for the second time in two years, there was a Congressional subcommittee hearing on UFOs, or as they have been foolishly rebranded \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d shortened to UAPs.\n\nOne of the visionaries helping uncover the truth is none other than Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman, R-Fond du Lac, who chairs the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nEditorial: Hovde's election claims are false. He's blaming Milwaukee \u2013 without evidence.\n\nLast week\u2019s hearing, \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" including a new slate of witnesses who provided testimony about UFO sightings and what the government may or may not know about them. One witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence officer, went so far to say, \"Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nAlien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials now in Congressional Record\n\nLast year\u2019s testimony included former Pentagon official David Grusch telling a Congressional committee that he\u2019d learned of a decades-long Pentagon program focused on \u201ccrash retrieval and reverse engineering\u201d of UFOs from other planets. Grusch also said that remains found at the spacecraft crash sites were \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d\n\nYes, crashed alien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials made it to the Congressional Record.\n\nHowever, neither in the aftermath of last year's and last week's hearing did the terms \"UFO\" \"Alien\" \"UAP\" or even \"government coverup\" break the 25 most searched terms in Google Trends.\n\nWhat were people searching for last week? Would it surprise you if I said: \"mike tyson jake paul fight.\"\n\nTo be fair, neither of these hearings has provided real evidence to prove UFOs or UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. But the collection of testimony indicates that UAPs are very real in the sense there are a number of as-yet-unexplained phenomena.\n\nAnd yet, apparently, most of us do not care enough to let that information even make a blip on our news cycle.\n\nAll the more reason that right now is the right time for these tight-lipped folks in defense and intelligence departments, whose jobs could very well be on the chopping block anyways in Trump's administration, to just let it rip.\n\nDeclassify everything. Tell us the truth is out there. Then send Biden and Trump out to do a tag team Bill Pullman-Independence Day-esque speech, where they encourage us to not be consumed by our petty differences and instead be united in our common interests. Give us a new enemy!\n\nOr at the very least, declassify everything just to remind humans of our standing in the universe. I don't know who said it first but right now feels like a good time for everyone to remember that we\u2019re, \"just ghosts driving meat coated skeletons made from stardust riding a rock floating through space.\"\n\nKristin Brey is the \"My Take\" columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: House committee answers questions we've long had about ET | Opinion"

        "article_content": "Some of those who spoke out last week lambasted the military and intelligence agencies for what they see as unnecessary \u2013 and even dangerous \u2013 secrecy shrouding what is known about UFOs.\n\nOn the heels of that hearing, Jon T. Kosloski, the newly-appointed director of AARO, will testify Tuesday before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nAARO released its latest report analyzing more than 700 recent UFO cases last week.\n\nLess than a week ago, whistleblowers in Congress rekindled the notion that high levels of government are concealing evidence of nonhuman intelligent beings and the mystifying vehicles they pilot.\n\nNow, the leader of the Pentagon's office to investigate UFOs is set to provide congressional testimony of his own.\n\nThat agency, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO,) came under heavy fire last Wednesday when a quartet of witnesses appeared before a House committee for its latest foray into the topic of UFOs.\n\nMany sightings AARO has historically investigated are reported by military fighter pilots, some of whom have captured footage on jets' cockpit gun cameras of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. The acronym has come to be the government's preferred term for what is still largely known among the public as UFOs, both because it's less stigmatized and because it includes objects seen in not just the air, but the water.\n\nBut despite the Pentagon's recent shows of transparency, some of those who spoke out last week lambasted the military and intelligence agencies for what they see as unnecessary \u2013 and even dangerous \u2013 secrecy shrouding what is known about UAP. The hearing was rife with both criticisms of AARO's March UFO report, as well as accusations that the agency engages in disinformation campaigns to discredit sightings and those in the military who report them.\n\nOn the heels of that hearing, Jon T. Kosloski, the newly-appointed director of AARO, will testify Tuesday before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nHere's what to know about the hearing, and how to watch it.\n\nUFO hearing:Here are the biggest revelations Congress heard\n\nWhen is the Senate UFO hearing? How to watch\n\nKosloski will appear at 4:30 p.m. EST Tuesday to testify before a subcommittee of the Armed Services committee.\n\nInformation on the nature of the hearing is vague, indicating only that Senate subcommittee members will \"receive testimony on the activities of\" AARO.\n\nVideo of the hearing will be available on the committee's website.\n\nHouse heard from UFO whistleblowers last week\n\nNews of the upcoming Senate hearing comes amid the latest round of testimony last week in the halls of Congress about unexplained objects violating U.S. airspace and shadowy programs to recover and study downed craft.\n\nFormer military members and others have for years described witnessing or recording baffling objects in both the skies and waters maneuvering in ways they believed to be beyond known human technology.\n\nLast Wednesday, journalist Michael Shellenberger testified that sources had informed him that intelligence communities are in possession of numerous high-resolution photos and videos of the craft unlike any of the grainy imagery that has so far been declassified.\n\nOne witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official, described a decades-long international arms race to obtain and reverse-engineer the strange vehicles so governments can bolster their own technology. In corroborating much of the testimony Pentagon intelligence official David Grusch offered in July 2023, Elizondo also accused the Department of Defense of hiding its UFO programs from Congress while misappropriating funds to operate them.\n\nElizondo lambasted the intelligence community for its decades of \"excessive secrecy\" around UAP reports \u2013 \"all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe we as Americans can handle the truth and I also believe the world deserves the truth,\" he said.\n\nLegislators have spent the past year pushing for new laws that would boost UAP transparency, with one seeking to create a civilian reporting mechanism, and one directing the executive branch to declassify certain records. But elected officials and UAP transparency advocates say it hasn't been enough.\n\nWhat is AARO? Pentagon reports have found no evidence of aliens\n\nAs Elizondo made clear last week, laws regarding classified information constrained him and Grusch from publicly presenting hard evidence to support claims of a crash retrieval program, which the Pentagon has repeatedly denied exists.\n\nFor its part, the Pentagon has overseen AARO since its creation in 2022 and created a website in 2023 for the public to access declassified UFO information.\n\nAARO has also released a series of reports with findings on various UFO sightings, all of which end with the same conclusion: That no evidence has been found to suggest that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial in nature.\n\nAstrophysicists, as well, have long cautioned that the absence of obvious natural explanations for UFOs doesn't make otherworldly ones likely.\n\nIn its most recent report released Thursday, a day after the congressional UFO hearing, AARO studied 757 reports of UAP between May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024.\n\n\"There are definitely anomalies,\" Kosloski admitted at a briefing last week, adding, \"we have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrial.\"\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

        "article_content": "In the last two years, Microsoft has invested a lot of money in the ChatGPT inventor Open AI and in its own AI developments.\n\nSince then, Microsoft has been equipping more and more programs with artificial intelligence, above all the Edge browser and Office programs. But AI is also finding its way into Windows.\n\nIn this article, we present the new AI functions in Windows, the Windows apps, and Microsoft 365.\n\nWindows 11 Pro Price When Reviewed: 199.99 Best Prices Today:\n\nArtificial intelligence: Copilot\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI engine Copilot has been part of the operating system since Windows 11 23H2 for U.S. users, and is available via the Copilot app in the Microsoft Store for others. It can be integrated into the taskbar or simply accessed via the Start menu.\n\nThe trick: The app simply links to Copilot in Edge, where the AI then runs as an independent program in its own window with a slightly different interface. However, Edge must be installed; the app will not work without the browser.\n\nYou can chat with Windows Copilot and ask questions, which the AI assistant answers with the help of Bing. It displays the sources it has used. You can choose between \u201cCreative,\u201d \u201cBalanced,\u201d and \u201cAccurate\u201d conversation styles.\n\nHowever, the differences are hardly noticeable. The AI can also write letters, articles, and poems. With the help of Microsoft Designer and the support of the open AI tool Dall-e 3, Copilot can also generate images based on descriptions.\n\nCopilot is directly integrated into Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser. You can ask the AI questions or have it summarize the currently open website. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nThe Edge browser has been equipped with Copilot since 2023. You can open the AI function via the icon in the top right-hand corner.\n\nCompared to the app, this has two advantages: Firstly, it allows you to ask questions directly about the website currently being accessed in the browser or request a summary of an online article. In the app, you can simply formulate a command such as \u201cSummarize this article\u201d and then add a link to the desired website.\n\nYou can also activate Copilot plugins in Edge, such as Kayak for searching for flights, accommodations, and car rental, or Opentable for searching for restaurants. This is not possible in the Windows app.\n\nCocreator & Imager Creator: Create images in Paint\n\nThe Windows drawing program Paint gets new features from time to time, most recently working on multiple layers and the AI function Image Creator were added \u2014 previously called Cocreator.\n\nFollowing this renaming to Image Creator, Cocreator is now available again in parallel, albeit with more advanced functions.\n\nHowever, most Windows users will not be able to use the new Cocreator, as it only runs on Copilot Plus notebooks (see box \u201cAI processors in Copilot PCs\u201d). The new Cocreator can now be found in the Paint toolbar alongside the Image Creator.\n\nThe Image Creator is a slimmed-down version of the Bing Image Creator available online and Microsoft Designer.\n\nAll three tools are based on Dall-e from Open AI and create images using descriptive text.\n\nYou simply type in what you want to see and Image Creator creates a corresponding image.\n\nThe Cocreator also works in the same way. However, while the Image Creator accesses Microsoft\u2019s server resources on the internet, the Cocreator works locally on the computer and uses the NPU or the AI processor of the Copilot Plus notebooks.\n\nLocal processing ensures better data protection, but Cocreator still requires an internet connection.\n\nDescribe what you want Image Creator to create and select the desired style. Mark Hachman / IDG\n\nThe Image Creator in Paint accepts your descriptions and generates images from them. You can choose between photos and different painting styles.\n\nRetouch photos with the Windows photo viewer\n\nThe Windows Photo Viewer, simply called \u201cPhotos\u201d in earlier versions, has had a generative erase function for a few months now. This allows you to selectively remove individual objects from a photo.\n\nThe software fills the empty space amazingly well in the style of the image environment, the editing is often not recognizable. To do this, open the photo display by entering photos in the search field in the taskbar.\n\nIn the program, click on the \u201cAll photos\u201d icon on the left or on \u201cFolder;\u201d here you can add a picture directory to the program via \u201cAdd folder.\u201d\n\nTo open, double-click on an image in the preview and then click on the \u201cEdit\u201d button at the top left. Now select the \u201cDelete\u201d command and set the brush size on the right-hand side.\n\nThe smaller the object to be deleted, the smaller the brush should be. Use the mouse to select the object to be deleted or the distracting area. As soon as you release the mouse button, the software starts working and retouches the photo.\n\nYou can use the delete function in the Windows photo display to mark distracting objects. The software removes them and fills the space intelligently. Microsoft\n\nAI processors in Copilot Plus PCs The use of AI functions is very computationally intensive. For this reason, AI operations are currently mostly outsourced to the cloud, i.e. to the global data centers of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others. This causes potential problems with data protection, as the prompts, i.e. your queries, also end up with the IT companies and can therefore be assigned to you. At the same time, the AI operations in the data centers consume a lot of money and energy. The Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge notebook is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor and thus belongs to the new class of Copilot Plus devices. Samsung This is why PCs have been developed that can also perform AI tasks locally. Microsoft certifies correspondingly powerful Windows computers with the \u201cCopilot\u201d logo. These new notebooks have been available since the summer, initially all models with a Snapdragon X processor from Qualcomm and Arm architecture. AMD now also offers a CPU for Copilot Plus, Intel follows with its Core Ultra 200V mobile processor. The CPUs in Copilot Plus PCs accelerate AI functions and calculations to such an extent that it is not necessary to move them to the cloud in most cases. These chips are known as Neural Processing Units (NPUs).\n\nDesigner: AI functions in the Microsoft 365 apps\n\nDesigner was initially only available in PowerPoint, but is now included in the Microsoft 365 word processor. You will therefore need a paid Personal or Family account to be able to use the AI functions.\n\nCorporate customers are currently excluded. With a 365 account, you can use Designer in the online version of Word and in the desktop and online versions of PowerPoint. The program appears in the \u201cStart\u201d ribbon in each case.\n\nIn PowerPoint, give your first slide a title and call up the Designer. It suggests various design templates that match the theme of the presentation. However, this only works in English.\n\nFurther reading: 9 free AI tools that run locally on your PC\n\nAdvanced AI function Copilot Pro only with additional subscription\n\nIf you click on \u201cTest Copilot Pro\u201d in one of the 365 programs under File > Account > Manage account > Account, you can play with the extended AI functions for the Office programs free of charge for one month. After that, the subscription costs $22 per month.\n\nAfter activation, the Copilot icon appears at the beginning of the line next to the cursor in Word. After clicking on it, you can send the AI a description of the type of text you need. For example, Copilot can write speeches on a given topic, create a template for a CV or write short stories.\n\nIn Excel, Copilot automatically creates formulas and sorts, analyzes and highlights data. However, this only works in the online version of the program and the files must be stored in a Onedrive or Sharepoint folder.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has made improvements in the meantime, the AI in Excel is still not as good as we would like it to be.\n\nIn Outlook, Copilot is also limited to the online version. There, the AI summarizes the content of emails and translates foreign-language emails into your language of choice.\n\nCopilot Pro can also compose messages itself based on a short description.\n\nCopilot Pro in the video editing tool Clipchamp and in Teams\n\nThe video editor Clipchamp offers a little more AI. The tool displays the \u201cCreate video with AI\u201d button on its start page.\n\nClick on it to call up an AI wizard, which you can use to upload the images and videos for the Clipchamp film. After asking for a few pre-settings, it combines the media into a new film. Music can also be added if required.\n\nIn the online version, you will find additional functions supported by artificial intelligence. These include a text-to-speech module and a presentation coach that provides real-time feedback on camera recordings.\n\nFinally, the Teams video conferencing software has received AI support: Users can ask Copilot questions during a conference or also use it as a writing assistant that automatically formulates chat messages after a few keywords have been entered.\n\nYou can also instruct the AI to summarize the content from chats and channels for you. The AI also translates foreign-language posts, which are displayed as subtitles in real time: However, \u201cLive Captions\u201d only runs on Copilot Plus notebooks."

This year\u2019s overarching theme was expanding generative AI\u2019s summarization and rewriting capabilities to address more niche use cases.\n\nAI translator agent can replicate your voice in Teams\n\nMicrosoft is going all-in on AI \u201cagents\u201d in an effort to further abstract the workings of large language models. Ideally for Microsoft, this would make those models more capable of autonomous, sequential actions. Microsoft Copilot Studio will enable autonomous agents soon, with this feature now in preview. Other major announcements around agents at Ignite 2024 include:\n\nAgents in SharePoint, available now, can answer questions about files, folders, or sites.\n\nA Teams Facilitator agent, which takes notes and summarizes meetings, is now in preview.\n\nAn Interpreter agent in Teams, which can replicate a user\u2019s voice in up to nine languages for real-time translation, will be in preview in early 2025.\n\nCopilot Studio will soon include images and voice content\n\nCopilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry will be more closely linked, with a Microsoft Agent SDK available for both developers to create custom agents. The Agent SDK, available now in preview, can draw from Azure\u2019s large AI model catalog.\n\nSoon, Copilot Studio users can experiment with multimodality in the agents they build. Image upload and analysis are now in preview, and voice is in private preview. (Private preview in Azure is invite-only.)\n\nSEE: As of this Patch Tuesday, Copilot PC users can remap the AI button.\n\nAzure AI Foundry offers new capabilities\n\nMicrosoft announced a new way to access AI in the Azure AI Foundry, a hub for AI models and solutions.\n\nAzure AI Foundry is accessible in preview through either an SDK or online portal and interoperates with GitHub and Visual Studio. Both offer slightly different options: the SDK helps admins and app developers evaluate AI models and test apps before deploying them. The portal replaces the former Azure AI Studio and offers management of AI apps, models, and services.\n\nRedmond also announced a service allowing developers to make and deploy AI agents. Azure AI Agent Service will be in preview in December.\n\nIn other Azure news:\n\nAzure AI will offer an AI scorecard containing \u201cmodel cards, model versions, content safety filter configurations, and evaluation metrics.\u201d The goal of AI reports is to help development teams complete audits and compliance reports.\n\nRisk and safety evaluations for image content will flag harmful content generated by AI. The go is to help with data-driven assessments of how often such content might appear.\n\nCloud professionals can now map out AI adoption in the Cloud Adoption Framework. AI workload guidance has also been added to the Azure Well-Architected Framework.\n\nAzure AI Content Understanding, now in preview, is a streamlined workflow for turning unstructured text, images, and video into a corpus of data. It packages together templates, grounding mechanisms, and confidence scores to help developers and enterprises release AI solutions.\n\nDevelopers can run AI workloads on serverless GPUs in Azure Container Apps, which are currently in preview.\n\nSecurity Exposure Management tool enters general availability\n\nIn the security world, Microsoft introduced a new service: Security Exposure Management. This service works in concert with Extended Detection and Response, Microsoft Defender XDR in Microsoft Security. It provides insight into an organization\u2019s security posture. Now available to all users, Security Exposure Management had previously been in preview only.\n\nDeploying Security Exposure Management helps raise awareness of an organization\u2019s attack surface, analyzes attack paths, and aggregates security posture data into \u201cUnified Exposure Insights.\u201d These insights, in turn, are translated into metrics to measure security initiatives.\n\nIn other security news, Security Copilot in Intune for workflow management will be expanded. Security Copilot will now be able to weigh in on a broader range of scenarios across Intune, the Intune Suite, and Windows Autopatch. Intune admins can now add iOS, Android, macOS, and Linux devices to their hardware inventory.\n\nMicrosoft announced several similar updates for Microsoft Purview, but we won\u2019t cover them exhaustively here. See Microsoft for more information about the 90-plus announcements from the Ignite event.\n\nCopilot+ PCs add flexibility to Windows Search\n\nStarting in early 2025, Search will look different in File Explorer, Windows Search, and Settings. Users can search for documents and photos using natural language, and an internet connection isn\u2019t required.\n\nMicrosoft encourages business customers to show off prompts to coworkers\n\nIn today\u2019s AI infrastructure, companies tend to produce tools that make adopting their AI products easier.\n\nFor example, Copilot Analytics, set to expand its features in early 2025, offers insights into adoption and usage trends to measure business impact. Additionally, Microsoft is gamifying AI adoption by enabling easy prompt sharing and introducing a prompt leaderboard. Both features will be part of the Copilot Prompt Gallery \u2014 formerly Copilot Labs. Prompt sharing will roll out with Microsoft 365 Copilot later in 2024, while an organization-wide \u201cnew and trending prompts\u201d list is expected in early 2025.\n\nOne new feature, generative AI controls in Microsoft 356 Copilot, encourages caution with generative AI. The controls will notify users if prompts or responses in Microsoft 365 Copilot contain information that might be sensitive or put an organization at risk. Admins can configure Microsoft Purview Data Loss protection individually to match the sensitivity of their organization\u2019s data.\n\nIs AI ROI panning out?\n\nIn a recent survey, Slack revealed that AI adoption might be slowing down. Why? Some people feel the technology hasn\u2019t lived up to the hype, that AI use is considered \u201clazy,\u201d or that they don\u2019t know how to use AI.\n\nHowever, in a November 2024 study, Microsoft reported a 10x ROI increase among \u201ctop\u201d business leaders using generative AI. Most AI use cases observed by Microsoft were focused on productivity.\n\nTechRepublic covered Microsoft Ignite remotely."

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, told BarrieToday the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford told BarrieToday, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, telling BarrieToday he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going. This thing would not stop with the motion-sensored cat balls and there were noises going on all in the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was standing there asking questions and we heard a little girl call out. We looked at each other like \u2018what the (heck) was that!?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoric said they went to explore where the sound came from, which is when he heard Maryk yelling from where she was in the building.\n\n\u201cWe started running back and she was where the doll was \u2026 and asked what all the banging was about,\u201d he said, adding neither he nor the employee\u2019s wife knew what his partner was talking about. \"We\u2019d just heard the kid\u2019s voice, which is where Shirley had heard disembodied voices in the area previously.\u201d\n\nBoric told BarrieToday it felt like a game of cat and mouse trying to track down the spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve encountered that a lot, and it sometimes gets a little annoying because you go thinking you\u2019re going to experience something and it just leads you around the building,\" he said. \u201cIt was a good experience and there was a plethora of (paranormal) activity.\"\n\nBoric ended up bringing the \u201chaunted doll\u201d home to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cI have her in the room with the other ones,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure her arm moved the other night, so I am setting up a security camera in the haunted room.\u201d\n\nSanford says she found the entire experience \u201cfascinating,\u201d adding she \"absolutely\" believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get scared over any of this stuff that happens. I am all for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen these guys came in, I saw it for myself. The white orbs and the one gentleman at the very end had forgotten something upstairs \u2026 When we got up there, one of the revolving showcases was on and (it) hadn\u2019t been on 15 minutes early when we\u2019d been up there.\u201d\n\nThe episode is expected to air on the Walking Among Us YouTube channel in January 2025."

        "article_content": "Alan Wake 2 was the game that fully connected the entire Remedy universe, but it all started with Control. Set in The Oldest House, home of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), Jesse Faden became the new director as she used her transforming gun and powers to defeat the Hiss. A DLC chapter connected her with Alan Wake, and now another piece of DLC for Alan Wake 2 has shifted the focus back on the FBC. Control 2 is the next chapter of this dark and paranormal story unlike anything else on our list of upcoming video games. It will still be a while before we return to the world of altered items of objects of power, so thankfully we have games like Civilization VII and Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows to hold us over, but there\u2019s nothing that can scratch that specific itch Control did. This is our declassified document on everything we know about Control 2.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on the lookout for the best upcoming PS5 games, we\u2019ve got you covered there too.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRelease speculation\n\nThere\u2019s no word on when Control 2 will launch as of now. The game was first officially announced at the end of 2022 when it was first entering production, but in October of 2023 revealed that the game was still only in its \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d stage. Based on that, we might not see Control 2 until 2026 or later.\n\nPlatforms\n\nRemedy games since Quantum Break have never been platform-exclusive and we don\u2019t anticipate that changing for Control 2. You should expect to see it on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at least, but possibly Switch 2 as well.\n\nTrailers\n\nNo footage for Control 2 has been shared yet, but it sounds like Remedy may be ready to show us the game soon based on how much it is talking about it. Who we play as, where, and what we\u2019ll be doing is all up in the air.\n\nGameplay\n\nNews from our Capital Markets day: \ud83d\udd26 Alan Wake 2 has sold over 1.8M units\n\n\ud83d\udd3b Control Ultimate Edition will release on Mac February 12th, 2025\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Control 2 will be an action RPG\n\n\ud83c\udf81 Control will receive a free update in early 2025, unlocking some previously released content \ud83d\udd0e\u2026 pic.twitter.com/AX1jqpNTkt \u2014 Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) November 19, 2024\n\nThe only concrete detail we know about Control 2\u2018s gameplay is that it will be an action RPG. This was revealed by Remedy Entertainment itself, which lines up with how the first game played. It will also have a budget of approximately $52.9 million. This is low for most modern games, but quite a bit more than the first game\u2019s $30 million budget.\n\nControl 2 will almost certainly still be a third-person shooter with various weapon modes, psychic powers, and skill trees. How Remedy expands on those elements or what it decides to add is yet to be seen.\n\nPreorder\n\nThere will be no preorder details until Control 2 has a solid release date. As soon as they are available, we will update this article."

Learn More\n\nMicrosoft introduced AI agents to its Dynamics 365 platform in October. During Ignite, the company announced it would add more agentic AI capabilities to other Microsoft products, such as SharePoint and Microsoft Copilot 365.\n\nHowever, enterprises will need to manage the many AI agents they deploy and understand whether these agents accurately follow workflows and can only access what they are supposed to access. Microsoft\u2019s new capabilities in Azure AI aim to help developers build evaluation tools and a way to manage AI agents at scale and solve precisely those issues.\n\nThe software developer kit for Azure AI Foundry offers a toolkit to customize, test, deploy and manage AI applications and agents. It lets developers bring control and customization to many AI apps brought into their tech stack.\n\nMicrosoft said the SDK, available in preview, has 25 templates developers can use with an integrated library of models to build in scale.\n\nThe Azure AI Foundry portal, formerly Azure AI Studio and also in previews, offers developers a visual dashboard for evaluating models and tools. The dashboard also lets people manage who can use certain apps.\n\nThe company said AI Foundry is integrated with other developer tools like GitHub, Visual Studio and Copilot Studio.\n\nAs agents become a more significant part of the AI ecosystem, enterprises want to figure out how to manage how these work together. Azure AI Agent Service lets companies establish orchestration frameworks for automated workflows.\n\n\u201cWith features like bring your own storage and private networking, it will ensure data privacy and compliance to help organizations protect their sensitive data,\u201d the company said.\n\nAgent management\n\nAI agents emerged as one of the big trends in enterprise AI this year and are poised to grow in the next year as more companies begin experimenting with them. Several providers, like Microsoft and Salesforce, offer customers access to agents or a no-code way of building agents.\n\nMicrosoft is also researching how multiple agents can work together through a new framework called Magentic-One.\n\nIdeally, AI agents would automate workflows without requiring human employees to keep prompting AI applications. Companies are beginning to use multiple agents, triggering each activity to build out their agent ecosystems. To ensure the agents do their jobs, some providers create orchestration agents that monitor and direct agents.\n\nHowever, enterprises still need to figure out the best way to deploy these agents across their entire organization without accidentally letting agents access data they shouldn\u2019t. Determining safety and performance for agents can also be difficult, as current benchmarks don\u2019t really capture agentic performance."

It can be set to create an automatic summary of important action points at the end of the workday, gather inputs from a team for a weekly newsletter, or summarize recent interactions with a client ahead of a meeting. The feature is now in private preview."

        "article_content": "Darien Craig and Brandon Echols have known each other since they were 6 years old in small-town Hayden, Alabama. They attended the same high school and even dropped out of college in tandem, they said on Friday's episode of ABC's \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nDuring that episode, the pair hit another milestone together: agreeing to an investment offer for their jointly owned business. Craig and Echols co-own Y'all Sweet Tea, which Craig founded in 2021 \u2014 after getting fired from his previous job, he wrote on his company's website.\n\n\"The week I got fired, I had $7 to my name,\" wrote Craig. \"With the last paycheck I received, I used the $300 from that check to purchase the first jars, sugar, and tea that would eventually catapult this idea.\"\n\nY'all sells its tea direct-to-consumer and in roughly 600 grocery store locations, mostly across the southeastern United States, Echols said on \"Shark Tank.\" It brought in $4 million in revenue, including nearly $800,000 in profit, last year, he added.\n\nThose numbers included a detail that the show's investor judges found particularly interesting: Y'all added flavored teas to its lineup last year, and sold 10,000 units of its first flavor, \"Georgia Peach,\" in just 35 minutes, Craig said. The first eight of those minutes were responsible for $100,000 in sales, he noted.\n\n\"When you're dropping that amount in that short period on your own site, that's rare,\" Kevin O'Leary said. Barbara Corcoran chimed in: \"Do you know how few entrepreneurs can make that claim?\"\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"That is beautiful. That is like beauty,\" Mark Cuban added.\n\n'You don't need me to tell you how to run this business'\n\nCraig and Echols asked the investors for $500,000, in exchange for a 5% equity stake in their company. Guest investor Rashaun Williams, a venture capitalist and minority-stake owner of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, quickly offered them $500,000 for 10%.\n\n\"I'll let you figure out if you want to go to Walmart, if you want to stay direct-to-consumer, or what balance of both,\" said Williams. \"You don't need me to tell you how to run this business ... I think you guys are a rocket ship.\"\n\nCuban and Corcoran bowed out. Y'all was a better fit for Williams' investment style, Cuban said: Craig and Echols noted that they hoped to eventually find an exit for their company, and a professional VC investor could help them grow enough to get acquired or go public.\n\nBut O'Leary wanted in. He proposed a joint offer with Williams \u2014 $500,000 for 20% of Y'all, which the two investors would split down the middle.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lori Greiner added another joint offer with Williams to the table: $500,000 for 15% of Y'all. O'Leary promptly lowered his offer to match.\n\nCraig asked if any of the investors would chip in another $250,000. They declined, with Williams saying Y'all could always raise more money in the future. After quickly deliberating, Craig and Echols accepted Greiner and Williams' joint offer \u2014 prioritizing the combination of Williams' VC knowledge and Greiner's retail experience over the stronger financial terms of Williams' solo proposal.\n\nThe quartet officially inked the deal at Greiner and Williams' proposed terms after the show's taping, Craig confirmed to CNBC Make It.\n\n\"Rashaun is an awesome businessman and Lori has so much experience in retail,\" Echols said on the show. \"It couldn't have been a better deal.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to include Craig's post-taping confirmation of the investment deal.\n\nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nWant to earn more money at work?
