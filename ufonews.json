(Youtube/The Age Of Disclosure)\n\nIn the trailer he said: \"The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\"\n\nHe praised the documentary on social media, saying: \"The Age of Disclosure is the most revelatory, credible, and historic documentary ever made about UAP, non-human intelligent life, the Government\u2019s involvement, and the bi-partisan disclosure effort.\"\n\nIf that's true then this is pretty much what all those UFO hunters and true believers have been waiting for, someone saying they have been a first-hand witness to the evidence of non-human intelligent life.\n\nAdvert\n\nAmong the other contributors to the documentary are various high ranking US politicians including the director of national intelligence during Barack Obama's time in office.\n\nMeanwhile, senior CIA official Jim Semivan claimed that 'UAPs are here, they are real and they are not human'.\n\nFormer Department of Defense official Christopher Mellon called it the 'biggest discovery in human history' while his fellow former DoD member Luis Elizondo said there was 'information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species'.\n\nIs this what we've all been waiting for?"

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019d no idea\u201d: The Pink Floyd song David Gilmour wasn\u2019t comfortable with\n\nWhen David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in late 1967, he had a mountain to climb. Not only was he drafted in to help his friends circumvent the astounding collapse in the mental health of their leader, Syd Barrett, but within just a few months, he\u2019d be required to replace his old friend. Gilmour had played in bands before, but supplanting such a revered titan of the psychedelic trend was a different matter entirely.\n\nAfter a period of cutting their teeth at London\u2019s UFO Club, which saw Barrett and the group hone their incongruous psychedelic style, they released their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, in August 1967. Blending Barrett\u2019s take on pop with an improvisational spirit, rock and pioneering use of studio effects, it was profoundly psychedelic but also something else. The record was as if Barrett had opened a tiny door in the back of his mind, allowing the listener to sample his surreal LSD-coated otherworld within. It was like a planet from the hit sci-fi series Star Trek with the surreal features of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland.\n\nDespite such an acclaimed and influential record, Barrett\u2019s mental health would sadly plummet not long after its release, and by April of the following year, the band had ejected him. They simply could not go on with a frontman who was so erratic and inconsistent. They were left to finish their highly-anticipated second album, A Saucerful of Secrets, without him.\n\nNaturally, A Saucerful of Secrets has always been regarded as an oddity in Pink Floyd\u2019s back catalogue, featuring a young group with a new lineup trying to find a way forward after Barrett\u2019s departure. This saw bassist Roger Waters step up as the band\u2019s leader, and each member shared songwriting duties to alleviate the burden.\n\nBecause of this transitional nature, A Saucerful of Secrets has also long been deemed one of the band\u2019s worst efforts. However, it does contain great moments that point to where they would head now that Waters was in control and Gilmour was impressing himself on proceedings.\n\nOne of these is \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019. Written by Waters, it tapped into the oddity of Barrett\u2019s work with Gilmour\u2019s noir-esque guitar line at the start, the over-pronounced English accent, and strange backing vocals. It\u2019s also significant as it saw Gilmour sing the majority of the lead vocals, and the serene moments of release, \u201cMrs Clegg, you must be proud of him\u2026\u201d, sonically evoke the later grandeur of their work on the likes of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nDespite \u2018Corporal Clegg\u2019 being a crucial moment for Gilmour and Pink Floyd, speaking to Guitar Heroes in 1983, he explained how uncomfortable the song made him feel at the time. Responding to the suggestion that he was trying to sound like Jimi Hendrix on it, he soberingly conceded that he had no clue what he was doing at the time. He was still forming his now-iconic approach to the six-string\n\nRecalling how uncomfortable working on the song was, he said: \u201cNo, not really. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was trying to play at the time to be quite honest. I\u2019d really no idea. What I was used to playing, the style I had, didn\u2019t fit Pink Floyd at the time, and I didn\u2019t really know quite what to do. Gradually, over the years, my style changed to fit Pink Floyd, and Pink Floyd changed to fit my style.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to characterise his style back then, the frank Gilmour replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think I had one really.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nAI is already reshaping industries and society on a global scale. IDC predicts that AI will contribute $19.9 trillion to the global economy by 2030, comprising 3.5% of GDP. This momentum is exemplified by the recent announcement of \u201cProject Stargate,\u201d a partnership to invest up to $100 billion in new AI-focused data center capacity. This is all indicative of the tremendous activity going on with AI development. On a single day, AI made headlines for discovering proteins to counteract cobra venom, creating a Star Trek-style universal translator and paving the way for true AI assistants.\n\nThese and other developments highlight individual achievements, as well as their interconnected progress. This flywheel of innovation is where breakthroughs in one domain amplify advancements in others, compounding AI\u2019s transformative potential.\n\nSeparating signal from noise\n\nEven for someone who follows AI developments closely, the rapid technological breakthroughs and diffusion across industries and applications is dizzying, making it highly challenging to not only know and understand what is going on, but understand the relative importance of developments. It is challenging to separate the signal from noise.\n\nIn the past, I might have turned to an AI industry analyst to help explain the dynamics and meaning of recent and projected developments. This time, I decided instead to see if AI itself might be able to help me. This led me to a conversation with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. The 4o model might have worked as effectively, but I expected that a reasoning model such as o1 might be more effective.\n\nI asked o1 what it thought were the top AI trends and why. I started by asking for the top 10 to 15, but over the course of our collaborative dialog, this expanded to 25. Yes, there really are that many, which is a testament to AI\u2019s value as a general-purpose technology.\n\nIn dialog about leading AI trends with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds of inference-time \u201cthinking,\u201d o1 responded with a list of trends in AI development and use, ranked according to their potential significance and impact on business and society. I asked several qualifying questions and made a few suggestions that led to slight changes in the evaluation method and rankings.\n\nMethodology\n\nRankings of the various AI trends are determined by a blended heuristic that balances multiple factors including both quantitative indicators (near-term commercial viability) and qualitative judgments (disruptive potential and near-term societal impact) further described as follows:\n\nCurrent commercial viability: The trend\u2019s market presence and adoption.\n\nLong term disruptive potential: How a trend could significantly reshape industries and create new markets.\n\nSocietal impact: Weighing the immediate and near-term effects on society, including accessibility, ethics and daily life.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the overall AI trend rankings, each trend receives a long-term social transformation score (STS), ranging from incremental improvements (6) to civilization-altering breakthroughs (10). The STS reflects the trend\u2019s maximum potential impact if fully realized, offering an absolute measure of transformational significance.\n\nLevels of social transformation associated with top AI trends.\n\nThe development of this ranking process reflects the potential of human-AI collaboration. o1 provided a foundation for identifying and ranking trends, while my human oversight helped ensure that the insights were contextualized and relevant. The result shows how humans and AI can work together to navigate complexity.\n\nTop AI trends in 2025\n\nFor tech leaders, developers and enthusiasts alike, these trends signal both immense opportunity and significant challenges in navigating the many changes brought by AI. Highly-ranked trends typically have broad current adoption, high commercial viability or significant near-term disruptive effects.\n\nTable of top 10 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for social impact. Specific use cases \u2014 like self-driving cars or personal assistant robots \u2014 are not considered individual trends but are instead subsumed within the broader foundational trends.\n\nHonorable mention list: AI trends 11 \u2013 25\n\nOne can quibble whether number 11 or any of the following should be in the top 10, but keep in mind that these are relative rankings and include a certain amount of subjectivity (whether from o1 or from me), based on our iterative conversation. I suppose this is not too different from the conversations that take place within any research organization when completing their reports ranking the comparative merits of trends. In general, this next set of trends has significant potential but are either: 1) not yet as widespread and/or 2) have a potential payoff that is still several or more years away.\n\nWhile these trends did not make the top 10, they showcase the expanding influence of AI across healthcare, sustainability and other critical domains.\n\nTable of top 11 to 25 trends for 2025 ranked on current commercial viability, long-term disruptive potential and potential for societal impact.\n\nDigital humans show the innovation flywheel in action\n\nOne use case that highlights the convergence of these trends is digital humans, which exemplify how foundational and emerging AI technologies come together to drive transformative innovation. These AI-powered avatars create lifelike, engaging interactions and span roles such as digital coworkers, tutors, personal assistants, entertainers and companions. Their development shows how interconnected AI trends create transformative innovations.\n\nThe flywheel of AI innovation: Interconnected advancements in AI technologies drive transformative progress, where breakthroughs in one domain amplify developments in others, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation leading to new uses.\n\nFor example, these lifelike avatars are developed using the capabilities of generative AI (trend 1) for natural conversation, explainable AI (2) to build trust through transparency and agentic AI (3) for autonomous decision-making. With synthetic data generation, digital humans are trained on diverse, privacy-preserving datasets, ensuring they adapt to cultural and contextual nuances. Meanwhile, edge AI (5) enables near real-time responsiveness and multi-modal AI (17) enhances interactions by integrating text, audio and visual elements.\n\nBy using the technologies described by these trends, digital humans exemplify how advancements in one domain can accelerate progress in others, transforming industries and redefining human-AI collaboration. As digital humans continue to evolve, they not only exemplify the flywheel of innovation, but also underscore the transformative potential of AI to redefine how humans interact with technology.\n\nWhy are AGI and ASI so far down the list?\n\nThe future is, indeed, hard to predict. Many expect artificial general intelligence (AGI) to be achieved soon. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said recently: \u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d However, that is different from saying that AGI is imminent. It also does not mean that all agree on the definition of AGI. For OpenAI, this means \u201ca highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d\n\nMark Zuckerberg said he believes that in 2025 Meta will \u201chave an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer\u201d that can write code. That is clearly economically viable work and could be used to claim the arrival of AGI. Perhaps, but even Altman is now saying that AGI is not arriving soon.\n\nSource: https://x.com/sama/status/1881258443669172470\n\nGoogle Deepmind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis said recently on the Big Technology podcast that AGI is likely \u201ca handful of years away.\u201d He added, however, that there is a 50% chance another one or two significant breakthroughs on the order of the transformer model that led to generative AI will still be needed to fully achieve AGI.\n\nSuperintelligence, too, could eventually be achieved in the next 5 to 10 years. Altman and Elon Musk have said as much, although the consensus expert opinion is closer to 2040 \u2014 and some believe it will never be achieved. Amara\u2019s Law reminds us that we tend to overestimate the effect of any technology in the short run and underestimate the effect eventually. If achieved, the impact of superintelligence would be enormous \u2014 but at present, this \u201cif\u201d precludes this from the top 10 list.\n\nChoosing the right AI collaborator(s)\n\nAfter taking on this venture, I discovered some crucial elements to consider in the choice of AI collaborators. While o1 offered valuable insights into leading AI trends, its cutoff date for training data was October 2023, and it lacks web browsing capabilities. This became clear when it initially suggested No. 12 for agentic AI, a trend that has advanced rapidly in the last several months. Rerunning the analysis with the 4o model, which includes web browsing, led to a more proper ranking of agentic AI at No. 3.\n\nPer ChatGPT: \u201cApologies for any confusion earlier. Given the rapid advancements and the significant attention agentic AI is receiving in 2025, it would be appropriate to rank it at No. 3 on the list of top AI trends. This adjustment reflects its growing impact and aligns with recent analyses highlighting its importance.\u201d\n\nIn much the same way, I had a conversation with o1 about the placement of AI in education, healthcare and life sciences. However, 4o suggested that their order in the ranking be reversed, that healthcare should be No. 11, and education No. 12.\n\nView from the 4o model on the relative ranking for AI in healthcare versus AI in education.\n\nI agreed with the rationale and switched the order. These examples show both the challenges and benefits of working with the latest AI chatbots, and both the necessity and value of human and machine collaboration.\n\nSocial transformation rankings\n\nBelow is a summary of the STS rankings, offering a comparative view of the top 25 AI trends for 2025 and their potential long-term impact. These rankings highlight how AI trends vary in their potential to reshape society, from near-term enablers like generative AI and agentic AI, to longer-term innovations such as quantum AI and brain-computer interfaces.\n\nSummary of the top 25 AI trends for 2025, ranked by how profoundly each trend might reshape society at its fullest realization.\n\nNavigating AI\u2019s transformative impact\n\nWhile some AI breakthroughs are here now or seem just around the corner, others like AGI and ASI remain speculative, reminding us that there is much more to come from AI technologies. Yet it is already clear that AI, in all its manifestations, is reshaping human affairs in ways likely to become even more profound over time. These changes will extend to daily life and could even challenge our understanding of what it means to be human.\n\nAs AI continues to redefine industries and society, we are only at the beginning of a dramatic technological renaissance. These trends, ranging from generative models to humanoid robots powered by AI, highlight both the promise and complexity of integrating AI into our lives.\n\nWhat is particularly striking about these 25 trends is not just their individual significance, but the interconnectedness of their progress. This flywheel of AI innovation will continue to amplify progress, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of breakthroughs that redefine industries and society. As these trends evolve, revisiting this analysis in six to 12 months could reveal changes in the rankings and how the flywheel of innovation continues to accelerate progress across industries.\n\nLeaders, developers and society must monitor these advancements and ensure they are directed toward fair outcomes, striking a balance between innovation and responsibility. The next five years will define AI\u2019s trajectory \u2014 whether it becomes a tool for societal benefit or a source of disruption. The choice is ours.\n\nGary Grossman is EVP of technology practice at Edelman and global lead of the Edelman AI Center of Excellence."

            "article_content": "Agentic artificial intelligence is set to transform business this year, replacing workers as the technology can think and make decisions, offering companies the chance to cut costs\n\nListen to this article\n\nAccording to Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025.\n\nLeading businesses in Thailand have begun to embrace agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to pilot selective tasks, in a bid to explore its benefits.\n\nThe term refers to an AI system with enhanced autonomy, decision-making capabilities and adaptability. Agentic AI systems autonomously plan and take actions to meet user-defined goals, offering the promise of a virtual workforce that can offload and augment human work.\n\nAccording to global research and consultancy Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025 that is poised to drive innovation, offering significant business benefits by providing a virtual workforce of AI agents.\n\nHowever, the implementation of agentic AI also presents challenges, particularly in ensuring that these autonomous systems are aligned with the intentions of both the providers and users.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish robust safeguards and guardrails that guarantee AI's actions remain consistent with the desired outcomes, said Gartner.\n\nThe company predicts by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, enabling 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made autonomously.\n\nFirst in the region\n\n\"In 2025, agentic AI will be a key trend, combining AI and automation,\" said Anothai Wettayakorn, managing director of IBM Thailand.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI marks a significant shift in the future of work, with AI agents autonomously executing tasks, collaborating with human workers, and driving value across businesses, he said.\n\nIn Thailand, IBM successfully completed a pilot initiative using generative AI (GenAI) to automate laboratory orders, enhancing patient diagnosis and improving confidence, quality and speed in treatment.\n\nThis collaboration took place with Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, an affiliate of Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Medicine.\n\nThis was the first agentic AI use in Southeast Asia for healthcare, said Mr Anothai.\n\nAfter an eight-month pilot and an investment of 10 million baht, IBM's agentic AI technology leverages existing automation in the hospital's laboratory and hospital data system to speed up patient services.\n\nThe initiative minimises repetitive tasks for doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij Lojanapiwat, faculty dean at the university.\n\nIBM's client engineering team worked alongside the faculty to build a model using IBM AI platforms to analyse and interpret doctors' notes, recommend treatment pathways, and automatically handle laboratory orders.\n\nAI can suggest pathology laboratory tests based on a patient's medical record and trends, and doctors can then verify the suggestions.\n\nOnce approved by doctors, the AI automates the lab orders and schedules the patient's follow-up appointments, alleviating the workload for both doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij.\n\nThe collaboration complemented the hospital's recent implementation of a fully automated medical laboratory system.\n\nBuilt on transparent, reliable data and global AI governance standards, this initiative was meant to improve service efficiency and support medical decision-making with accurate and comprehensive insights, enhancing treatment quality and speed, according to IBM.\n\nThe project eases high-volume workloads, reducing the time spent in the lab order process and on scheduling patient appointments. As a result, it cuts the time spent by patients in medical check-ups at the hospital by 30-40 minutes, down from the current 150 minutes, he said.\n\nThe hospital has around 1.6 million patients a year. For the project, physicians also help to train the AI system.\n\n\"This milestone highlights our vision to lead in service excellence, treatment and research -- not just in Chiang Mai or Thailand, but across Southeast Asia,\" said Dr Bannakij.\n\nDr Krit Khwanngern, deputy dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, said the system does not store patients' real names, instead anonymising them to protect sensitive data and comply with the Personal Data Protection Act.\n\nIn the future, the hospital will analyse patient medical check-up data and use it to offer preventive healthcare services on a more personalised basis, said Dr Krit.\n\n\"Agentic AI is leveraged with the digital improvements we've invested in over the past few years by integrating different systems from physicians, nurses, pharmacies, and electronic medical records for both inpatient and outpatient care. This provides a strong data infrastructure on the back end, which leads to improved services on the front end,\" he said.\n\n\"We also invested 300 million baht in cybersecurity to ensure strong capabilities to secure sensitive data.\"\n\nThe project was successful because of the ability of the hospital's in-house teams to work together with external tech experts, while its physicians have technical knowledge that can design systems to serve users' needs, said Dr Krit.\n\nThe hospital continues to adopt advanced technologies, he said.\n\nThe faculty piloted IBM's AutoAI to support the development of patient service apps, enabling data scientists to write code more efficiently and reduce development time for future apps that will enhance patient treatment and services, said Dr Krit.\n\nAgentic AI in banking\n\n\"2025 will be the year of agentic AI and we've been working on responsible agentic AI since the beginning of this year,\" said Ruangroj Poonpol, chairman of Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG), the technology arm of Kasikornbank.\n\nAgentic AI will be an essential tool for KBTG to accelerate its organisational transformation, he said. An AI agent can perceive, make decisions, take action and achieve goals in its own environment.\n\n\"It's a digital workforce without the need of a vacation, providing even more productivity uplift than before. We need to upskill, reskill, and learn how to use it and when to use it,\" said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nIn 2025, KBTG will focus on fostering collaboration between humans and AI, while ensuring a human-centric approach, he said. With human-AI convergence for value creation, KBTG's performance will be faster and more productive than ever, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nHe said this focus will be driven by a few elements, including the use of new platforms to efficiently manage AI agents, enabling seamless collaboration with human workers.\n\nOne of the platforms is AthenaMind, an internal tool designed as an AI agent creation hub, or \"AI agent factory\", for building AI agents for various applications.\n\nAnother element is an agentic orchestration, involving the design of new operational workflows to enable AI agents and humans to work together more effectively and drive business outcomes.\n\nFor example, KBTG introduced an AI coding assistant to improve software development, reducing software developers' working hours by 20%. So far, more than 500,000 lines of code have been generated using AI.\n\nThe next step is to evolve this AI assistant into a fully functional AI coding agent, capable of independently writing code from start to finish based on clear requirements, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nKBTG equips its employees with the right mindset, skills, and an open work culture to integrate AI into their daily tasks, he said. The company achieved 100% AI literacy, ensuring all employees are knowledgeable and prepared to work alongside AI technology in their roles.\n\nKBTG wants this human-AI convergence project to generate more than 10 billion baht in business impact by 2029, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nRetail uses\n\nAxel Winter, chief executive of Xponential, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform and innovation consultancy, said the opportunities for AI agents are vast in the retail sector.\n\n\"For example, agents could dynamically create promotions based on real-time data such as customer sentiment, inventory levels and sales trends,\" he said.\n\nThey can also generate and deploy marketing campaigns across various channels, which are particularly relevant in the fast-paced Southeast Asian e-commerce landscape.\n\n\"It's important to recognise not all AI technologies being promoted are fully mature, and the field is in constant flux. It is vital to remain flexible, keep a close eye on both established vendors and the open-source community, and be prepared to adapt and innovate rapidly,\" said Mr Winter.\n\nWidespread in 2026\n\nPhiphat Prapapanpong, director of advanced insights at Bluebik Group, a SET-listed tech consulting firm, said the adoption of AI-driven agentic workflows, which leverage GenAI capabilities with business processes, will emerge as a key trend in AI development.\n\n\"This year marks the beginning of the agentic AI era, with large enterprises -- particularly banks, insurance companies and retailers -- starting to pilot its use internally,\" he said.\n\nBy next year, Mr Phiphat said he expects agentic AI to become more widespread and transition into full deployment.\n\nHe said organisations piloting agentic AI aim to enhance employee productivity without additional hiring. For example, procurement processes can use agentic AI to seek better prices and sourcing.\n\nJob losses and opportunities\n\nPanutat Tejasen, a pioneer in AI development, said the adoption of agentic AI is accelerating because it can integrate with business workflows, delivering tangible results for return on investment.\n\nHe said many jobs will be replaced as agentic AI takes over tasks. For example, roles in customer service, procurement and data entry are likely to be automated.\n\n\"You will see machine agents communicating with other machines. A procurement agent, for example, will negotiate with a sales agent, with less human involvement,\" said Mr Panutat.\n\nHe said agentic AI will also open up new opportunities in software development.\n\nThanachart Numnonda, executive director of IMC Institute, a tech research and training firm, said agentic AI is still being used for specific and small-scale tasks.\n\n\"This opens up new opportunities for developers to build agentic AI services tailored for businesses,\" he said.\n\nMr Thanachart said he does not think agentic AI will make the SaaS business obsolete, as it still requires software as its foundation.\n\n\"Humans are still in the loop and work alongside AI,\" he said."

In addition, the trailing 12-month (TTM) trend in revenue shows that after a spike between FY21 and FY22 amid the post-pandemic boom, the revenue growth for each of the five companies has fallen below the levels seen five years ago, impacted by a slack in the demand for discretionary projects - long-term contracts which are transformational in nature - amid the rising focus of clients to achieve cost efficiency for existing processes.The TTM method tends to smoothen out quarterly volatility thereby offering a better understanding of the long-term trend. Considering the TTM dollar denominated revenue, the aggregate revenue of the top five IT exporters recorded a year-on-year growth of 2.4% in the December quarter, led by 5.3% growth in the country's third largest IT exporter HCLTech's TTM revenue at $13,771.8 million and 4% in $30,077 million revenue reported by TCS , the largest IT exporter. On the other hand Wipro and Tech Mahindra , the fourth and the fifth largest Indian IT exporters by that order showed a drop of 3.6% and 2.1% respectively in their TTM revenues. For Infosys , the second largest IT exporter, TTM revenue rose by 3% to $6,263.3 million.Though the December quarter TTM revenue growth for the sample was the highest in four quarters, it has been on a gradual decline compared with the growth ten quarters ago. For instance, it peaked at 18.1% in the March 2022 quarter on the back of a tepid 1.7% increase in the year-ago quarter affected due to the Covid pandemic. However, since the March 2022 quarter, it has gradually fallen.The top line growth is expected to pick up in the coming quarters amid hopes of a revival in discretionary projects. Each of the top companies continued to report a sustained momentum in new deal wins in the December quarter thereby improving revenue visibility. In rupee terms, the sample's aggregate revenue rose by 0.9% to \u20b91.7 lakh crore while net profit grew by 3.7% to \u20b928,126 crore in the December quarter. HCLTech reported the strongest growth of 3.6% and 8.4% in revenue and net profit at \u20b929,890 crore and \u20b94,591 crore in that order."

            "article_content": "Agentic artificial intelligence is set to transform business this year, replacing workers as the technology can think and make decisions, offering companies the chance to cut costs\n\nListen to this article\n\nAccording to Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025.\n\nLeading businesses in Thailand have begun to embrace agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to pilot selective tasks, in a bid to explore its benefits.\n\nThe term refers to an AI system with enhanced autonomy, decision-making capabilities and adaptability. Agentic AI systems autonomously plan and take actions to meet user-defined goals, offering the promise of a virtual workforce that can offload and augment human work.\n\nAccording to global research and consultancy Gartner, agentic AI is a top strategic technology trend in 2025 that is poised to drive innovation, offering significant business benefits by providing a virtual workforce of AI agents.\n\nHowever, the implementation of agentic AI also presents challenges, particularly in ensuring that these autonomous systems are aligned with the intentions of both the providers and users.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish robust safeguards and guardrails that guarantee AI's actions remain consistent with the desired outcomes, said Gartner.\n\nThe company predicts by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, enabling 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made autonomously.\n\nFirst in the region\n\n\"In 2025, agentic AI will be a key trend, combining AI and automation,\" said Anothai Wettayakorn, managing director of IBM Thailand.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI marks a significant shift in the future of work, with AI agents autonomously executing tasks, collaborating with human workers, and driving value across businesses, he said.\n\nIn Thailand, IBM successfully completed a pilot initiative using generative AI (GenAI) to automate laboratory orders, enhancing patient diagnosis and improving confidence, quality and speed in treatment.\n\nThis collaboration took place with Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, an affiliate of Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Medicine.\n\nThis was the first agentic AI use in Southeast Asia for healthcare, said Mr Anothai.\n\nAfter an eight-month pilot and an investment of 10 million baht, IBM's agentic AI technology leverages existing automation in the hospital's laboratory and hospital data system to speed up patient services.\n\nThe initiative minimises repetitive tasks for doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij Lojanapiwat, faculty dean at the university.\n\nIBM's client engineering team worked alongside the faculty to build a model using IBM AI platforms to analyse and interpret doctors' notes, recommend treatment pathways, and automatically handle laboratory orders.\n\nAI can suggest pathology laboratory tests based on a patient's medical record and trends, and doctors can then verify the suggestions.\n\nOnce approved by doctors, the AI automates the lab orders and schedules the patient's follow-up appointments, alleviating the workload for both doctors and nurses, said Dr Bannakij.\n\nThe collaboration complemented the hospital's recent implementation of a fully automated medical laboratory system.\n\nBuilt on transparent, reliable data and global AI governance standards, this initiative was meant to improve service efficiency and support medical decision-making with accurate and comprehensive insights, enhancing treatment quality and speed, according to IBM.\n\nThe project eases high-volume workloads, reducing the time spent in the lab order process and on scheduling patient appointments. As a result, it cuts the time spent by patients in medical check-ups at the hospital by 30-40 minutes, down from the current 150 minutes, he said.\n\nThe hospital has around 1.6 million patients a year. For the project, physicians also help to train the AI system.\n\n\"This milestone highlights our vision to lead in service excellence, treatment and research -- not just in Chiang Mai or Thailand, but across Southeast Asia,\" said Dr Bannakij.\n\nDr Krit Khwanngern, deputy dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, said the system does not store patients' real names, instead anonymising them to protect sensitive data and comply with the Personal Data Protection Act.\n\nIn the future, the hospital will analyse patient medical check-up data and use it to offer preventive healthcare services on a more personalised basis, said Dr Krit.\n\n\"Agentic AI is leveraged with the digital improvements we've invested in over the past few years by integrating different systems from physicians, nurses, pharmacies, and electronic medical records for both inpatient and outpatient care. This provides a strong data infrastructure on the back end, which leads to improved services on the front end,\" he said.\n\n\"We also invested 300 million baht in cybersecurity to ensure strong capabilities to secure sensitive data.\"\n\nThe project was successful because of the ability of the hospital's in-house teams to work together with external tech experts, while its physicians have technical knowledge that can design systems to serve users' needs, said Dr Krit.\n\nThe hospital continues to adopt advanced technologies, he said.\n\nThe faculty piloted IBM's AutoAI to support the development of patient service apps, enabling data scientists to write code more efficiently and reduce development time for future apps that will enhance patient treatment and services, said Dr Krit.\n\nAgentic AI in banking\n\n\"2025 will be the year of agentic AI and we've been working on responsible agentic AI since the beginning of this year,\" said Ruangroj Poonpol, chairman of Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG), the technology arm of Kasikornbank.\n\nAgentic AI will be an essential tool for KBTG to accelerate its organisational transformation, he said. An AI agent can perceive, make decisions, take action and achieve goals in its own environment.\n\n\"It's a digital workforce without the need of a vacation, providing even more productivity uplift than before. We need to upskill, reskill, and learn how to use it and when to use it,\" said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nIn 2025, KBTG will focus on fostering collaboration between humans and AI, while ensuring a human-centric approach, he said. With human-AI convergence for value creation, KBTG's performance will be faster and more productive than ever, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nHe said this focus will be driven by a few elements, including the use of new platforms to efficiently manage AI agents, enabling seamless collaboration with human workers.\n\nOne of the platforms is AthenaMind, an internal tool designed as an AI agent creation hub, or \"AI agent factory\", for building AI agents for various applications.\n\nAnother element is an agentic orchestration, involving the design of new operational workflows to enable AI agents and humans to work together more effectively and drive business outcomes.\n\nFor example, KBTG introduced an AI coding assistant to improve software development, reducing software developers' working hours by 20%. So far, more than 500,000 lines of code have been generated using AI.\n\nThe next step is to evolve this AI assistant into a fully functional AI coding agent, capable of independently writing code from start to finish based on clear requirements, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nKBTG equips its employees with the right mindset, skills, and an open work culture to integrate AI into their daily tasks, he said. The company achieved 100% AI literacy, ensuring all employees are knowledgeable and prepared to work alongside AI technology in their roles.\n\nKBTG wants this human-AI convergence project to generate more than 10 billion baht in business impact by 2029, said Mr Ruangroj.\n\nRetail uses\n\nAxel Winter, chief executive of Xponential, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform and innovation consultancy, said the opportunities for AI agents are vast in the retail sector.\n\n\"For example, agents could dynamically create promotions based on real-time data such as customer sentiment, inventory levels and sales trends,\" he said.\n\nThey can also generate and deploy marketing campaigns across various channels, which are particularly relevant in the fast-paced Southeast Asian e-commerce landscape.\n\n\"It's important to recognise not all AI technologies being promoted are fully mature, and the field is in constant flux. It is vital to remain flexible, keep a close eye on both established vendors and the open-source community, and be prepared to adapt and innovate rapidly,\" said Mr Winter.\n\nWidespread in 2026\n\nPhiphat Prapapanpong, director of advanced insights at Bluebik Group, a SET-listed tech consulting firm, said the adoption of AI-driven agentic workflows, which leverage GenAI capabilities with business processes, will emerge as a key trend in AI development.\n\n\"This year marks the beginning of the agentic AI era, with large enterprises -- particularly banks, insurance companies and retailers -- starting to pilot its use internally,\" he said.\n\nBy next year, Mr Phiphat said he expects agentic AI to become more widespread and transition into full deployment.\n\nHe said organisations piloting agentic AI aim to enhance employee productivity without additional hiring. For example, procurement processes can use agentic AI to seek better prices and sourcing.\n\nJob losses and opportunities\n\nPanutat Tejasen, a pioneer in AI development, said the adoption of agentic AI is accelerating because it can integrate with business workflows, delivering tangible results for return on investment.\n\nHe said many jobs will be replaced as agentic AI takes over tasks. For example, roles in customer service, procurement and data entry are likely to be automated.\n\n\"You will see machine agents communicating with other machines. A procurement agent, for example, will negotiate with a sales agent, with less human involvement,\" said Mr Panutat.\n\nHe said agentic AI will also open up new opportunities in software development.\n\nThanachart Numnonda, executive director of IMC Institute, a tech research and training firm, said agentic AI is still being used for specific and small-scale tasks.\n\n\"This opens up new opportunities for developers to build agentic AI services tailored for businesses,\" he said.\n\nMr Thanachart said he does not think agentic AI will make the SaaS business obsolete, as it still requires software as its foundation.\n\n\"Humans are still in the loop and work alongside AI,\" he said."

            "article_content": "After a blockbuster debut on the BSE in October 2024, when its shares listed at a 69.66% premium, Waaree Energies has seen its performance falter dramatically. The stock has plunged 37% from its peak of \u20b93,743, closing at \u20b92,355.95 on 23 January, 2025. The sharpest blow came on 22 January, when the stock plummeted by 10% in a single trading session triggered by the expiration of a shareholder lock-in period, which escalated its selling pressure.\n\nThe solar solutions company is navigating a volatile market, and investor unease has further deepened due to concerns over global trade policies, particularly in the US.\n\nAs the largest manufacturer of solar modules in India, Waaree Energies stands as a forerunner for the country's clean energy ambitions. However, its recent performance and strategic decisions reveal a more complex and evolving story.\n\nIndia\u2019s renewable energy boom and Waaree\u2019s role\n\nIndia is taking bold strides toward a greener future, setting an ambitious goal of generating 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based power by 2030. The country\u2019s solar module manufacturing sector is thriving, with 65 GW of capacity already operational and another 25 GW of cell manufacturing expected to come online soon.\n\nWaaree Energies, with its 13.3 GW installed capacity, is a significant contributor to this growth. Operating state-of-the-art facilities across India and with a global footprint spanning 25 countries, the company offers innovative solar solutions ranging from panel manufacturing to EPC services.\n\nHowever, while India\u2019s solar module assembly sector has seen remarkable growth, achieving complete backward integration remains a significant hurdle. Policies like the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) have fueled local manufacturing by requiring India-made photovoltaic (PV) modules for government projects.\n\nIn a recent interview with Moneycontrol, Waaree\u2019s CEO Amit Paithankar emphasised the need to extend ALMM policies to include ingots and wafers to bolster India\u2019s solar manufacturing ecosystem further. This policy push aligns with India\u2019s broader aspirations to reduce dependency on imports and strengthen domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe introduction of production linked incentive (PLI) schemes has further incentivized manufacturers to focus on vertical integration. Waaree\u2019s strategic decisions to expand its solar cell and wafer manufacturing capabilities reflect its commitment to aligning with these government initiatives.\n\nAlso Read: Waaree Energies earnings: A reality check as listing euphoria fades\n\nUS policy shifts\n\nThe anticipated policy shifts under the Trump administration, including higher tariffs on solar imports and a rollback of climate-focused incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have created uncertainty. These measures threaten to disrupt Waaree\u2019s key export market, with the US being the largest contributor. In fiscal year 2024, the company reported export sales amounting to around \u20b96,569 crore, representing 57.64% of its total revenue from operations.\n\nThe company\u2019s reliance on US demand highlights its need for strategic diversification, as the country accounted for 97% and 99% of India\u2019s PV exports in FY2023 and FY2024, respectively.\n\nWaaree Energies, along with Adani Solar and Vikram Solar, contributed significantly to this export surge, each shipping more than half of their annual production to international markets, with the majority destined for the US market. This heavy dependence underscores the importance of diversifying into other regions to mitigate potential geopolitical and regulatory risks.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty are concerns around global supply chains and fluctuating raw material costs. Waaree\u2019s focus on securing supply chains and pursuing backward integration into ingots and wafers may mitigate some of these risks, but challenges remain significant.\n\nAlso Read: No pre-emptive tariff cuts on US imports as India prepares for tricky trade dance with Trump\n\nStrategic expansion and diversification\n\nWaaree Energies has taken proactive steps to mitigate some of the external risks. The company\u2019s 1.6 GW solar module plant in Texas marks its entry into the US. manufacturing space, aiming to leverage local demand and bypass potential tariffs. Plans to expand this capacity to 5 GW by FY27 underscore its commitment to capturing a share of the profitable US market.\n\nAdditionally, the recent acquisition of Enel Green Power India for \u20b9792 crore is a strategic move to diversify its portfolio into wind energy and enhance its independent power producer (IPP) business. Enel\u2019s operational and developmental assets offer Waaree a foothold in the broader renewable energy landscape.\n\nThese expansions reflect a broader trend in the renewable energy sector. Waaree\u2019s plans to enter the battery energy storage systems (BESS) market and its exploration of electrolyzer technologies for green hydrogen production also highlight its forward-looking strategy.\n\nFinancial performance and market sentiment\n\nDespite all these challenges, Waaree Energies has shown some financial resilience. In Q2FY24, the company reported a 17% rise in consolidated net profit at \u20b9375.6 crore, with the order book standing at 20 GW, marking customer confidence in its execution capabilities, according to the company.\n\nWaaree aims to expand its solar module manufacturing capacity in India to 21GW by FY27. Furthermore, it plans to achieve backward integration by establishing 11GW of solar cell manufacturing capacity by the same timeline. By combining cell manufacturing with solar module production, the management anticipates a reduction in overall module costs and projects an improvement in blended margins by 2-3%.\n\nDespite Kotak Institutional Equities\u2019 \u2018sell\u2019 rating on the stock in its recent initiating coverage, the brokerage anticipates a 12% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in Waree's module capacity, reaching 40 GW by 2035. It also forecasts a 14%CAGR in module volumes through FY2035, driven by robust capacity expansions and high utilization rates.\n\nHowever, Kotak raised concerns about the stock's elevated valuations, which it views as unsustainable relative to peers. The brokerage also flagged risks associated with Waaree\u2019s reliance on US exports and the execution challenges tied to its ambitious vertical integration plans. While Waaree\u2019s entry into US manufacturing through its Texas plant is a strategic move, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties add to the complexity of its growth trajectory.\n\nNevertheless, the brokerage expects Waaree to continue its dominance, driven by rapid capacity expansion plans, and see it reach 19.3 GW module, 11.4 GW cell and 6GW wafer capacity by 2027. It also highlights that vertical integration is expected to significantly enhance Waaree's Ebitda margins, increasing from 13.8% in FY2024 to 23.6% by FY2027.\n\n\u201cOver the medium term, we believe that integrated Indian manufacturers and companies with local US manufacturing presence would continue to enjoy a competitive advantage over peers, resulting in superior profitability,\" it said.\n\nYet, the company must navigate heightened competitive intensity, which is anticipated to pressure margins by 2028, it added.\n\nAlso Read:Data dive: Dark clouds hover over India\u2019s solar story\n\nIntensifying competition\n\nWhile Waaree Energies leads the pack in India\u2019s solar module manufacturing, it operates in an intensely competitive landscape both domestically and globally. Among its key competitors are Tata Power Solar, Vikram Solar, Adani Solar, and RenewSys, which have also capitalized on India\u2019s ambitious renewable energy targets.\n\nTata Power Solar, for instance, boasts integrated operations that span from manufacturing to EPC services, giving it a significant edge in large-scale projects. Vikram Solar has established itself as a strong player with a robust export portfolio and advanced R&D capabilities. Adani Solar benefits from the financial muscle of the Adani Group and its focus on end-to-end vertical integration, positioning itself as a key rival in the Indian market.\n\nGlobally, Waaree also faces competition from Chinese manufacturers like Longi Green Energy and Jinko Solar, which dominate the international solar module market with their cost-efficient, large-scale production capabilities. This competitive pressure underscores the importance of Waaree\u2019s ongoing efforts to expand capacity, strengthen backward integration, and secure its position in critical export markets like the US.\n\nAlso Read: Real costs: Why solar and wind energy are not market winners yet\n\nPolicy and regulatory dynamics\n\nThe Indian government\u2019s support for the renewable energy sector, through initiatives like the PM-Kusum (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan) Scheme and the National Green Hydrogen Mission, provides a push for Waaree. However, the sector\u2019s heavy reliance on policy support also exposes it to regulatory risks, both domestically and internationally.\n\nGovernment policies have been both a boon and a challenge for Waaree Energies. Domestic measures, such as the ALMM mandate, trade barriers on Chinese imports, and initiatives like the PM-KUSUM Scheme, have supported the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nHowever, global policy shifts, particularly in the US, have created complications. The Trump administration\u2019s proposed tariffs on solar imports could make Indian exports less competitive while raising module prices in the US, benefiting Waaree\u2019s local manufacturing units.\n\nOperationally, the company faces challenges in maintaining high utilization rates across its manufacturing facilities. As the company scales up its operations, it will be crucial to ensure consistent quality and timely delivery to sustain its market leadership.\n\nRead more: Mint Primer | Trump\u2019s second stint: What\u2019s in store for India?\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWaaree Energies exemplifies both the promise and the challenges of India\u2019s renewable energy sector. Its aggressive capacity expansion, strategic entry into US manufacturing, and diversification into wind energy highlight its growth ambitions. However, external risks\u2014from global trade policies to competitive pressures\u2014remain significant hurdles.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to adapt to evolving market dynamics will determine its future success. For Waaree, success will be highly dependent on strategic execution, policy navigation, and investor confidence.\n\nMoving forward, Waaree\u2019s focus on integrating cutting-edge technologies and expanding its global footprint positions it as a key player in this transition. However, realizing this potential will require navigating a complex web of challenges, from regulatory hurdles to market competition.\n\nFor stakeholders and industry observers, Waaree Energies remains a company to watch\u2014not only as India\u2019s largest solar module manufacturer with a 44% market share as of FY2023-24 but also as a case study in the evolving dynamics of the global renewable energy market.\n\nFor more such analyses head to Profit Pulse.\n\nNote: The objective of this article is to share insightful charts, data points, and thought-provoking opinions.

            "article_content": "Combined tax cuts and tariffs on imports will only increase the national debt and inflation.\n\nIt was said of the Bourbons upon their restoration after the French Revolution and the rule of Napoleon that they had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. We have to wonder whether something similar might be said of President Donald Trump with his proposed economic policy to reduce the trade deficit. On his first day in office, he showed every sign of planning the same sort of policies to reduce the trade deficit that failed so miserably in his first term in office.\n\nOne thing that Mr. Trump did not learn in his first White House stint is that a country\u2019s trade deficit is the result of a country spending more than it produces. Or, as Keynes taught us, it is the result of a country saving less than it invests. As long as it invests more than it saves, it will have a trade deficit. The economic arithmetic remains true no matter how high a country sets its import tariff level.\n\nFailing to grasp this fundamental economic principle in his first term, Mr. Trump thought that hiking tariffs was a sure route to getting rid of the trade deficit. With that in mind, he imposed 10\u201325 percent tariffs on around $380 billion worth of imports from China, including a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and one of 10 percent on aluminum. Yet despite these tariffs, under his watch, the U.S. trade deficit increased by 40 percent from $480 billion in 2016 to $680 billion in 2020.\n\nThe basic reason for the widening deficit was that at the same time that he hiked tariffs, he enacted a large-scale tax cut in the form of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). According to the Congressional Budget Office, over the following decade, that piece of legislation swelled the budget deficit by somewhere between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. From a trade balance perspective, Trump\u2019s tax cuts had the effect of both reducing the country\u2019s savings level, as reflected in a widening budget deficit and increasing its investment level by providing corporations with tax relief. Little wonder then that the trade deficit widened in Mr. Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nFast forward to today, and Mr. Trump is proposing to repeat his earlier combination of tariff hikes and tax cuts, but this time on steroids. On the campaign trail, he committed himself to a 60 percent import tariff on China and one of 10-20 percent tariffs on the rest of our trade partners. Meanwhile, this week, he indicated that on February 1, he intends to impose a 10 percent tariff on China and one of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico. He has also ordered a review of the unfair trade practices of Mexico, Canada, and China, presumably as a prelude to further tariff increases.\n\nSeemingly unfazed by the fact that he has inherited a budget deficit that is some 6.5 percent of GDP and a national debt that is well over 100 percent of GDP, Mr. Trump is proposing to extend the 2017 TCJA and to eliminate income taxes on social security and tips. According to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, over the next decade, those tax cuts will add $7.75 trillion to the budget deficit.\n\nAll of this has raised serious questions as to the risks that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed economic plan poses to the U.S. and world economies. First, surely those policies must be expected to cause a further widening of the trade deficit as they cause the government\u2019s savings to plummet while incentivizing investment. Second, they must be expected to complicate the Federal Reserve\u2019s task of reducing inflation by increasing the domestic cost of imports. Third, tariffs of the size being contemplated must be expected to invite retaliation by our trade partners that could take us down the road to the 1930s beggar-thy-neighbor policies that were so destructive to international economic prosperity. Fourth, there is the very real risk that the Trump tariffs will push the already struggling and export-intensive Chinese and European economies into recession. That, in turn, could adversely impact our export sector, our financial system, and the profitability of our corporations.\n\nFor all of these reasons, we have to hope that now in office, Mr. Trump will substantially water down his campaign commitments to aggressive tariff hikes and tax cuts. Unfortunately, judging from his actions over the past two days, there is no sign that he will do this without some sort of financial market meltdown.\n\nDesmond Lachman as a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

            "article_content": "I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a Mario and Zelda machine ever since. It\u2019s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch\u2019s best trick \u2014 pick-up-and-play portability \u2014 while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.\n\nBut the Nintendo Switch 2, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be the console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use its detachable Joy-Cons\u2019 many tricks, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC \u2014 or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.\n\nThe Switch 2\u2019s newly magnetic Joy-Con. Gif: Nintendo\n\nThe Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. If history\u2019s any indication, it should easily sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was almost nothing to play but Zelda, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip \u2014 but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the largest and most welcoming libraries of all time, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.\n\nSo: How can the budding handheld PC revolution escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won\u2019t say I know for sure, but I did just check the industry\u2019s temperature at CES 2025, the world\u2019s biggest tech show \u2014 and I\u2019m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.\n\nHandheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck\u2019s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the 8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Lenovo Legion Go S, to the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2, and the giant 11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon, even the largest Windows handhelds didn\u2019t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.\n\nThere are four places I think the industry has to change \u2014 and maybe, band together \u2014 if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.\n\nA year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo\u2019s handhelds in particular. (The new one\u2019s on the left.) Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto\n\nOperating system\n\nBuyers need to know that their game will be ready to play when they press the power button on a handheld. That\u2019s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it\u2019s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded \u2014 but it\u2019s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.\n\nThat\u2019s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today\u2019s version of handheld Windows.\n\nFirst, Lenovo revealed it would produce the first authorized third-party handheld to ship with Valve\u2019s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows \u2014 something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds as soon as this April. Third, a Microsoft executive told The Verge that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining \u201cthe best of Xbox and Windows together.\u201d\n\nThese moves are heartening, as it\u2019s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn\u2019t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They\u2019re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too \u2014 to the point that today, a community-created fork of Valve\u2019s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience than Windows.\n\nIt\u2019s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we\u2019ve already seen the Deck can\u2019t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers don\u2019t see the raw sales numbers to bring big multiplayer games like Fortnite or Valorant to SteamOS. (They say cheaters are too big a risk.)\n\nBut, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet hard \u2014 not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won\u2019t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.\n\nNo other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, with a claim that was apparently false or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it\u2019d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.\n\nCES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they\u2019re not necessarily a bad idea! Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nScreen\n\nThis one\u2019s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should universally adopt a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.\n\nMany PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won\u2019t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld without a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate \u2014 VRR was the Asus ROG Ally\u2019s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals\u2019 chips offered the same FPS.\n\nLastly, HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s screen, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they\u2019re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It\u2019s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today\u2019s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.\n\nIs a screen like the one I\u2019m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.\n\nChips and battery\n\nUnless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom Aerith and Sephiroth parts for the Steam Deck feel like the only ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD\u2019s new Z2 line might not be all that different.\n\nAMD\u2019s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn\u2019t originally for handheld; they\u2019re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.\n\nThe Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it\u2019s looking at running its Legion Go S\u2019s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.\n\nAMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company\u2019s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC\u2019s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it\u2019s not a leap forward. That may require AMD\u2019s even newer RDNA 4 graphics, and it may require bespoke processors.\n\nThe MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath if you\u2019re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s why MSI hasn\u2019t fully launched the Claw as expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel certainly has bigger fish to fry right now than making custom handheld chips. \u201cIt\u2019s not a market that we\u2019re actively pursuing, but it\u2019s a market we\u2019re happy to enable,\u201d Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. \u201cIt is somewhat extracurricular,\u201d he added, explaining that it\u2019s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. \u201cWe\u2019re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.\u201d.\n\nSome manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today\u2019s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack \u2014 the Asus ROG Ally X doubled the size of its predecessor\u2019s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it\u2019s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can only be partially engineered away.\n\nWe need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.\n\nThe Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior. Photo by The Verge\n\nPrice\n\nThe PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo\u2019s lunch.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 \u2014 around $380 in today\u2019s money \u2014 and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve\u2019s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.\n\nOnly the least expensive model of Lenovo\u2019s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S will lower that bar to $499 this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it\u2019s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell said it was \u201cpainful\u201d but \u201ccritical\u201d to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the razor-and-blades business model where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that\u2019s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world\u2019s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.\n\nBut not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss less than a year after its debut. So it\u2019s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S\u2019s price, for example.\n\nTo compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of portable Xboxes or PlayStations or Steam Machines, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum."

            "article_content": "Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities made a number of prescient calls last year. Perhaps most impressive was his prediction that the Nasdaq Composite would reach 20,000 in 2024 as the artificial intelligence boom drove technology stocks higher. Ives remains bullish in 2025.\n\nThe first three industrial revolutions were driven by technological innovations in steam power, electricity, and microprocessors, and Ives sees AI as the driving force behind the fourth industrial revolution. Investment opportunities of that magnitude come along maybe once in a decade, perhaps even less often.\n\nImportantly, during a recent Bloomberg interview, Ives selected Nvidia (NVDA -3.12%) as his top stock pick for 2025 due to the company's central role in the artificial intelligence economy. Read on to learn more.\n\nNvidia is the reason modern artificial intelligence is possible\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center tasks like training large language models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Analysts estimate the chipmaker has between 70% and 95% market share in AI accelerators. And Forrester Research says, \"Without Nvidia's GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nIn a recent note, Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley wrote, \"The market tends to underestimate the difficulty of competing with Nvidia.\" Indeed, analysts generally expect the company to maintain its dominance for at least two to three years. One reason for that confidence is Nvidia's CUDA platform, a robust ecosystem of code libraries and pretrained models that simplifies the development of AI applications.\n\nAnother reason for that confidence is the company's full-stack approach to accelerated computing. Nvidia is best known for GPUs, but its product portfolio also includes central processing units (CPUs), interconnects, and networking equipment. That vertical integration lets the company build systems with a superior total cost of ownership, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nChristopher Rolland at Susquehanna recently wrote, \"Nvidia has become the world's de facto enabler of AI.\" He attributed that success to vertical integration spanning chips, adjacent data center hardware, and software. Overcoming that advantage is more complicated than developing better accelerators. Instead, competitors would need an entire ecosystem of hardware and software comparable to what Nvidia offers.\n\nIves says the artificial intelligence revolution is entering a new phase\n\nDan Ives recently wrote on X (the platform previously known as Twitter), \"The AI revolution is entering a new stage of growth and Nvidia and Jensen continue to be the foundation for this 4th industrial revolution.\" Also, in a recent CNBC interview, Ives identified two catalysts that could send Nvidia shares higher: the Blackwell GPU and physical AI.\n\nBlackwell is Nvidia's next-generation GPU architecture. Compared to the previous Hopper generation, Blackwell can complete AI training tasks up to four times faster and AI inference tasks up to 30 times faster. Production of Blackwell started to ramp up in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which ends in January 2025, so Nvidia should see substantial revenue from the new chip this year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang believes, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history.\" He also told attendees at the 2025 CES, \"The next wave of AI is here. Robotics powered by physical AI will revolutionize industries.\"\n\nIves believes Nvidia has a $1 trillion opportunity in physical AI as self-driving cars and robotics become sizable markets in the next decade. Importantly, Nvidia has already positioned itself to be a long-term winner. Like its strategy with generative AI, the company has a full-stack computing solution for autonomous robots spanning data center infrastructure, software development tools, and embedded processors.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a surprisingly reasonable valuation\n\nDan Ives is not alone in selecting Nvidia as a top stock pick for 2025. Harsh Kumar at Piper Sandler recently wrote, \"We are making Nvidia our top large-cap pick given the company's dominant position in AI accelerators and the upcoming launch of the Blackwell architecture.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase by 39% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 55 times adjusted earnings look very reasonable. But Ives believes that the consensus figure underestimates earnings by as much as 30% over the next few years.\n\nWhether he is correct or not, investors with a time horizon of three to five years should feel comfortable buying a small position in Nvidia today. However, investors should not limit themselves to a single \"best\" AI stock. It would be more prudent to build a basket of AI stocks that cover different areas of the AI economy, such as data center infrastructure, cloud services, and software."

            "article_content": "Joe Rogan has put forth an astounding theory on the polarizing case of the alleged alien mummies. Rogan's breakdown comes around a month after the tragic passing of a scientist researching the case.\n\nIn 2024, a New York Post report addressed the three-fingered humanoid alien mummies investigated in Peru in 2023. Speaking to the Daily Mail, American attorney Joshua McDowell, who'd claimed to have investigated the humanoids with an independent forensic team, asserted that the humanoids' fingerprints were \"straight\" unlike those of humans.\n\nThe Post alluded that Mexican journalist, Jose Jaime Maussan, presented some alleged mummified alien remains in front of Mexico's Congress back in 2023.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Edgar Hernandez published two research papers on the tridactyls, including the alleged alien mummy 'Maria.' The scientist reportedly passed away in a car accident in Huaytara, Huancavelica, Peru, in Dec. 2024.\n\nTrending\n\nGet the latest updates on One Championship Rankings at Sportskeeda and more\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nOn the Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) podcast's episode #2262 this month (January 2025), Joe Rogan discussed alien lifeforms and anatomy with Dr. Mark Gordon, a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) treatment and neurogenerative medicine expert.\n\nReuters recently reported that a press conference was held in Lima, Peru. Therein, experts suggested that the much-discussed humanoid remains, supposedly from Peru's Nazca region and of entities that were tridactyls (with three fingers), were humanoid dolls made by sticking together human and animal remains.\n\nJoe Rogan cited the 2024 New York Post report and alluded to the inbuilt three-finger structure, non-human fingerprint pattern (straight lines not spirals), and the indications that the humanoid referred to as 'Maria' might indeed be an extraterrestrial:\n\n\"They had a cranial capacity that is larger than most human beings ... It looks like a f*cking alien. But is that real? ... Look at that picture, what it actually looks like. That's f*cking crazy. That [Maria] does look like an alien.\"\n\nRogan emphasized how eerily similar it was to the archetype of the 'Greys' aka 'Grey aliens,' an oft-utilized alien representation in pop culture. It entails that an alien/ET is generally a grey-colored entity with a small hairless body, enlarged head, and large peculiar black eyes:\n\n\"What is that? If it's got three fingers and three toes, and it's got an alien face -- it looks like a 'Grey' [Grey alien]. It has a tiny slot for a mouth and tiny dots for a nose. It looks like the archetypal angel, or the archetypal alien rather, that people see in the [movie] 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'

Many ufologists and ET/alien lifeform enthusiasts have often accused the U.S. government as well as other countries' governments of concealing alien remains and technologies from the general populace.\n\nBack in Feb. 2023, the American government shot down a few objects that some believed were Chinese spy balloons. The government had implied that the objects weren't ETs/ET-related technology. Nevertheless, Joe Rogan took to Instagram and jestingly reaffirmed his stance that the government was probably concealing alien-related knowledge. He wrote:\n\n\"Now all of a sudden I think it actually is aliens. #lookintoit\"\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Tim Burchett has brought up his theory about underwater alien activity.\n\nTennessee Representative Tim Burchett has taken the trending extraterrestrial conversation to the depths of Earth\u2019s oceans.\n\nAccording to a report from WREG Memphis News Channel 3 (via The Hill), The Republican congressman has openly declared his belief that aliens might be operating secret underwater bases right here on our planet. Burchett\u2019s claims are now making waves in Washington and beyond due to the interesting intersection between religion and science that his beliefs clash on.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s One America News show, he clearly states that he arrived at this point base on his thought process of the unlimited power of the most high. \u201cI just think travelin\u2019 light years, I think it happens,\u201d Burchett said. Burchett also pondered the unimaginable distances aliens might travel to reach Earth.\n\n\u201cThe light from those stars that we see at night left there before the time of Christ,\u201d he added, mixing astronomy and theology in his explanation.\n\nBurchett\u2019s fascination with the unknown isn\u2019t new. Last year in April, following a classified briefing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), he hinted that the U.S. government is deliberately withholding information about these mysterious occurrences.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a cover-up,\u201d Burchett alleged. \u201cWe\u2019ve had departments tell us that they have recovery units, but they won\u2019t release full reports. Everything\u2019s covered up.\u201d\n\nThe congressman\u2019s interest in aliens gained momentum in the summer of 2023, when whistleblowers came forward during a series of UAP hearings. These insiders alleged that the government has long concealed evidence of advanced crafts of either foreign or extraterrestrial origin.\n\nBurchett took action by requesting the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general investigate these shocking claims. Burchett described one case that had him particularly spooked. \u201cWhen they tell me something\u2019s moving at hundreds of miles an hour underwater, and our capabilities\u2026and these things, this one was, it was large as a football field underwater,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this was a documented case, and\u2026and I have an admiral telling me this stuff.\u201d he said.\n\nBurchett has even led efforts to establish a UAP caucus in the House, joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers demanding greater transparency from the military on all things alien. With tens of millions spent on mysterious investigations, Burchett believes Americans deserve the full story\u2014even if it means unearthing secrets that sound straight out of a sci-fi movie.\n\nInterestingly, Burchett isn\u2019t the first U.S. lawmaker to explore the outer edges of plausibility. One prominent example of recent congressional conspiracy theories involves Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). In 2018, she speculated about a secretive \u201cspace laser\u201d potentially being used to start wildfires in California.\n\nThe theory, which linked wildfires to a powerful and shadowy elite, was widely debunked and criticized but highlighted her willingness to amplify far-fetched claims. Her comments about various conspiracy theories, including QAnon, have sparked national debates and raised concerns about the influence of such ideas within government institutions."

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered how certain problems are so complex that even the fastest computers struggle to solve them? These types of problems are often found in industries like transportation, finance, healthcare, and science. They\u2019re called \u201coptimization problems,\u201d where the goal is to find the best solution out of many possible options.\n\nWhile regular computers (called \u201cclassical computers\u201c) are great for many tasks, they can have a hard time handling these massive challenges. Enter quantum computers.\n\nQuantum computers are an exciting new kind of technology that could change the way we solve difficult problems, especially Quantum Computing Problems. Instead of using regular computer bits (which are like tiny on/off switches), quantum computers use something called \u201cquantum bits,\u201d or qubits.\n\nQubits are super special because they follow the rules of quantum physics, which means they can process information in ways that classical computers can\u2019t. This makes quantum computers much more powerful at solving certain types of puzzles.\n\nWhat Are Optimization Problems?\n\nOptimization problems sound fancy, but you deal with them every day without even realizing it. Imagine you\u2019re trying to pick the fastest route to school on a map, or you\u2019re deciding how to spend your pocket money to get the best value. These are simple examples of optimization problems\u2014finding the best option out of many choices.\n\nNow imagine you work at an airport and have to decide the best way to schedule hundreds of flights, manage thousands of bags, and make everything run smoothly without delays. Or maybe you work for a delivery company and you want to find the most efficient way to deliver millions of packages across the country. These problems are way too complicated to solve with just guesswork!\n\nRegular computers try to solve these tough problems by testing every possible solution one by one, which can take an enormous amount of time. Even supercomputers may need days, months, or even years to do the job, depending on how big the problem is.\n\nWhat Makes Quantum Computers Different?\n\nQuantum computers are special because they use principles from quantum mechanics, a branch of science that studies the tiniest building blocks of our universe\u2014like atoms and particles. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be in multiple states at once, thanks to something called \u201csuperposition.\u201d This allows quantum computers to look at many possible solutions simultaneously, instead of one by one.\n\nQuantum computers also use something called \u201centanglement,\u201d where qubits are connected in a way that lets them share information instantly. These features allow quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nFor optimization problems, this means quantum computers can solve puzzles with millions (or even billions!) of possibilities in a fraction of the time it would take a classical computer.\n\nThis breakthrough is particularly exciting for industries like logistics, where the rise of technology has revolutionized traditional operations. If you interested in exploring this further, can check out our blog, \u201cF2000s and the Rise of Technology in Logistics,\u201d to learn how advanced computing and innovation are shaping supply chains globally.\n\nReal-Life Benefits of Quantum Computing in Optimization\n\nNow that we understand how quantum computers work, let\u2019s explore some real-life benefits for solving optimization problems.\n\n1. Faster Deliveries and Better Logistics\n\nHave you ever ordered something online and tracked its delivery route? Companies like Amazon or FedEx need to figure out the fastest and cheapest way to deliver packages to millions of customers. Using quantum computers, these companies could create better delivery plans in real time, saving money and ensuring you get your package as quickly as possible.\n\n2. Smarter Traffic Management\n\nTraffic jams are another optimization challenge. Cities around the world face growing traffic problems as more and more cars hit the roads. Quantum computing can help plan better traffic flows, reduce congestion, and make public transportation more efficient. This could save time, lower fuel usage, and reduce pollution!\n\n3. Improved Healthcare Scheduling\n\nHospitals deal with optimization problems all the time, like scheduling surgeries, assigning doctors, and managing beds for patients. Quantum computers could help hospitals make better schedules that improve patient care and reduce waiting times. This means more lives saved and a smoother healthcare experience.\n\n4. More Accurate Financial Predictions\n\nBanks and investment companies often deal with risky decisions, like where to invest money or how to predict market changes. These are complex optimization problems that involve analyzing a huge amount of data. Quantum computers could help make faster and smarter financial decisions, which could stabilize markets and improve the global economy.\n\n5. Advancing Science and Research\n\nFrom designing new medicines to improving renewable energy systems, scientists rely on optimization to solve tough problems. Quantum computers can speed up this research and bring us closer to breakthroughs in important areas like curing diseases or fighting climate change.\n\nChallenges and the Future of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computers sound amazing, but they\u2019re not perfect yet. Building and maintaining them is incredibly hard. They need to be kept in extremely cold environments and are still in the early stages of development. Right now, only a few companies and research labs have working quantum computers.\n\nStill, progress is happening quickly. Scientists and engineers are working hard to make quantum computers more powerful and accessible. Many believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, we\u2019ll see quantum computing become a common tool for solving real-world problems.\n\nWhy Should You Care About Quantum Computing?\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a scientist or an engineer, quantum computing is something exciting to keep an eye on. The benefits it could bring, from better technologies to smarter ways of solving problems, have the potential to impact nearly every part of our lives. Quantum computing could lead to a better, more efficient, and more sustainable future.\n\nThink of quantum computers like the superheroes of the technology world. They take on the toughest challenges and uncover solutions that normal computers just can\u2019t handle. And who knows? Maybe one day you\u2019ll be working on quantum computing or benefiting from its amazing advancements!\n\nQuantum computing may still sound like science fiction to some, but it\u2019s quickly becoming a reality. Its ability to solve advanced optimization problems could transform industries and improve the world in countless ways.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless, and we\u2019re just getting started!

AI helps us learn faster, better, and in more detail. It is no longer necessary to master English to access knowledge. AI makes learning available native languages. \u2014 Sam Samdani interim chief executive officer of QuantumCT\n\n\"The world is connected now. So, work done in Bangladesh can be useful in other countries and developments in other places can also help in Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\n\"Our students and business executives must be equipped to understand foundational sciences like quantum physics and find ways to apply them in real-world contexts.\"\n\nSamdani emphasised that quantum physics opens the doors to innovation across sectors. Drawing attention to existing breakthroughs like lasers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), he urged students and researchers to explore the \"strange phenomena\" of quantum effects and repurpose them for local applications.\n\nFor instance, he mentioned the potential of quantum-based sensors to revolutionise medical imaging with unprecedented resolution, enabling early detection of diseases.\n\nSome of these advancements are already in late-stage development and could hit the market within the next few years, he noted.\n\nAccording to him, Bangladesh needs a talent pipeline that is well-versed in quantum physics, mathematics, and AI to leverage these technologies effectively.\n\nSamdani also emphasised the importance of nurturing curiosity among young students and fostering a culture of learning.\n\n\"This is the best time to be alive. AI helps us learn faster, better, and in more detail,\" he said. \"It is no longer necessary to master English to access knowledge. AI makes learning available in Bangla and other native languages.\"\n\nSamdani underscored that investing in a mindset change is key to advancing these technologies. He suggested businesses focus on partnerships with global firms to adopt and adapt advanced technologies for local needs.\n\nCiting examples of cost-effective adaptations, Samdani said technologies like MRI machines, which are often expensive in their original form, can be modified to create affordable versions suitable for developing countries.\n\n\"Quantum physics, AI, and biotechnology are converging fields that offer immense opportunities for creativity and innovation,\" he added.\n\nSamdani urged the government to prioritise \"knowledge diplomacy\" by creating platforms for information exchange and collaboration.\n\nHe proposed establishing an online clearing house for quantum technologies, potentially hosted by institutions like the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.\n\n\"Knowledge diplomacy will be the soft power of the future, more impactful than traditional arms diplomacy,\" he remarked.\n\nAddressing the event, M Tamim, vice-chancellor of Independent University, Bangladesh, remarked on the human brain's difficulty in comprehending quantum phenomena, such as particles existing in two places simultaneously.\n\nDespite this complexity, quantum physics is now being applied to computing and communication, he said.\n\nHowever, Tamim raised ethical concerns, such as cloning and the blending of physical and digital realms, which are already emerging globally.\n\nHe noted that Bangladesh lags behind in adopting cutting-edge technology and highlighted the energy-intensive nature of quantum computing and AI.\n\nHe emphasised that universities must prepare students to tackle these challenges and take the lead in advancing such transformative technologies.\n\nThe event was also addressed by M Asis Ud Dowla, former president of MCCI, Kamran T Rahman, president of MCCI, Habibullah N Karim, senior vice-president of MCCI, and Farooq Ahmed, secretary general of MCCI."

            "article_content": "\u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d by Yuval Noah Harari is a sweeping and insightful exploration of our species\u2019 journey from its humble beginnings to the present day.\n\nSapiens explores the rise of Homo sapiens through key revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Scientific Revolution. This groundbreaking book examines how human history is shaped by \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies \u2013 that enable unparalleled cooperation. Harari investigates the impact of these revolutions on human society, from the dawn of agriculture and the rise of civilizations to the challenges of the modern world, including climate change, technological disruption, and the search for meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution: The book begins by examining the unique cognitive abilities that set Homo sapiens apart from other animals. Around 70,000 years ago, a \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d occurred, leading to the development of advanced language and the ability to create and believe in \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies. These shared fictions, while not objectively real, allow humans to cooperate flexibly on a massive scale, a feat unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This cooperation enabled the development of complex social structures, from small tribes to vast empires.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution: Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. This seemingly revolutionary shift, however, brought about significant drawbacks. Agriculture led to increased inequality, disease, and environmental degradation. Farmers, despite working harder than hunter-gatherers, often had less leisure time and a poorer diet. The domestication of plants and animals also led to the suffering of countless creatures.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution: Beginning in the 16th century, the Scientific Revolution challenged religious dogma and ushered in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Science provided humans with new tools and knowledge, allowing them to manipulate the natural world on an unprecedented scale. This revolution, however, also brought about new challenges, such as climate change, nuclear war, and the potential for technological disruption.\n\nModern Challenges: Harari explores the profound challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. These include climate change, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. He raises critical questions about the meaning of happiness, the future of humanity, and our relationship with technology.\n\nKey Themes:"
