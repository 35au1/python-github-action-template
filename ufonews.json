        "article_content": "UFOs came to Washington again last week.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. at 11:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday, Nov. 13. Unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) is a relatively new catch-all term that includes sightings of unexplained objects or events that take place in the air, underwater, in space, or that travel between those domains.\n\nLike previous congressional UFO hearings, the event featured testimony from current U.S. military personnel who claim the American government has for decades hidden evidence of advanced technologies and otherworldly visitors from the public. A multitude of anecdotes were presented about flying orbs coming out of the ocean, disc-shaped objects, and craft \"exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal.\" While such claims are nothing new, what is noteworthy about the hearing are the pedigrees of some of the whistleblowers who testified, including a former U.S. counterintelligence officer, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former NASA associate administrator. All of them stressed the need for more government transparency, less stigma about the UFO topic and new policies to bring UAP data out of the \"black\" classified world and into the public domain.\n\nA still from a video titled \"Go Fast\" recorded by a U.S. Navy aircraft reportedly showing a UAP that was discussed in the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth\" on Wednesday (Nov. 13). (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nThis isn't the U.S. government's first attempt to investigate the recent wave of UFO claims that began in 2017. A similar hearing was held last year, in which a whistleblower told Congress the U.S. government is hiding evidence of 'non-human intelligence.'\n\nThe Pentagon also created the All-Doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAP reports and government data about UFOs, but critics, including some government officials, are skeptical of the office's aims and methods.\n\nRelated: SETI searches for alien life in over 1,000 galaxies using unexplored radio frequencies\n\n\"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\"\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOther representatives stressed the need for transparency and data analysis, a common theme of other recent UAP studies. \"We have evidence that what we are detecting things, and we know that we don't understand them, and this is worth investigating,\" Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said. \"I believe we can always be more transparent. To me, this hearing and others are simply about the truth and getting to the facts of what these UAPs actually are.\"\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former U.S. counterintelligence officer who has been vocal about such claims in recent years, told the assembled representatives at the hearing that \"excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public \u2014 all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" Elizondo stated during his testimony.\n\nElizondo, who claims to have previously investigated UFOs as part of a secret Pentagon program, suggested that the U.S. government create a \"whole-of-government\" approach to studying UAP, create a national UAP strategy and offer protections so that whistleblowers who are \"desperate to do the right thing can come forward without fear.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Elizondo was asked if some of the \"advanced technologies\" that have been seen monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe could be operated by aliens or private companies. \"Maybe both,\" Elizondo replied.\n\nElizondo also stated point-blank to Rep. Mace's questioning that the U.S. government has programs to retrieve crashed UAP and reverse-engineer them, but avoided giving any specifics in an unclassified public setting such as the hearing.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) then questioned Elizondo, asking the former counterintelligence agent about a document he signed that limits him from speaking publicly about crash retrieval programs. \"The document said you can't talk about crash retrieval. Well, you know, you can't talk about Fight Club if there's no Fight Club, correct?\"\n\nLike other witnesses, Elizondo stated that the alleged excessive government secrecy around UFOs harms national security. In response to questioning from Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Elizondo stated that, if UAP sightings turned out to be technologies operated by adversarial nations, it would be \"an intelligence failure eclipsing 9/11 in order of magnitude.\"\n\nA still from footage shot by an MQ-9 reaper drone showing an unidentified spherical object soaring through the air shown to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services during an April 2023 hearing. (Image credit: U.S. Dept. of Defense)\n\nRetired U.S. Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet offered similar testimony as Elizondo. \"We know from last year's UAP hearing and recent statements and publications by credible whistleblowers that UAP, NHI [non-human intelligence], and their technology of unknown origin (TUO) represent a new realization that we are not the only advanced intelligence in the universe,\" Gallaudet said on Wednesday, according to his published remarks.\n\n\"Unelected officials in the U.S. government do not have an exclusive right to this knowledge about the nature of reality. The American people have a right to that knowledge,\" Gallaudet said. The retired rear admiral also stressed the national security and airspace safety concerns related with UAP sightings, calling them \"extensive.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Garcia asked Gallaudet and other witnesses what UAP might represent, the retired rear admiral said he believes they are evidence of a \"non-human higher intelligence.\"\n\nFormer NASA Associate Administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold also testified at the hearing, and previously served on NASA's UAP study team. Gold's testimony was more grounded; for example, he stressed the need for NASA to contribute its authority and expertise toward analyzing what UAP data it might already possess and helping dispel the stigma associated with the UFO topic.\n\n\"Our best tool for unlocking the mystery of UAP is science, but we cannot conduct a proper inquiry if the stigma is so overwhelming that just daring to be part of a NASA search team elicits such a vitriolic response,\" Gold said during the hearing. \"Therefore, one of the most important actions that can be taken, relative to exposing the truth of UAP, is to combat the stigma, and this is where I believe that NASA can be eminently helpful.\"\n\nGold added that NASA has a massive archive of data that could possibly contain evidence of UAP, and suggested that artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms could help sort through the agency's trove of data to help shine light on the UFO phenomenon. In addition, the former NASA associate administrator said the agency should develop specialized instruments that might be able to gather useful data about UAP.\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger also testified, telling the representatives that there's a \"growing body of evidence that the government is not being transparent about what it knows about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly called UFOs, and that elements within the military and IC [intelligence community] are in violation of their Constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.\"\n\nShellenberger stated that there is a secret program within the U.S. government known as \"Immaculate Constellation\" whose sole purpose is to collect UFO and UAP reports from military personnel and sensor data and quarantine them away from the rest of the government and military. While he noted that a Pentagon spokesperson has stated no such program exists, Shellenberger recounted prior examples in which the Department of Defense has initially denied knowledge of UAP-related information only to later change its stance and either admit the information exists or release it to the public.\n\n\"The U.S. government appears to know significantly more about UAPs than it is revealing,\" Shellenberger said at the hearing. \"But even those who believe the U.S. government has revealed all that it knows should have no objection to Congressional demands for greater transparency.\"\n\nTo conclude the meeting, Rep. Mace asked each of the witnesses to define what non-human biologics or non-human intelligence mean to each of them.\n\n\"I don't think it's a stretch, when you look at the diversity of life on this planet and the size of this universe, to think that there will be more diverse, higher-order, non-human intelligence throughout the universe, and that's probably what's visiting us,\" Gallaudet said.\n\nElizondo stated he would take a scientific approach: \"The definition would be the ability to react to a stimulus in a manner that requires an intellectual thought process.\"\n\nGold, meanwhile, questioned whether non-human intelligence necessarily implies life, suggesting sophisticated artificial intelligence might be responsible for some UAP encounters. Shellenberger simply stated he did not know what they might be.\n\nIn the hearing, as in other UFO hearings, there was a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. One of the core tenets of these whistleblower testimonies is that much of the credible UFO data is classified and can't be revealed to the public based on the military capabilities that some of that data could reveal.\n\nWhistleblowers have attested for years that, because advanced or classified sensors and satellites sometimes capture footage or photos of unexplained phenomena or advanced craft, those photos or videos are likewise classified by the U.S. government in order to not reveal America's full surveillance or sensing capabilities.\n\nSuch was the case in 2023 when U.S. military aircraft shot down a mysterious object off the coast of Alaska. The American government has yet to release any imagery from the event, but a Canadian freedom of information request unveiled a photograph earlier this year of a balloon-like object.\n\nThose incidents and others like it, such as a weeks-long drone incursion above Langley Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., were discussed in the hearing. \"The origin of these drones and their operators remains a mystery,\" Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said. \"This incident and other sightings near sensitive military installations highlights the complexity of the UAP challenge facing our intelligence, defense and homeland security committees.\"\n\nOriginally posted on Space.com."

        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: AARO/DOD\n\nIt's never aliens.\n\nAt least, it hasn't been yet. The United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities heard testimony on Tuesday (Nov. 19) from Jon T. Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). The U.S. Department of Defense created the office in July 2022 in order to have a single place for military and government personnel to report UFO sightings, or UAP, as they're now known. The new term, short for unidentified anomalous phenomena, encompasses not only unidentified objects or events in the sky, but also those in water, in space or those that appear to travel between these domains.\n\nDuring today's hearing, Kosloski came in strong, stating that \"it is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.\" Still, despite having resolved hundreds of cases with prosaic explanations, Kosloski noted that his office does not believe that every UAP is a bird, balloon or drone. \"We do have some very anomalous objects,\" he said.\n\na blurry black dot flying above a snow-covered volcano in grainy black-and-white footage\n\nKosloski also reported on the office's latest analysis of UFO/UAP cases, stressing that his office will \"continue to follow the science and data wherever they lead\" and keep both Congress and the public as informed as possible \u2014 at the unclassified level, he clarified.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to testimony presented to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee last week, in which a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer told lawmakers that the American government is part of a decades-long coverup to conceal the fact that \"we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Kosloski gave an overview of his office's activities since it issued a report to Congress and testified in a similar setting last year. \"Many reports resolve to commonplace objects like birds, balloons and unmanned systems, while others lack sufficient data for comprehensive analysis,\" Kosloski said, adding that \"only a small percentage of reports received by AARO are potentially anomalous.\"\n\nKosloski referred to a UAP incident that occurred in 2013 near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The infrared video, shot in 2013 by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol helicopter, appears to show an object flying just above the ocean before disappearing into it, or perhaps splitting in two.\n\n\"We assessed that it was actually flying over the airport the entire time,\" Kosloski said. When the object appears to disappear in the infrared video that accompanies the case, it is actually the camera sensing that the object is the same temperature as the water behind it. Instead of splitting in two, it was simply two objects \u2014 balloons or sky lanterns \u2014 in close proximity that came in and out of view.\n\nKosloski also offered how his office was able to close the case on the infamous GOFAST video, shot by a U.S. Navy fighter jet in 2016 off the coast of Florida. In that case, the object's apparent speed in the video was actually due to the parallax effect, or the camera's perspective, Kosloski explained.\n\nFurthermore, the AARO director showed a 2018 video captured by a drone flying over Mt. Etna that he stated is not widely known among the public. \"This was a rather difficult case to solve,\" Kosloski said. \"The object was actually 170 meters away from the plume \u2014 not flying through it.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) asked Kosloski about whether or not some individuals who have encountered UAP might be reluctant to engage with his office, referring to accusations some UAP disclosure advocates frequently level against AARO. These critics attest that the office is part of an alleged decades-long U.S. government-led campaign of \"excessive secrecy\" that aims to keep the public in the dark about UFOs.\n\nIn response to Gillibrand's questioning, Kosloski defended his office. \"Congress has gone out of its way to create the organization AARO specifically to conduct these sorts of investigations, and has uniquely empowered them to have access to all UAP related information, whether that's historic or current, and we take that responsibility and those authorities very seriously,\" he said.\n\nGillibrand also asked about a report released by AARO in March 2024, noting that she has been told \"it doesn't show any any evidence of secret programs that have aliens.\"\n\nBut Gillibrand pushed back on that assertion. \"That's not how I read the report,\" the senator said. \"What I read in the report is the US government took sightings extremely seriously over the last 75 years, and put some of the greatest minds together to analyze these cases, because they assessed them as some deeply unknown phenomena that may or may not cause threats \u2014 that may or may not be related to adversaries.\"\n\na grainy black orb above the ocean in a black-and-white video\n\nAARO released a report to accompany today's hearing earlier this week. The report, titled, \"All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office\u2019s Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena,\" examines UAP cases dated between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as historical incidents that were not included in previous reports.\n\nBut, like in its other reports, AARO found no smoking gun for alien visitation this year. \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report notes. Out of the 485 cases that are well within the report's timeframe, 118 were solved and another 174 were slated to be closed, pending a final review.\n\nStill, AARO's 2024 report says that many cases remain unsolved, and that the office continues to study them. However, AARO\u2019s ability to resolve cases \"remains constrained by a lack of timely and actionable sensor data,\" according to the report, meaning there just isn't enough data to conclusively solve cases that lack detailed or multi-sensor observations. In some cases, all there might be to analyze is a single photograph, a few seconds of grainy video or an aviator's written report. Many UAP sightings happen in the blink of an eye as an unknown object zooms past a moving aircraft, for example, so there often isn't enough time to gather photographic or video evidence.\n\nIn other cases, the capabilities of the sensors or platforms involved in the UAP sightings are themselves classified (sometimes, even their existence isn't publicly known), so AARO is unable to discuss them in unclassified reports.\n\nThough overall, according to the 2024 report, there is enough data for AARO to state that it has has \"no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Pentagon UFO office finds 'no empirical evidence' for alien technology in new report\n\n\u2014 Pentagon has 'no credible evidence' of aliens or UFOs that defy physics\n\n\u2014 UFO whistleblowers tell Congress 'we are not alone in the cosmos' (video)\n\nToday's hearing echoed a previous hearing held last year on April 19, 2023. During that hearing, AARO's previous director Sean Kirkpatrick told the Senate Armed Services Committee that his office has seen \"no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics.\"\n\nSimilarly, the report released by AARO in March 2024 that examined historical UFO cases found \"no evidence that any USG [U.S. government] investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.\"\n\nAARO's previous report, released in 2022, examined 510 contemporary UAP reports gathered from government agencies and branches of the United States military. The report found that, while most cases were able to be resolved, 171 remained a mystery.\n\n\"Some of these uncharacterized UAP appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis,\" AARO's 2022 report states.\n\nToday's hearing concluded with a discussion of recent incidents in which unidentified drones, or uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), were seen over U.S. military bases and other sensitive installations. Those incidents, Kosloski notes, underscore the need for the United States to have \"more persistent monitoring and understand that, whether it is a UAP or a counter-UAS issue, that we need to have that complete domain awareness around our national security facilities.\""

        "article_content": "No alien evidence in latest UFO reports, but some 'particularly interesting' cases, Pentagon says\n\nThe U.S. government has received more than 700 reports of unexplained phenomena but have found no proof of extraterrestrial life, the Pentagon\u2019s UFO office confirmed at a Thursday briefing.\n\nThe All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) said it received 757 reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, also known as UAP, between May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024.\n\nAmong those reports were 485 UAP incidents that occurred within that year period, while the remainder took place between 2021 to 2022, according to AARO. The office, which operates within the Secretary of Defense, has been reviewing more than 1,600 cases in total, as of June 1, 2024.\n\nCongress heard testimony about UFOs: Here are the biggest revelations\n\nARRO Director Jon T. Kosloski said a higher portion of these incidents were reported by national security sites near U.S. military assets in what he called a \"geographical bias.\" However he clarified this is likely due to an increase incommercial pilot reporting in the continental U.S.\n\n\"We follow up on every tip,\" Kosloski said. \"We've received 1,600 cases. A large number of those are unresolved, which means we don't know exactly what they are. Until we know what they are or who they belong to we can't attribute intent and understand exactly what the purpose of that phenomenon is.\"\n\nNo evidence of extraterrestrial beings found\n\nARRO has found no \"verifiable evidence\" of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology according to Kosloski.\n\n\"There are definitely anomalies. We have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrial,\" Kosloski said.\n\nKosloski mentioned that none of the resolved cases have been linked to breakthrough technologies, which refers to advanced capabilities that exceed what exists today or within the next few years. He also shot down claims that all UAPs are either drones or unmanned aircraft systems.\n\n\"We have several particularly interesting cases. We're working within the office, working with our partners to downgrade several of those cases so we can talk about them publicly,\" he said. \"But there are interesting cases that I, [in] my physics and engineering background and time in the IC (Intelligence Community), I do not understand. And I don't know anybody else who understands.\"\n\nARRO urges Americans to report UAP sightings\n\nKosloski urged anyone who sees what they genuinely believe could be a true anomaly to report it to ARRO.\n\nHe emphasized the office is going to need the help of academia and public to address these sightings and said ARRO aims to \"build that more transparent partnership.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging that his request could lead to deliberately misleading reports, he said it's worth it.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer in big data is going to lead to better conclusions, and I would rather have to filter out some of those copycat cases,\" Kosloski said. \"If we're looking for a needle in a haystack, I'd rather have multiple haystacks to go digging through, rather than just one.\"\n\nAnyone can submit a report regarding a UAP sighting by navigating to ARRO's website and following the office's instructions.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Pentagon receives 700 new UFO reports: Here's what to know"

        "article_content": "The Pentagon announced they solved one of the most famous UFO videos that sparked a wave of national interest and speculation when it was first released in 2017.\n\nAn official from the Pentagon testified to Congress Tuesday about the wildly popular \u201cGOFAST\u201d video, saying that the attention was unwarranted for the footage once considered to be some of the best evidence of the reality of unidentified flying objects.\n\nDr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said the object captured off the Florida coast by a Navy fighter jet appears to be moving so fast because of the perspectival phenomenon of a parallax.\n\n5 A screengrab from the famous \u201cGOFAST\u201d video, which shows an infrared radar depiction of an\n\nobject that remains unidentified by the Pentagon, but which is no longer considered anomalous. AARO / SWNS\n\n\u201cThrough a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,\u201d Kosloski testified during an oversight hearing.\n\n5 Dr. Jon Kosloski heads up AARO, the agency tasked with finding explanations for anomalous activity of presumed UAPs. C-SPAN\n\nKosloski did not, however, identify the object in the \u201cGOFAST\u201d video. He says AARO will make the report on their parallax claims public on their official website.\n\nThe \u201cGOFAST\u201d video shows a radar recording of an object that appeared to be moving at an incredibly high speed, not far above the water.\n\nForward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology was used by fighter jet pilots operating off of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n5 A radar operator in a jet is forced to manually lock onto the target which was evading the automatic\n\nsystems that usually function without human input. AARO / SWNS\n\nThe FLIR radar shows a small blip on the screen moving so quickly that the operating officer was forced to lock onto the target manually.\n\nWhen the radar operator is finally able to lock onto the moving target, he yells, \u201cWhoa! Got him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the f\u2013k is that?,\u201d someone is heard saying over the radio in the video.\n\n\u201cWow, what is that man? Look at it fly!,\u201d another is heard saying.\n\n5 Dr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. DOD\n\nDespite dashing some hopes of UFO and UAP enthusiasts, Kosloski testified to Congress that there are 21 cases that are still unsolvable.\n\nOne such case involved a law enforcement officer \u201cout West\u201d who saw a large orange orb floating several hundred feet above the round.\n\nThe officer reports approaching the \u201cblacker than black object\u201d that was about the size of a Toyota Prius.\n\nWhen the officer got within 100 feet of the object, it shot up into the sky at a 45 degree angle at an improbably fast pace, according to Kosloski\u2019s testimony.\n\n5 A radar image from another famous UAP incident, commonly referred to as the \u201cGIMBAL\u201d video,\n\nwhich was also recorded of the east coast of the United States by operators working off air craft\n\ncarriers USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt. AARO / SWNS\n\nIn yet another inexplicable event, two government contractors in the Southeast reported seeing a \u201clarge metallic cylinder about the size of a commercial airplane\u201d hovering in the air motionless for 15-20 seconds, according to the testimony Tuesday.\n\n\u201cObviously an object that large and stationary \u2014 unless it\u2019s a blimp \u2014 is unusual but then disappearing, we can\u2019t explain how that would happen,\u201d Kosloski told Congress.\n\nAt a hearing last week, UAP and UFO community whistleblowers testified to congress that they were aware of secret research programs conducted by the US government that included crash recoveries and highly secretive back-engineering programs."

        "article_content": "H, the Paris startup founded by Google alums, made a big splash last summer when, out of the blue, it announced a seed round of $220 million before releasing a single product. Three months later, still without a product, that splash started to look like a catastrophic flood when three of the company\u2019s five co-founders left over \u201coperational and business disagreements.\u201d\n\nBut the company has kept swimming, and today it\u2019s announcing its first product: Runner H, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI aimed at businesses and developers across tasks like quality assurance and process automation. It\u2019s built atop the startup\u2019s own, proprietary \u201ccompact\u201d LLM based on just 2 billion parameters.\n\nH has set up a waitlist for Runner H on its site. CEO Charles Kantor said that it will be releasing APIs to those on the list over the coming days to use agents \u201coff the shelf\u201d that have been pre-built by H, as well as for developers to create their own. Access to the API will also come along with access to something called H-Studio to test and manage how these services work.\n\nInitially, using those APIs will be free, and later there will be a payment model introduced.\n\nEven using compact LLMs, building and running AI is not cheap, especially as competition continues to raise money to develop their own products. TechCrunch has also confirmed that H is raising a Series A to build what Kantor describes as part of the second era of AI \u2014 with LLM companies like OpenAI being part of the first era.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to be in the position of building our own models,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cBut this second era will be as capital intensive as the first one.\u201d\n\n(Recall the $230 million H has already raised \u2014 it appears to have added another $10 million since announcing it earlier this year \u2014 was a mixture of equity and convertible debt. The long list of investors in that round included individuals like Eric Schmidt, Yuri Milner, and Xavier Niel; VCs such as Accel and Creandum; and strategic backers like Amazon, Samsung, and UiPath.)\n\nKantor told TechCrunch that H has quietly been working with a handful of customers in areas like e-commerce, banking, insurance, and outsourcing, who have been helping it hone the product.\n\n\u201cEverything [in H] is not based on our creativity but customer feedback,\u201d he said.\n\nRunner H will initially focus on three specific use cases: robotic process automation (RPA), quality assurance, and business process outsourcing.\n\nRPA is an area that has existed for years, using basic scripts to automate the most repetitive tasks that humans have had to perform \u2014 such as reading forms, checking boxes, and sending files from one place to another. In fact, a lot of RPA has never been built with AI baked in, even after AI started to develop advanced skills. The idea with Runner H is that it will be able to run RPA across forms, sites, and other templates even when they have been modified (something that might have broken previous scripts), and across a much wider range of sources.\n\nQuality assurance can cover a wide range of applications, but Kantor said that one of the most popular so far has been reducing the \u201cmaintenance burdens\u201d around website testing \u2014 validating page availability, simulating real user actions, or ensuring compatibility across payment methods \u2014 in particular when modifications have been made.\n\nBPO is a catch-all area that will cover not just fixing and improving billing processes, but also speeding up how an agent can use and access data from different sources, and more.\n\nThere has been a race among foundational AI companies around how many parameters are going into LLMs. (GPT 4 for example has 175 billion parameters.) But Runner H is taking a very different approach with just 2 billion parameters, both for its LLM and for its computer-vision-based \u201cVLM.\u201d Kantor\u2019s argument is that this makes them significantly more efficient in terms of cost and operations, key when working on winning and keeping business deals, and H\u2019s own operational costs.\n\n\u201cWe are specialists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building for the agentic era.\u201d\n\nThe company also claims that it works: It says that its compact model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s \u201cComputer Use\u201d by 29% (based on WebVoyager benchmarks) as well as models from Mistral and Meta.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Download ETTelecom App Get Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles Scan to download App\n\nNew Delhi: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and generative AI (GenAI) technologies is set to strain global power supplies; 40 per cent of AI data centres may face operational challenges by 2027 because of electricity shortages, says a report by Gartner Inc. The energy demand for data centres is projected to grow by 160 per cent over the next two years, pushing electricity consumption to unprecedented levels.Power usage in AI data centres is expected to rise from 261 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024 to 500 TWh by 2027, more than double the 2023 levels.This surge is driven by the increasing need for larger data centres to handle the vast computing power required for training and deploying large language models (LLMs) that underpin GenAI applications.However, utility providers are struggling to expand their capacity quickly enough to meet this demand, creating a potential energy shortfall that could disrupt data centre operations by 2026.Bob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, said, \"New larger data centres are being planned to handle the huge amounts of data needed to train and implement the rapidly expanding large language models (LLMs) that underpin GenAI applications.\"He added, \"However, short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution, and generation capacity could take years to come online and won't alleviate current problems.\"The impending power shortages are expected to lead to significant cost increases for data centre operations.As electricity prices rise, organisations relying on AI technologies will face higher operating costs.Gartner advises businesses to prepare for these increases by negotiating long-term contracts for stable power rates and incorporating higher energy costs into their project budgets.In addition to rising costs, sustainability goals will also face setbacks. To meet the growing energy demand, some power suppliers are extending the operation of fossil fuel plants initially planned for retirement.This move will likely increase CO2 emissions, making it difficult for data centres and their customers to meet zero-carbon objectives in the short term.Furthermore, renewable energy sources like wind and solar cannot provide the consistent 24/7 power needed by data centres without alternative supply solutions, such as advanced battery storage or nuclear power.To mitigate these challenges, Gartner recommends organisations assess the risks of power shortages on their AI operations and consider alternative strategies.This includes using smaller AI models, edge computing, and more energy-efficient technologies. Businesses should also revise their sustainability goals and explore innovative energy solutions, such as sodium-ion batteries or small nuclear reactors, to support long-term operations."

However, when attempted, some films like 'Romancham' and 'Adi Kapyare Kootamani' have struck a chord with audiences. Joining this league is debutant Vaishakh Elans\u2019s 'Hello Mummy,' featuring Sharafudheen and Aishwarya Lekshmi in lead roles.\n\nFor starters, the movie introduces a fresh concept. The story revolves around Boney (Sharafudheen), who falls in love with Steffy (Aishwarya Lekshmi). However, their love story comes with a spooky twist\u2014a ghostly presence in Steffy\u2019s life prevents her from leading a peaceful existence with Boney. To uncover the mystery behind this paranormal interference, you\u2019ll have to catch 'Hello Mummy' in theatres.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the film\u2019s strengths lies in how it utilises Sharafudheen\u2019s comedic talent. His portrayal of Boney, a quirky, fun-loving character, adds charm and humour to the narrative. Watching Sharaf bring this role to life makes for an entertaining experience.\n\nHis combination scenes with Aishwarya Lekshmi are delightful to watch. Writer Sanjo Joseph has infused the story with several humorous moments, though it does feel somewhat incomplete in parts. Aishwarya shines as Steffy, bringing a playful energy to her character. Supporting actors like Jagadish and Johny Antony also contribute to the lively banter, adding to the overall entertainment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs for the horror aspect, the film successfully introduces a mystical and fantastical vibe.\n\nVaishakh leans heavily on slapstick comedy for most of the film, and it works for the most part. Sharaf delivers a solid performance, holding his own as Boney, a character trying to navigate the chaos and make sense of the paranormal activities surrounding him.\n\nThe second half of the film shifts slightly from the light-hearted, fun tone of the first half, exploring more serious and emotional aspects. It also focuses on providing explanations for the events that unfolded earlier in the story. For those looking for a lighthearted and enjoyable experience, this film is a great pick. With its blend of horror, fantasy, and comedy, it\u2019s sure to appeal to younger audiences."

The US facility was once declared an architectural marvel but carries a dark and eerie past read more\n\nAnmol is booked in 18 criminal cases and has served time in the Jodhpur jail.\n\nThe historic Squirrel Cage Jail in US\u2019s Iowa has recently captured headlines for housing Anmol Bishnoi, the brother of notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.\n\nThe 26-year-old was put behind bars a few days ago for entering that country with illegal documents and having a dozen high-profile criminal cases lodged against him in India, including the murder of the late Punjabi singer Siddhu Moosewala, NCP leader Baba Siddique and the firing incident outside actor Salman Khan\u2019s Mumbai home in June 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso read: Who is Lawrence Bishnoi\u2019s brother Anmol Bishnoi detained in the US? Why is he wanted in India?\n\nApart from being a wanted criminal in around 18-20 cases in various Indian states, Bishnoi is also under the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s radar for his illegal activities. He is being probed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.\n\nBut the US facility in which Bishnoi is lodged is far from an ordinary prison. This 19th-century jail carries a dark and eerie past, known not only for its unique architecture but also for the paranormal stories that linger within its walls.\n\nHere\u2019s a deeper dive into the chilling history of Squirrel Cage Jail.\n\nA 19th-century marvel built on a church morgue\n\nThe Pottawattamie Jailhouse, famously known as the \u201cSquirrel Cage Jail,\u201d was built in 1885 on the site of an old church morgue.\n\nAn architectural wonder, the jail stands out for its unnerving and bizarre design as it is one of only three remaining revolving prisons in the United States.\n\nThe standout feature was its innovative rotating cells. These cells spun within a circular structure, aligning with a single door to allow access to jailers who reach a specific prisoner by rotating the cells. The feature earned it the title of a \u201c19th-century marvel.\u201d\n\nWhile most rotary jails of that era had just one level, this jail was constructed with three stacked levels of holding cells. This vertical arrangement gave it the appearance of a cage meant for a small creature, hence its nickname, the \u201cSquirrel Cage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPottawattamie Jailhouse\u2019s standout feature was its innovative rotating cells. These cells spun within a circular structure, aligning with a single door to allow access to jailers who reach a specific prisoner by rotating the cells. Image courtesy: Flickr/Creative Commons\n\nHowever, the ingenious design soon revealed its flaws. The complex mechanics became a problem, and the jail was deemed a failure only a few years after it opened. It was notorious for producing a dreadful noise during rotation, and its gears frequently jammed, leaving prisoners at risk of starvation.\n\nAccording to a local us website that deals with ghost adventures, the rotating design also made it difficult to segregate prisoners, leading to all inmates being housed in close quarters. This proximity resulted in frequent injuries as inmates would sometimes extend their limbs through the bars while the cells rotated, causing severe injuries and breaks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis proximity resulted in frequent injuries as inmates would sometimes extend their limbs through the bars while the cells rotated, causing severe injuries and breaks. Image courtesy: Flickr/Creative Commons\n\nBy the 1960s, the machinery\u2019s unreliability reached a grim peak. A mechanical failure left a deceased inmate trapped in his cell for two days before his body could be recovered.\n\nThe facility was used as a jail until 1969.\n\nSpooky stories\n\nIn 1971, the Council Bluffs Park Board acquired the jailhouse for preservation and it was later converted into a museum by the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County (HSPS).\n\nSince its transformation, the jail has become well-known for its eerie reputation, drawing plenty of attention for its ghostly associations.\n\nOne unsettling story involves a jailer from the 1950s who refused to live in the fourth-floor apartment after he repeatedly heard footsteps on the empty floor. He then chose to sleep on the second floor instead, avoiding the unexplainable sounds.\n\nToday, the museum staff and volunteers have reported similarly strange experiences in the building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1971, the Council Bluffs Park Board acquired the jailhouse for preservation and it was later converted into a museum by the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County. Image courtesy: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u201cMany of the jail staff and volunteers have heard footsteps, voices, whispers and doors moving. Some have even seen dark shadows moving across the stairs or past doorways,\u201d stated Kat Slaughter, the museum\u2019s manager, in an article on the Council Bluffs website.\n\nSlaughter believes the rumours of the jail being haunted are partly rooted in the four documented deaths that occurred within its walls. A prisoner died of a heart attack, another fell three stories while attempting to carve his name into the ceiling, one hung himself and died by suicide, and an officer lost his life when a training gun accidentally misfired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParanormal investigators have conducted numerous studies at the site, recording several unexplained incidents. These include Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVPs) and sightings of shadowy figures. Slaughter mentions that investigators have detected electromagnetic field (EMF) irregularities in areas where none should exist.\n\nAccording to the HSPS, many prisoners left their signatures and dates scratched into the jail\u2019s walls, etching their stories into the structure\u2019s grim past. These markings serve as a stark reminder of an era that a modern facility would never replicate, the HSPS noted on its website.\n\nWith input from agencies"

Astronomers have just discovered a new planet, and yes, it\u2019s one more name to add to those already tricky lists of planets. This one\u2019s called IRAS 04125+2902 b, and it\u2019s a baby planet- 3 million years old. While that sounds pretty old in planet years, it\u2019s actually still in the early stages of life. But what\u2019s even cooler is how astronomers found it: they got lucky with a rare chance to see it in action as it passed in front of its star, a phenomenon known as a transit.\n\nAlso Read NASA brings AI to space science, these areas to get biggest boost\n\nNormally, when planets are still babies, they\u2019re hidden behind thick clouds of space dust and debris. But this planet is special. Its surrounding debris disk has been warped in a way that allows telescopes, like TESS (the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), to see it from Earth.\n\nLocated about 430 light-years away in a region called the Taurus Molecular Cloud, IRAS 04125+2902 b is in a stellar nursery, where new stars and planets are being born. The planet itself is still hot from the heat of its formation, and while it\u2019s smaller than Jupiter, it\u2019s still big enough to be seen as it passes across the face of its star. This is an incredible discovery because it helps scientists learn more about how planets form and what happens to them in the first few million years of their life.\n\nAlso Read India\u2019s push to establish an Earth Observation Satellite ecosystem through Public Private Partnership IN-SPACe taps DoT to cut spectrum price for Spacetech startups Oppo Find X8, X8 Pro launching globally on November 21 with MediaTek Dimensity 9400 and ColorOS 15 Govt to act as a VC fund for pushing space startups\n\nThe planet is likely to be very different from the ones we know in our solar system.

        "article_content": "It was 1996, and Masashi Yanagisawa was on the brink of his next discovery.\n\nThe Japanese scientist had arrived at the University of Texas Southwestern 5 years earlier, setting up his own lab at age 31. After earning his medical degree, he\u2019d gained notoriety as a PhD student when he discovered endothelin, the body\u2019s most potent vasoconstrictor.\n\nYanagisawa was about to prove this wasn\u2019t a first-timer\u2019s fluke.\n\nHis focus was G-protein\u2013coupled receptors, or GPCRs, cell surface receptors that respond to a range of molecules and a popular target for drug discovery. The Human Genome Project had just revealed a slew of newly discovered receptors, or \u201corphan\u201d GPCRs, and identifying an activating molecule could yield a new drug. (That vasoconstrictor endothelin was one such success story, leading to four new drug approvals in the United States over the past quarter century.)\n\nYanagisawa and his team created 50 cell lines, each expressing one orphan receptor. They applied animal tissue to every line, along with a calcium-sensitive dye. If the cells glowed under the microscope, they had a hit.\n\nJon Willie, MD, PhD\n\n\u201cHe was basically doing an elaborate fishing expedition,\u201d says Jon Willie, MD, PhD, an associate professor of neurosurgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who would later join Yanagisawa\u2019s team.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the neon-green fluorescence signaled a match. After isolating the activating molecule, the scientists realized they were dealing with two neuropeptides.\n\nNo one had ever seen these proteins before. And no one knew their discovery would set off a decades-long journey that would finally solve a century-old medical mystery \u2014 and may even fix one of the biggest health crises of our time, as revealed by research published just this year. It\u2019s a story of strange coincidences, serendipitous discoveries, and quirky details. Most of all, it\u2019s a fascinating example of how basic science can revolutionize medicine \u2014 and how true breakthroughs happen over time and in real time.\n\nBut That\u2019s Basic Science for You\n\nMost basic science studies \u2014 the early, foundational research that provides the building blocks for science that follows \u2014 don\u2019t lead to medical breakthroughs. But some do, often in surprising ways.\n\nAlso called curiosity-driven research, basic science aims to fill knowledge gaps to keep science moving, even if the trajectory isn\u2019t always clear.\n\n\u201cThe people working on the basic research that led to discoveries that transformed the modern world had no idea at the time,\u201d says Isobel Ronai, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in life sciences at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cOften, these stories can only be seen in hindsight,\u201d sometimes decades later.\n\nCase in point: For molecular biology techniques \u2014 things like DNA sequencing and gene targeting \u2014 the lag between basic science and breakthrough is, on average, 23 years. While many of the resulting techniques have received Nobel Prizes, few of the foundational discoveries have been awarded such accolades.\n\n\u201cThe scientific glory is more often associated with the downstream applications,\u201d says Ronai. \u201cThe importance of basic research can get lost. But it is the foundation for any future application, such as drug development.\u201d\n\nAs funding is increasingly funneled toward applied research, basic science can require a certain persistence. What this under-appreciation can obscure is the pathway to discovery \u2014 which is often as compelling as the end result, full of unpredictable twists, turns, and even interpersonal intrigue.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the fascinating \u2014 and definitely complicated \u2014 phenomenon of multiple independent discoveries.\n\nAs in: What happens when two independent teams discover the same thing at the same time?\n\nBack to Yanagisawa\u2019s Lab...\n\n\u2026where he and his team learned a few things about those new neuropeptides. Rat brain studies pinpointed the lateral hypothalamus as the peptides\u2019 area of activity \u2014 a region often called the brain\u2019s feeding center.\n\nMasashi Yanagisawa\n\n\u201cIf you destroy that part of the brain, animals lose appetite,\u201d says Yanagisawa. So these peptides must control feeding, the scientists thought.\n\nSure enough, injecting the proteins into rat brains led the rodents to start eating.\n\nSatisfied, the team named them \u201corexin-A\u201d and \u201corexin-B,\u201d for the Greek word \u201corexis,\u201d meaning appetite. The brain receptors became \u201corexin-1\u201d and \u201corexin-2.\u201d The team prepared to publish its findings in Cell.\n\nBut another group beat them to it.\n\nIntroducing the \u2018Hypocretins\u2019\n\nIn early January 1998, a team of Scripps Research Institute scientists, led by J. Gregor Sutcliffe, PhD, released a paper in the journal PNAS. They described a gene encoding for the precursor to two neuropeptides.\n\nThomas Kilduff, PhD\n\nAs the peptides were in the hypothalamus and structurally like secretin (a gut hormone), they called them \u201chypocretins.\u201d The hypocretin peptides excited neurons in the hypothalamus, and later that year, the scientists discovered that the neurons\u2019 branches extended, tentacle-like, throughout the brain. \u201cMany of the connected areas were involved in sleep-wake control,\u201d says Thomas Kilduff, PhD, who joined the Sutcliffe lab just weeks before the hypocretin discovery. At the time, however, the significance of this finding was not yet clear.\n\nWeeks later, in February 1998, Yanagisawa\u2019s paper came out.\n\nSomehow, two groups, over 1000 miles apart, had stumbled on the same neuropeptides at the same time.\n\n\u201cI first heard about [Yanagisawa\u2019s] paper on NBC Nightly News,\u201d recalls Kilduff. \u201cI was skiing in the mountains, so I had to wait until Monday to get back to the lab to see what the paper was all about.\u201d\n\nHe realized that Yanagisawa\u2019s orexin was his lab\u2019s hypocretin, although the study didn\u2019t mention another team\u2019s discovery.\n\n\u201cThere may have been accusations. But as far as I know, it\u2019s because [Yanagisawa] didn\u2019t know [about the other paper],\u201d says Willie. \u201cThis was not something he produced in 2 months. This was clearly years of work.\u201d\n\n\u2018Multiple Discovery\u2019 Happens More Often Than You Think\n\nIn the mid-20th century, sociologist Robert Merton described the phenomenon of \u201cmultiple discovery,\u201d where many scientific discoveries or inventions are made independently at roughly the same time.\n\n\u201cThis happens much more frequently in scientific research than people suppose,\u201d says David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate\u2019s Institute for Scientific Information, the analytics company\u2019s research arm. (Last year, Pendlebury flagged the hypocretin/orexin discovery for Clarivate\u2019s prestigious Citations Laureates award, an honor that aims to predict, often successfully, who will go on to win the Nobel Prize.)\n\n\u201cPeople have this idea of the lone researcher making a brilliant discovery,\u201d Pendlebury says. \u201cBut more and more, teams find things at the same time.\u201d\n\nWhile this can \u2014 and does \u2014 lead to squabbling about who deserves credit, the desire to be first can also be highly motivating, says Mike Schneider, PhD, an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, who studies the social dynamics of science, potentially leading to faster scientific advancement.\n\nThe downside? If two groups produce the same or similar results, but one publishes first, scientific journals tend to reject the second, citing a lack of novelty.\n\nYet duplicating research is a key step in confirming the validity of a discovery.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in 2018, the journal PLOS Biology created a provision for \u201cscooped\u201d scientists, allowing them to submit their paper within 6 months of the first as a complementary finding. Instead of viewing this as redundancy, the editors believe it adds robustness to the research.\n\n\u2018What the Heck Is This Mouse Doing?\u2019\n\nEven though he\u2019d been scooped, Yanagisawa forged on to the next challenge: Confirming whether orexin regulated feeding.\n\nHe began breeding mice missing the orexin gene. His team expected these \u201cknockout\u201d mice to eat less, resulting in a thinner body than other rodents. To the contrary, \u201cthey were on average fatter,\u201d says Willie. \u201cThey were eating less but weighed more, indicating a slower metabolism.\u201d\n\nThe researchers were befuddled. \u201cWe were really disappointed, almost desperate about what to do,\u201d recalls Yanagisawa.\n\nAs nocturnal animals eat more at night, he decided they should study the mice after dark. One of his students, Richard Chemelli, MD, bought an infrared video camera from Radio Shack, filming the first 4 hours of the mice\u2019s active period for several nights.\n\nAfter watching the footage, \u201cRick called me and said, \u2018Let\u2019s get into the lab,\u2019\u201d says Willie. \u201cIt was four of us on a Saturday looking at these videos, saying, \u2018What the heck is this mouse doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile exploring their habitat, the knockout mice would randomly fall over, pop back up after a minute or so, and resume normal activity. This happened over and over \u2014 and the scientists were unsure why.\n\nThey began monitoring the mice\u2019s brains during these episodes \u2014 and made a startling discovery.\n\nThe mice weren\u2019t having seizures. They were shifting directly into REM sleep, bypassing the non-REM stage, then quickly toggling back to wake mode.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew these animals had something akin to narcolepsy,\u201d says Willie.\n\nThe team recruited Thomas Scammell, MD, a Harvard neurologist, to investigate whether modafinil \u2014 an anti-narcoleptic drug without a clear mechanism \u2014 affected orexin neurons.\n\nTwo hours after injecting the mice with the medication, the scientists sacrificed them and stained their brains. Remarkably, the number of neurons showing orexin activity had increased ninefold. It seemed modafinil worked by activating the orexin system.\n\nThese findings had the potential to crack open the science of narcolepsy, one of the most mysterious sleep disorders.\n\nUnless, of course, another team did it first.\n\nThe Mystery of Narcolepsy\n\nYet another multiple discovery, narcolepsy was first described by two scientists \u2014 one in Germany, the other in France \u2014 within a short span in the late 1800s.\n\nIt would be more than a hundred years before anyone understood the disorder\u2019s cause, even though it affects about 1 in 2000 people.\n\n\u201cPatients were often labeled as lazy and malingerers,\u201d says Kilduff, \u201csince they were sleepy all the time and had this weird motor behavior called cataplexy\u201d or the sudden loss of muscle tone.\n\nIn the early 1970s, William Dement, MD, PhD \u2014 \u201cthe father of sleep medicine\u201d \u2014 was searching for a narcoleptic cat to study. He couldn\u2019t find a feline, but several colleagues mentioned dogs with narcolepsy-like symptoms.\n\nDement, who died in 2020, had found his newest research subjects.\n\nIn 1973, he started a narcoleptic dog colony at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. At first, he focused on poodles and beagles. After discovering their narcolepsy wasn\u2019t genetic, he pivoted to dobermans and labradors. Their narcolepsy was inherited, so he could breed them to populate the colony.\n\nAlthough human narcolepsy is rarely genetic, it\u2019s otherwise a lot like the version in these dogs.\n\nBoth involve daytime sleepiness, \u201cpathological\u201d bouts of REM sleep, and the loss of muscle tone in response to emotions, often positive ones.\n\nThe researchers hoped the canines could unlock a treatment for human narcolepsy. They began laying out a path of dog kibble, then injecting the dogs with drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They wanted to see what might help them stay awake as they excitedly chowed down.\n\nKilduff also started a molecular genetics program, trying to identify the genetic defect behind canine narcolepsy. But after a parvovirus outbreak, Kilduff resigned from the project, drained from the strain of seeing so many dogs die.\n\nEmmanuel Mignot, MD, PhD\n\nA decade after his departure from the dog colony, his work would dramatically intersect with that of his successor, Emmanuel Mignot, MD, PhD.\n\n\u201cI thought I had closed the narcolepsy chapter in my life forever,\u201d says Kilduff. \u201cThen in 1998, we described this novel neuropeptide, hypocretin, that turned out to be the key to understanding the disorder.\u201d\n\nNarcoleptic Dogs in California, Mutant Mice in Texas\n\nIt was modafinil \u2014 the same anti-narcoleptic drug Yanagisawa\u2019s team studied \u2014 that brought Emmanuel Mignot to the United States. After training as a pharmacologist in France, his home country sent him to Stanford to study the drug, which was discovered by French scientists, as his required military service.\n\nAs Kilduff\u2019s replacement at the dog colony, his goal was to figure out how modafinil worked, hoping to attract a US company to develop the drug.\n\nThe plan succeeded. Modafinil became Provigil, a billion-dollar narcolepsy drug, and Mignot became \u201ccompletely fascinated\u201d with the disorder.\n\n\u201cI realized quickly that there was no way we\u2019d find the cause of narcolepsy by finding the mode of action of this drug,\u201d Mignot says. \u201cMost likely, the drug was acting downstream, not at the cause of the disorder.\u201d\n\nTo discover the answer, he needed to become a geneticist. And so began his 11-year odyssey to find the cause of canine narcolepsy.\n\nAfter mapping the dog genome, Mignot set out to find the smallest stretch of chromosome that the narcoleptic animals had in common. \u201cFor a very long time, we were stuck with a relatively large region [of DNA],\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a no man\u2019s land.\u201d\n\nWithin that region was the gene for the hypocretin/orexin-2 receptor \u2014 the same receptor that Yanagisawa had identified in his first orexin paper. Mignot didn\u2019t immediately pursue that gene as a possibility \u2014 even though his students suggested it. Why?\n\n\u201cThe decision was simply: Should we lose time to test a possible candidate [gene] among many?\u201d Mignot says.\n\nAs Mignot studied dog DNA in California, Yanagisawa was creating mutant mice in Texas. Unbeknownst to either scientist, their work was about to converge.\n\nWhat Happened Next Is Somewhat Disputed\n\nAfter diagnosing his mice with narcolepsy, Yanagisawa opted not to share this finding with Mignot, though he knew about Mignot\u2019s interest in the condition. Instead, he asked a colleague to find out how far along Mignot was in his genetics research.\n\nAccording to Yanagisawa, his colleague didn\u2019t realize how quickly DNA sequencing could happen once a target gene was identified. At a sleep meeting, \u201che showed Emmanuel all of our raw data. Almost accidentally, he disclosed our findings,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a shock for me.\u201d\n\nUnsure whether he was part of the orexin group, Mignot decided not to reveal that he\u2019d identified the hypocretin/orexin-2 receptor gene as the faulty one in his narcoleptic dogs.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t share this finding, Mignot says he did offer to speak with the lead researcher to see if their findings were the same. If they were, they could jointly submit their articles. But Mignot never heard back.\n\nMeanwhile, back at his lab, Mignot buckled down. While he wasn\u2019t convinced the mouse data proved anything, it did give him the motivation to move faster.\n\nWithin weeks, he submitted his findings to Cell, revealing a mutation in the hypocretin/orexin-2 receptor gene as the cause of canine narcolepsy. According to Yanagisawa, the journal\u2019s editor invited him to peer-review the paper, tipping him off to its existence.\n\n\u201cI told him I had a conflict of interest,\u201d says Yanagisawa. \u201cAnd then we scrambled to finish our manuscript. We wrote up the paper within almost 5 days.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, it seemed both papers would be published together in Cell. Instead, on August 6, 1999, Mignot\u2019s study was splashed solo across the journal\u2019s cover.\n\n\u201cAt the time, our team was pissed off, but looking back, what else could Emmanuel have done?\u201d says Willie, who was part of Yanagisawa\u2019s team. \u201cThe grant he\u2019d been working on for years was at risk. He had it within his power to do the final experiments. Of course he was going to finish.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, Yanagisawa\u2019s findings followed, also in Cell.\n\nHis paper proposed knockout mice as a model for human narcolepsy and orexin as a key regulator of the sleep/wake cycle. With orexin-activated neurons branching into other areas of the brain, the peptide seemed to promote wakefulness by synchronizing several arousal neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have orexin, each of those systems can still function, but they\u2019re not as coordinated,\u201d says Willie. \u201cIf you have narcolepsy, you\u2019re capable of wakefulness, and you\u2019re capable of sleep. What you can\u2019t do is prevent inappropriately switching between states.\u201d\n\nTogether, the two papers painted a clear picture: Narcolepsy was the result of a dysfunction in the hypocretin/orexin system.\n\nAfter more than a century, the cause of narcolepsy was starting to come into focus.\n\n\u201cThis was blockbuster,\u201d says Willie.\n\nBy itself, either finding \u2014 one in dogs, one in mice \u2014 might have been met with skepticism. But in combination, they offered indisputable evidence about narcolepsy\u2019s cause.\n\nThe Human Brains in Your Fridge Hold Secrets\n\nJerome Siegel\n\nJerome Siegel had been searching for the cause of human narcolepsy for years. A PhD and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, he had managed to acquire four human narcoleptic brains. As laughter is often the trigger for the sudden shift to REM sleep in humans, he focused on the amygdala, an area linked to emotion.\n\n\u201cI looked in the amygdala and didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the brains stayed in my refrigerator for probably 10 years.\u201d\n\nThen he was invited to review Yanagisawa\u2019s study in Cell. The lightbulb clicked on: Maybe the hypothalamus \u2014 not the amygdala \u2014 was the area of abnormality. He and his team dug out the decade-old brains.\n\nWhen they stained the brains, the massive loss of hypocretin-activated neurons was hard to miss: On average, the narcoleptic brains had only about 7000 of the cells vs 70,000 in the average human brain. The scientists also noticed scar tissue in the hypothalamus, indicating that the neurons had at some point died, rather than being absent from birth.\n\nWhat Siegel didn\u2019t know: Mignot had also acquired a handful of human narcoleptic brains.\n\nAlready, he had coauthored a study showing that hypocretin/orexin was undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid of the majority of the people with narcolepsy his team tested. It seemed clear that the hypocretin/orexin system was flawed \u2014 or even broken \u2014 in people with the condition.\n\n\u201cIt looked like the cause of narcolepsy in humans was indeed this lack of orexin in the brain,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hypothesis immediately. To me, this is when we established that narcolepsy in humans was due to a lack of orexin. The next thing was to check that the cells were missing.\u201d\n\nNow he could do exactly that.\n\n\n\nAs expected, Mignot\u2019s team observed a dramatic loss of hypocretin/orexin cells in the narcoleptic brains. They also noticed that a different cell type in the hypothalamus was unaffected. This implied the damage was specific to the hypocretin-activated cells and supported a hunch they already had: That the deficit was the result not of a genetic defect but of an autoimmune attack. (It\u2019s a hypothesis Mignot has spent the last 15 years proving.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a gathering in Hawaii, in late August 2000, that the two realized the overlap of their work.\n\nTo celebrate his team\u2019s finding, Mignot had invited a group of researchers to Big Island. With his paper scheduled for publication on September 1, he felt comfortable presenting his findings to his guests, which included Siegel.\n\nUntil then, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what he had found, and he didn\u2019t know what I had found, which basically was the same thing,\u201d says Siegel.\n\nIn yet another strange twist, the two papers were published just weeks apart, simultaneously revealing that human narcoleptics have a depleted supply of the neurons that bind to hypocretin/orexin. The cause of the disorder was at last a certainty.\n\n\u201cEven if I was first, what does it matter? In the end, you need confirmation,\u201d says Mignot. \u201cYou need multiple people to make sure that it\u2019s true. It\u2019s good science when things like this happen.\u201d\n\nHow All of This Changed Medicine\n\nSince these groundbreaking discoveries, the diagnosis of narcolepsy has become much simpler. Lab tests can now easily measure hypocretin in cerebrospinal fluid, providing a definitive diagnosis.\n\nBut the development of narcolepsy treatments has lagged \u2014 even though hypocretin/orexin replacement therapy is the obvious answer.\n\n\u201cAlmost 25 years have elapsed, and there\u2019s no such therapeutic on the market,\u201d says Kilduff, who now works for SRI International, a non-profit research and development institute.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because agonists \u2014 drugs that bind to receptors in the brain \u2014 are challenging to create, as this requires mimicking the activating molecule\u2019s structure, like copying the grooves of an intricate key.\n\nAntagonists, by comparison, are easier to develop. These act as a gate, blocking access to the receptors. As a result, drugs that promote sleep by thwarting hypocretin/orexin have emerged more quickly, providing a flurry of new options for people with insomnia. The first, suvorexant, was launched in 2014. Two others followed in recent years.\n\nResearchers are hopeful a hypocretin/orexin agonist is on the horizon.\n\n\u201cThis is a very hot area of drug development,\u201d says Kilduff. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s going to get the drug to market first.\u201d\n\nOne More Hypocretin/Orexin Surprise \u2014 and It Could Be The Biggest\n\nSeveral years ago, Siegel\u2019s lab received what was supposed to be a healthy human brain \u2014 one they could use as a comparison for narcoleptic brains. But researcher Thomas Thannickal, PhD, lead author of the UCLA study linking hypocretin loss to human narcolepsy, noticed something strange: This brain had significantly more hypocretin neurons than average.\n\nWas this due to a seizure? A traumatic death? Siegel called the brain bank to request the donor\u2019s records. He was told they were missing.\n\nYears later, Siegel happened to be visiting the brain bank for another project and found himself in a room adjacent to the medical records. \u201cNobody was there,\u201d he says, \u201cso I just opened a drawer.\u201d\n\nShuffling through the brain bank\u2019s files, Siegel found the medical records he\u2019d been told were lost. In the file was a note from the donor, explaining that he was a former heroin addict.\n\n\u201cI almost fell out of my chair,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cI realized this guy\u2019s heroin addiction likely had something to do with his very unusual brain.\u201d\n\nObviously, opioids affected the orexin system. But how?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s when people are happy that this peptide is released,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cThe hypocretin system is not just related to alertness. It\u2019s related to pleasure.\u201d\n\nAs Yanagisawa observed early on, hypocretin/orexin does indeed play a role in eating \u2014 just not the one he initially thought. The peptides prompted pleasure seeking. So the rodents ate.\n\nIn 2018, after acquiring five more brains, Siegel\u2019s group published a study in Translational Medicine, showing 54% more detectable hypocretin neurons in the brains of heroin addicts than in those of control individuals.\n\nIn 2022, another breakthrough: His team showed that morphine significantly altered the pathways of hypocretin neurons in mice, sending their axons into brain regions associated with addiction. Then, when they removed the mice\u2019s hypocretin neurons and discontinued their daily morphine dose, the rodents showed no symptoms of opioid withdrawal.\n\nThis fits the connection with narcolepsy: Among the standard treatments for the condition are amphetamines and other stimulants, which all have addictive potential. Yet, \u201cnarcoleptics never abuse these drugs,\u201d Siegel says. \u201cThey seem to be uniquely resistant to addiction.\u201d\n\nThis could powerfully change the way opioids are administered.\n\n\u201cIf you prevent the hypocretin response to opioids, you may be able to prevent opioid addiction,\u201d says Siegel. In other words, blocking the hypocretin system with a drug like those used to treat insomnia may allow patients to experience the pain-relieving benefits of opioids \u2014 without the risk for addiction.\n\nHis team is currently investigating treatments targeting the hypocretin/orexin system for opioid addiction.\n\nIn a study published in July, they found that mice who received suvorexant \u2014 the drug for insomnia \u2014 didn\u2019t anticipate their daily dose of opioids the way other rodents did. This suggests the medication prevented addiction, without diminishing the pain-relieving effect of opioids.\n\nIf it translates to humans, this discovery could potentially save millions of lives.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just us working on this,\u201d says Siegel.\n\nBut with hypocretin/orexin, you never know."

        "article_content": "This story was originally published in the 2024 edition of Discovery magazine, the College of Science's publication. This edition of Discovery celebrated the 20th anniversary of the College of Science.\n\n\"Ours is a world of sights and sounds. We live by our eyes and ears and tend generally to be oblivious to the chemical happenings in our surrounds. Such happenings are ubiquitous. All organisms engender chemical signals, and all, in their respective ways, respond to the chemical emissions of others. \u2026 And it is a discipline in which discovery is still very much in order, for the interactions themselves remain in large measure to be uncovered.\" \u2013 Jerrold Meinwald and Thomas Eisner, 1995\n\nThe last part of the first paragraph of Meinwald and Eisner\u2019s abstract in their review article \"Chemical Ecology\" is just as true today as it was when it was published 30 years ago. There are a growing number of chemical ecologists, and many of them are being trained at the University\u2019s Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology.\n\nThe Hitchcock Center is named for its founding donor, Mick Hitchcock. Hitchcock is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and worked in the pharmaceutical industry for many years, helping to develop antiviral drugs, including the first once-daily three-drug combination pill to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hitchcock moved to Reno in 2009 (largely due to its proximity to good snowboarding) and has been involved at the University since.\n\nChristopher Jeffrey, a professor in the Department of Chemistry, started at the University the same day Hitchcock was giving a talk. Jeffrey attended the talk and later, the two had dinner together. Following this initial interaction, Jeffrey and Hitchcock began to talk about chemistry on a regular basis over dinners and started snowboarding together.\n\n\"[Mick] got to learn about what our research was, and it fell in line with exactly how he felt the future of science is going,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nHitchcock worked with Jeffrey to develop a multi-year program that would provide both research and teaching opportunities for students and faculty at the University.\n\n\"The idea was that, by funding the start up of the center over a period of years, it would allow time for the group to become independent by obtaining funding and grants from other sources, especially funding sources that are not usually available to researchers in single, independent laboratories,\" Hitchcock said.\n\nIn 2018, the Hitchcock Center officially opened as an interdisciplinary research unit, where graduate students could be trained to think in more disciplines than the normal higher education model allows for. The Hitchcock Center has developed a space where the lines are blurred between chemistry, biology and ecology.\n\nResearchers study systems in Nevada\u2019s dry, harsh deserts and the Amazon\u2019s lush, tropical rainforests. One major project studies Piper kelleyi, a wild relative of black pepper. The plant, found in the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Andes, is widespread and supports many species, particularly caterpillars. The project involves collaboration with the Indigenous Kichwa and Waorani communities in Ecuador. These communities have used Piper as medicine for generations. The research project includes Lora Richards (Principal Investigator), Deena Schmidt, Thomas Parchman, Lee Dyer, Christopher Jeffrey, Craig Dodson and Casey Philbin (all faculty from the University), and scientists from the Kichwa and Waorani communities.\n\nA recent National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Traineeship (NRT) grant was awarded to the Hitchcock Center after seven previous applications for the incredibly competitive grant.\n\nThe $3 million grant will support at least 25 fellowships for students working in chemical ecology. Jeffrey credits the success of the proposal to Marjorie Matoq, the director of the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology graduate program, whose experience with monitoring program success, a critical part of any grant, was the last piece of the puzzle to secure this achievement.\n\n\"Those missing elements pushed us right over the top,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nThe proposal featured several areas of research, including evolution of chemically mediated interactions, chemistry of community interactions, chemistry of biological interactions: engines of biodiversity, and ecoimmunology and pest management. The NRT funding also includes support for the development of a new course: Chemistry of Biological Interactions.\n\nThe center promotes success for graduate students by providing a workshop series that will discuss topics like interdisciplinary communication, conflict resolutions, DEI/Ally training, team science and reproducible science. The NSF has emphasized the importance of making science reproducible and developing good data management practices.\n\n\"That grant, I would say, reflects the broader goals of our center,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nTo promote interdisciplinary research partnerships, the Hitchcock Center pairs two students on a single project who are participating in distinct areas of research. Zach Ledvina and Haley Dole are partnering up to teach each other the chemical and ecological characteristics of Piper kelleyi. Ledvina, a chemistry student pursuing his doctoral degree, and Dole, a doctoral student in the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology graduate program, each have unique skillsets and knowledge about the system that they can share with one another to elucidate the underlying \"chemical happenings\" in the system.\n\nThe center also provides stipends and research support for undergraduate students, and summer or semester internships with the biotechnology industry, natural resource management agencies, outreach education (including at the University\u2019s Museum of Natural History) and conservation organizations.\n\nSpeakers at the Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology Symposium gather for a photo before Paul Cox's keynote lecture.\n\nThe Hitchcock Center just hosted its second Hitchcock Symposium at the University of Nevada, Reno at Lake Tahoe, which brought a long-time supporter and advisory member of the center, Paul Alan Cox, back to campus. Cox is an ethnobotanist who searches for cures or treatments for diseases in the natural world, particularly in so-called \"blue zones\" where much of the population lives longer than the average human lifespan. Cox previously spoke at the University for a Discover Science lecture in 2016 and continues to advocate for the center through support on grants and as an adviser to the programs.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got the right people, the right science, the right questions,\" Cox said about the Hitchcock Center during his talk.\n\nThe center received funding from multiple companies to support the symposium, including Untamed Wine Estates, where alumna McKenzie Shipman-Sanvido '15 (biology, analytical chemistry) serves as vice president, which provided raffle prizes for public attendees; Agilent, a company that develops cutting edge instrumentation, which provided academic and speaker grants; and Alcami, which provided award sponsorship for student presentations.\n\nThree Ph.D. candidates were presented with student awards at the end of the conference: Tanzil Mahmud (left) won the oral presentation award, Yingshi Feng (middle) won the poster presentation award and Ari Grele won the Scott Chadwick Outstanding Chemical Ecology Graduate Award.\n\nIn addition to the Hitchcock Center, Jeffrey said there are several other chemical ecology centers around the world, including at the Pennsylvania State University, Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\n\n\n\"What makes our program unique is that it is chemistry-forward,\" Jeffrey said.\n\n\n\nThe Hitchcock Center was recently elected to a multi-state consortium of chemical ecology centers led by Penn State and Cornell focused on using chemical ecology to solve agricultural challenges. This election has elevated the center\u2019s status as an internationally recognized contributor to the discipline and paved the way for the center to apply for new agriculture grants. Jeffrey recently attended the International Chemical Ecology short course, which rotates between most of the major centers for chemical ecology. Jeffrey is working out dates with his colleagues for the Hitchcock Center to host this short course in the future. The Hitchcock Center has also been developing partnerships with other universities to work toward applied research in agriculture and medicine.\n\nOne part of the many projects Jeffrey is excited about is the synthetic chemistry being used to understand the relationships between caterpillars and Piper kelleyi. As a synthetic chemist, Jeffrey, who had just finished his postdoctoral work, read an article published in 2007 that said the field was facing the slow death of natural products chemistry. Today, Jeffrey is excited that natural products and synthetic chemistry are going hand-in-hand, playing an important role in chemical ecology research, and are able to directly address some of the biggest questions in science, such as explaining the biodiversity of our planet.\n\nSince the Hitchcock Center was formally recognized on campus, faculty and the center itself have received $30 million in grants, comprised of four NSF grants (including the NRT and Piper kelleyi research), a NASA astrobiology research grant (in partnership with scientists at the Desert Research Institute) and others.\n\nScott Chadwick of Alcami has also supported the center by endowing a scholarship for an outstanding graduate student in chemical ecology.\n\n\"My goal for the center is that it will eventually take on a life of its own,\" Hitchcock said. \"Much like seed funding for an entrepreneurial business venture, the strategy is to start the ball rolling with enough energy to allow it to continue independently in due course.\""

        "article_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from businessInsider - Business Newsletter sent Mon to Fri, twice each day with a full week's round up every Sat\n\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure and skills ebbs and flows with the rise and fall of industries, the shifting economy, and the evolution of technology.\n\nA walk along the Monkland Canal near the BioCity site at Newhouse is testament to this. Built in the late 18th century to transport coal from the Monklands mining areas to Glasgow, its construction was a monumental task in terms of time, resources and money.\n\nToday, it is a peaceful water feature where people stroll with their dogs - a memory of a past that those walking along it no longer recall. Further upstream on the North Calder Water, the remains of massive stone bridges serve as further glimpses of this industrious past hiding in plain sight.\n\nThis ever-changing landscape due to human economic activity is constant - and it\u2019s mirrored in the modern era by the Newhouse BioCity site.\n\nOriginally developed by Dutch pharmaceutical company Organon, which sought a safe manufacturing site outside mainland Europe after the Second World War, Newhouse evolved into a major pre-clinical drug discovery research and development (R&D) centre in the late 1990s. Significant investment in buildings and equipment helped the site employ up to 250 scientists at its peak, making it a key player in Scotland\u2019s drug discovery scene.\n\nMany Scottish university pharmacology students at the time, myself included, began their careers in Organon's labs, participating in industrial degrees, studentships and work placements. From my own experience, I saw the culture and working practices at Organon influence local university departments and companies, from the terminology used to describe experimental practices to the widespread use of lab notebook naming conventions - a small, yet persisting, legacy.\n\nDespite the site\u2019s productivity and success in delivering blockbuster drugs, its fate was sealed by the turbulence of large pharmaceutical mergers throughout the 2000s.\n\nAfter Organon was taken over by the large pharmaceutical firm Schering-Plough, the future looked bright. The site was ear-marked as the global compound management and supply hub, with major investment in state-of-the-art chemical storage facilities.\n\nHowever, a subsequent merger with another pharma behemoth, MSD, brought the inflow of capital to a shuddering halt. Large pharmaceutical mergers are often indifferent to the success and productivity of smaller R&D centres, and the closure of Newhouse was a critical blow to Scotland\u2019s drug discovery industry, as it was the only large pharmaceutical research site in the country.\n\nThe loss of this hive of drug discovery knowledge and expertise was significant. While some individuals stayed in science in Scotland, finding work in local life science companies or migrating to academia, many took their and expertise skills abroad or retrained to start completely new careers. This could easily have been a painful milestone on a path of slow decline of Scotland's rich heritage in drug discovery and medical innovation.\n\nYet, the site remained intact, even if much of its equipment was stripped away. Taken over by BioCity, it was re-purposed to provide rented laboratory space to incubate a diversity of new and growing life and chemical sciences companies.\n\nOne critical asset that couldn\u2019t be moved due to its sheer size was the chemical compound storage facility - commissioned by Schering-Plough, but never used. Fortunately, some ex-Organon leaders remained committed to maintaining the site\u2019s legacy and keeping Scotland\u2019s drug discovery flame alive.\n\nAn opportunity arose when the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private funding agency backed by the EU and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), launched a call for consortia to share pharmaceutical compound libraries with European academics and SMEs.\n\nAlongside ex- Organon colleagues in the Netherlands, a bid was submitted and won, leading to the creation of the European Lead Factory (ELF). This brought investment back to the site and led to the foundation of a small compound management business, BioAscent, alongside the creation of a co-located academic drug discovery team, the European Screening Centre (ESC).\n\nDespite the immense complexity of the project and the large network of partners involved, the ELF years were a whirlwind of discovery. BioAscent and the ESC collaborating with brilliant - and occasionally demanding - academic, SME and pharma teams across Europe. The group worked on a diverse portfolio of hundreds of potential drug targets, yielding promising drug candidates for diseases ranging from antimicrobial-resistant infections to cancer.\n\nHowever, the IMI funding was always temporary. Without a sustainable source of funds, economic entropy would ultimately dissolve the academic ESC team. A smaller scale dissolution of drug discovery expertise mirroring the previous MSD site closure.\n\nThe completion of the ELF project would also prove a tough test for BioAscent, which had been working to establish itself in the compound management market, facing the challenge of convincing large companies to trust their precious compound collections to a small, and relatively unknown Scottish firm - an effort that was always accompanied by concerns for the long-term prospects of scaling a business in such a niche area of drug discovery services.\n\nAt this critical juncture, a new chief executive joined BioAscent, and discussions began about integrating the ESC staff and expanding BioAscent into 'integrated drug discovery services'. Just as the ESC staff faced redundancy, a plan was devised, funding was raised through Maven Capital, and the turbulent transition from academia to the contract research organisation (CRO) industry was initiated.\n\nOvernight, BioAscent went from seven employees in one department to 35 employees in three departments: compound management, chemistry and biosciences.\n\nThis chaotic transition, an exercise of change management on steroids, came with significant challenges. Securing clients became an urgent priority, which isn\u2019t easy when the company had no track record of trading as an integrated drug discovery CRO.\n\nHappily, through hard work and the cohesion of the BioAscent team, the order book began to fill, and 80% compound annual growth followed in revenue for integrated drug discovery services, along with 51% for the entire company between 2018 and 2023.\n\nBioAscent offers more than just a tale of saving a few jobs: it\u2019s a story of resilience, innovation and the value of believing in people and investing in infrastructure; even in times of uncertainty.\n\nThe revival of the Newhouse site, once nearly consigned to history, shows that with strategic vision, collaboration, a commitment to excellence, and a bit of stubborn persistence - even a site buffeted by the turbulent cycles of industry - can rise again.\n\nAt the heart of this are its people - experienced drug hunters and problem solvers, many of whom are veterans of Organon. Their expertise and deep roots in Scotland have been pivotal in re-establishing Newhouse as a hub of drug discovery.\n\nPrioritising human capital over owning proprietary drug intellectual property (IP) shields BioAscent from the fate of so many R&D centres - absorbed, stripped of their easily transportable IP, and dismantled and discarded by global mergers.\n\nLooking ahead, consider it as a stretched goal, but maybe BioAscent can act as a counterweight to the UK's 'Golden Triangle', counteracting the gravitational pull that sees talent and investment flow down south.\n\nIts model - focused on integrated drug discovery services, strategic partnerships, and delivering consistent science and customer interactions - positions it not just as a survivor of Scotland\u2019s industrial challenges, but as a key player in the future of Scottish innovation.\n\nThe story of the Newhouse research site and BioAscent\u2019s journey might offer lessons for other regions and industries navigating the same cycles of boom and bust. A downturn doesn\u2019t have to signal the end, it can be an opportunity to smart something new.\n\nFor Scotland, historically a powerhouse of scientific and industrial innovation, BioAscent represents a new chapter. Its growth proves that, with the right vision and leadership, industries can be revived, economies recharged and futures rewritten.\n\nIn today\u2019s uncertain economic climate, this is a reminder that investment in people, skills, and innovation is never truly wasted. Even after periods of decline when circumstances looked bleak, there is always the potential for re-discovery - a message that should inspire industries worldwide to pursue their own renaissance.\n\nStuart McElroy is director of biosciences at BioAscent"

        "article_content": "In a world where rapid access to services has become the norm\u2014whether ordering food, booking a ride, or streaming entertainment\u2014the financial sector is catching up. Fintech companies are under increasing pressure to streamline processes, especially in areas like onboarding, where cumbersome, manual verifications have traditionally slowed things down. Responding to this demand, Invincible Ocean has launched a groundbreaking AI-powered no-code onboarding platform that reduces fintech product deployment to just 10 minutes, potentially transforming the customer onboarding landscape.\n\nAs governments globally tighten Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, the demand for efficient, compliant eKYC solutions has become a priority across industries. Invincible Ocean\u2019s solution is designed to help businesses, particularly in finance, navigate this requirement effortlessly while keeping fraud risks at bay.\n\n\"As onboarding journeys across different sectors are largely similar, our solution allows the same product to be used across various industries and use cases,\" states Ajay Setia, CEO, Invincible Ocean. \"Additionally, our Invincible Intelligence ecosystem helps design customised risk engines using alternate data.\"\n\nSimplifying onboarding with no-code efficiency\n\nAt the core of Invincible Ocean\u2019s platform is a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that requires no specialised coding knowledge. This no-code design allows users from various departments\u2014not just tech teams\u2014to customise their onboarding workflows easily. By enabling a microservices-based architecture, companies can modularise each part of the onboarding process, breaking it down into reusable components that simplify configuration. This approach allows businesses to create a personalised onboarding journey tailored to their brand's look and feel, integrating domain names, logos, and colours, for a seamless user experience.\n\n\"Our no-code platform is accessible to a wide range of users within an organisation,\" Setia says. \"It allows companies to build onboarding solutions without the need for deep technical expertise, democratising access to a crucial area of customer experience and compliance.\"\n\nA standout feature of the platform is its ability to adapt across industries. While the platform is flexible enough to meet general onboarding needs, it also offers pre-designed, industry-specific solutions tailored to sectors like Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), insurance, and banking. These customised workflows are already aligned with the unique compliance and operational requirements of each industry, making it easier for businesses to deploy without the need for extensive adjustments.\n\nSpeed is the hallmark of this offering, with a record delivery time of 10 minutes for product deployment. In contrast to traditional onboarding processes that may take days or even weeks, Invincible Ocean\u2019s rapid deployment ensures that businesses can quickly react to changing regulatory needs and roll out solutions for onboarding customers and vendors seamlessly.\n\n\"Invincible, with its DIY platform and 250+ verification APIs, provides eKYC solutions for 150+ countries and includes a comprehensive vehicle intelligence ecosystem,\" says Setia, highlighting the platform\u2019s vast reach and capability to support businesses on a global scale.\n\nTackling onboarding challenges\n\nIn developing this no-code solution, the company identified three critical challenges in the current onboarding landscape: inefficiency, high costs, and fraud risks. Traditional onboarding typically involves manual paperwork, time-consuming verifications, and disconnected systems, leading to bottlenecks and elevated costs. For many businesses, these processes also increase the likelihood of errors and fraud.\n\nTo address these challenges, the platform leverages AI-driven risk engines and real-time data processing, which enhance fraud detection capabilities. By allowing users to configure risk engines according to industry-specific needs, the platform also helps minimise exposure to fraudulent activities. For instance, financial institutions that prioritise security can leverage the Invincible Intelligence ecosystem, which uses alternate data to make real-time, risk-informed decisions.\n\nIt\u2019s built as a white-label solution, enabling organisations to integrate onboarding seamlessly within their existing brand environment, while ensuring compliance and security. This adaptability ensures that clients can scale their onboarding solutions to meet evolving business demands without compromising security or user experience.\n\nOngoing support for changing regulatory needs\n\nDespite the platform's simplicity, Invincible Ocean provides robust client support. \"We designed a straightforward DIY platform that emphasises ease of use,\" Setia says. To facilitate smooth onboarding for users, it has incorporated AI-enabled tips throughout the platform and offers resources like tutorials, user guides, and access to a dedicated support team.\n\nKeeping pace with the fast-changing fintech sector, Invincible Ocean actively gathers client feedback to continuously improve its platform. With a clientele of over 300 companies and 10 banks, the platform\u2019s adaptability is a response to emerging trends and regulatory changes. The Invincible Intelligence Ecosystem was specifically designed to meet the demand for comprehensive insights from real-time data, enabling businesses to make quick, informed adjustments.\n\n\u201cBy harnessing real-time data and advanced analytics, the platform can adapt to regulatory shifts and evolving market demands, ensuring that clients remain compliant and competitive,\u201d explains Setia.\n\nData security and privacy at the forefront\n\nIn a world where data breaches are a constant threat, the company prioritises data security and privacy. The platform incorporates secure microservices and encryption to protect data at every stage of onboarding. Compliance with industry regulations is a key component of the platform\u2019s architecture, which employs robust access controls and regular security audits to detect and prevent potential threats. For companies handling sensitive KYC information, this adherence to high-security standards is a reassurance that customer data is well-protected.\n\nBy focusing on ease of use, data security, and regulatory compliance, Invincible Ocean has effectively addressed key pain points in the onboarding process, making it a go-to solution for fintech companies worldwide. As Setia aptly concludes, \"In today\u2019s market, onboarding needs to be not only fast but also secure and adaptable. Invincible Ocean\u2019s platform meets that demand, empowering businesses to deploy fintech products quickly and confidently.\""

Aside from the cover or perhaps some illustrations, multiple colors aren\u2019t that important to the experience of reading a novel, but it is for magazines, comics, and books that rely on photographs or artwork to get the point across.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Amazon Kindle Colorsoft brings a color screen to the Kindle, bridging the gap between it and a tablet and, in an ideal world, making owning or carrying both these devices around redundant. It\u2019s also doing so while retaining its trademark low-power, easy-on-the-eyes e-ink display. I\u2019ve been reading on the Colorsoft for a few weeks to see if it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s Wizard of Oz moment.\n\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft specs\n\nSize 127.6 x 176.7 x 7.8mm Weight 219g Display 7-inch 300ppi (black and white) 150ppi (color) 94 nits maximum brightness Storage 32GB Battery life Up to 8 weeks Charging 9W wired, Qi wireless Durability IPX8 Colors Metallic Black\n\nReading on a Kindle is magical\n\nMy years-old Kindle Paperwhite\u2019s battery stopped charging in 2023, and rather than buying a new one, I used an Apple iPad as its replacement. The big, colorful screen is excellent for magazines and comics, but less so for novels. The device itself is ungainly to use in bed, and it\u2019s not very \u201cfriendly,\u201d with its cold exterior and hard edges. I read things on it, but I never really relaxed with it.\n\nWhat a difference the Kindle Colorsoft made when it arrived. I adore the thin, lightweight, soft-to-touch shell and rounded sides and corners, and it\u2019s wonderful to use whether you\u2019re lying in bed, sitting in a cafe, or when you\u2019ve got some time to spare while waiting for someone to arrive. The size and 219-gram weight make it easily transported in a bag, far more so than a full-size iPad, and the nonreflective screen not only makes it usable in different lighting conditions, but also so comfortable to view.\n\nMore than that, I appreciate the 7-inch screen\u2019s extremely wide viewing angles and the way it sits right up against the front glass, replicating the look of a paper page very well. It feels warm to the touch and makes you feel warm inside when you read on it. The friendliness of a Kindle is hard to describe, but its importance can\u2019t be overstated, as it\u2019s a huge part of the device\u2019s appeal. If you\u2019re an experienced Kindler, you likely know what I mean. If you haven\u2019t read on one before, you\u2019re in for a treat.\n\nThe friendliness of a Kindle is hard to describe.\n\nI happily read a novel in the time I\u2019ve been testing the Kindle Colorsoft. I set the brightness and warmth of the page view up once and haven\u2019t felt the need to change it, slightly altered the font size, and that\u2019s all. The words are pin-sharp on the screen, and it\u2019s fast to respond when turning pages and navigating the menus.\n\nIt\u2019s all completely customizable, so if you want larger text, a warmer tone, less brightness, or to schedule a time to automatically increase the warmth of the screen, it\u2019s all a few taps and swipes away. Using the Kindle Colorsoft reminded me of what I\u2019d been missing during all that time I spent reading on my iPad.\n\nIs the color magical, too?\n\nThis is where the trouble with the Colorsoft begins. Almost everything I\u2019ve said so far applies to all Kindle models, and you can spend a lot less than the price of the Colorsoft and get all the above benefits. The only genuine reason to buy the Colorsoft over a Kindle Paperwhite or a basic Kindle is the color screen, so what\u2019s it like?\n\nThere is a quality difference between the black-and-white and color screens, with a 300 pixel-per-inch (ppi) density for the former and 150 ppi for the color screen. However, color pages still look sharp and filled with detail, even when you zoom in by pinching the screen.\n\nThis gesture worked in comics, but not in the magazines I tried, where you were forced to view the entire page without the option to look more closely at any images. It may not be the same for every magazine, though. I also cranked the brightness up and used the Vivid screen setting for anything in color, as in Standard mode and below a certain brightness level, images can look dark and dingy.\n\nFormatting for the comics I tried wasn\u2019t ideal either. I have been reading through Skybound Entertainment and Daniel Warren Johnson\u2019s Transformers series, and the distinct border sometimes seen down either side of the page isn\u2019t very attractive. It is minimized by using the inverted page color (where the background is dark and the text light), but it\u2019s still apparent, depending on what you\u2019re reading. Text can be really tiny unless you zoom in, which is where the Colorsoft\u2019s slow processing speed and screen refresh rate show up. There are flickers and stutters while it rearranges the page and processes the image, which simply doesn\u2019t happen on a tablet.\n\nMagazines don\u2019t fare much better. Gone are the smooth page transitions found in black-and-white books, and the stutters that accompany each screen tap are jarring and unpleasant. Formatting again isn\u2019t always ideal, with some pages blank aside from a single, thumbnail-sized image. As someone who likes to read magazines out of page order, the navigation is usually confusing and makes \u201cflicking through\u201d impossible. It\u2019s not absolutely terrible, but it\u2019s not like reading the print version of a magazine or even reading one digitally on a tablet.\n\nI repeatedly questioned just how much benefit I was getting from the color screen. Comics look sharp and defined, but the process of turning pages and zooming in is slow and janky, while magazines can be formatted oddly and the images are often too small to be anything more than page dressing.\n\nThere are flickers and stutters while it rearranges the page and processes the image.\n\nWhere the color screen came into its own is in the library and browsing books in the Kindle Store, where the covers pop off the screen and bring life to the normally grayscale world of the Kindle. I like the color screen savers that show when the Colorsoft is in standby, and many people will appreciate the different color highlighter options too.\n\nGetting the basics right\n\nThe color screen does add a touch of class and modernity to the Kindle, but I don\u2019t think it enhances the act of reading on one. Amazon\u2019s Kindles are at their best when things are kept simple, and a great example is the software experience outside of books. There\u2019s a Home Screen and a Library screen, a swipe-down page where commonly used settings live, and a single tap in the top of a page in an open book lets you quickly return to your library. It\u2019s equally as easy to jump into the Kindle Store, find a book, and immediately purchase and download it \u2014 something you can\u2019t do through the iPad\u2019s Kindle app.\n\nEven setup is simple, with the Colorsoft guiding me through getting it ready using the Kindle app on my phone. It was up and running in less than 10 minutes, and the Wi-Fi connection has been faultless. There\u2019s 32GB of internal storage, and while it supports a range of different formats, using anything other than the Kindle Store is a bit of a pain due to individual DRM restrictions. For personal files, there are various options to transfer them over, including through the Kindle app on your phone or connecting it physically to a computer.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nCharging is through a USB-C port on the bottom of the Kindle, and the battery will last for up to eight weeks according to Amazon. I\u2019ve used the Colorsoft Signature Edition every day for the last three weeks, reading different material for up to an hour, and the battery is at 70%, so I expect it to easily reach this estimation. Recharging is slow, though, and a full change is expected to take two-and-a-half hours using the maximum 9 watts of power.\n\nThe Colorsoft\u2019s screen has a maximum brightness of 94 nits, plus the device has an IPX8 water resistance rating for reading at the beach or in the bath. I love the Kindle Colorsoft\u2019s overall simplicity, but unfortunately, Amazon decided to only offer it in black. For a device that\u2019s presumably going to be sold on the fact that it has a color screen, it\u2019s a shame the shell doesn\u2019t come in different colors too, as the flash of reflective color in the Amazon logo on the back just isn\u2019t enough.\n\nWhat\u2019s not so good about the Colorsoft\n\nThere are a few things about the Colorsoft that have frustrated me a little, and they deserve special mention here. The Kindle has an auto-brightness setting that adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness according to the conditions. It consistently set the brightness too low for my personal taste, especially as comics and other color content really require a high-level of brightness to appreciate. I turned it off and adjusted the brightness manually when needed.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are manufacturing reasons why the power button is on the bottom of the Colorsoft, but it\u2019s not the most ergonomic location. I\u2019ve accidentally pressed it when resting the Kindle on my chest, and would have preferred it on the top of the device. Also, it\u2019s unfortunate that the Colorsoft does not have the full dark mode found on other Kindle models. Considering the price, the Colorsoft should have all the features, but full dark mode may arrive through a software update in the future.\n\nThe last thing to mention is if you check Amazon\u2019s page for the Colorsoft, you\u2019ll note the low review rating. This is mostly due to some early buyers of the Kindle Colorsoft seeing a yellow tint on the lower part of the screen, but my review model does not seem to be affected. Amazon is aware of the problem and is offering a refund or exchange to anyone with an affected device.\n\nAmazon Kindle Colorsoft price and availability\n\nThe Amazon Kindle Colorsoft is available to buy now, it comes in only one color and one storage space option, and costs $280. Aside from the Kindle Scribe, it\u2019s the most expensive Kindle you can get. If you want to just read books, the base Kindle (2024) costs $110. It\u2019s quite the savings, and the very desirable Kindle Paperwhite is just a little more at $160. You need to be very sure you want the color screen to invest in the Colorsoft. Because of the Colorsoft\u2019s high price, anyone who wants some color in their life also has a selection of very temptin,g but technically different alternatives.\n\nI\u2019ve loved my time with the Kindle Colorsoft.\n\nThe Amazon Fire Max 11 with its keyboard comes into play as it regularly hovers around $330 for the whole package, and a 64GB 10.9-inch Apple iPad costs $350. If you want to read magazines, comics, and image-heavy books, they\u2019re better at it than the Kindle Colorsoft, and aren\u2019t that much more money. When you consider everything else you can do with a tablet, they are a good value, too.\n\nFinally, if you aren\u2019t married to Amazon and the Kindle book store and want a slightly more off-the-wall alternative, the $250 Onyx Boox Go Color 7 does a lot of what makes the Colorsoft special, with greater versatility through its Google Android operating system.\n\nShould you buy the Kindle Colorsoft?\n\nAt first, the case for buying the Kindle Colorsoft looks quite complicated, but when you break it down and fully understand the color screen, it\u2019s far easier to make a decision than you may think. As a Kindle e-reader for books, it\u2019s excellent, just like the other models. The color screen primarily makes it more modern and adds visual punch to the store and your library, and also makes comics and magazines more readable. It really does provide more reading opportunities and a touch of fun to the Kindle, and I would miss it if I went back to a grayscale screen. For these reasons, I\u2019ve loved my time with it.\n\nMuch as I\u2019ve loved reading books on the Kindle Colorsoft, I know I\u2019d love reading them on a Paperwhite, too; plus, reading comics and magazines is a more ponderous experience than it is on a tablet. Even with my relatively low comic and magazine consumption, the color screen\u2019s ability to hold my attention is strained, and if I only read comics and magazines, it would quickly become frustrating, and I\u2019d reach for my iPad.\n\nThe Kindle Colorsoft is brilliant, and it\u2019s a recommended buy, but mostly because it\u2019s a Kindle and not really because it has a color screen. Colorizing the Kindle has made it more modern and will definitely mean it will reach new eyeballs, but like Night of the Living Dead and The Mist, sometimes black-and-white is just better."

From its dappled forged carbon fiber lid, to its overclockable Intel Core i9 HX processor and Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU, this is a laptop that isn\u2019t afraid to throw its weight around. And why should it be? With specs that powerful, you can game, create content, and plow through any work that might fall into your lap. Hell, you might find Jimmy Hoffa with this thing (OK, I\u2019m being facetious with that last one, but the Legion 9i is a serious powerhouse).\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHowever, a pair of subpar speakers mar an otherwise great laptop. And we can\u2019t forget the price, which will prevent all but the most deep-pocketed gamers from partaking in the awesomeness. But if you want an absolute force of one of the best gaming laptops available, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) is a must-see.\n\nSpecs and configurations\n\nLenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 Dimensions 14.1 x 10.93 x 0.75 ~.89 inches Weight 5.51 pounds Processor Intel Core i9-14900HX Graphics Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090/Intel UHD Graphics RAM Up to 64GB LPDDR5 5600MHz Display 16-inch 3,200 x 2000 mini-LED Storage Up to 2TB (RAID 0 1TB+1TB) PCIe SSD (Gen 4) Touch No Ports 2x Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A, 1x, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type C, 1x HDMI 2.1 Wireless Killer WiFi 6E* 802.11AX (2 x 2) and Bluetooth 5.1 Webcam 1080p + IR camera Operating system Windows 11 Pro Battery 99 watt-hour Price $3,840\n\nLenovo only offers one pre-built configuration of the Legion 9i Gen 9 on the company site, and the $4,560 price will definitely make more than a few wallets wince.\n\nThe configuration I reviewed has a 2.2-GHz Intel Core i9-14900HX Meteor Lake Refresh processor with 32GB of 5600Mhz DDR5 RAM, two 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSDs in RAID 0 configuration, integrated Intel UHD Graphics, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU with 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 16-inch, 3200 x 2000 mini-LED, 16:10 aspect ratio display with a 165Hz refresh rate and 3-millisecond response time and Windows 11 Home. However, you can save yourself almost $1,000 if you purchase the system from B&H which currently has the laptop on sale for $3,399.\n\nThe base model of the Gen 9 can be found in the configure menu on Lenovo\u2019s website. It costs $3,840 and halves the storage and drops the GPU to a 4080 GPU with 12GB of video memory. If you want to max out the specs, prepare to fork out $4,665, which will add Windows 11 Pro and 64GB of RAM to the mix.\n\nA unique, elegant design\n\nThe Legion 9i doesn\u2019t look like any other gaming laptop on the market. It doesn\u2019t even look like any laptop in its line. That\u2019s because Lenovo used forged carbon fiber for its lid that with the company\u2019s eight-layer stamping method, the lid is 10% lighter and stronger than regular aluminum. In terms of looks, the lid falls somewhere in between one of those old-school composition notebooks and some elegant camouflage. And while that process makes for a lighter, tougher lid, the slightly textured panel is a one-of-one with each notebook sporting a different pattern. As nice as the lid looks, you\u2019ll want to have a microfiber cloth handy as the lid is highly susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.\n\nThere\u2019s a small silver metal Lenovo plate embedded into the lower-left corner of the lid with a large RGB-backlit Legion emblem running vertically down the right. The camera and mic housing sits top center with its glossy metal covering protruding ever so slightly, The hinge connecting the lid and bottom of the laptop is large and extends into a rather large vent that has several ports. A thin RGB light strip creates a line of delineation between the hinge and vent.\n\nThe notebook\u2019s interior and undercarriage are made primarily of recycled magnesium colored carbon black. Compared to other gaming laptops, the palm rest is rather small, but there\u2019s still enough room to accommodate most wrists and a small metal Lenovo tag in the lower-right corner. The trackpad is long instead of tall and sits below the island-style keyboard as it glows seductively. Above that is a large air vent with the power button sitting front and center. The 16-inch display is ensconced in matte black bezels with a small lip at the top making the lid easier to open.\n\nThe Legion 9i\u2019s undercarriage is almost all vent with two raised rubber feet to assist with airflow. The back foot has a middle divot stamped with Legion, which is a nice touch. You have a pair of bottom-firing speakers toward the front and two large vents along the sides. The bottom panel is held in place with six screws in case you want to access the laptop\u2019s interior.\n\nThe notebook has a solid array of ports and slots befitting a laptop of this size. You have a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 port and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port on the right with a physical camera disable switch. On the left sits an SD card reader and a headset jack. You\u2019ll find the rest of the ports in the rear with another USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a HMDI 2.1 port, Ethernet port, and a proprietary DC-in jack.\n\nCompared to its competitors, the 5.51-pound, 0.75 ~0.89 inch x 14.1 x 10.93-inch Legion 9i is almost a lightweight. The Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 (0.91 x 11.57 x 15.71 inches) is the big man on campus here at 6.83 pounds, but keep in mind that this is an 18-inch laptop. Next up, is the Alienware m16 R2 (0.93 x 14.33 x 9.81 inches), which weighs 5.75 pounds. And finally, we have the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 (13.94 x 9.69 x 0.64 inches) that tips the scales at 4.1 pounds, which is the lightest of the bunch.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nIn the battle between matte and glossy displays, Lenovo has chosen matte for the Legion 9i. And while matte panels effectively cut down on glare and reflections, they\u2019ve been known to deliver muted color. I found the 16-inch, 3200 x 2000 mini-LED panel delivered great color and detail, which took some of the hurt from the many deaths I suffered while playing Black Myth: Wukong. Speaking of which, thanks to the inclusion of Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync software and the panel\u2019s 165Hz refresh rate and 3ms response rate, my attacks, dodges, and parries were as smooth as butter, as were my myriad of deaths.\n\nThe display achieved 100% of the sRGB color gamut. However, on the Adobe sRGB and DCI-P3 gamuts, the screen reached 88 and 99%, respectively. Both results are short of the 100% Lenovo claims. But in case the panel isn\u2019t as vivid as you\u2019d like, the laptop has Dolby Vision software to adjust the color temperature. My light meter clocked the display\u2019s brightness at 692 nits, which is impressive for a matte panel.\n\nI knew when I took my initial tour around the laptop, I identified one of its few flaws: the bottom-mounted speaker. And sure enough, once I started streaming tracks on Spotify, the pair of 2W Harmon speakers produced mediocre audio. The volume couldn\u2019t fill my medium-sized living room. Even worse, the low end is hollow more often than not with weak bass and percussion no matter the genre. And this is despite having Nahmic\u2019s audio software preinstalled, which is one of the better apps out there.\n\nBut the audio quality deteriorates when using the laptop on your lap. My thighs swallowed up the tiny speaker grilles, which in turn, muffled the audio. You\u2019re definitely going to need a pair of headphones or a gaming headset if you have any expectation of good audio.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nLenovo\u2019s smile-shaped keys bring a smile to my face. While they\u2019re not as good as what you\u2019d find on the company\u2019s ThinkPad line of laptops, the Legion 9i\u2019s keyboard with its Chiclet-style keys with their 1.5mm key travel are super comfy to type on with firm feedback and no bottoming out. The keycaps are large with generous spacing. And while I rarely use the NumPad, I\u2019m always glad to see it included. I surpassed my usual 70-words-per-minute average on the MonkeyType typing test, hitting 85 wpm.\n\nThe keyboard features per-key backlighting, which allows you to create a custom light show with every key glowing in a different shade via the Lenovo Vantage app. This is also where you can set macros, monitor system health, adjust camera and display settings, and much more.\n\nThe Legion 9i\u2019s touchpad is smaller than what I\u2019m used to nowadays, but it got the job done. Multitouch gestures such as pinch-zoom, two-finger scroll and three-finger tap performed seamlessly. The trackpad offers good palm rejection with strong feedback on the bottom corners.\n\nWebcam and connectivity\n\nThe Legion 9i has one of the best integrated webcams I\u2019ve seen this year on a gaming laptop. The color on the 1080p shooter is great, capturing the exact shade of bubblegum pink of my wrapped locs. Details were so sharp, you can see almost every wrinkle in my sunflower yellow shirt. It\u2019ll definitely hold up in a video call or a live stream.\n\nAnd in some other webcam fun, the laptop has Tobii\u2019s eye-tracking software preinstalled in the form of Tobii Aware and Horizon. The former dims the screen when you\u2019re not looking at it while the latter lets you control a game using head-tracking.\n\nAs for connectivity, the Legion 9i has a Killer WiFi 6E* 802.11AX (2 x 2) network card with Bluetooth 5.1.\n\nCPU performance\n\nWho ordered a ridiculous amount of power, because the Legion 9i has a double serving. The notebook sports a 24-core Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market. The juggernaut came out swinging on the Cinebench R24 multi-core test, beating all competitors.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Lenovo only edged out its predecessor by a few points. And as usual, the MacBook Pro 16 with its M3 Max chipset beat out all challengers. The M4 Max would surely push this comparison even further, though we\u2019ve only tested the M4 Pro model so far. The single-core portion of the Cinebench R24 had a similar outcome with the Legion 9i leading the gaming laptops, and the MacBook being the overall winner. The Legion 9i managed to score a definitive victory over everyone during the GPU portion of Cinebench R24, including the MacBook.\n\nWe got similar results on both the multi- and single-thread runs of Geekbench 6 test, with the Legion surpassing its gaming laptop rivals. It\u2019s interesting to see how close last year\u2019s Legion 9i is to its descendent. But as powerful as the new kid on the block is, it couldn\u2019t overtake the MacBook 16 with its highly optimized chipset and operating system. Although the Legion is primarily a gaming laptop, it is more than capable of handling any video, photo, or audio editing project you have up your sleeve. Running the PugetBench tests for both Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, the Lenovo maintained a slight lead over everything but the MacBook Pro.\n\nGaming\n\nWhile it\u2019s nice that the Legion can handle all your productivity and content creation tasks, you\u2019re here to game. And with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, the Legion 9i is more than ready for those marathon gaming sessions. That\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t some competition. While the Legion 9i achieved high marks on the 3DMark Time Spy test, it wasn\u2019t enough to topple the ROG Strix Scar 18. The Legion however, is only a few points shy from matching the Scar. The Legion 9i got the upper hand on the 3D FireStrike test.\n\n1600p resolution has become the sweet spot for many gamers, but at its 2000p native resolution, the Legion 9i frame rate never dropped below 90 frames per second, even on titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong, and Forza Horizon 5, which are some of the most graphically taxing games on the market.\n\nThanks to the GPU and its 16GB of video memory, you can crank up all the settings to the max and that includes ray tracing. And if you want to squeeze every frame out of the system, feel free to enable Nvidia\u2019s DLSS technology. My only other gripe with the Legion 9i is the fans. The laptop\u2019s trio of fans are seriously loud with Performance mode enabled. It\u2019s to be expected with a laptop of this caliber as is the heat exhaust blowing from the top of the keyboard deck.\n\nBattery life\n\nGaming laptops this stacked are a series of checks and balances. Sure, you\u2019ll get ridiculous power, but man, is that battery life going to suck. However, the Legion 9i lasted longer than expected with a time of four hours, nine minutes on the video playback test with the power setting on Best Performance at 100 nits of brightness. That\u2019s a little longer than the Scar 18, but it falls short of the Alienware m16 R2 and the ROG Zephyrus G16.\n\nStill, that time is respectable for a gaming laptop, especially one with these heavy duty specs. Thanks to Nvidia\u2019s Advanced Optimus software, which is essentially a MUX switch, the laptop can switch over to its integrated Intel UHD Graphics chip, when handling less graphically taxing tasks. That way, the laptop can last longer on a charge.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIf you\u2019re on a quest for power, the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch) lies at the end of the journey. The desktop replacement is a certified beast, sporting a one-two punch of an Intel Core i9 processor and an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU. Whether it\u2019s gaming, creating content, or productivity, the Lenovo Legion 9i can handle it all with unflappable aplomb. On top of that, it\u2019s got a lovely display, comfortable, customizable keyboard, a crispy webcam, and it\u2019s got an interesting design.\n\nThe only real flaw the notebook has is its weak speakers and of course, the exorbitant price, which is a shame as the Legion 9i is just a stone\u2019s throw from perfect. Offering some more customization in terms of configurations may have allowed a more affordable entry point too. Sure the fans can get loud, but that\u2019s to be expected in a gaming laptop.\n\nIf you want something with longer battery life, consider the Alienware m16 R2 or the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16. But for people that want power, plain and simple. It\u2019s a bit of a niche laptop at this price, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find something better than the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 9 (16-inch)."
