        "article_content": "By Bront\u00eb H. Lacsamana, Reporter\n\nMovie Review\n\nV/H/S Beyond\n\nSM\u2019s Sine Sindak\n\nFOR teenagers and young adults, Sine Sindak was the ideal Halloween treat. Too old to partake in Trick or Treat and too young to organize family visits to the cemetery, this segment of the youth was more than happy to check out an affordable horror film festival brought to malls nationwide by SM Cinemas.\n\nWith tickets priced at P150 per film, and P300 for an all-day pass, barkadas were able to scare each other effectively in a dark, comfortable, and immersive movie theater. BusinessWorld joined in the fun on Nov. 4, the day before the festival closed.\n\nV/H/S, an American horror anthology composed of short found footage films (a genre of horror where the camera is supposedly held by a character, often leading to shaky camera movement), released its 7th installment this October.\n\nTitled V/H/S Beyond, it was one of the many offerings at Sine Sindak that horror fanatics and eager barkadas flocked to see. Unlike other installments in the franchise, it had a central theme \u2014 science fiction and dangerous life forms \u2014 promising a bloody experience in the theater.\n\nAs with any anthology, the films presented were a mixed bag.\n\nStork, helmed by Jordan Downey and Kevin Stewart, was a strong start and definitely benefited from its heavy use of the video game visual style. Filmed from the point of view of body cams on a crew of cops, it follows their mission into an old house filled with what seem to be zombies. It genuinely feels like watching a video game unfold, as the characters shoot and stab their way through the horde and up to the attic where they uncover the mystery behind the alien-zombie cult colony.\n\nA group of high school kids who were hanging out at the cinemas the whole day for Sine Sindak (probably using the watch-all-you-can day pass) came in just for this segment. They had an uproarious time reacting to it and scaring each other, then left immediately after \u2014 showing just how much fun it is for that particular demographic.\n\nDream Girl had potential to show us something more than a freaky monster finally running loose, but never dug in to any level of depth. It was made by Virat Pal and Evan Dickson. In it, two tabloid news cameramen gain access to the busy set of Bollywood star Tara\u2019s latest movie, hoping to catch footage of her. While they most certainly do, it comes at a cost as they find out what kind of goddess she actually is.\n\nWhile the film touched very lightly on the brutality of making it big in the film industry and the exploitation that takes its toll on aspiring stars, none of it ever really amounted to something in the plot. The climax was \u201cbeautiful star turns into a monster and goes on a killing spree while a catchy Bollywood tune plays,\u201d which was awesome to behold, but not as satisfying as expected.\n\nLive and Let Dive was one of the weaker films. Made by Justin Martinez and Ben Turner, it follows a group of friends going skydiving to celebrate the birthday of one of them. Before they can do so, they spot an unidentified flying object (UFO) which crashes their plane and feasts on them. While it has an interesting concept, the execution is obnoxious and all over the place.\n\nFur Babies, another weak link, got understandably strong reactions from the audience since it centered on a pet daycare run by a deranged lady abusing dogs. Christian and Justin Long nailed the necessary beats to get people engaged, with animal rights activists trying to infiltrate the daycare. But it was tonally out of place in an anthology of insane alien stories.\n\nThe wraparound section by Jay Cheel, named Abduction/Adduction, was a YouTube-style mockumentary attempting to thread all the films together. Though passable, it didn\u2019t offer much enjoyment, especially the lackluster ending that didn\u2019t leave an impact.\n\nStowaway should have been the strong note to end on. It was this writer\u2019s absolute favorite, the only segment that compelled audiences to genuinely care for the lead character. Helmed by horror filmmaking couple Kate Siegel and Mike Flanagan, it followed a UFO documentarist who goes out to the Mojave Desert to document a recent influx of sightings by locals.\n\nLittle tidbits of her personaltiy, like her attachment to a keychain from childhood, and her undying curiosity being both a strength and a weakness, endeared her to audience members. Once she encounters an alien spaceship in the desert and makes the poor decision to enter the mysterious craft, the brutal transformation that awaits her builds up to a horrific end. By the end, the pure terror of her fate stays with you, providing not just visual and narrative dread, but also existential dread. Definitely one of the best in the V/H/S franchise.\n\nToday, Nov. 5, is the last day of Sine Sindak at SM Cinemas nationwide."

The next generations of Duttons (played by terrific ensemble Kelly Reilly, Luke Grimes, and Wes Bentley), orphans though they may now be, hope to keep the family traditions alive. There are still rumors , though no studio commitments, that a season six may happen without Costner.\n\nGoodbye, \u201cYellowstone\u201d road. The fifth and final season of Taylor Sheridan\u2019s breakout contemporary neo-western is circling its wagons starting Sunday at 10 p.m. on Paramount. Dutton family patriarch Kevin Costner has already ridden off into the sunset to make his multi-part western \u201cHorizon: An American Saga.\u201d Oops, the premiere flopped . Costner, though talented, has an epic penchant for self-sabotage.\n\nWhat else is coming this week?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out why,\u201d says \u201cInspector Ellis,\u201d a mantra for motive that underpins whodunits good and bad. The first-rate female-driven British procedural premieres today on Acorn. Striking Sharon D. Clarke plays DCI Ellis, a self-possessed detective-of-few-words-and-big-actions. With assistant DS Harper (Andrew Gower), the experienced pair are the pros from Dover who bigfoot the turf of flailing local cops. In this three-part miniseries, Ellis and Harper investigate a young man\u2019s mysterious death, the suspicious disappearance of a detective that leads to a trail of police corruption, and the disappearance of honeymooners where a severed hand points the way to the crime\u2019s solution.\n\n2. Discovery launches \u201cGame Changers\u201d Tuesday at 9 p.m. The limited series goes back to the dark ages of gaming \u2014 Pong \u2014 at the dawn of Atari and the gaming industry. According to the International Gaming Commission, that modest game of back-and-forth spawned what was to become a $184 billion global video game industry in 2023. The eight-part docu-series charts the pastime\u2019s short history, employing archival footage and talking to creators, investors, experts, and players about the intellectual challenges, backstage dramas, and discovery of new frontiers in gaming. Episode 1 charts the rise of Nintendo, a one-time Japanese family business that began over a century ago making playing cards and evolved into a global entertainment giant.\n\n3. While Alan Cumming may never star as a gladiator in a Ridley Scott sword-and-sandal epic, he has conquered pretty much everything else he\u2019s tried. One-man \u201cMacbeth\u201d on Broadway? Done it. Now, with the five-part \u201cAlan Cumming\u2019s Paradise Homes\u201d airing on BritBox Wednesday, the effusive Scottish star with a love for all things tartan enters the shelter show market. Over five episodes, presenter Cumming pokes through houses that fascinate him. Inspired by his love for architecture and design, and in search of the magical and unique, Cumming prowls dream homes, from a private retreat in Mull with 360-degree views and circling golden eagles, to a renovated barn in Northern Ireland, to a home with a naturalistic style that harmonizes with its Swedish island site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. On Thursday, Amazon Prime continues to expand its international programming, including spinoffs for the \u201cCitadel\u201d spy franchise spearheaded by the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe. The ambitious project known as The Citadel Cinematic Universe heads to India for the action prequel \u201cCitadel: Honey Bunny,\u201d dubbed and in subtitles. Samantha Ruth Prabhu stars as actress Honey, opposite Varun Dhawan\u2019s stuntman Bunny. The Mr. and Mrs. Smith types get swept up in a spy ring where pulling the trigger isn\u2019t just play-acting. Years later, the estranged pair come together again when their past comes calling \u2014 and they must ensure the safety of their daughter Nadia.\n\n5. UFO reporter George Knapp throws down the gauntlet: \u201cWe need to get beyond that obvious question \u2018Are UFO\u2019s real?\u2019 to what really matters. Why are they here, and what do they want from us?\u201d In \u201cInvestigation Alien,\u201d the Netflix series dropping Friday, Knapp goes in search of hard evidence to back up his claims, undeterred by the Pentagon, which only last year declared there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of alien intelligence on earth. Are we alone in the universe or not? Knapp travels the world, highlighting suspicious incidents and interviewing witnesses. The truth is out there, but proof remains Knapp\u2019s holy grail."

        "date": "8h",
        "source": "ZDNet",
        "article_content": "It's a simple but effective desktop. Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nAI is being promoted everywhere. Many Linux distributions have already proclaimed they will never add it to the desktop (as Apple and Microsoft have for MacOS and Windows). With the latest release, Linux Lite decided to buck that trend\u2026 sort of.\n\nI'll explain that bit in a moment.\n\nAlso: If you're ready to leave Windows 11 behind, I recommend this distro for new Linux users\n\nThe new release of Linux Lite (version 7.2) is as good as it's always been. It's lean, sleek, easy to use, and includes everything you need to be social, productive, and/or entertained. I've covered Linux Lite before, proclaiming it as the best way to revive your old computer. I still stand by that claim because Linux Lite really is a great option for those aging machines.\n\nThat said, Linux Lite will also serve you well on modern hardware. Plus, like nearly every Linux distribution on the market, Linux Lite is free to download and install on as many computers as needed.\n\nWhat's in this new release?\n\nLet's start with the obvious freshness that's been added to the desktop.\n\nFirst and foremost, Linux Lite ships with version 4.18 of the Xfce desktop, which includes plenty of improvements to the Thunar file manager (such as an editable toolbar, split view, file highlighting, recursive search, on-screen notifications for undo/redo, and more), a new Lite Theme Manager, new preferences in the Panel, new font options for the clock applet, the ability to disable header bars in dialogs, pick a default monitor before you add a secondary monitor, and more.\n\nOkay, I know what you're thinking\u2026 that's not much. The thing to keep in mind is that the developers of the Xfce desktop take a more conservative approach to new releases. This desktop has evolved at a snail's pace because what they have works, and the Xfce community knows this. It's one of the few desktop environments where you don't find a lot of users clamoring for game-changing new features.\n\n\"It just works\u2026 and always will\" should be Xfce's mantra.\n\nAlso: I switched from Intel to AMD - here's why I'm never going back\n\nVersion 7.2 also ships with Linux kernel 6.8.0-49. That might sound like an older kernel (given the latest is 6.11.6), but it was only released on March 10, 2024. According to endoflife.date, version 6.8 of the Linux kernel stopped receiving security support on May 30, 2024. Version 6.8 is not an LTS (Long Term Support), so this is no surprise. It also doesn't mean you should avoid Linux Lite 7.2. This release is based on Ubuntu 24.04, which is a Long Term Support release, and if you need to upgrade to the 6.11 kernel, you can install it with this command:\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-linuxlite-6.11.0 linux-image-linuxlite-6.11.0 -y\n\nAfter installation, reboot, so the changes will take effect. Support for the 6.11 kernel ends on January 15, 2025.\n\nSometimes, support seems to be like an always-spinning rotating door.\n\nYou'll also find LibreOffice 24.2.6, GIMP 2.10.36, and VLC 3.0.20 (among other apps) installed and ready to go.\n\nWhat about this AI thing?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, AI has been added to the mix, but it's not quite what you're probably thinking. There's no AI app to open or integration to be found. The Linux Lite team went far more subtle than that. The AI is really just a website that serves as a direct support option: \"Linux Lite AI Chat.\" It's there to \"help you with all of your Linux Lite-related questions and issues.\" You can type a query, such as How do I install a theme in Linux Lite?, click Send, and you'll get your answer.\n\nAlso: This Linux distribution doesn't require installation, and still remembers where you left off\n\nJust for fun, I decided to open the default Chrome browser, point it to the AI Chat, save it as an app, and voil\u00e0... an AI web app that is accessible as a launcher on the desktop. I tested the AI chat for accuracy and found it pretty spot on. Although the instructions for upgrading the kernel differ from mine, they still work.\n\nPersonally, I believe this is the way to go for introducing AI to the Linux desktop, and I don't believe it needs to go any further than that. Integrating AI into the Linux operating system would be incredibly difficult, given how disparate the development teams are that create the various desktop apps. The Linux Lite developers would have to coordinate with teams from Xfce, Linux Kernel developers, LibreOffice, and countless others. I cannot imagine that happening on a level that would be necessary to get AI integrated throughout the desktop.\n\nSave the Linux Lite chatbot site as a web app and it's accessible from your desktop. Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nAll told, Linux Lite 7.2 is a small step forward for the distribution, but a slightly larger step forward for users. If you're worried you won't be able to figure out how to use Linux, you would do well with this distribution because you have a dedicated AI chatbot to answer Linux Lite-specific questions specific.\n\nIf you want to give this distribution a try, download the version 7.2 ISO and have at it."

        "article_content": "A handful of microbes have put global health on the ropes. They are the superbugs, considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one of the 10 main threats to public health and responsible for 1.27 million deaths a year. The WHO is specifically targeting 15 microorganisms considered \u201chighly dangerous\u201d due to their resistance to the arsenal of available antibiotics and their ability to spread or transmit resistance to other bacteria. Sworn enemies include, for example, resistant Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, among others. Regarding the latter, research published on Thursday in the journal Science has delved into their mechanisms for escaping antimicrobials and has discovered that, in order to be highly resistant, these microbes adopt a double defense.\n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) alone causes around 120,000 deaths a year worldwide. It is \u201ca serious global threat,\u201d explains Simon Foster, a researcher at the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom) and author of the study, which reveals a new defense mechanism for this bacteria. Methicillin was the antibiotic traditionally used against this microbe, but due to the appearance of MRSA and the toxicity of the drug itself, Foster explains, it was no longer being used. The problem is that methicillin belongs to a broader family of antibiotics, beta-lactams, and MRSA has become resistant to almost all of them. \u201cMRSA can sometimes be treated with other antibiotics, such as linezolid or tetracycline. However, for serious infections, such as bacteremia or endocarditis, daptomycin or vancomycin must be used. The problem is that resistance has developed against each of them,\u201d explains the expert.\n\nThe scientific community has long since discovered that MRSA had a peculiarity: it had acquired a gene that encodes a component called MecA, which helps form the bacteria\u2019s cell walls so that it can grow and divide. This genomic peculiarity makes it resistant, but researchers knew that this characteristic alone was not enough to be highly resistant. \u201cIt was also known that there are other small changes that occur in bacteria that allow a big jump in the level of resistance,\u201d Foster adds in an email response. Scientists thought that these small genetic changes, called \u201cenhancers\u201d in scientific jargon, allowed MecA to work better.\n\nHowever, the University of Sheffield researcher explains, his new discovery has turned the initial assumptions on its head and has revealed that these enhancers \u201care not related to the activity of MecA, but are part of another mechanism necessary for high-level resistance.\u201d Specifically, the authors discovered that MRSA adopts an alternative mode of cell division in the presence of antimicrobials to ensure its survival. \u201cBy using the newly discovered mechanism, bacteria divide in a different way that does not require a key activity that is normally needed for them to divide and multiply,\u201d says the researcher.\n\nThese two defense mechanisms are synergistic: \u201cBoth are necessary for high-level methicillin resistance. MecA needs to be resistant at a low level, about 10 times more than a sensitive strain, and potentiation needs to be resistant at a high level, about 1,000 times more than a sensitive strain. Potentiation alone does not make them resistant,\u201d says Foster.\n\nAccording to the authors, their discovery opens the door to finding new therapeutic strategies to fight antibiotic resistance. Foster argues that the discovery of this new division mechanism, hitherto unknown, is important on two levels: \u201cFirstly, it has been shown that these bacteria have the ability to divide in a way that was previously unknown, which sheds light on the mechanisms that sustain the life of this organism. Secondly, it shows that the development of resistance is more complex than we had previously imagined and uses the newly discovered pathway, which has important ramifications for the development of new treatments to control MRSA.\u201d The scientist assures that there are already compounds to which this resistant bacteria is vulnerable, and the activity in each of its two defense systems could be mapped to find other new treatments.\n\nA worrying pathogen\n\nBruno Gonz\u00e1lez-Zorn, director of the Antimicrobial Resistance Unit at the Complutense University of Madrid and advisor to the WHO in this field, stresses that MRSA is one of the pathogens \u201cthat causes the most mortality and the most concern at the hospital level\u201d and any advance in the knowledge of the biology of the resistance it generates, such as this research, is important: \u201cIt is an article on fundamental biology where it describes that MRSA acquires a gene that confers resistance. But one in every 10,000 of these manages to have a very high resistance and, until now, it was not known what made it highly resistant because that gene alone was insufficient. The new discovery will not have an immediate clinical implication, but it does open the door to designing molecules to inhibit that high level of resistance,\u201d reflects the microbiologist, who has not participated in this research.\n\nMar\u00eda del Mar Tom\u00e1s, a microbiologist at the A Coru\u00f1a University Hospital Complex and spokesperson for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), has a similar opinion: \u201cIt is extremely interesting. Many investigations have focused on the classic resistance mechanisms, those that act on antibiotics, but this study looks at the tolerance and stress mechanisms of the bacteria, which can also influence resistance.\u201d Tom\u00e1s points out that Foster\u2019s research, in which she did not participate, finds \u201cthe perfect link\u201d to explain the high resistance of MRSA to antibiotics: \u201cIt is a mechanism that combines the union of MecA with a mutation in enhancer genes related to cell division: the bacteria grows in a different, abnormal and disordered way, but it manages to stop the antibiotic from acting.\u201d\n\nThe research published in Science also raises new questions, Foster admits. For example, whether MRSA may have other hidden mechanisms to evade antibiotics: \u201cOur discovery of this new mechanism using an alternative division strategy demonstrates how little we know. We are currently working to elucidate the basis of the alternative division mode and how enhancers actually work to promote resistance. This allows us to discover a whole range of cellular capabilities that we can now explore. There is always more to discover and understand,\u201d the scientist says.\n\nAnother question is whether these same defense pathways are replicated in other resistant bacteria. For now, Foster says, enhancers are associated with resistance to other types of antibiotics and have been found in other bacteria. \u201cWe are working to determine whether there is a common thread between bacteria and whether this mechanism is more frequent than we had previously suggested,\u201d he says.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

Companies like HubSpot, founded in 2006, transformed the marketing landscape with its innovative inbound marketing software. Its success showcases the potential of Boston\u2019s unique ecosystem.\n\nAnother notable example is Drift, a conversational marketing platform that emerged from the city\u2019s tech scene.

Each company adds to a narrative rich with creativity and resilience while inspiring future founders to pursue their dreams amidst challenges.\n\nChallenges Faced by the Startup Community in Boston\n\nThe startup community in Boston, while thriving, faces notable challenges. One significant hurdle is the high cost of living. Founders and employees often grapple with steep housing prices, making it difficult to attract and retain talent.\n\nDiversity remains another pressing issue. The lack of inclusivity can stifle innovation and limit perspectives within startups. Many entrepreneurs feel that a richer mix of backgrounds could lead to more groundbreaking ideas.\n\nBoston also competes fiercely with Silicon Valley for resources and attention. This rivalry creates pressure on local startups to perform at an exceptionally high level just to stay relevant.\n\nNavigating these challenges requires resilience from the entrepreneurial ecosystem. As founders adapt, they may find innovative solutions that not only benefit their companies but also enhance the overall landscape of Boston\u2019s startup culture.\n\n\u2013 High Cost of Living\n\nBoston\u2019s high cost of living presents a significant hurdle for startups and their teams. Housing prices have soared, making it challenging for entrepreneurs to attract talent without offering competitive salaries.\n\nThe expense doesn\u2019t stop at rent or mortgages. Basic necessities like groceries, transportation, and utilities also come with hefty price tags. This financial strain can pressure budding companies that are still in their early stages.\n\nMany young professionals find themselves juggling multiple jobs just to make ends meet while pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams. The reality is that the vibrant startup culture can sometimes feel inaccessible due to these economic barriers.\n\nAs founders seek innovative solutions, they must navigate this landscape wisely. It\u2019s a balancing act between fostering growth and managing expenses in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Limited Diversity and Inclusivity\n\nDespite its vibrant ecosystem, Boston\u2019s startup culture faces challenges with diversity and inclusivity. The tech scene often mirrors the demographics of its surrounding areas, which can lead to a homogeneous environment.\n\nMany founders come from similar educational backgrounds and networks. This lack of varied perspectives can stifle creativity and innovation within startups.\n\nEfforts are being made to change this narrative, but progress is slow. Underrepresented groups still find it difficult to secure funding or mentorship opportunities in comparison to their counterparts.\n\nInitiatives aimed at fostering inclusivity exist, yet they need broader support from established businesses and investors. A shift towards embracing diverse talent could unlock new ideas and drive growth for all involved in the startup community.\n\n\u2013 Competition with Silicon Valley\n\nSilicon Valley often casts a long shadow over other startup ecosystems, and Boston is no exception. The tech giants of the West Coast have set high expectations for innovation and growth. This creates both inspiration and pressure for local startups.\n\nBoston\u2019s entrepreneurs frequently find themselves comparing their journeys to those in Silicon Valley. The allure of massive funding rounds and rapid scaling can be daunting. Yet, this competition drives Boston\u2019s startups to refine their ideas and focus on sustainable growth.\n\nWhile some may see it as a disadvantage, many embrace the challenge. It fosters creativity that differentiates Boston from its competitors. Startups here tend to emphasize quality over quantity, fostering deeper connections with customers.\n\nThis rivalry also encourages collaboration among local businesses looking to carve out their niche in the market. Instead of merely competing with Silicon Valley, Boston aims to complement it through unique innovations tailored for specific industries like healthcare and biotech.\n\nHow Boston\u2019s Startup Culture Impacts the City and its Economy\n\nBoston\u2019s startup culture significantly influences both the city and its economy. The influx of innovative companies fosters job creation, providing opportunities for residents across various skill levels.\n\nAs startups flourish, they attract talent from around the globe. This influx enriches the local workforce and stimulates diverse industries. A vibrant ecosystem emerges where established firms collaborate with newcomers, nurturing creativity and knowledge sharing.\n\nMoreover, successful startups often reinvest in their communities. They support local schools, nonprofits, and infrastructure projects through philanthropic efforts.\n\nThe economic ripple effect is undeniable; increased business activity enhances tax revenues that fund crucial public services and community development initiatives.\n\nThis dynamic also draws significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on Boston\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, further fueling growth in technology sectors like biotech and software development.\n\nThe Future of Boston\u2019s Startup Scene\n\nBoston\u2019s startup scene is poised for exciting growth.

Although it\u2019s not the update people have been waiting for, it\u2019s still important.\n\nAccording to SamMobile, a new software update is being rolled out for the carrier-locked versions of the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra. The firmware version for this update is S92xUSQS4AXJA, and it includes the November 2024 security patch. This update addresses multiple security vulnerabilities, but does not introduce any new features. Instead, it resolves dozens of security issues identified in the previous software version.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLast week, Samsung released the same update for the Galaxy Tab S7 FE.\n\nAlthough the new security update is important, users have been patiently waiting for the next release, One UI 7. This update, based on Android 15, will offer a refreshed design and enhanced features for Galaxy devices. It includes several redesigned icons and a new camera user interface.\n\nOne UI 7 includes modifications such as a pill for system apps on the home screen, reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island. However, unlike Apple, which places its similar feature at the top center of the screen, Samsung\u2019s Dynamic Island will be located on the left side of the notification area.\n\nOnce expected to arrive earlier this year, One UI 7 might not launch until early next year. According to reliable tipster Ice Universe, Samsung is expected to release the first One UI 7 beta to testers in the coming weeks. Although many anticipated this launch in July, it has been delayed by several months.\n\nTo check for the new security update on your Galaxy S24 series device, go to Settings and then navigate to Software Update."
