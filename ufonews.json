            "article_content": "Released on June 21st, 19-Something and Four, Bee Thousand, the seventh album by Dayton, Ohio\u2019s Guided by Voices, was ushered into the time-and-space sphere. The record may clock in at 36:35, but in reality\u2014whatever that even is\u2014Bee Thousand has proved to be a timeless piece, able to exist as an artifact of a certain musical genre known as \u201clo-fi indie rock,\u201d while also retaining its immediacy, as evidenced in the opening track, \u201cHardcore UFO\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOver a jangly, guitar-driven tune with a pulsating drum beat, Robert Pollard croons the opening lyrics from a second-person perspective. You (me) are hanging on the roof of the house, staring upwards towards infinity, hoping for a close encounter of the amplified kind. UFOs are unencumbered by that whole space-and-time thingy.\n\nMore from Spin:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final line of the first stanza is \u201cI\u2019ll be with you, without you, again.\u201d\n\nThen, a magical moment occurs, or I should say has been occurring, and will continue to occur until God knows when. At the :56 second mark of the song, just before things kick into high gear, one of the four tracks used to record the song drops out. How this happened remains a mystery. Was it due to faulty equipment? Did somebody accidentally press Record and Play at the same time? We will never know. The How is unimportant, what matters is it happened.\n\nEvery time I listen to the song, that dropout happens. Every future play, it will happen. If scholars or stoners ever want to get to the bottom of the popularity of listening to sub-par fidelity music then they should look no further than this moment. The creation and the act of creating have been synchronized. Mistake or divine intervention, those three seconds, before the second guitar reappears, proves that time is purely subjective. In that exact moment I exist on two parallel planes. 2024 and 1994, at once a middle-aged teenager.\n\nTurned 30 this year: Guided by Voices\u2019 Bee Thousand album.\n\nLet\u2019s talk to Robert.\n\nSPIN: Bee Thousand turns 30 this year. Did you have a hunch that it would be the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d album?\n\nRobert Pollard: It\u2019s actually just a collection of re-worked, old songs. This one broke through and found a lot of important ears because of its diversity and sheer volume of very good songs. There are a lot of different fields of sound, and a lot of it\u2019s actually pretty hard to listen to. That may be part of the appeal. I wanted it to sound like a collection of poorly recorded Beatles White Album demo outtakes.\n\nThe band started employing the 4-track machine on Propeller. What is it about the lo-fi aesthetic?\n\nThe lo-fi thing to me at first came out of economical necessity. But then I started really digging the immediacy and the crazy shitty overall sounds you could get. A lot of diversity within a limited space. You rely on live, in-the-room sound and moving things around. You incorporate extraneous elements like field recordings and fucked-up film extracts detuned to fit the key of song. Drop-outs, warp effects, strange percussive devices, things like that, and then you cram everything into four or five or six tracks.\n\nYou and I were once in Cincinnati, and out of the blue you started singing a song you dubbed \u201cHat Vertigo,\u201d after noticing how many dudes in that bar were wearing hats. You sang a verse and chorus and then it floated into the ether. Do you remember doing that? How many great songs are on old tapes or lyrics in notebooks?\n\nI don\u2019t remember \u201cHat Vertigo,\u201d but I like that.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo telling how many of those there are, where they are, or if recorded takes exist. Also there are a lot of aborted lyrics and ideas in notebooks, and I\u2019m constantly making up songs and singing them into people\u2019s phones when we\u2019re out drinking and being silly.\n\nHow early in life did you think, \u201cI can write a song!\u201d?\n\nI was writing hits for neighborhood buddies when I was 7 or 8 years old. All a capella but with structure and very derivative of AM radio hits of that time. 1965-66 Herman\u2019s Hermits, Beatles, Dave Clark Five, Gary Lewis and the Playboys. I had songs like \u201cWe Are From the Planet Mars,\u201d \u201cWolf Man,\u201d \u201cEggs Make Me Sick,\u201d \u201cImagination,\u201d to name a few.\n\nYou once said recording each song of Bee Thousand took roughly a half-hour. What took so long?\n\nIt took roughly a half-hour each because we had to change the setting. Rearrange the mic-ing set ups and positions. Get different effects. Whatever. Do another shot. Smoke a joint.\n\nFrom left: Mitch Mitchell, Kevin Fennell, Robert Pollard, and Tobin Sprout.\n\nYou also once said, \u201cIf you write a song and your mom likes it, shit-can it immediately.\u201d Does that ethos remain?\n\nI actually said \u201cgrandmother,\u201d but it pretty much equally applies to mother or even sister and a lot of times friends. The first person to hear a song now is my wife, Sarah. Then Travis [Harrison], then the band.\n\n\u201cGirls of Wild Strawberries\u201d I assume was at least half-concocted while watching the Bergman classic.\n\nYes, it definitely was inspired by the Bergman film, which I think is beautiful. \u201cImaginary Queen Anne\u201d was inspired by an episode of The Tudors about King Henry VIII, when she had a flashback, end of life memory of her childhood with her brother right before she was beheaded. I\u2019m sure there are a lot of other songs [influenced by movies].\n\nIf you could work with one director, who would it be?\n\nWell, I was set up to work with Steven Soderbergh on a musical adaptation of the life of Cleopatra called Cleo, but it ended up not happening. He even stayed at my house to work on altering lyrics from some of my better-known songs to match the script. Anyway, it fell through. It was a big-ass waste of my time. Now I don\u2019t want to work with any directors on a movie soundtrack. Fuck that. Just make albums. They\u2019re better than trying to force songs into a movie soundtrack anyway.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo disrespect to Steven Soderbergh. I don\u2019t think it was his fault. And that\u2019s not to say if something really alluring came up I wouldn\u2019t change my mind.\n\nDo you remember your reaction to hearing the tape cut out on \u201cHardcore UFO\u2019s\u201d?\n\nWe just thought it sounded cool and it went along with our lo-fi aesthetic. Also we justified it as being interference from hardcore UFOs.\n\nGBV began life in a proper studio, and then came the lo-fi glory years. Now y\u2019all are really letting your prog flag fly. You\u2019ve released some country ditties under the name Cash Rivers. Any other genres you feel like tackling?\n\nYou know, I thought about a crooner record, but I\u2019ve got this eternal child-like perspective when it comes to making music. I just keep writing and recording songs as if I were in high school or college, and that means rock.\n\nWhat is the recording process? How much input do the other band members supply?\n\nThe others, including Travis, have a tremendous amount of input. In fact, unlike in the past, they pretty much do everything except for writing the songs and doing the vocals, which I add to the final mixed instrumentals.\n\nDo you still record demos on your boombox?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I do!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead SPIN\u2019s original 1994 review of Guided by Voice\u2019s Bee Thousand here.\n\nTo see our running list of the top 100 greatest rock stars of all time, click here."

            "article_content": "AI systems have a range of applications in the automotive market. However, they do not come without their challenges.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) applications have become increasingly prominent within the automotive sector from in-cabin monitoring systems to lane and object detection while driving.\n\nAlthough a large number of new vehicles boast some form of impressive on-board AI technology it does not come without its challenges during production processes. Machine learning algorithms are very complex and specialised, requiring engineers to frequently overcome challenges and resolve errors.\n\nAssisting the industry on its AI journey is Voxel51, a team of machine learning and computer vision experts, helping to address the challenges and issues posed by AI projects. \u2018FiftyOne\u2019 from Voxel51 enables users to build production-ready visual AI applications easily, efficiently, and at scale.\n\nWe spoke with Brian Moore, CEO, Voxel51, and Jason Corso, Chief Science Officer, Voxel51, to learn more about the company and the benefits and challenges of automotive AI solutions.\n\nJust Auto (JA): Can you please provide some background on the company Voxel51?\n\nBrian Moore (BM): At Voxel51, we work at the cutting edge of visual AI, building technology that accelerates AI work across almost every vertical, from medical imaging to revolutionizing agriculture to self-driving cars.\n\nFor context, we spun out from research at the University of Michigan, where Jason Corso is on the faculty, and where I did my PhD work and research. Our software platform empowers visual AI builders to bring their innovations to life. Specifically, we help organisations develop sophisticated AI systems that can effectively interpret and make sense of visual data inputs such as images, videos, and other related modalities.\n\nYou can think of us as a development platform for software teams that work with visual data. One of the unique things about being from Michigan obviously is our proximity to Detroit. We have a long history of working with automakers, understanding the types of challenges, problems, and solutions that they have been building over the past decade.\n\nWhat work have you done with the automotive sector so far?\n\nBM: We work with OEMs in Detroit in the US, Germany, Japan and other locations, working closely with their machine learning, data architecture and AI teams to help power systems that they're building for exterior systems for vehicles. This includes lane keeping and adaptive cruise control just to name a couple of applications, as well as in-cabin systems.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe thing I would say about automakers in 2024 is that they're increasingly becoming software companies that have thousands of employees who are software engineers and data scientists. They are building quite sophisticated systems to develop these new technologies which they see as critical to their company strategies. We have the pleasure of supporting all these teams in building out their visual AI infrastructure, which they have brought in-house rather than outsourcing.\n\nJason Corso (JC): At the higher level, we examine the teaming between the driver and the automobile. It\u2019s important to think about what humans and AI are each good at. Humans are good at adapting to changing and new situations that require reasoning - both dynamic reasoning and also ethics. On the other hand, humans are bad at redundant, repetitive things like everyday tasks, whereas AI is really good at doing repetitive things over and over again.\n\nJason Corso\n\nWhat does that mean? For driving, AI has the potential to augment the human's ability to maintain eyes on the road, around you and in your blind spots, when you may not be able to do it because you're tired or distracted, or for some other reason. This will increase the overall safety of driving or safety of the road systems and that's in a scenario with AI and humans working in sync. I think that's going to come first before we see Level 4 or Level 5 autonomy. We are already seeing a lot of amazing enhancements in this augmentation of human driving with AI.\n\nWhich ADAS features are imminent, versus longer term projects for companies?\n\nBM: We're seeing specific technologies being rolled out that can alert drivers to identify opportune moments to change lanes or overtake other vehicles safely and in a way that doesn\u2019t distract them from the road. Lane keeping or adaptive cruise control are features that are already in the market, but which are being constantly evolved and improved, leveraging not just sensor-based systems but also other modalities and visual data to improve their power, reduce costs and make them more available on more types of vehicles.\n\nIn-cabin solutions are a key focus of the teams that we support. Think cameras that are mounted in strategic positions that can identify driver drowsiness and distraction (i.e. when the driver isn't watching the road), then issue alerts or interventions as necessary. This kind of innovation is already on the market and will continue to get more sophisticated as AI-powered systems become more capable and in-tune with driver attention and awareness.\n\nThere are also imminent features that will automate tasks that are hard for human drivers to execute, such as backing a truck into a loading dock. Another innovation is parking assistance where the car can identify if a parking spot is feasible and park in it automatically. We could also see vehicles that warn against hazards as you exit the car, such as a passing cyclist, to prevent collisions.\n\nSome other visual AI features we could see in the next few years are those that help reduce the risk of inexperienced or poor drivers which is made possible through driver recognition. Some examples that could be options for consumers to choose from:\n\nIntervening more aggressively when people with lower reaction times (e.g. someone who is older) take the wheel.\n\nPreventing teenagers from accessing sport mode or the enhanced acceleration car features or driving more than 5 mph over the speed limit. Full control of the car could also only be given after 100 hours of experience within controlled conditions.\n\nPreventing any driver other than the owner from driving the car away for the rest of the day to help prevent theft.\n\nThere are also ADAS features that adjust to real-time conditions which we would expect to be rolled out in the longer term:\n\nAutomatically increasing the distance from the car ahead depending on weather conditions such as fog, snow, and rain.\n\nAdjusting sensitivity of driving warnings or safety features like automated braking according to road conditions.\n\nProviding additional assistance within challenging lighting conditions caused by factors such as glare and low lighting conditions.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges OEMs face when developing these projects?\n\nJC: I think the ultimate challenge in many AI and visual AI projects is the long tail problem. It's pretty easy to get 80% performance on a typical problem with machine learning or AI these days, but usually decent performance is based on typical scenarios that drivers are used to. When you think about deploying AI in the real world, you can't deploy a pedestrian avoidance system that works four times out of five. That would be a problem. That's due to the visual and behavioural complexity of operating in the everyday world.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to build systems that have seen enough examples of all the variability or all the variations of situations that various autonomous systems will be expected to behave in. It is even harder to build a general intelligence capable of reasoning about these myriad situations.\n\nAlthough accidents happen, humans are rather good at applying adaptive on-the-fly responses and reflexes that tend to align with what we've experienced as best practices. While the automotive industry aims to get there, today's systems can't quite capture those capabilities. Even a student can download open-source code and use open-source data and quickly train a model that gets decent performance. But getting it to production quality that interprets the high variability that happens in the real world requires expertise, time, lots of money, lots of testing, and lots of patience.\n\nThat's ultimately the game that I think many of these companies are playing right now: trying to figure out how to cover as many of those hardest cases as possible while ensuring confidence in safety.\n\nWhat do you see the future holding for the use of AI in the automotive industry? Not just in terms of safety, but more broadly?\n\nBM: As I mentioned earlier, modern automakers are really software companies, and their value to the consumer is measured by safety and reliability. All the rest of it is really coming from the software or AI-enabled features that are now becoming possible for vehicles.\n\nI'm personally excited that safety is one of the first areas where we're seeing some real progress in terms of what these technologies can do - whether it's in-cabin awareness or keeping vehicles safe and reducing accidents. That's one of the first areas where we're seeing real returns from AI investment.\n\nAutomakers are great at thinking long term. The lifespan of a vehicle in the real world is 20 plus years and as a result, there's an extended roll out period that will happen. But these automakers are making the right investments today. It starts with gathering the right data to address some of the challenges and getting us to 99.999% reliability. That begins with being able to have very sophisticated data collection systems that can help automakers gather enough data to understand all of the different situations, edge cases, anomalies, and so forth. We're well into that journey now and it's exciting to see the automakers make that transition and be set up and positioned for success.\n\nIs there anything else that either of you want to add?\n\nBM: Although it\u2019s easy to focus on machines and algorithms taking complete control when talking about vehicles, humans play a key role in the entire lifecycle of the next generation of automotive technology. Humans play a key role in making sure that the data that is being fed into these AI systems in vehicles is accurate and free of bias. It's essential that those working on autonomous vehicles consider whether the system meaningfully increases the quality of both their product and the driver experience. It's not something that can be fully automated right away. We'll all be living with these cars in the future so it\u2019s important that the human element is a part of their development from beginning to end.\n\n\"Automotive AI: Applications that come with challenges in creation \" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Employers in this day and age are using more AI tools than ever to streamline and automate the recruitment process. This is especially the case when you look at the initial stages of screening potential candidates. These tools not only help to save time, but also improve consistency while eliminating potential bias.\n\nScreening Resumes and Applicant Tracking\n\nOne of the ways that employers are using AI tools to screen resumes is by scanning applications in bulk, which can be a game-changer for companies that are hiring on a large scale. AI is able to aid the selection process by allowing companies to filter out candidates who might not be suitable, or who do not meet the key qualifications needed for the job. Tools like this tend to include numerous features, including keyword matching. AI tools can also screen resumes for potential keywords that relate to the role. This could be a qualification, certification, or skill. Some advanced tools even have natural language processing capabilities. This helps the software to understand the context of the information that\u2019s being provided.\n\nApplication tracking systems are also being used more and more. ATS systems often come with integrated AI capabilities, which help to automate the ranking of candidates. This allows employers to prioritise the candidates that have applied for the role, and how well they fit the job offer. This can also be bundled with pre-screening questions. This allows employers to ask questions, with AI being used to assess whether the answer given fits the company's criteria. Although human input is still required when it comes to making the final decisions, resume screening can be a valuable and time-saving process for employers who need to filter through hundreds of potential applications.\n\nThe Rise of AI Chatbots\n\nAI-powered chatbots are being used more and more to engage with candidates from the second they submit their applications. Some chatbots are able to conduct preliminary interviews and they are also able to ask questions set by the recruiter. This helps the chatbot to assess the candidate\u2019s suitability for the role while ensuring that the response is scanned for keywords. Responses can then be categorised into pre-set criteria, ensuring that recruiters always have a good understanding of what they are working with. Some advanced bots are even able to assess soft skills through pre-determined interview questions. Using natural language processing, it\u2019s possible to assess tone, conversational nuances and the use of language. This can give insight into how a candidate communicates, and the language they choose to use when working with specific situations.\n\nChatbots can also help to handle FAQs, freeing up recruiters while also providing candidates with a faster and more efficient experience. For large-scale companies, having an automated way to answer commonly asked questions is a huge deal.\n\nAI and Hybrid Screening Processes\n\nAlthough AI is being used to streamline processes, sometimes, a human touch is still needed. AI can be used to assist with part of the process, such as by filtering out potential candidates and screening for skills. With that being said, humans still need to have the overall say to ensure fairness. An example of how this can be put into practice would be through blind hiring. Blind hiring is becoming more common with AI tools. Some systems are designed to make applications anonymous, by removing the address, name, photo and personal information from the application. This allows employers to focus on the facts, while ensuring that diversity and fairness remain at the forefront of the hiring process.\n\nUsing AI to screen job applications isn\u2019t just making it easier for recruiters to sift through applications. It\u2019s helping companies to adopt fairer hiring practices as well, which is a major benefit to large, corporate companies. It's also great for ensuring that more applications can be processed for a job role, which stops employers from shutting the application window early, just because they have too many resumes to sift through. This, again, opens up the potential to find new hires, who would have otherwise had their application rejected."

More info\n\nIntrepid paranormal sleuths who hunt for evidence of other worldly beings have conducted an investigation on the grounds of a former mental health facility and abandoned West Country graveyard. During various parts of the investigation it is claimed a disembodied figured told them to eat s**t while another seemed to direct them to a grave.\n\nGloucester Paranormal Investigation Services is run by lead investigators Paul Cowmeadow, 48, and Ed Francis, 51, who are both from Gloucester. They are the best of friends and share an interest in the paranormal and held their first investigation at the Rose Garden in Matson in 2018, and have continued on a quest to find conclusive proof of other worldly beings in different locations across the county.\n\nPaul and Ed had previously tried to investigate the former mental health facility and 'abandoned graveyard' in Horton Road, Gloucester, yet due to poor weather they had to abandon their plans. They have said an entity at the investigation recognised the pair from the previous stake-out, and said 'nice to see you'.\n\nThe investigation took place mid October and was recorded during a Facebook live stream and paranormal fans were able to join and watch the spooky goings on for themselves.\n\nPaul said: \"The most recent investigation we carried out took place at an abandoned graveyard on Horton Road opposite where the former Horton Road Hospital was, which was Gloucestershire\u2019s first mental asylum which was open from 1823-1988. This graveyard is said to be part of the hospital and patients from the asylum are believed to be buried there.\n\n\"We briefly tried to investigate it a few years ago but unfortunately the weather wasn\u2019t on our side and we had to leave just when we were starting to make a connection with the spirits there.\"\n\nThe pair arrived to the area around 9.30pm ready to start the live stream at 10pm. The stream drew in fans of the team to watch on as the night's events developed.\n\nStay up to date with the latest on this story and more by signing up to our daily newsletter, delivering our top stories straight to your inbox\n\nEd said: \"This investigation was a bit different from some of our previous investigations as it felt like the spirits there really wanted us to return and communicate with them which makes sense as it is an abandoned graveyard and we were probably the only visitors they had that gave them some attention.\"\n\nPaul said: \"After our first visit there back in 2021 where we had to leave because of bad weather, we felt like we had only just scratched the surface of what spirits were there and definitely felt like the spirits really wanted to communicate with us.\n\n\"This year we were again held back a bit by the weather but as soon as a clear evening was forecast, we seized the opportunity and went back to Horton Road Graveyard to see if we could pick up from where we left off last time.\"\n\nPaul and Ed felt they were going to get responses from other worldly beings from the off. They have documented the highlights of the live video and feel responses they had many intelligent responses from paranormal entities\n\nFor example, Paul takes a small box out from his bag and the spirits produced the words 'what's that box'. Then Ed explains to the spirits what to do with his digital recorder during a burst EVP session and the spirits produced the words \u201cexplain that device\u201d.\n\nPaul said: \"We use a ball which is a cat toy that lights up when it moves, and while we were talking away the name Thomas comes through on the Alice box, which is a voice generated word device, and the spirits pick and choose what they would like to say. When the name Thomas came through and a cat-eye ball went off, the cat ball actually moved onto a grave with the name Thomas on it which was amazing.\"\n\nEd said: \"This ones quite funny. While moving around the graveyard a spirit asked a question through the Spirit Talker app asking \u201cAm I dead?\u201d We responded by telling them 'yes, you are, sorry' and then the spirit generated two more words for us, 'eat s**t'. We came to the conclusion that it must be a spirit in denial, doesn\u2019t want to believe they are actually dead.\"\n\nThe engagement rom the entities did not stop there. The word 'abandoned came through on the word box and the pair believe this was in reference to the abandoned graveyard where they were investigating.\n\n(Image: Gloucester Paranormal Investigation Services)\n\nPaul said: \"The spirits produced the word 'abandoned' which made us think about how the graveyard is abandoned and nobody takes care of the graves any more causing them to become overgrown and almost invisible in places. Ed started removing some of the ivy and leaves away from a nearby grave making it more visible and the spirits produced the words 'thank you so much' and also said that it was 'nice to see us again'.\"\n\nPaul and Ed have been busy in the paranormal investigation work in recent months and it has taken them into a new realm of television.\n\nEd said: \"It\u2019s been a busy couple of years for us. Last year we were in the Forest of Dean at Littledean Jail filming for a new series called Weird Britain which was featured on Blaze earlier this year and is now being shown on Sky History.\n\n\"We are also involved with three film festivals. The Fortean Film Festival, the Magaflix Movie Awards and the International Celebration of Cinema that are run throughout the year. We\u2019ve appeared as extras in a horror movie and are involved in filming for other documentaries which we cant say too much about at the moment which is always an adventure and a lot of fun.\"\n\nPaul aid: \"Our hopes for the future are to continue on our paranormal journey with the spirits and travel further afield to continue to take their stories to a wider audience through documentaries and media.\""

This compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, has potential pharmacological applications, boosting makhana's value beyond a snack. This discovery could revolutionize the makhana industry, benefiting farmers and potentially impacting global snacking habits.\n\nFunds pending for restoration of school compound walls\n\nMonsoon rains wreaked havoc on 297 government schools in Mangaluru, damaging buildings and boundary walls. While the district administration disbursed Rs 4.6 crore to 244 schools for critical repairs, 53 schools with damaged walls were left without funding. These schools are now tasked with finding alternative resources like MGNREGA to address the remaining repairs, estimated to cost significantly more.\n\nGSFC Universitys lab gets NABL accreditation\n\nGSFC University's chemical instrumentation laboratory in Vadodara has received accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for drinking water quality testing. This prestigious recognition, based on ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standards, covers 19 parameters. The lab's accreditation will significantly boost student learning, research, and the university's mission to produce highly skilled graduates.\n\nBhagalpur: As makhana (fox nut) gains popularity as a healthy snack, scientists at Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, have achieved a major breakthrough. They have identified a unique compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, in makhana, which has vital medicinal property.\u201cThis is the first time the bioactive compound has been identified as a naturally occurring component in makhana,\u201d said vice-chancellor (VC) D R Singh. He added that the compound, a sulfonamide derivative of iodobenzene, is known for its pharmacological potential. \u201cThis finding proves the therapeutic potential of makhana and promises to boost its global recognition and market value. It could revolutionise both the makhana industry and global snacking habits,\u201d he said.Singh added the research reflects BAU\u2019s commitment to innovation, uplifting farmers\u2019 economic conditions and positioning Bihar as a hub for cutting-edge agricultural advancements. \u201cThis finding will inspire farmers to combine traditional farming with modern science.\u201dDr Anil Kumar Singh, director of research at BAU, filed a patent for the discovery. He said makhana, traditionally valued as a nutritious food, is now recognised as a bioactive resource with medicinal value. \u201cThis positions makhana as more than just a snack \u2014 it becomes a key player in the nutraceutical industry, attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and boosting its economic potential,\u201d he said.The research team revealed that makhana is not only rich in nutrients but also has antioxidant and therapeutic properties.Conducted in the university\u2019s NABL-accredited laboratory, the study was led by a team of scientists and faculty members, including V Shajeeda Banu (plant biotechnology), Pritam Ganguly (soil science and agricultural chemistry), Anil Kumar (horticulture) and Dr Anil Kumar Singh (director of research)."

Almost all ALS cases have cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates, and TDP-43 mutations cause this devastating neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe rNLS8 model is a twofold transgenic model in which human TDP-43 expression is suppressed by doxycycline (Dox) and has a faulty nuclear localization signal. The study aimed to compare the disease phenotype to the model's previously reported characterization (Walker et al., Acta Neuropathol 130, 2015).\n\nMethods\n\nAnimals:\n\nAll animal work followed the European Union Directive 2010/63 and was approved by the national Project Authorization Board. Mice lacking the tetO-hTDP-43-\u0394NLS transgene (tTA, 6F+6M) were compared to hemizygous rNLS8 double transgenic mice (rNLS8, 6F+10M; JAX ID: 028412).\n\nThe IHC analysis was performed on a separate cohort of rNLS8 (6F+5M) and tTA (4F+3M). From birth until disease induction, animals were fed ad libitum Dox-supplemented food (200 mg/kg Envigo).\n\nReadouts:\n\nClinical scores and body weights were measured thrice weekly (Figure 1).\n\nTo test wire hang, invert the top mesh of a wire cage and measure the time it takes to drop (maximum 180 seconds). If the 180-second mark was not met, up to three trials were allowed. The best attempt was chosen for analysis.\n\nAnimals were trained for five minutes at 4 RPM. One hour later, animals were subjected to three consecutive accelerating trials (0 to 40 RPM over 360 s; inter-trial interval 30 minutes).\n\nCSF was analyzed for NfL using the Quanterix SimoaTM NF-Light V2 Advantage test kit (#104073) in single determinations.\n\nTo analyze the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), gastrocnemius muscle cryosections were stained with anti-VAChT and anti-Syp antibodies and AF594-labeled \u03b1-bungarotoxin. The number of non-overlapping and overlapping pre- and post-synaptic components was investigated.\n\nFFPE slices from the lumbar spinal cord were stained with antibodies to identify total TDP-43 (human and mouse) and phosphorylated TDP-43 (Ser409/410). The Visiopharm\u00ae system was used for image analysis.\n\nFigure 1. Study design and clinical scoring criteria used in the study. For clinical scoring, animals were lifted by the tail to monitor hind limb clasping and subsequently immobilized to monitor the presence of tremor. Image Credit: Charles River Laboratories.\n\nResults\n\nClinical scores and body weights: In rNLS8 mice, hind leg weakness began seven days after discontinuing dox (Figure 2A). On day 22, all rNLS8 mice demonstrated complete hind limb clasping (score = 2). After two weeks off dox, rNLS8 mice began to lose weight (Figure 2B). Five of the 10 rNLS8 males reached the study\u2019s endpoints earlier because they lost more than 25 % of their weight. Only one female mouse and no tTA controls met HEP criteria during the study\u2019s follow-up period.\n\nFigure 2. Weakness symptoms and body weight over time.

Image Credit: Charles River Laboratories.\n\nNMJ analysis: There was considerable NMJ disintegration in rNLS8 mice, as the fraction of entire NMJs, i.e., with totally or partially overlapping pre- and post-synaptic components, was dramatically reduced when compared to fully intact NMJs in tTA control mice (Figure 5). The percentage of non-overlapping presynaptic and postsynaptic staining was 3.0% in tTA controls and 40.7 % in rNLS8 animals.\n\nFigure 5.

All visible NMJs in the tTA example have completely overlapping pre- and postsynaptic components, whereas completely (c), partially (p), and non-overlapping/denervated (n) NMJs are visible in the rNLS8 example. Image Credit: Charles River Laboratories.\n\nTPD-43 pathology: In the spinal cords of rNLS8 animals, the total intensity of TPD-43 staining rose significantly. TDP-43 levels were also much lower in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (Figures 6A and 6B) showing mislocalisation of this protein. Enhanced phosphorylation of the protein was observed (Figures 6C and 6D).\n\nFigure 6. A) Total TDP-43 IHC staining in the lumbar spinal cord as a ratio of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic intensity.

Neuromuscular endplate denervation was found in the gastrocnemius muscle. TDP-43 pathology was seen in the cytosolic buildup of TDP-43 and enhanced phosphorylation. All symptoms and pathologies investigated in this mouse model are also found in ALS patients, demonstrating the utility of this model for ALS drug discovery.\n\nAbout Charles River Laboratories\n\nAt Charles River, we are passionate about our role in improving the quality of people\u2019s lives.

            "article_content": "A recent statement from a member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team has sparked renewed debate over whether Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been achieved. This claim, while controversial, underscores the rapid pace of advancements in artificial intelligence and the increasing capabilities of modern AI systems. OpenAI\u2019s latest model, referred to as \u201co1,\u201d has demonstrated exceptional performance in various complex tasks, prompting critical discussions about the current state of AGI and its potential implications for society. Whether you\u2019re excited, skeptical, or downright uneasy about this possibility, it\u2019s hard to ignore the ripple effects this claim has sent through the tech world and beyond.\n\nBut what does \u201cachieving AGI\u201d really mean, and how does it affect the rest of us? For many, AGI feels like an abstract concept, something that belongs in the labs of researchers or the pages of futuristic novels. Yet, its implications could touch every corner of our lives, from how we work to how we solve humanity\u2019s most complex problems. In this guide by the AI GRID, learn more about OpenAI\u2019s claim, explore the advancements driving this conversation, and take a closer look at what AGI could mean for society.\n\nWhat Is AGI and Why Is It Important?\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : OpenAI claims to have achieved AGI with its latest model, \u201c01,\u201d sparking debate over the definition and realization of AGI.\n\nAGI is defined as AI surpassing human performance in most economically valuable tasks, but experts remain divided on whether current advancements meet this standard.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s \u201c01\u201d model demonstrates exceptional capabilities in advanced mathematics, programming, and reasoning but still faces limitations like lack of real-time learning and human-like contextual understanding.\n\nThe economic and technological implications of AGI include accelerating innovation, reducing costs, and driving productivity, though widespread adoption may take years.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft has been crucial for AGI research, with ongoing renegotiations highlighting the high stakes and need for sustained investment in this field.\n\nArtificial General Intelligence, or AGI, refers to an AI system capable of performing a wide range of economically valuable tasks at a level that surpasses human ability. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed to excel in specific, predefined tasks, AGI is envisioned as a versatile and adaptive intelligence capable of generalizing knowledge across multiple domains. OpenAI defines AGI as surpassing human performance in most areas of work, but this definition remains fluid and subject to interpretation.\n\nThe importance of AGI lies in its fantastic potential. If achieved, AGI could transform industries, reshape economies, and redefine the relationship between humans and technology.

Enhancing productivity in areas like software development, data analysis, and creative industries.\n\nHowever, the immediate relevance of AGI to the average person remains limited. Current AI applications are often confined to specialized domains, and the widespread adoption of AGI technologies may take years or even decades. Additionally, the economic benefits of AGI must be weighed against potential risks, such as job displacement and ethical concerns surrounding its deployment.\n\nThe Role of Microsoft in OpenAI\u2019s AGI Efforts\n\nOpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft has been a cornerstone of its efforts to advance AGI research. Microsoft has provided substantial resources, including funding and access to innovative computing infrastructure, allowing OpenAI to develop sophisticated models like \u201c01.\u201d Reports indicate that OpenAI is currently renegotiating its contract with Microsoft to address AGI-specific clauses and secure additional support for its ambitious goals.\n\nThis collaboration highlights the high stakes involved in AGI development. Sustained investment and strategic partnerships will likely be essential for overcoming the technical and ethical challenges associated with AGI. As OpenAI continues to push the boundaries of AI capabilities, its relationship with Microsoft serves as a model for how public-private partnerships can drive innovation in emerging technologies.\n\nFuture Prospects and Ongoing Debate\n\nLooking ahead, OpenAI remains optimistic about its progress toward AGI. CEO Sam Altman has hinted at the potential of future models, such as \u201c02\u201d or \u201c03,\u201d to further expand the capabilities of AI systems. These developments could bring researchers closer to realizing the vision of AGI, but the journey is far from over.\n\nExperts remain divided on the status of AGI:\n\nSome believe that current advancements represent a significant step toward achieving AGI.\n\nOthers argue that true AGI requires breakthroughs in areas such as dynamic learning, contextual reasoning, and ethical alignment.\n\nThis ongoing debate reflects the complexity of defining and achieving AGI. It also underscores the broader societal implications of AGI, from its potential to transform industries to the ethical and regulatory challenges it poses.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nOpenAI\u2019s claim of achieving AGI marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence. While the statement has sparked intense debate, it also highlights the remarkable progress made in AI research. As organizations like OpenAI continue to refine their models and address existing limitations, the question of AGI\u2019s realization will remain central to technological discussions.\n\nWhether or not AGI has been achieved, its potential to reshape industries, economies, and societies is undeniable. The journey toward AGI is as much about overcoming its challenges as it is about unlocking its possibilities, making it a topic of critical importance for the future of technology and humanity.\n\nMedia Credit: TheAIGRID\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "This article contains predictions for an old game!\n\nPhoto By - Imagn Images. Pictured: Josh Allen looks to throw the football.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills ride a seven-game winning streak into SoFi Stadium to face the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, December 8 at 4:25 p.m. ET on FOX.\n\nMy Bills vs. Rams predictions and NFL picks are bullish on Buffalo continuing its quest for the No. 1 seed in the AFC and handing Los Angeles a third straight loss.\n\nBills vs Rams predictions\n\nBills vs Rams spread prediction\n\nWhile Buffalo is ripe for a letdown showing and traveling west to SoFi Stadium following consecutive statement home wins over last year\u2019s two Super Bowl finalists, I expect the Bills to continue building momentum and taking down the Rams to push closer toward the No. 1 seed in the AFC on Sunday. Simply put, this will be too much of an uptick in class for a middling Los Angeles roster and quarterback Matthew Stafford.\n\nBills vs Rams moneyline prediction\n\nOne of the biggest reasons the Bills will cover the number is because the Rams lack a legitimate home-field advantage at SoFi Stadium. Expect Buffalo moneylines to be one of the most popular bets and parlay legs of Week 14.\n\nBills vs Rams Over/Under prediction\n\nThis is tied for the highest total of the season for the Bills, and they went Under 49.5 in Week 2. So, even with the Bills sporting an active 5-1-1 run to the Over, I still like the Under on Sunday. After all, Los Angeles failed to go Over the number in all four games with a total of 49 or higher, and Buffalo is in the noted letdown spot.\n\nBills vs Rams best bet\n\nBills -3.5 (-115 at BetMGM)\n\nThe 6-6 Los Angeles Rams are exactly who their record says they are. A middling club on both sides of the ball that\u2019s bouncing on the playoff bubble, and the Rams are receiving too much credit for recent road wins over the New England Patriots and New Orleans Saints.\n\nLos Angeles lacks a real home-field advantage at SoFi Stadium, and the travel shouldn\u2019t have a huge impact on the Buffalo Bills with just a single game since their Week 12 bye.\n\nThe Bills are better on both sides of the ball, and in particular, I value Buffalo scoring on 49.2% (second) of drives and turning 66.7% (fourth) of red-zone trips into touchdowns. Los Angeles respective sports a 20th-ranked 35.5% and 53.5% marks.\n\nOn the flip side, the Rams allow 45.5% (fifth-highest) of drives to result in points, while the Bills allow the eighth-fewest (33.1%).\n\nThe gap in quarterback play is also significant, with Bills quarterback Josh Allen throwing for higher yards per attempt and adjusted completion percentage than Rams QB Matthew Stafford. Of course, Allen also paces the NFL in adjusted EPA per play, while Stafford ranks a middling 19th.\n\nAgain, Buffalo is just too large a step up in class for Los Angeles, and the Bills have covered the number in 14 of their past 22 games.\n\nBills vs Rams same-game parlay\n\nBills -4.5\n\n\n\nUnder 49.5\n\n\n\nTyler Bass Over 1.5 made field goals +400 at BetMGM\n\nAs noted, this is tied for the highest total of the season for the Bills, and they went Under that 49.5 number in Week 2. Additionally, the Rams haven\u2019t gone Over a total of 49 or higher all season.\n\nThis checks out as a traditional tough schedule spot for Buffalo, too. The Bills played the Sunday Night Football game in Week 13, and they\u2019re now hitting the highway to play a game on the West Coast on Sunday.\n\nSo, even with Buffalo cruising along a 5-1-1 run to the Over, I\u2019m anticipating this number proving to be too high.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nNew Users\n\nUp to $1,500 in bonus bet insurance at BetMGM Make your football plays at BetMGM, which is offering new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets (if your first bet doesn't win)!

            "article_content": "The latest Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics just dropped, and it is filled with goodies ranging from new missions to plans for space weather.\n\nThe report comes from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and it outlines top priorities for space agencies and affiliated institutions in better understanding the solar system in the next decade. The report draws on 450 papers from the science community as well as other events including presentations and town halls.\n\nDecadal surveys are important; they outline science objectives for a wide array of scientists. In 2021, the academies outlined finding Earth-like exoplanets, understanding the universe\u2019s densest objects, and improving understanding of the birth and growth of galaxies as top astronomical priorities.\n\nThe following year, the report dedicated to planetary science and astrobiology concluded that a Uranus probe should be the highest priority mission. Last year, a report from the academies put a sustained human presence off-Earth on the docket.\n\nThis year\u2019s report covered the gamut of solar and space physics, including how to better track the dynamic environment of our solar system and better understand the star at its heart.\n\nThe report called for NASA to pursue a mission that would launch a constellation of satellites that would observe the space environment near Earth and a spacecraft that would image the Sun at its poles. The report identified the National Science Foundation\u2019s Next Generation Global Oscillations Network, a solar observatory network, as the highest-priority large construction project.\n\nFuture modeling of space weather systems should also make use of artificial intelligence, according to the report. Specifically, machine learning-driven models of the surface of the Sun could better anticipate eruptions from the surface of the star, and data assimilation could be done swiftly by AI programs, hastening the pace of discovery. The report also recommended that the NSF develop a strategic plan for space weather , that NOAA establish a program for it, and partner with the Department of Defense to develop predictive space weather models. The report also called for NASA to grow the spaceflight element of its Heliophysics Space Weather program; the Parker Solar Probe\u2019s dive into the Sun comes to mind, as an ambitious endeavor that yielded new insights into space weather.\n\n\u201cLack of progress in solar and space physics over the next decade could have devastating consequences to society, in part because it would inhibit our ability to predict and mitigate against potentially harmful space weather impacts,\u201d said committee co-chair Stephen Fuselier, acting vice president of the Southwest Research Institute\u2019s space science division, in an academies release.\n\n\u201cWhile making substantive progress will require modest additional investments from the government, research into these areas is of paramount importance,\u201d Fuselier added. \u201cThis report helps provide a window into the future of the field and safeguard a growing range of industries here on Earth, and enables humanity to become a true space-faring civilization.\u201d\n\nSpace weather is a dynamic phenomenon that even affects those of us on Earth; our planet was hit by several intense geomagnetic storms this year, causing auroras around the world and some electronic disruptions. But in space, such weather events can be severe for equipment that, albeit shielded, is not within the relatively safe cocoon of our planet\u2019s magnetosphere.\n\n\u201cThe solar and space physics field is at a pivotal point right now, and we have the opportunity in the coming years to pursue some really exciting science\u2014both for science\u2019s sake and to achieve major improvements to our understanding of things like space weather,\u201d said Robyn Millan, an astronomer at Dartmouth College and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report, in an academies release.\n\nAs we Earthlings ramp up exploration of our solar system (and, dare I say, beyond?), it\u2019s crucial for governing bodies to outline the types of missions and the funding required to take those ambitious next steps sooner rather than later. The report provides a north star for those goals, and gives the public something to get excited about."

He added that the compound, a sulfonamide derivative of iodobenzene, is known for its pharmacological potential. \u201cThis finding proves the therapeutic potential of makhana and promises to boost its global recognition and market value. It could revolutionise both the makhana industry and global snacking habits,\u201d he said.Singh added the research reflects BAU\u2019s commitment to innovation, uplifting farmers\u2019 economic conditions and positioning Bihar as a hub for cutting-edge agricultural advancements. \u201cThis finding will inspire farmers to combine traditional farming with modern science.\u201dDr Anil Kumar Singh, director of research at BAU, filed a patent for the discovery. He said makhana, traditionally valued as a nutritious food, is now recognised as a bioactive resource with medicinal value. \u201cThis positions makhana as more than just a snack \u2014 it becomes a key player in the nutraceutical industry, attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and boosting its economic potential,\u201d he said.The research team revealed that makhana is not only rich in nutrients but also has antioxidant and therapeutic properties.Conducted in the university\u2019s NABL-accredited laboratory, the study was led by a team of scientists and faculty members, including V Shajeeda Banu (plant biotechnology), Pritam Ganguly (soil science and agricultural chemistry), Anil Kumar (horticulture) and Dr Anil Kumar Singh (director of research)."

            "article_content": "After winning the 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump quickly empowered Musk, his most important benefactor, to undertake a project to massively slash the size and scope of the federal government.\n\nBut in launching a so-called \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d Elon Musk is not so much breaking new ground as he is dusting off a long-time, occasionally executed, ritual of Washington governance.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It has all the hallmarks of a buzzy initiative from the world\u2019s richest man: sky-high goals, an almost impossibly ambitious timeline, intense media interest, and liberal use of internet memes.\n\nAny enterprise headed by the Tesla and SpaceX multibillionaire \u2014 who also happens to be a right-wing influencer and media magnate \u2014 was bound to attract intense enthusiasm from admiring lawmakers and interest from the public.\n\nMusk\u2019s visit Thursday to Capitol Hill, along with his cochair, former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, was no exception. As Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, an original debt hawk hero of the Tea Party movement, walked into a forum on Capitol Hill featuring Musk, he agreed that a congressional summit to discuss debt reduction had perhaps never attracted so much hype.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\n\u201cThe American people spoke loudly, clearly. They understand that the government is a mess, and they want real change,\u201d Jordan told the Globe, as he weaved through a crowd of GOP luminaries, security personnel, and TV cameras.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince those two high-profile individuals, both successful entrepreneurs, are coming here to talk about it, there\u2019s not been anything like that in my observation over the last six years,\u201d said Senator Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican and one of his party\u2019s most vocal deficit hawks.\n\nBut peel back the master-of-the-universe shine and Musk\u2019s initiative \u2014 \u201cDOGE,\u201d in shorthand \u2014 increasingly looks like a most familiar Beltway creature. For decades, conservatives have pushed to cut federal spending \u2014 often by highlighting seemingly ridiculous budget line items, just as Musk and his allies have been doing in recent weeks.\n\nDOGE\u2019s exact structure is unclear, but it is not an official government department. Instead, it appears to be shaping up as a commission with no inherent authority \u2014 an oft-deployed Washington construct that has historically proven ineffective at restoring fiscal health to the government. Presidents Obama and Reagan both launched high-profile commissions to tackle the problem, each of which failed to meaningfully alter Washington\u2019s spending patterns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, told the Globe that DOGE is \u201csort of an amped up version\u201d of what David Stockman, Reagan\u2019s budget director, attempted to do in the early 1980s by pushing for deep spending cuts to federal entitlement programs.\n\n\u201cAnd you remember how that ended up,\u201d Whitehouse said, \u201cwith him being \u2018taken to the woodshed?\u2019\u201d (Stockman said he was castigated by Reagan for being too candid with the press about the real aims of \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics.)\n\nAs Trump prepares to make good on the sweeping promises of his campaign, the DOGE project illustrates the deep tensions between political ambition and structural reality embedded at the heart of his second-term agenda.\n\nThe president-elect elevated Musk to take a cleaver, not a scalpel, to the federal budget, and Musk has identified $2 trillion in cuts as a starting point. Given DOGE\u2019s inability to enforce cuts unilaterally, it would likely make recommendations that would require widespread approval from Congress or, failing that, a power grab from the executive branch.\n\nMusk and Ramaswamy have floated an agenda to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for programs with expired authorization from Congress \u2014 the largest being a $120 billion program for veterans\u2019 medical care.\n\nThey have also publicly entertained proposals like abolishing the Department of Education, a common right-wing target, as well as broader \u201cefficiency\u201d ideas, such as requiring all federal employees to work in person.\n\nDemocrats are grappling with how seriously to take an effort that is named in honor of an internet meme of a shiba inu dog that Musk finds funny and has made into a cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few Democrats have expressed support for the project, even though it\u2019s unclear how extensively they will be involved. But most might agree with Senator Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, who told the Globe that DOGE is \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cvintage Trump\u201d in that he is launching a high-profile effort that will supposedly fix a massive problem in short order.\n\nOn the other hand, Welch said, \u201cI take it very seriously. It\u2019s got the blessing of the president, and it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Democrats who could provide pushback: there are plenty of Republicans who might be skeptical, particularly boosters of the defense industry and members of the appropriations panels, which write annual federal spending bills and closely guard their influence over Congress\u2019s sacrosanct power of the purse.\n\nRepublicans, whose primary concern is the federal budget deficit, were grateful that Musk and Ramaswamy have, for now, injected some energy into their cause, which often gets abandoned when Republicans are in power. Even those skeptical of Trump\u2019s chronic overpromising see value in the DOGE project, even if it doesn\u2019t transform the government by July 4, 2026, Trump\u2019s stated end date for the project.\n\n\u201cSome of these blue-ribbon commissions actually do produce results,\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, the Utah Republican, told the Globe. \u201cMay take a while for them to get implemented or to be adopted, but generally, they\u2019re able to move the ball forward. So the more of them, the merrier, and you know, when you have Elon Musk, I think he\u2019s proven that he can deliver something when the world thinks it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans were also eager to point out differences between DOGE and efforts like the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, launched by Obama in 2010. That panel \u2014 known by its shorthand of Simpson-Bowles, after its cochairs \u2014 featured 18 members from around the political spectrum, who worked for months to devise deficit-reduction measures like spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nJust over half of the commission\u2019s members ultimately were able to endorse their final, comprehensive report, though some aspects of the plan were incorporated into future legislation.\n\nWhat will make DOGE successful, argued Senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, is that Trump is more aligned with the mission than Obama was with Simpson-Bowles.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s different about it, in my view, is it has such strong support from the President,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big difference. Go back to Simpson Bowles \u2014 of course, the president was supportive until they were done with it.\u201d\n\nThe mercurial Trump could easily wind up in a similar place: During his first term, he ran massive deficits and alienated many spending hawks. Still, Cramer said, \u201cI think this is more a part of who he is, the urgency of his one term. I just think it\u2019s more reflective of a new day.\u201d\n\nOne of the two remaining incumbent lawmakers who served on Simpson-Bowles, Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, called DOGE \u201ca ridiculous exercise\u201d on a number of levels.\n\nFor one, she said, DOGE is unlikely to have the balanced structure of Simpson-Bowles, where Democrats, Republicans, and independents had comparable power. Ultimately, Schakowsky conveyed that such commissions are limited to the extent that Congress embraces their ideas \u2014 in 2010, lawmakers roundly rejected legislation that was based on her panel\u2019s final report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time, there\u2019s skepticism about DOGE from lawmakers in both parties.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s relevant is that, after all was said and done,\u201d Schakowsky said of Simpson-Bowles, \u201cenough people did not vote to go ahead and do it, realizing that recommendation, that\u2019s all it was.\u201d\n\nSam Brodey can be reached at sam.brodey@globe.com.

(Image credit: Journal of Commerce)\n\nRishi Parti, the founder of Gurgaon-based Info-X Software Technology PVT LTD, has shot to limelight after his recent purchase--a Rs 190 crore penthouse in DLF's The Camellias--made headlines recently. The 16,290 square feet flat was bought at the rate of Rs 1.8 lakh per square foot, the Times of India reported, making it possibly the most expensive high-rise condominium apartment deal in NCR. The tech company paid Rs 13 crore in stamp duty and according to real estate experts, this deal could be the highest recorded per square feet for a high-rise apartment in India.\n\nAlthough neither of the companies has commented on the development, here are a few pointers on the director and founder of Info-X Software Technology.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n1.) Rishi Parti launched Info-X in 2001 when he was 24. The founding team had only three members. Now, the company has a team of 150 industry professionals and provides services across 15 countries.\n\n2.) Info-X has a 20,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility, headquartered in Gurgaon. The company provides transportation solutions, develops customisable software programs, and offers back-office documentation support to the transportation industry.\n\n3.) Parti, 47, is an angel investor. He is also a director in three companies, including Find My Stay Pvt Ltd and Integrator Ventures Pvt Ltd.\n\nCommenting on Parti's recent purchase, Samir Jasuja, the founder-CEO of real estate data analytics firm Propequity, said that this deal beat even Mumbai's sky-rocketing real estate prices. \"This translates to a price of Rs 1.18 lakh per square foot super area and Rs 1.82 lakh per square foot carpet area. While in Delhi NCR property prices are on super area basis, in Mumbai, the same is on the carpet area. So this Gurgaon deal is miles ahead of Mumbai pricing in terms of carpet area,\" he said, adding that the carpet area prices in Mumbai's most expensive areas go up to Rs 1.6 lakh per square foot.\n\nThe maximum city also saw one of its most expensive high-rise apartment deal last year when a company bought three apartments in Lodha Malabar for Rs 263 crore, at the rate of Rs 1.36 lakh per square foot of carpet area."

            "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm.\n\nIt seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military.\n\nREAD NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss.\n\nThe companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States' counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne.\n\nAccording to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI\u2019s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to \u201cassess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm\u2019s way\u201d, revealed a former OpenAI employee.\n\n\u201cOpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values\u2026 Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.\u201d\n\nLast month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide \u201cUS intelligence and defense agencies\u201d access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times\u2019 Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th.

            "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm.\n\nIt seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military.\n\nREAD NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss.\n\nThe companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States' counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne.\n\nAccording to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI\u2019s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to \u201cassess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm\u2019s way\u201d, revealed a former OpenAI employee.\n\n\u201cOpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values\u2026 Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.\u201d\n\nLast month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide \u201cUS intelligence and defense agencies\u201d access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times\u2019 Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year.\n\nThese strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI's position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a \u201cfierce competitor\u201d.

            "article_content": "Organisations are increasingly deploying artificial intelligence in finance operations, realising return on investments and benefits like better data and decisions, faster insights and reporting, lower costs and operational effectiveness, a KPMG report shows.\n\nAccording to the report, although investments are being made across a range of AI technologies, organisations are extracting the most value from machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. The RoI from these technologies is either meeting or exceeding expectations.\n\nThe research covered 2,900 organisations across 23 countries. KPMG identified a cohort of leaders who were more advanced and mature in AI deployment. Around 24% of organisations were Leaders, while 58% were middle ground Implementers, and 18% beginners.\n\nOver seven in 10 (71%) organisations are using AI to some degree in their financial operations. Currently, 41% are using AI to a moderate or large degree, and this is predicted to rise to 83% over the next three years.\n\nThe use of gen AI has also grown. The percentage of companies with no intention to use gen AI has fallen from 6% to 1% now. Gen AI has become a key focus and a top priority for the future, with 95% of Leaders and 39% of others expecting to adopt it within financial reporting in the next three years.\n\nAmong emerging markets, India and China are ahead in AI usage. Most sectors have a similar percentage of leaders, although financial services leads (29%), while healthcare lags behind (16%). Additionally, companies with larger revenue sizes are more AI-advanced.\n\nUnder corporate finance, AI is being deployed most in financial reporting, with nearly two-thirds of companies piloting or using AI for reporting, accounting and financial planning. Nearly half of companies are also piloting or using AI for treasury and risk management. This has the potential to generate better debt management, cash-flow forecasting, fraud detection, credit risk assessment, and scenario analysis in the treasury and risk management functions."

            "article_content": "By Nic Maclellan\n\nA no-confidence motion in the French National Assembly has ousted the government led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier. But for New Caledonians, still reeling from the economic, cultural and social impacts of six months of conflict this year, the collapse of the Barnier government raises concern about future support from Paris.\n\nA long-serving conservative politician and former diplomat, Barnier was appointed as a Prime Minister in September by French President Emmanuel Macron, following the defeat of the presidential majority in July\u2019s snap elections for the National Assembly. From months, Macron had delayed appointing a prime minister, given his Ensemble alliance lacked the numbers to maintain a governing majority in the French legislature.\n\nRefusing to appoint a candidate from the Left-wing political alliance Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) \u2013 even though it was the largest parliamentary group \u2013 Macron finally chose Barnier to lead the government, even though he was a member of the conservative Rassemblement party, which came fourth in the elections!\n\nAt the time, Barnier\u2019s appointment was welcomed by New Caledonian anti-independence parties, given his past support for the Pacific dependency to remain within the French Republic. Over the last few months, however, business leaders and politicians across the political spectrum in Noumea have been increasingly worried by the drift in French leadership.\n\nSince July, political and community leaders in Noumea have sought support from Paris for post-conflict reconstruction, after riots erupted on 13 May, followed by five months of clashes between Kanak activists\n\nand more than 6,000 French gendarmes, riot squads and anti-terrorist police, backed by armoured cars and military assistance.\n\nInitially, responding to the crisis was high on the Barnier government\u2019s agenda. It formally abandoned Macron\u2019s failed policy on electoral reform for New Caledonia\u2019s local legislature (a constitutional amendment that triggered the riots in mid-May). Barnier deployed a series of diplomatic missions to Noumea, including Overseas Minister Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Buffet, the president of the National Assembly Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet and Senate president G\u00e9rard Larcher. His government adopted a more conciliatory tone towards the independence movement, seeking to re-start stalled negotiations on New Caledonia\u2019s future political status.\n\nFor the Government of New Caledonia, however, a central priority was to negotiate new funding in the French government\u2019s 2025 budget to support economic reconstruction. The months of conflict had damaged local businesses, the tourism sector and the crucial nickel industry, one in six workers in the private sector have lost their jobs and many others survive on reduced hours. Under President Louis Mapou, New Caledonia\u2019s government adopted a plan to stabilise the economy, transform the tax base, and support workers and employers battered by months of shutdown and conflict \u2013 but needed support from Paris to finance the transition over the next three years.\n\nSince Barnier took office, New Caledonian business and political leaders have travelled to Paris to lobby French politicians for extra funding in the 2025 national budget. President Mapou also flew to Paris in November, meeting with President Macron at the Elysee Palace to call for urgent action.\n\nHowever, after weeks of negotiations, Barnier couldn\u2019t finalise a national budget for 2025. In office for only three months, Barnier\u2019s government lacked the numbers to easily pass legislation. Trapped between the largest bloc in the National Assembly, the Left-wing Nouveau Front Populaire and the extreme right Rassemblement national, Barnier lacked the political authority to bang heads together.\n\nHis decision to ram through changes to Social Security funding without a vote in the National Assembly was the final straw. On 4 December, a no confidence motion proposed by the NFP was backed by Rassemblement national, and 331 of 577 deputies in the National Assembly voted to bring down the government.\n\nUnlike most parliamentarians from France\u2019s overseas colonies in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean, New Caledonia\u2019s two deputies in the National Assembly did not vote in favour of the no-confidence motion.\n\nLoyalist politician Nicolas Metzdorf is a member of Macron\u2019s presidential bloc and voted against the resolution. Speaking in Paris after the vote, Metzdorf said \u201cwe need to have a functioning government to discuss the future of New Caledonia, and we need to have economic and financial stability and support from the French State.\u201d\n\nThe other New Caledonian member of the French legislature is Emmanuel Tjibaou, newly elected as president of the largest pro-independence party Union Cal\u00e9donienne (UC). Winning his seat in Paris last July, Tjibaou is the first pro-independence Kanak leader to serve in the National Assembly for 38 years. However, on Wednesday he was absent during the no-confidence vote, one of the few members of the Left who declined to vote for Barnier\u2019s ousting.\n\nAs UC president, Tjibaou continues to call for a pathway to sovereign independence. However, like his conservative colleague Metzdorf, Tjibaou has been working to gain extra economic assistance for New Caledonia, in preparation for planned discussions on a new political statute in 2025 (as he recently said \u201cyou can\u2019t negotiate on an empty stomach\u201d).\n\nIn recent weeks, the New Caledonian parliamentarians have been successful in gaining pledges of extra support from Paris. The Barnier government committed financial assistance until the end of 2024 and included important provisions just for New Caledonia in the draft budget for 2025. Just before the no-confidence motion, the National Assembly passed a bill to continue funding for the 2024 financial year, including important commitments made by France\u2019s Overseas Minister during his October visit to Noumea (additional loan guarantees; funding to rebuild schools, town halls and other public buildings damaged by arson or rioting over the last six months; financial subsidies to employers to retain workers who have lost full-time jobs).\n\nHowever, this month\u2019s parliamentary no-confidence motion \u2013 the first in more than 60 years \u2013 blows the draft 2025 budget out of the water. Barnier has now formally resigned, with the dubious distinction that his 90-day tenure was the shortest period as prime minister since the French Fifth Republic was created in 1958.\n\nFunding for New Caledonia\n\nBefore the vote on 4 December, Overseas Minister Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Buffet acknowledged that the government had failed to lock in its pledges to New Caledonia.\n\n\u201cWe are in an extremely difficult situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government had made commitments at the time of my visit to New Caledonia [last October] and they had to be translated into concrete terms in the budget.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Buffet outlined the provisions that would lapse if the government lost office. The draft financial program for next year included: a loan guarantee of 1 billion euros to underwrite budgetary initiatives by the Government of New Caledonia; plans for tax incentives to encourage post-conflict investment in the islands; and legislation and funding to conduct a census next year (New Caledonia\u2019s five-yearly census was last held in 2019 and was due this year, but could not proceed during the months of turmoil since May).\n\nLast month, the French Parliament deferred local elections in New Caledonia until November 2025, leaving the Mapou government in office until New Caledonian citizens can again vote for their three provincial assemblies and national Congress. The year-long delay is designed to give time for supporters and opponents of independence to negotiate a new political statute to replace the 1998 Noumea Accord. Now, the collapse of the French government and ongoing political uncertainty in Paris may delay the timing of crucial negotiations on New Caledonia\u2019s future.\n\nFor Loyalist leader Nicolas Metzdorf, the no-confidence motion \u201cplunges France into a major political crisis at a time when New Caledonia needs stability more than ever. This vote, with serious consequences, comes while significant progress had been obtained within the framework of the finance bill for 2025.\u201d\n\nOn 11 December, the Congress of New Caledonia must now vote on legislation that would validate the loans and grants committed for 2024 worth 27 billion Pacific francs (AUD$350 million). Beyond this, prospects for next year are still uncertain.\n\nMacron\u2019s folly\n\nOn the night after the collapse of the Barnier government, French President Emmanuel Macron made a televised speech to the nation, pledging to appoint a new prime minister quickly. However, he showed no humility or acknowledgement of his own responsibility for the current crisis. Instead he thrust responsibility back to the parliament, suggesting they must finalise a new budget before Christmas: \u201cIt is necessary to have this budget at the very beginning of next year to allow the country to invest, as has been planned, in our armed forces, our court system, our law enforcement, but also to help our farmers in difficulty who were waiting for the budget, or to support New Caledonia.\u201d\n\nMacron still has two years in office until the next presidential elections in 2027, but his capacity to drive politics and policy is diminished. Even as he struts the world stage as a statesman, he is on the nose with most French voters \u2013 one opinion poll taken after the no-confidence motion reported that 63% of French citizens want him to resign.\n\nThe New Popular Front has called for Macron\u2019s resignation, but \u2013 returning to Paris from a diplomatic visit to Saudi Arabia \u2013 Macron was defiant: \u201cIf I am here before you, it is because I was elected twice by the French people. I am extremely proud of this, and I will honour this trust with all the energy that is mine, until the last second, I can be useful to the country.\u201d\n\nHis political future remains uncertain however, given that many of the key players in the National Assembly also intend to run for the presidency in 2027, including Marine Le Pen of Rassemblement national (National Rally), Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of La France Insoumise (France unbowed) and even Macron allies like Edouard Philippe, a former Prime Minister dumped in the 2021, or outgoing Armed Forces Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu.\n\nWidely seen as arrogant or out of touch, the French President has been criticised by his own supporters for last June\u2019s decision to call snap elections, which left his parliamentary group without the numbers to pass legislation. After the collapse of the Barnier government, an editorial in Le Monde noted that \u201cMacron is still paying for, and making the country pay for, his disastrous dissolution of the National Assembly in June, which resulted in no governing majority, three political blocs unable to agree, and the feeling amongst many voters that they had been democratically cheated during the interminable appointment of Prime Minister Barnier.\u201d\n\nThe leading newspaper argued \u201cthere is now a real risk that the political crisis will degenerate into an institutional crisis, given the high level of mistrust not only of the President but also of parliamentarians.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s misjudgement on domestic French politics echoes a series of policy blunders in recent years that have affected people in New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia, even as the small island states try to deal with post-Covid debt, cost-of-living pressure, the climate emergency and growing US-China strategic competition.\n\nAt the Pacific Islands Forum in Nuku\u2019alofa last August, President of French Polynesia Moetai Brotherson told Islands Business that misjudged decisions taken by President Macron since 2021 had contributed to mid-May\u2019s explosion of conflict in New Caledonia.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all the events since 13 May were easy to foresee,\u201d Brotherson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling France for three years now about the stepping stones that led to those events.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the decision by the French State to maintain the third referendum on self-determination in December 2021, that was the first mistake. Then the nomination of [Loyalist leader] Madame Back\u00e8s as Secretary of State for Citizenship \u2013 that was a huge mistake, because it was the first time that the French State was clearly no longer respecting the neutral position that was their position since the [1998 Noumea] Accord.\u201d\n\nBrotherson noted that President Macron\u2019s attempt to ram through electoral reforms for New Caledonia \u2013 without a local consensus \u2013 added to this breakdown of trust between independence supporters and the French State: \u201cThe third and major mistake was this push around modification of the voting constituency in New Caledonia, and that was a major mistake, especially in the light of dissolving the French National Assembly right after creating all this havoc!\u201d\n\nSo, what comes next? Michel Barnier will remain as caretaker leader until President Macron can appoint a successor (who will become the fifth prime minister the French leader has churned through since his re-election in 2022). Macron may now seek to split the Left\u2019s New Popular Front, offering the prime minister\u2019s job to a politician from the Socialist Party or Greens, while isolating M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s La France Insoumise. However, whoever takes up this poisoned chalice will not have a governing majority in the parliament, Macron cannot call new parliamentary elections until July 2025 (after calling snap elections last June, the law requires him to wait a year before he can dissolve the legislature again).\n\nWhen Barnier first took office three months ago, a Le Monde editorial on New Caledonia said that \u201cFrance has a duty there to achieve what it has so often failed to do in the past: decolonisation.\u201d\n\nThat remains the challenge for France\u2019s next Prime Minister. Many independence supporters will be reaffirmed in their belief that it\u2019s time to move on from the French colonial empire, as an independent nation\u2026. PACNEWS/ISLANDS BUSINESS"

Some letters are not posted for public view until weeks or months after they are sent. Business owners have 15 days to respond to FDA warning letters. Warning letters often are not issued until a company has been given months to years to correct problems.\n\nMena Food Group LLC\n\nFort Lauderdale, FL\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to Mena Food Group LLC, citing numerous violations of federal food safety and labeling regulations at its Fort Lauderdale facility. The letter, dated Aug. 8, 2024, follows an inspection conducted from Oct. 30, 2023, to Nov. 20, 2023, during which FDA investigators observed serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food (CGMP & PC) rule under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117.\n\nThe FDA also issued a Form 483, Inspectional Observations, at the conclusion of the inspection, but Mena Food Group has yet to provide a written response addressing the observations.\n\nViolations detailed in the letter:\n\nThe FDA identified several critical issues at the facility, including:\n\n1. Failure to address known hazards:\n\nThe company did not adequately evaluate or address foreseeable hazards requiring preventive controls, such as:\n\nEnvironmental pathogens: The facility failed to implement controls for pathogens like Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in its ready-to-eat (RTE) products during post-baking stages.\n\nThe facility failed to implement controls for pathogens like Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in its ready-to-eat (RTE) products during post-baking stages. Mycotoxins: Mena Food Group did not establish a supply-chain program to monitor ingredients, such as wheat flour, associated with mycotoxins like deoxynivalenol (DON).\n\nMena Food Group did not establish a supply-chain program to monitor ingredients, such as wheat flour, associated with mycotoxins like deoxynivalenol (DON). Undeclared allergens: The company\u2019s failure to label allergens, including wheat, soy, sesame, and tree nuts, was deemed hazardous.\n\n2. Allergen cross-contact and labeling deficiencies:\n\nInvestigators found the company lacked sufficient monitoring, corrective action, and verification procedures to prevent allergen cross-contact during production. Products such as challah burger buns and hoagie rolls were found without proper allergen declarations.\n\n3. Hygiene violations:\n\nFDA inspectors observed several hygiene lapses, including employees failing to wash hands after exiting the facility and re-entering production areas. Other violations included open beverage containers near food preparation areas and direct hand-arm contact with RTE frosting during production.\n\n4. Facility maintenance issues:\n\nThe facility was cited for unsanitary conditions, such as apparent mold-like substances on light fixtures and ceiling tiles in production areas and heavily soiled fans blowing onto uncovered RTE products.\n\n5. Misbranding violations:\n\nSeveral RTE products, including cupcakes, buns, and cakes, were misbranded for failing to declare allergens, list common or usual ingredient names, and provide accurate statements of net quantity or manufacturer information.\n\nThe full warning letter can be viewed here.\n\nCalavo Growers Inc.\n\nKeaau, HA\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to Calavo Growers Inc., highlighting violations of the Produce Safety Regulation at one of its contracted papaya farms. The letter, dated Oct. 25, 2024, stems from a domestic investigation conducted on April 16, 2024, at Calavo\u2019s papaya packing facility, followed by an inspection of a contracted farm from April 20-22, 2024.\n\nThe FDA issued a Form FDA 4056, Produce Farm Inspection Observations, to the contracted farm after identifying significant violations.\n\nViolations detailed in the letter:\n\nThe FDA found that the farm did not provide adequate, readily accessible toilet facilities for workers in growing areas during harvesting activities. Specifically, workers were forced to urinate in bushes near the fields because the sole toilet facility was located 0.30 miles from the harvesting site. The violation was previously observed during a 2023 inspection, making it a repeat offense.\n\nCalavo representatives acknowledged the violations and verbally committed to relocating toilet facilities closer to growing areas and ordering additional composting toilets to cover all contracted farms. The FDA emphasized that Calavo Growers bears responsibility for ensuring compliance with federal safety standards, even when contracting with independent farms.\n\nThe full warning letter can be viewed here.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)\n\n"

            "article_content": "Bryn Davies, CEO of InfoBluePrint.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and cloud are top trends impacting master data management (MDM) now and into the year ahead, as organisations turn their attention to data quality and management to support areas such as digital transformation and analytics.\n\nWhile AI and cloud are certainly noteworthy trends in MDM, my advice \u2212 as always \u2212 is to ensure there's a solid business case for MDM as a first priority.\n\nMore South African organisations have turned their attention to getting data management right as a foundation for analytics and data science.\n\nReliable analytics is a solid business objective, but MDM is not just about analytics, it's also about operational efficiencies: helping you \u2018make more money, spend less money, or stay out of jail\u2019. It's about raising revenues, cutting costs and compliance.\n\nAI may not yet have transformed MDM, but there\u2019s a great deal of interest and a lot of progress being made in deploying AI to improve data governance, metadata management and MDM.\n\nThe application of AI to MDM is a natural progression that will accelerate rapidly in the short-term, and significantly enhance the value and efficiencies of MDM in organisations.\n\nReliable analytics is a solid business objective, but MDM is not just about analytics, it's also about operational efficiencies\n\nAs data volumes continue to grow and data sources become more and more diverse, organisations will find that traditional and manually configured MDM approaches are no longer sufficient to meet their rapidly-evolving data management needs.\n\nThis will require the evolution of MDM to include augmentation through AI and ML, and there are many aspects of MDM that can benefit from this.\n\nAs an example, automated identification of data elements based on actual content, and then instant application of pre-configured data quality validation and remediation rules pertaining to that data, without human developers first having to profile data and then manually map rules.\n\nIn addition to this, such AI algorithms continuously learn and improve, thus automatically reducing errors and enhancing overall data quality on a continuous improvement basis.\n\nAnother example of AI application to MDM would be the replacement of static and rigid data governance processes with adaptive governance frameworks that automatically evolve with changing needs. Overall, AI-driven MDM promises to be a powerful solution to modern data management challenges.\n\nCloud-based MDM has all the benefits of cloud models for other applications, such as rapid deployment, improved scalability, lower costs associated with on-premises IT infrastructure and operations, and improved disaster recovery, to name a few.\n\nOther benefits provided specifically by cloud-based MDM could be the enablement of easier and greater collaboration across larger audiences (human or machine) spread over multiple divisions, organisations, geographic regions, industries or a combination thereof, together with the required seamless scalability that such complexity would demand.\n\nAdditionally, data governance for global organisations could be significantly enhanced by cloud-based MDM, as well as reference data management for such organisations, provided, for example, by a hierarchical MDM architecture supporting global, regional and local master and reference data management schemes.\n\nOf course, whether it is practical to have a cloud-based MDM solution with data provider or consumer applications on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both, would require well-considered architectural frameworks and thorough piloting, in particular around the inherent data integration requirements of MDM.\n\nAnother trend highlighted by some international industry stakeholders is data fabric architecture to provide a unified view of data across different systems and sources. This has been spoken about for some years, but is only now really starting to be considered seriously by some South African companies.\n\nAs organisations continue to explore the application of data fabric to their analytics, reporting and associated data integration needs, the question that arises is where MDM fits into a data fabric strategy, or vice versa.\n\nIt must be noted that, while there is some overlap between data fabric and MDM, they are different, sometimes subtly, in many regards. Both share a common theme of the need to share data, but the scope of data fabric is all data, while that of MDM is generally master data, and often also reference data.\n\nData fabric has a strong data integration focus, while integration for MDM is more a means to an end, with MDM having a stronger focus on data quality and a persisted, standardised best of breed system-of-record, than what data fabric has.\n\nUltimately, data fabric benefits from MDM being a supplier of harmonised, quality, master (and reference) data, enabling fabric to deliver improved reliability and much greater value when combined with other data, such as transactional data, from multiple sources. Therefore, a move to data fabric may turn more of a spotlight on MDM in future."

More info\n\nAn appeal has been launched to help identify the body of a man found in remote woods exactly 45 years ago. They mystery of the 'Glamorgan Man' has baffled authorities for nearly five decades.\n\nOn December 9, 1979, the skeletal remains of a man were found in Rheola Forest near Resolven in Glamorgan. He is believed to have died between nine and 18 months previously.\n\nIt has been thought over the years that he might be a visitor from South Africa. On his body was a Salvation Testament that bore the name D MALAN and a partial address in Randburg, South Africa. Much of the evidence points towards him having been from South Africa, or having had a link to the country.\n\nVolunteer investigators with Locate International, a charity that looks into cold cases of missing and unidentified people, have been working on the case of Glamorgan Man, as he is known, for the past four years. Join our WhatsApp community here.\n\nNow, 45 years to the day since he was discovered, they are launching a new public appeal for information in Wales and South Africa.\n\nThey have described how the man was:\n\nbetween 40 and 60 years old\n\nof stocky build\n\nlikely to have walked with a heavy limp, as his right knee was fused\n\nbetween 5ft 8ins to 5ft 10ins (173-178cm) tall\n\nmay have worn dentures as he did not have teeth\n\nhad short mixed light brown hair streaked with grey\n\nThe charity believes that someone will have remembered him from his time in south Wales, possibly in 1978. A spokesman said: \"That person might have been a taxi driver, someone who worked at a hotel or a bed and breakfast, or a chapel-goer at the time.\n\nHe was wearing casual grey trousers with a size 28\u2033 inside leg, size eight shoes, a blue shirt a beige/fawn jumper, chest size 40.\n\n\"A number of items found on his person suggest a link to South Africa: A commemorative bookmark for a Christian mission conducted in King William\u2019s Town (now known as Qonce) by \u2018Rhodes Varsity Trekkers\u2019 which was held at Easter (April 9 -17) 1960\n\n\"There was also a South African Airways timetable of flights from London to Johannesburg, dated 1977. Notes on an airmail envelope planning an internal flight to Durban. The handwriting appears to be the same as that in the Bible. For the latest Welsh news delivered to your inbox sign up to our newsletter\n\n\"There was also a map of south Wales, which our volunteers have learned was issued by the Welsh Tourist Board, was also found, along with a small amount of Canadian and US dollars and blank headed notepaper from the Heathrow Sheraton hotel.\"\n\n(Image: Locate)\n\nLocate International\u2019s volunteers are exploring a number of possible angles and have been asking if he was a mining consultant. They say the dollars in his possession suggest he was used to travel. They have also been investigating if there are any anti-apartheid movement like because some prominent members lived near Resolven after leaving South Africa.\n\nAnother angle they have been investigating is whether he was researching his own family history because there is evidence that several people from the Resolven area emigrated to South Africa.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"Do you remember someone who was from South Africa, or who spoke of South Africa and who walked with a heavy limp? Did you work in a guest house or hotel and remember a visitor leaving behind some possessions? And what happened to any such possessions? Have you kept a register of guests who visited in 1978?\"\n\nThey have been exploring the reason why he was carrying a Salvation Testament, and trying to check if he attended chapel while visiting South Wales and the Vale of Neath in particular.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who would have stood out to anyone who encountered him at the time,\u201d said Mark Greenhalgh, Locate International\u2019s CEO. \u201cHe was a stocky man with a strong limp, who possibly spoke with a South African accent.\n\n\u201cThink back to 1978 and where you were at that time, and who you knew. Who could you ask that might be able to help?\n\n\u201cEven the smallest piece of information you have can make a difference, and help return Glamorgan Man\u2019s identity after all this time.\u201d\n\nIf you have any information, contact Locate International by emailing appeals@locate.international, by calling 0300 102 1011 (in the UK) or by visiting here."

            "article_content": "Humanoids, AI agents expected in 2025\n\nNvidia experts across accelerated computing, data science and research predict multimodal models will speed industry innovation and efficiency.\n\nFrom boardroom to break room, generative AI took this year by storm, stirring discussion across industries about how to best harness the technology to enhance innovation and creativity, improve customer service, transform product development and even boost communication.\n\nThe adoption of generative AI and large language models is rippling through nearly every industry, as incumbents and new entrants reimagine products and services to generate an estimated $1.3 trillion in revenue by 2032, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nYet, some companies and startups are still slow to adopt AI, sticking to experimentation and siloed projects even as the technology advances at a dizzying pace. That\u2019s partly because AI benefits vary by company, use case and level of investment.\n\nCautious approaches are giving way to optimism. Two-thirds of the respondents to Forrester Research\u2019s 2024 State of AI Survey believe their organizations would require less than 50% return on investments to consider their AI initiatives successful.\n\nThe next big thing on the horizon is agentic AI, a form of autonomous or \u201creasoning\u201d AI that requires using diverse language models, sophisticated retrieval-augmented generation stacks and advanced data architectures.\n\nNvidia experts in industry verticals already shared their expectations for the year ahead:\n\nIan Buck, vice-president of hyperscale and HPC\n\nInference drives the AI charge: As AI models grow in size and complexity, the demand for efficient inference solutions will increase.\n\nThe rise of generative AI has transformed inference from simple recognition of the query and response to complex information generation \u2014 including summarizing from multiple sources and large language models such as OpenAI o1 and Llama 450B \u2014 which dramatically increases computational demands. Through new hardware innovations, coupled with continuous software improvements, performance will increase and total cost of ownership is expected to shrink by 5x or more.\n\nAccelerate everything: With GPUs becoming more widely adopted, industries will look to accelerate everything, from planning to production. New architectures will add to that virtuous cycle, delivering cost efficiencies and an order of magnitude higher compute performance with each generation.\n\nAs nations and businesses race to build AI factories to accelerate even more workloads, expect many to look for platform solutions and reference data center architectures or blueprints that can get a data center up and running in weeks versus months. This will help them solve some of the world\u2019s toughest challenges, including quantum computing and drug discovery.\n\nQuantum computing \u2014 all trials, no errors: Quantum computing will make significant strides as researchers focus on supercomputing and simulation to solve the greatest challenges to the nascent field: errors.\n\nQubits, the basic unit of information in quantum computing, are susceptible to noise, becoming unstable after performing only thousands of operations. This prevents today\u2019s quantum hardware from solving useful problems. In 2025, expect to see the quantum computing community move toward challenging, but crucial, quantum error correction techniques. Error correction requires quick, low-latency calculations. Also expect to see quantum hardware that\u2019s physically colocated within supercomputers, supported by specialized infrastructure.\n\nAI will also play a crucial role in managing these complex quantum systems, optimizing error correction and enhancing overall quantum hardware performance. This convergence of quantum computing, supercomputing and AI into accelerated quantum supercomputers will drive progress in realizing quantum applications for solving complex problems across various fields, including drug discovery, materials development and logistics.\n\nBryan Catanzaro, vice-president of applied deep learning research\n\nPutting a face to AI: AI will become more familiar to use, emotionally responsive and marked by greater creativity and diversity. The first generative AI models that drew pictures struggled with simple tasks like drawing teeth. Rapid advances in AI are making image and video outputs much more photorealistic, while AI-generated voices are losing that robotic feel.\n\nThese advancements will be driven by the refinement of algorithms and datasets and enterprises\u2019 acknowledgment that AI needs a face and a voice to matter to 8 billion people. This will also cause a shift from turn-based AI interactions to more fluid and natural conversations. Interactions with AI will no longer feel like a series of exchanges but instead offer a more engaging and humanlike conversational experience.\n\nRethinking industry infrastructure and urban planning: Nations and industries will begin examining how AI automates various aspects of the economy to maintain the current standard of living, even as the global population shrinks.\n\nThese efforts could help with sustainability and climate change. For instance, the agriculture industry will begin investing in autonomous robots that can clean fields and remove pests and weeds mechanically. This will reduce the need for pesticides and herbicides, keeping the planet healthier and freeing up human capital for other meaningful contributions. Expect to see new thinking in urban planning offices to account for autonomous vehicles and improve traffic management.\n\nLonger term, AI can help find solutions for reducing carbon emissions and storing carbon, an urgent global challenge.\n\nKari Briski, vice-president of generative AI software\n\nA symphony of agents \u2014 AI orchestrators: Enterprises are set to have a slew of AI agents, which are semiautonomous, trained models that work across internal networks to help with customer service, human resources, data security and more. To maximise these efficiencies, expect to see a rise in AI orchestrators that work across numerous agents to seamlessly route human inquiries and interpret collective results to recommend and take actions for users.\n\nThese orchestrators will have access to deeper content understanding, multilingual capabilities and fluency with multiple data types, ranging from PDFs to video streams. Powered by self-learning data flywheels, AI orchestrators will continuously refine business-specific insights. For instance, in manufacturing, an AI orchestrator could optimize supply chains by analyzing real-time data and making recommendations on production schedules and supplier negotiations.\n\nThis evolution in enterprise AI will significantly boost productivity and innovation across industries while becoming more accessible. Knowledge workers will be more productive because they can tap into a personalised team of AI-powered experts. Developers will be able to build these advanced agents using customizable AI blueprints.\n\nMultistep reasoning amplifies AI insights: AI for years has been good at giving answers to specific questions without having to delve into the context of a given query. With advances in accelerated computing and new model architectures, AI models will tackle increasingly complex problems and respond with greater accuracy and deeper analysis.\n\nUsing a capability called multistep reasoning, AI systems increase the amount of \u201cthinking time\u201d by breaking down large, complex questions into smaller tasks \u2014 sometimes even running multiple simulations \u2014 to problem-solve from various angles. These models dynamically evaluate each step, ensuring contextually relevant and transparent responses. Multistep reasoning also involves integrating knowledge from various sources to enable AI to make logical connections and synthesize information across different domains.\n\nThis will likely impact fields ranging from finance and healthcare to scientific research and entertainment. For example, a healthcare model with multistep reasoning could make a number of recommendations for a doctor to consider, depending on the patient\u2019s diagnosis, medications and response to other treatments.\n\nStart your AI query engine: With enterprises and research organizations sitting on petabytes of data, the challenge is gaining quick access to the data to deliver actionable insights.\n\nAI query engines will change how businesses mine that data, and company-specific search engines will be able to sift through structured and unstructured data, including text, images and videos, using natural language processing and machine learning to interpret a user\u2019s intent and provide more relevant and comprehensive results.\n\nThis will lead to more intelligent decision-making processes, improved customer experiences and enhanced productivity across industries. The continuous learning capabilities of AI query engines will create self-improving data flywheels that help applications become increasingly effective.\n\nCharlie Boyle, vice -president of DGX Platforms\n\nAgentic AI makes high-performance inference essential for enterprises: The dawn of agentic AI will drive demand for near-instant responses from complex systems of multiple models. This will make high-performance inference just as important as high-performance training infrastructure. IT leaders will need scalable, purpose-built and optimised accelerated computing infrastructure that can keep pace with the demands of agentic AI to deliver the performance required for real-time decision-making.\n\nEnterprises expand AI factories to process data into intelligence: Enterprise AI factories transform raw data into business intelligence. Next year, enterprises will expand these factories to leverage massive amounts of historical and synthetic data, then generate forecasts and simulations for everything from consumer behavior and supply chain optimization to financial market movements and digital twins of factories and warehouses. AI factories will become a key competitive advantage that helps early adopters anticipate and shape future scenarios, rather than just react to them.\n\nChill factor \u2014 liquid-cooled AI data centres: As AI workloads continue to drive growth, pioneering organisations will transition to liquid cooling to maximize performance and energy efficiency. Hyperscale cloud providers and large enterprises will lead the way, using liquid cooling in new AI data centers that house hundreds of thousands of AI accelerators, networking and software.\n\nEnterprises will increasingly choose to deploy AI infrastructure in colocation facilities rather than build their own \u2014 in part to ease the financial burden of designing, deploying and operating intelligence manufacturing at scale. Or, they will rent capacity as needed. These deployments will help enterprises harness the latest infrastructure without needing to install and operate it themselves. This shift will accelerate broader industry adoption of liquid cooling as a mainstream solution for AI data centers.\n\nGilad Shainer, senior vice-president of Networking\n\nGoodbye network, hello computing fabric: The term \u201cnetworking\u201d in the data center will seem dated as data center architecture transforms into an integrated compute fabric that enables thousands of accelerators to efficiently communicate with one another via scale-up and scale-out communications, spanning miles of cabling and multiple data center facilities.\n\nThis integrated compute fabric will include Nvidia NVLink, which enables scale-up communications, as well as scale-out capabilities enabled by intelligent switches, SuperNICs and DPUs. This will help securely move data to and from accelerators and perform calculations on the fly that drastically minimize data movement. Scale-out communication across networks will be crucial to large-scale AI data center deployments \u2014 and key to getting them up and running in weeks versus months or years.\n\nAs agentic AI workloads grow \u2014 requiring communication across multiple interconnected AI models working together rather than monolithic and localized AI models \u2014 compute fabrics will be essential to delivering real-time generative AI.\n\nDistributed AI: All data centers will become accelerated as new approaches to Ethernet design emerge that enable hundreds of thousands of GPUs to support a single workload. This will help democratize AI factory rollouts for multi-tenant generative AI clouds and enterprise AI data centers.\n\nThis breakthrough technology will also enable AI to expand quickly into enterprise platforms and simplify the buildup and management of AI clouds.\n\nCompanies will build data center resources that are more geographically dispersed \u2014 located hundreds or even thousands of miles apart \u2014 because of power limitations and the need to build closer to renewable energy sources. Scale-out communications will ensure reliable data movement over these long distances.\n\nLinxi (Jim) Fann, senior research scientist: AI Agents\n\nRobotics will evolve more into humanoids: Robots will begin to understand arbitrary language commands. Right now, industry robots must be programmed by hand, and they don\u2019t respond intelligently to unpredictable inputs or languages other than those programmed. Multimodal robot foundation models that incorporate vision, language and arbitrary actions will evolve this \u201cAI brain,\u201d as will agentic AI that allows for greater AI reasoning.\n\nTo be sure, don\u2019t expect to immediately see intelligent robots in homes, restaurants, service areas and factories. But these use cases may be closer than you think, as governments look for solutions to aging societies and shrinking labor pools. Physical automation is going to happen gradually, in 10 years being as ubiquitous as the iPhone.\n\nAI agents are all about inferencing: In September, OpenAI announced a new large language model trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. OpenAI o1, dubbed Strawberry, thinks before it answers: It can produce a long internal chain of thought, correcting mistakes and breaking down tricky steps into simple ones, before responding to the user.\n\n2025 will be the year a lot of computation begins to shift to inference at the edge. Applications will need hundreds of thousands of tokens for a single query, as small language models make one query after another in microseconds before churning out an answer.\n\nSmall models will be more energy efficient and will become increasingly important for robotics, creating humanoids and robots that can assist humans in everyday jobs and promoting mobile intelligence applications..\n\nBob Pette, vice president of enterprise platforms\n\nSeeking sustainable scalability: As enterprises prepare to embrace a new generation of semiautonomous AI agents to enhance various business processes, they\u2019ll focus on creating robust infrastructure, governance and human-like capabilities for effective large-scale deployment. At the same time, AI applications will increasingly use local processing power to enable more sophisticated AI features to run directly on workstations, including thin, lightweight laptops and compact form factors, and improve performance while reducing latency for AI-driven tasks.\n\nValidated reference architectures, which provide guidance on appropriate hardware and software platforms, will become crucial to optimize performance and accelerate AI deployments. These architectures will serve as essential tools for organizations navigating the complex terrain of AI implementation by helping ensure that their investments align with current needs and future technological advancements.\n\nRevolutionizing construction, engineering and design with AI: Expect to see a rise in generative AI models tailored to the construction, engineering and design industries that will boost efficiency and accelerate innovation.\n\nIn construction, agentic AI will extract meaning from massive volumes of construction data collected from onsite sensors and cameras, offering insights that lead to more efficient project timelines and budget management.\n\nAI will evaluate reality capture data (lidar, photogrammetry and radiance fields) 24/7 and derive mission-critical insights on quality, safety and compliance \u2014 resulting in reduced errors and worksite injuries.\n\nFor engineers, predictive physics based on physics-informed neural networks will accelerate flood prediction, structural engineering and computational fluid dynamics for airflow solutions tailored to individual rooms or floors of a building \u2014 allowing for faster design iteration.\n\nIn design, retrieval-augmented generation will enable compliance early in the design phase by ensuring that information modeling for designing and constructing buildings complies with local building codes. Diffusion AI models will accelerate conceptual design and site planning by enabling architects and designers to combine keyword prompts and rough sketches to generate richly detailed conceptual images for client presentations. That will free up time to focus on research and design.\n\nSanja Fidler, vice-president of AI research\n\nPredicting unpredictability: Expect to see more models that can learn in the everyday world, helping digital humans, robots and even autonomous cars understand chaotic and sometimes unpredictable situations, using very complex skills with little human intervention.\n\nFrom the research lab to Wall Street, we\u2019re entering a hype cycle similar to the optimism about autonomous driving 5-7 years ago. It took many years for companies like Waymo and Cruise to deliver a system that works \u2014 and it\u2019s still not scalable because the troves of data these companies and others, including Tesla, have collected may be applicable in one region but not another.\n\nWith models introduced this year, we can now move more quickly \u2014 and with much less capital expense \u2014 to use internet-scale data to understand natural language and emulate movements by observing human and other actions. Edge applications like robots, cars and warehouse machinery will quickly learn coordination, dexterity and other skills in order to navigate, adapt and interact with the real world.\n\nWill a robot be able to make coffee and eggs in your kitchen, and then clean up after? Not yet. But it may come sooner than you think.\n\nGetting real: Fidelity and realism is coming to generative AI across the graphics and simulation pipeline, leading to hyperrealistic games, AI-generated movies and digital humans.\n\nUnlike with traditional graphics, the vast majority of images will come from generated pixels instead of renderings, resulting in more natural motions and appearances. Tools that develop and iterate on contextual behaviors will result in more sophisticated games for a fraction of the cost of today\u2019s AAA titles.\n\nIndustries adopt generative AI: Nearly every industry is poised to use AI to enhance and improve the way people live and play.\n\nAgriculture will use AI to optimize the food chain, improving the delivery of food. For example, AI can be used to predict the greenhouse gas emissions from different crops on individual farms. These analyses can help inform design strategies that help reduce greenhouse gas in supply chains. Meanwhile, AI agents in education will personalize learning experiences, speaking in a person\u2019s native language and asking or answering questions based on level of education in a particular subject.\n\nAs next-generation accelerators enter the marketplace, you\u2019ll also see a lot more efficiency in delivering these generative AI applications. By improving the training and efficiency of the models in testing, businesses and startups will see better and faster returns on investment across those applications.\n\nAndrew Feng, vice-president of GPU Software\n\nAccelerated data analytics offers insights with no code change: In 2025, accelerated data analytics will become mainstream for organizations grappling with ever-increasing volumes of data.\n\nBusinesses generate hundreds of petabytes of data annually, and every company is seeking ways to put it to work. To do so, many will adopt accelerated computing for data analytics.\n\nThe future lies in accelerated data analytics solutions that support \u201cno code change\u201d and \u201cno configuration change,\u201d enabling organizations to combine their existing data analytics applications with accelerated computing with minimum effort. Generative AI-empowered analytics technology will further widen the adoption of accelerated data analytics by empowering users \u2014 even those who don\u2019t have traditional programming knowledge \u2014 to create new data analytics applications.\n\nThe seamless integration of accelerated computing, facilitated by a simplified developer experience, will help eliminate adoption barriers and allow organizations to harness their unique data for new AI applications and richer business intelligence.\n\nNader Khalis, director of developer technology\n\nThe startup workforce: If you haven\u2019t heard much about prompt engineers or AI personality designers, you will in 2025. As businesses embrace AI to increase productivity, expect to see new categories of essential workers for both startups and enterprises that blend new and existing skills.\n\nA prompt engineer designs and refines precise text strings that optimize AI training and produce desired outcomes based on the creation, testing and iteration of prompt designs for chatbots and agentic AI. The demand for prompt engineers will extend beyond tech companies to sectors like legal, customer support and publishing. As AI agents proliferate, businesses and startups will increasingly lean in to AI personality designers to enhance agents with unique personalities.\n\nJust as the rise of computers spawned job titles like computer scientists, data scientists and machine learning engineers, AI will create different types of work, expanding opportunities for people with strong analytical skills and natural language processing abilities.\n\nUnderstanding employee efficiency: Startups incorporating AI into their practices increasingly will add revenue per employee (RPE) to their lexicon when talking to investors and business partners.\n\nInstead of a \u201cgrowth at all costs\u201d mentality, AI supplementation of the workforce will allow startup owners to home in on how hiring each new employee helps everyone else in the business generate more revenue. In the world of startups, RPE fits into discussions about the return on investment in AI and the challenges of filling roles in competition against big enterprises and tech companies."
