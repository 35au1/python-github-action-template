            "article_content": "INSTITUTE, W.Va. \u2013\u2013 Local volunteers will donate their time over the next dozen weeks to gather food for local food banks in Kanawha and Putnam Counties. The 44th annual United Food Operation food drive kicked off Friday. It\u2019s a 12 week effort to collect as much non-perishable food as possible to be passed along to the region\u2019s needy.\n\n\u201cWe do our pre-planning and get everything together and as we\u2019re talking to the pantries, they\u2019re running out of food. The need is so great we\u2019ve got to keep this going,\u201d said Elaine Harris, UFO Chairperson.\n\nEach Friday through April, the organization will accept donations of food at their warehouse in Institute to be distributed to a dozen food banks across two counties.\n\n\u201cOur warehouse is right off the Institute exit, there will be a big sign. We can take food and store it there and then distribute to the food banks,\u201d she explained.\n\nThis year the American Postal Workers Union Local 133 has joined the effort. The union members are employed at the U.S. Postal Service Processing Center at Southridge. The facility had originally been slated for closure, but thanks to efforts by the community and West Virginia\u2019s Congressional delegation it was saved and will stay in place. Harris said the organization wanted to get involved in the food drive out of gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their way of giving back to the community because the community was so very involved and supportive of them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur members are very excited to take part in this,\u201d Tim Holstein, Vice President of APWU Local 133, said in a news release. \u201cWe have a table set up in front of the union office at the plant and at the Main Post Office and are asking everyone to bring canned/nonperishable food to donate. One can of food could make a difference in someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe effort accepts any non-perishable goods. They\u2019ll take them at the warehouse each Friday or they can also make arrangements to pick up large donations. Harris said it\u2019s a never ending labor of love.\n\n\u201cThe need is so great. This is working people falling through the cracks. This is how we started this program almost 45 years ago,\u201d she said."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d.

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "Microsoft made a trio of announcements this week that are going to be very important for how the company approaches its big AI bet in 2025. It started off by creating a new AI engineering group to focus its developers on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers. Microsoft then announced pay-as-you-go agents for its relaunched Copilot Chat for businesses, and it finished the week by bundling Office AI features into Microsoft 365 for consumers and raising the subscription price.\n\nAll three of these announcements are linked to Microsoft\u2019s insatiable hunger to win at AI. The company still prioritizes security through employee performance reviews, but it increasingly feels like promoting AI is an equally high priority.\n\nThe new engineering group is a good example of Microsoft\u2019s priorities. Led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, the new CoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools division will combine Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div and AI platform teams together. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the reorganization as \u201centering the next innings of this AI platform shift\u201d and said it will \u201creshape all application categories.\u201d Nadella has regularly said that the pace of AI is changing software development, and now Microsoft is building an AI-first app stack to try and take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nCombining Microsoft\u2019s AI platform work and its developer division will put AI at the heart of the very tools, platforms, and services that Microsoft builds for customers and its own teams. Nadella even described this platform shift as the ability for Microsoft\u2019s AI agents, which are essentially virtual employees that automate tasks, to eventually be able to build custom applications. It\u2019s a transformation for Microsoft that looks like it will flip the company from software-as-a-service to service-as-software \u2014 where once-manual human tasks are automated by software and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has spent the past 15 years selling cloud computing to businesses, tempting them to move off traditional software that\u2019s licensed and installed to on-premise servers toward servers hosted by the software giant. Nadella led Microsoft\u2019s transformation to cloud infrastructure and services before becoming CEO, and it\u2019s been hugely successful for the company. Now, Nadella appears to be betting on being able to automate many people-based services and package this up in a software solution Microsoft can sell to businesses.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to some employees in Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div organization this week, and it\u2019s clear there is some unease about the company\u2019s commitment to AI at all costs. Microsoft\u2019s new AI engineering group emerged just days after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg predicted 2025 is going to be a year where \u201cMeta, and the other companies that are working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code.\u201d In an interview with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg said he believes that, over time, a lot of the code in Meta\u2019s apps \u201cwill be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a scary prospect for the thousands of engineers at Meta and Microsoft who have spent their entire careers learning how to build software. One engineer in Microsoft\u2019s new CoreAI team tells me there\u2019s now a feeling that if you\u2019re not all in on AI, there won\u2019t be a place for you in this new team.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s transition here will undoubtedly see engineering jobs change, and it\u2019s all part of a revenue opportunity for AI that the company is constantly chasing. Investors are increasingly looking for returns on Microsoft\u2019s big bets on AI, and recent reports have suggested that it\u2019s struggling to sell businesses on the idea of paying extra for AI-powered versions of Office apps. That\u2019s probably why this week we also saw Microsoft relaunch Copilot as Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, complete with free ChatGPT-like capabilities and pay-as-you-go agents. It\u2019s a rebranding of what was once Bing Enterprise Chat, then Copilot, and now Copilot Chat.\n\nI spoke to Jared Spataro, Microsoft\u2019s chief marketing officer of AI at work, earlier this week, and he made it clear this relaunch is also Microsoft\u2019s latest attempt to get people hooked on using AI at work. \u201cWhat we find is that when you start to use it, you become accustomed to and appreciative of the value that it can provide at work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThe free chat side of Copilot has already been popular for businesses that rely on Microsoft\u2019s software and services, and by adding in agent capabilities, there\u2019s an upsell opportunity to get businesses to pay extra to automate tasks with AI.\n\nMicrosoft can also use this Copilot Chat as a way to tempt businesses into upgrading to the full Microsoft 365 Copilot at $30 per user per month. \u201cWhile Copilot Chat is a powerful new on-ramp for everyone in your organization to build the AI habit, Microsoft 365 Copilot remains our best-in-class personal AI assistant for work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThis is where Copilot really transforms from a simple chatbot into a more assistive technology that can analyze Excel data for you, write paragraphs in Word, or generate an entire PowerPoint presentation. A lot of CTOs tell me that businesses have found the most value from Copilot inside Microsoft Teams, where the AI assistant will transcribe meetings and pull out key talking points to make it easy to catch up on calls you might have missed.\n\nMost businesses aren\u2019t paying the extra for Copilot inside Office apps, though. While adding an AI-powered version of the Python programming language to Excel is powerful and summaries of Outlook emails are super useful, Microsoft needs a lot more compelling Copilot features if it wants businesses to pay that $30 per user per month fee.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar situation over on the consumer side, which is why Microsoft started bundling its AI-powered Office features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions this week. Instead of asking consumers for $20 extra per month for Copilot Pro, Microsoft is raising its subscription prices by $3 per month to bundle Copilot into Office apps.\n\nAs part of this price bump, Microsoft is providing a set of AI credits that can be used on Copilot in apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. You\u2019ll get a monthly allotment of these credits, which can also be used for things like image generation in the Designer app or in apps on Windows like Paint, Photos, and Notepad. If you want unlimited usage of Copilot in Office apps or all of these AI features, you\u2019ll still need to pay for Copilot Pro.\n\nMicrosoft had been testing this Microsoft 365 subscription change in Australia, New Zealand, and some markets in Asia, and it feels like the worldwide launch this week is an even bigger test before the company does something similar for its commercial subscriptions.\n\nGoogle may well force Microsoft\u2019s hand here, after revealing this week that its Gemini Business plan, which you previously had to pay $20 per user per month for, is now free. Google is now bringing all of its AI features to its Workspace app at no extra cost, which piles on the pressure for Microsoft to make some similar moves for commercial customers of Microsoft 365.\n\nAs the competition heats up in 2025, expect to see Microsoft come up with even more inventive pay-as-you-go agents or AI credit methods to get consumers and businesses addicted to AI.\n\nThe pad:\n\nMicrosoft won\u2019t support Office apps on Windows 10 after October 14th. If you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time. Microsoft has started warning that it will no longer support Office apps, known as Microsoft 365 apps, on Windows 10 after October 14th \u2014 the day support ends for the old OS. While the apps will continue to function, there could be issues over time. It\u2019s all part of an effort from Microsoft to get businesses and consumers to upgrade to Windows 11.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time.

It\u2019s just a regular Bing search result now, although some countries still have the fake Google UI.\n\nMicrosoft has started quietly killing off its spoofed Google UI that it was using to trick Bing users into thinking they were using Google.

Microsoft files a gaming AI patent for \u201ccrafting and altering game narratives.\u201d I\u2019m still waiting for Microsoft to unveil its AI plans for Xbox, but it looks like the company is already exploring ways that AI can be used in game design. Windows Central has spotted a patent from 2024 that allows designers and players to customize a game through generative AI prompts. Nvidia has been showing off similar work for NPCs in games, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we start to see a lot more of this.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for Microsoft to unveil its AI plans for Xbox, but it looks like the company is already exploring ways that AI can be used in game design.

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "What is a 'blazar'?\n\nBlazar\n\nJ0410\u22120139\n\n'Cosmic powerhouse'\n\nFurther explorations\n\nAstronomers have identified the most ancient blazar ever observed, a supermassive black hole from the early universe shooting an energy beam directly at Earth. This cosmic powerhouse has a mass equal to 700 million suns, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters titled \"Properties and Far-infrared Variability of a z = 7 Blazar.\"Blazars are rare galaxies with supermassive black holes at their centres.These black holes emit jets of radiation that align directly with Earth, making them some of the brightest objects in the universe. The immense magnetic fields around these black holes shape the jets, which can extend far beyond their host galaxies.The newly discovered blazar, named J0410\u22120139, lies approximately 12.9 billion light-years from Earth. Its high-energy beam of radiation has travelled for almost 13 billion years to reach us, dating back to a time just 800 million years after the Big Bang. This makes it the most distant blazar ever recorded, surpassing the previous record-holder by 100 million years.The discovery of J0410\u22120139 offers scientists a unique opportunity to explore the early universe. \"The alignment of J0410\u22120139's jet with our line of sight allows astronomers to peer directly into the heart of this cosmic powerhouse,\" explained Emmanuel Momjian, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Virginia.Researchers combined data from powerful telescopes, including the Atacama Large Millimeter Array , the Magellan telescopes, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, alongside Nasa's Chandra observatory in orbit. These observations shed light on how the earliest supermassive black holes formed and evolved.Finding such a distant blazar suggests the existence of many other supermassive black holes from the same era, either lacking jets or with jets pointing away from Earth. Study lead author Eduardo Ba\u00f1ados of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy likened the discovery to a lottery win. \"Finding one [quasar] with a jet pointing directly toward us implies that at that time, there must have been many [quasars] in that period of cosmic history with jets that do not point at us.\"The team believes this is just the beginning. \"Where there is one, there's one hundred more [waiting to be found],\" added co-author Silvia Belladitta.This discovery makes J0410\u22120139 a record-holder and opens the door to finding more blazars from the early universe."

Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Michael Bennet to Amazon, Apple, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft and Uber.\n\n\"Big Tech companies have come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators for antitrust violations, violations of privacy, and harms to workers, consumers, and competition. At the same time, lawmakers in both parties have voiced support for regulating tech platforms, in recognition that there is currently no comprehensive set of rules for the tech sector,\" the letter states.\n\nBiden Warns Of 'Ultra-wealthy' 'Oligarchy' Despite Accepting Donations From Dem Mega-donors\n\nSenators Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet are asking tech companies for answers following their contributions to President-elect Trump's inaugural fund.\n\n\"We are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor,\" the document continues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWarren and Bennet claim these donations \"raise questions about corruption and the influence of corporate money on the Trump administration, and Congress and the public deserve answers.\"\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\nThe letter asks the mentioned companies to answer questions by January 31 about these contributions, including the rationale behind them and what kinds of communications were made to the Trump team.\n\nJason Aldean, Kid Rock Join Carrie Underwood At Trump Inauguration Events\n\nLogos of major Big Tech companies.\n\n\"Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to Democrats,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted in response to the letter.\n\nAltman noted that his $1 million donation to the inaugural fund was a personal contribution, and he was confused about the document's details, considering his company had no part in the decision.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, an OpenAI spokesperson said, \"Sam believes that President Trump will lead our country during a pivotal moment for AI and American innovation and looks forward to working with him and his administration.\"\n\nTrump Inauguration Guest List Includes Tech Titans Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk\n\nTech leaders, including Elon Musk, Shou Zi Chew, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg are set to attend Trump's inauguration on Monday.\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Uber donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook personally donated $1 million to the fund.\n\nMany of these tech company leaders are expected to attend Trump's inauguration.\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Uber for comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Democratic lawmakers pen letter accusing Meta, OpenAI, Google and more of trying to 'buy favor' with Trump"

            "article_content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) have historically focused their virtual health care enforcement efforts on \u201ctraditional\u201d telemarketing, broker, runner, and related schemes. These arrangements generally involve sales agents, recruiters, or marketers who direct patients to purported telemedicine companies, which then enter into payment arrangements with physicians and/or non-physician practitioners for the provision of medically unnecessary health care services. The practitioners often have limited or no interaction with the supposed patients, do not review or have access to patient medical records, and order or prescribe medically unnecessary items or services from a predetermined list.\n\nIn July 2022, the OIG formalized its concerns regarding such arrangements in a Special Fraud Alert. As noted by the OIG, these schemes implicate multiple civil and criminal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the civil False Claims Act (FCA), and criminal fraud statutes. The OIG further stated that these arrangements have the potential for considerable harm to both federal health care programs and program beneficiaries, including (1) inappropriate increases in costs for medically unnecessary items and services, (2) patient harm or delayed clinical services, and (3) corruption of medical decision-making.\n\nWhile DOJ and the OIG have continued to pursue and investigate telefraud schemes, two cases announced in 2024 demonstrate a shift in telemedicine enforcement from \u201ctraditional\u201d schemes to more sophisticated investigations and potential criminal exposure in certain matters.\n\nFirst, in June 2024, Ruthie He, the founder, CEO, and clinical president of Done Global (Done), and David Brody, clinical president of Done and the sole physician shareholder of Done Health, P.C., were indicted, arrested, and arraigned in a first-of-its-kind telemedicine criminal prosecution (see our prior post here). Both He and Brody face a seven-count indictment alleging conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nThe indictment alleges that He and Brody orchestrated a scheme to generate over $100 million in revenue by inappropriately offering Adderall and other stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Among other allegations, the defendants purportedly violated the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine and directed practitioners to prescribe and renew Adderall prescriptions without clinical justification. The practitioners were allegedly paid based upon an above-market pay structure tied to the number of patients ultimately receiving prescriptions. Indeed, the indictment asserts that prescribing practitioners often were not licensed in the states where prescriptions were issued and that Adderall and other stimulants were ordered in violation of state physician supervision requirements.\n\nThe prosecution of He and Brody is proceeding in federal court in the Northern District of California before Judge Breyer. In October 2024, He\u2019s bond was revoked, and she was remanded to custody as a flight risk. On December 2, 2024, He filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, moved to compel disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion asserts that the indictment fails to satisfy the knowledge requirement under the Controlled Substances Act, that the health care fraud conspiracy elements have not been adequately alleged, and, in the alternative, that He should be entitled to grand jury materials. On December 16, 2024, DOJ opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing the sufficiency of the indictment and contesting the disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion to dismiss is currently pending.\n\nIn addition to He and Brody, several other Done personnel have cases pending in the Northern District of California. Two Done nurse practitioners and an executive leader have cases pending before Judge Breyer. In the last related case, a Done physician has entered a plea agreement.\n\nSecond, also in June 2024, a behavioral health telemedicine holding company and its practice affiliates (collectively, Supportive Care) agreed to pay approximately $4.6 million to resolve allegations related to the submission of false claims to Medicare and the Connecticut Medicaid program. Interestingly, DOJ alleged that the telemedicine company submitted false claims for \u201ctelehealth originating site facility fees.\u201d Under the applicable Medicare billing code, telehealth originating site fees are only billable when the originating site (in this case the nursing facility) provides administrative and clinical support for the telehealth patient. Instead, here, the telemedicine company and its affiliates billed for the originating site facility code.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ alleged that Supportive Care submitted false claims for psychological services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. DOJ alleged, however, that the beneficiaries were not in fact residing in the nursing facilities and had been transferred to various hospitals and admitted as inpatients. The settlement resolved both sets of FCA allegations.\n\nThese two cases demonstrate that DOJ and the OIG are expanding their investigation and enforcement activities beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d telefraud arrangements into more complex areas. In the Done prosecution, DOJ is seeking to criminally enforce allegedly fraudulent telehealth activity implicating compliance with state corporate practice and physician supervision requirements. In the Supportive Care resolution, DOJ and the OIG focused on the alleged failure to adhere to telehealth-specific codes. Both matters portend a trend likely to continue in 2025 whereby a maturing telehealth industry is subject to more sophisticated government investigations.\n\n[View source.]"

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "Medical Properties Trust (MPW 2.25%) got off to a challenging start last year. In January, the real estate investment trust (REIT) revealed that its top tenant at the time, Steward Health Care, was experiencing liquidity issues, which impacted its ability to pay rent.\n\nSteward filed for bankruptcy a few months later. The year ended more positively as the REIT was able to take control of its real estate from Steward and lease most of those properties to five higher-quality replacement operators.\n\nWith Steward no longer in the picture, the healthcare REIT thought it had finally closed the door on its tenant issues last year. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. It recently revealed that another leading tenant, Prospect Medical Group, has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nNew year, same issue\n\nProspect Medical Group filed for bankruptcy in early January. The healthcare company has been experiencing liquidity issues, due partly to the stalled sales processes across several East Coast markets (Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania). The REIT has investments linked to Prospect in two of those states (Connecticut and Pennsylvania). It also has investments in California.\n\nMedical Properties Trust had previously recapitalized its $1.6 billion investment with Prospect in May 2023, which included:\n\nCalifornia : The REIT had a $513 million investment in six leased California hospitals. Prospect was to resume making partial rent payments on these properties in September of that year and full payments in March of 2024.\n\nConnecticut : Medical Properties Trust has a $457 million real estate investment that it agreed to sell as part of Yale New Haven Health's acquisition of Prospect's operations in the state. The REIT expected to recoup its investment via that sale (which still hasn't closed) and the sale of its interest in Prospect's managed-care business (valued at $103 million).\n\nPennsylvania : The REIT transferred its Pennsylvania real estate to Prospect in exchange for a $150 million mortgage loan and $100 million of equity in Prospect's managed-care business.\n\nOther : The REIT had another $264 million of loans, $56 million of accrued rent and interest, and a $50 million convertible loan to the managed-care business, all of which it expected to recover through the sale of Prospect's managed-care business.\n\nAs a result of its liquidity issues, Prospect hasn't paid any rent to Medical Properties Trust on the California hospital since last June, even though those facilities reported volume growth and improved coverage trends last year. Meanwhile, it has only made minimal payments related to leases and mortgages in Connecticut and Pennsylvania over the past two years.\n\nWorking to preserve and recover value\n\nMedical Properties Trust received some positive news regarding its investment in Prospect late last year. The company announced that Astrana Health had agreed to buy a majority of Prospect's managed-care platform for $745 million plus the assumption of some liabilities in November. As a result, Medical Properties Trust expects to receive about $200 million, with most of that cash expected in the first half of this year (it will also receive a $50 million payment by 2027).\n\nHowever, with Prospect filing for bankruptcy, the REIT's focus is now on protecting its California hospital investment. Medical Properties Trust also anticipates that the process will enable Prospect to successfully complete the sale of its Connecticut facilities. This outcome would enable it to recoup some of the value of its Connecticut properties while resuming rent collection in California.\n\nGiven that the REIT currently isn't collecting any income from these properties right now, the bankruptcy likely won't have any impact on its dividend (which currently yields 7.7%). Instead, its rental income is on track to rise this year as the new tenants at its former Steward facilities start making rental payments.\n\nThose payments will steadily escalate over the next two years, reaching their fully stabilized rate at the end of 2026 (about 95% of Steward's lease rate). That growing income stream could enable Medical Properties Trust to rebuild its dividend following two deep cuts in recent years.\n\nTwo steps forward and another back\n\nMedical Properties Trust continues to battle tenant-related headwinds. While it has finally severed its relationship with Steward, Prospect has become a source of trouble again.\n\nHowever, its bankruptcy could enable Prospect to finally sell off its troubled East Coast operations so that it can focus on California, which would benefit Medical Properties Trust. The hope is that it will quickly reemerge from bankruptcy, which could finally enable Medical Properties Trust to put its tenant issues in the past. That would allow the company to focus on rebuilding its portfolio, dividend, and shareholder value."

            "article_content": "The Apache Software Foundation has recently announced the general availability of Apache Hudi 1.0, the transactional data lake platform with support for near real-time analytics. Initially introduced in 2017, Apache Hudi provides an open table format optimized for efficient writes in incremental data pipelines and fast query performance.\n\nOriginally developed at Uber as an incremental processing framework on Apache Hadoop and submitted to the Apache Software Foundation in 2019, Hudi is designed to bridge the gap between database-like functionality and open data lakehouse architectures. Hudi\u2019s main strength lies in its ability to support both near real-time and batch queries simultaneously.\n\nThe latest release introduces new features aimed at transforming data lakehouses into what the project community considers a fully-fledged \"Data Lakehouse Management System\" (DLMS). Vinoth Chandar, creator of the Hudi Project at Uber and CEO at Onehouse, writes:\n\nHudi shines by providing a high-performance open table format as well as a comprehensive open-source software stack that can ingest, store, optimize and effectively self-manage a data lakehouse. This distinction between open formats and open software is often lost in translation inside the large vendor ecosystem in which Hudi operates. Still, it has been and remains a key consideration for Hudi\u2019s users to avoid compute-lockin to any given data vendor.\n\nReleased under an Apache License 2.0, Hudi 1.0 introduces a new secondary indexing system designed to enhance query performance and reduce data scanning costs. Users can now create SQL-based indexes on secondary columns, significantly speeding up query execution. The release also includes expression-based indexing, similar to a feature in PostgreSQL, which replaces traditional partitioning strategies to enable more flexible and efficient data organization. When the preview was announced last year, Boris Litvak, principal software engineer at Snyk, wrote:\n\nAmong the big 3 ACID storage formats on Object Storage, Apache Hudi 1.0 (beta) is the first one introducing \"functional indexes\" over the data. We usually call it \"secondary indexes\" in SQL DB jargon. When will Delta.io and Apache Iceberg follow?\n\nSource: Apache Hudi Blog\n\nThe release introduces support for partial updates, which improves storage and compute efficiency by allowing updates to specific fields instead of entire rows. Additionally, non-blocking concurrency control enables multiple streaming jobs to write to the same dataset without causing bottlenecks or failures. Discussing the database architecture, Chandar adds:\n\nRegarding full-fledged DLMS functionality, the closest experience Hudi 1.0 offers is through Apache Spark. Users can deploy a Spark server (or Spark Connect) with Hudi 1.0 installed, submit SQL/jobs, orchestrate table services via SQL commands, and enjoy new secondary index functionality to speed up queries like a DBMS.\n\nHudi 1.0 introduces enhancements to the storage engine, including the adoption of a log-structured merge (LSM) tree for efficient timeline management. This supports long-term data retention and ensures high-performance query planning, even for datasets containing billions of records. Bhavani Sudha Saktheeswaran, software engineer at Onehouse and Apache Hudi PMC, comments:\n\nWhether you're building an open data platform, streaming into the data lakehouse, moving away from data warehouses, or optimizing for high-performance queries, Hudi 1.0.0 makes it easier than ever to work with lakehouses.\n\nSaktheeswaran and Saketh Chintapalli, software engineer at Uber, presented a session on incremental data processing with Apache Hudi at QCon San Francisco. The session recording is available on InfoQ."

            "article_content": "The retail industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, thanks to the transformative power of machine learning. A recent article by Akhilesh Kota sheds light on how machine learning is revolutionizing the dynamic pricing landscape, enabling retailers to make more informed and adaptive decisions. The insights delve into the nuances of this innovative approach, emphasizing its role in reshaping consumer experiences and business profitability.\n\nUnderstanding Dynamic Pricing\n\nDynamic pricing is a strategy that adjusts prices in real-time, responding to fluctuations in demand, competition, and external factors. Unlike traditional static pricing, it uses advanced algorithms to analyze and react to market conditions with accuracy and speed. When combined with machine learning, dynamic pricing becomes even more powerful. Machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and refine pricing strategies based on actionable insights. This enables businesses to stay competitive, meet customer expectations, and maximize revenue. By ensuring prices are neither excessively high nor unsustainably low, dynamic pricing balances profitability with customer satisfaction, driving sustainable business growth.\n\nMachine Learning: The Game Changer\n\nThe application of machine learning in dynamic pricing brings unprecedented sophistication to pricing strategies, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Machine learning algorithms excel in several key areas:\n\nAnalyzing Market Trends: These systems detect subtle shifts in consumer preferences, competitor pricing, and market conditions, enabling proactive and informed pricing adjustments.\n\nPredicting Demand: By forecasting demand patterns for specific products and timeframes, businesses can optimize inventory levels, avoid stockouts, and maximize revenue opportunities.\n\nEnhancing Personalization: Tailored pricing strategies based on individual customer profiles, preferences, and purchase history create a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.\n\nBy automating complex analytical processes, machine learning not only reduces human error but also enables faster, more accurate responses to dynamic market conditions, empowering businesses to stay competitive.\n\nData as the Backbone\n\nThe success of machine learning in dynamic pricing hinges on the quality and diversity of data inputs.

In the film, Israelis described what it was like to experience the deadliest day for Jews since World War II as the Oct. 7 attacks unfolded, with around 1,200 people killed, 5,000 injured and 251 taken hostage. And in Gaza, where more than 40,000 people have reportedly been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliation against Hamas, Palestinians described \u2014 and recorded \u2014 the horrors of large-scale devastation.\n\nAs outrage over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza deeply divided American campuses and in some places devolved into hate-filled rhetoric and arrests, this June 2024 documentary with Retro Report investigated how universities responded, how powerful interests joined the fray, and how the conflict over the conflict ultimately spiraled out of control.\n\nThis documentary, updated in May 2024, offered a sweeping examination of the critical moments over the course of the past three decades leading up to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the role of a central player: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn this January 2024 documentary, correspondent Ramita Navai investigated rising support for militant groups, including Hamas, since the Oct. 7 attack, Israel\u2019s military campaign in the West Bank, and the implications for a region on edge.\n\nThis December 2023 documentary with The Washington Post examined how Hamas was able to breach Israel\u2019s vaunted security barrier and carry out the attack that ignited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nRe-released in October 2023, this seminal 2002 documentary examined how the Israeli-Palestinian peace process begun at Oslo in the 1990s was derailed and ultimately undone by the dynamics of politics and violence. The documentary included interviews with key figures from both sides of the negotiating table, including Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Saeb Erekat and Ehud Barak.\n\nExplore more from FRONTLINE on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

            "article_content": "The inauguration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last Friday ushers in a new chapter for Venezuela, marked by deep socioeconomic wounds. The ongoing financial crisis \u2014 arguably the population\u2019s greatest source of discontent \u2014 persists despite a modest reactivation of consumption. Crisis and political conflict remain intertwined, and after a decade of catastrophic governance and escalating tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, the Maduro government now faces an especially turbulent period.\n\nThe evidence of electoral fraud, which Maduro has been unable to convincingly refute, have heightened international pressure. Both the United States and the European Union have stepped up sanctions, and Maduro is bracing for a new wave of isolation. As in the past, this isolation is likely to exacerbate the nation\u2019s economic struggles.\n\nThe start of Maduro\u2019s new mandate follows three years of moderate economic recovery, a relative improvement considering the depths from which Venezuela has emerged. This recovery was preceded by a historic economic contraction that drastically altered the nation\u2019s landscape over the past decade. Amid this unprecedented economic crisis \u2014 exacerbated by the political isolation of Chavismo \u2014 in 2020, the Maduro government began to distance itself from the statist orthodoxy outlined in the Plan de la Patria, its flagship economic program. Instead, it adopted a series of market-oriented reforms in an effort to stabilize the economy.\n\nThe partial dollarization of the monetary system, the introduction of new exchange and fiscal policies, a more business-friendly stance, and a shift in the treatment of international capital have led to a reduction in year-on-year inflation, a recovery in purchasing power, and some improvement in trade. However, the damage to Venezuela\u2019s productive and social fabric had already been done. The socioeconomic collapse experienced between 2014 and 2020, during Maduro\u2019s presidency, delivered a devastating blow to the nation\u2019s economic framework. This trauma has left many Venezuelans struggling to fully recover from its far-reaching effects.\n\nDuring the years of strict economic controls, company takeovers, conflicts with capital, and excessive bureaucratization, Venezuela\u2019s economy contracted by more than 80%. The local industrial sector was decimated, and now operates at just 30% of its capacity. Thousands of businesses went bankrupt. A wave of nationalizations severely undermined the country\u2019s ability to respond to economic challenges. Hyperinflation, which peaked at an astronomical 9,500% in 2019, wreaked havoc on the economy, devastating the financial stability of millions. Meanwhile, the oil industry, once the backbone of Venezuela\u2019s economy, collapsed under the weight of a fixed exchange rate policy and pervasive corruption in the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Income poverty doubled, and now affects an estimated 80% of the population, according to the Venezuelan Academy of Economic Sciences (ANCE).\n\nAccording to the ANCE, the current level of income poverty in Venezuela is 2.6 times higher than the Latin American average. Income distribution is also among the most unequal in the region, with the wealthiest 10% controlling 37% of the nation\u2019s income.\n\nThe crisis of the past decade left profound scars: wages were decimated, prices soared, shortages of essential goods became widespread, and public services deteriorated dramatically. This collapse triggered a mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans, many of whom fled the country on foot, seeking refuge across South America.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of Venezuela, under Maduro\u2019s control, stopped publishing monthly economic data. Media censorship also worsened. The ruling party\u2019s popularity, which began to decline in 2014, has not recovered since. In 2019 and 2020, the national economy displayed metrics comparable to those of a war-torn nation, with GDP contracting by a staggering 30 percentage points, according to estimates from private consulting firms.\n\nThe popular social assistance programs created by the Chavista government \u2014 such as the Barrio Adentro preventive health initiative, the Mi Casa Bien Equipada goods transfer program, Mercal\u2019s cheap food markets, and the Cuban-assisted Comprehensive Diagnostic Centers \u2014 collapsed during the crisis, largely due to widespread corruption among government officials.\n\nThe minimum monthly wage, traditionally around $400, has dropped to just $3. The government provides periodic bonuses every four weeks, but without retroactive benefits, these only raise the effective minimum wage to $150 per month.\n\nInternational sanctions, particularly from the United States, were introduced in 2016 in response to the political crisis driven by popular discontent. These sanctions significantly restricted Maduro\u2019s ability to explore alternative trade options or revitalize the oil industry. The global search for new markets, spurred by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, fostered a period of cautious d\u00e9tente between Caracas and Washington, leading to a modest revival in the oil sector. However, with the return of Donald Trump to the White House, it is likely that sanctions on Venezuelan oil will tighten further.\n\nNational revenues, heavily reliant on crude oil extraction, hit a critical low point in the last decade, with production dropping from nearly 3 million barrels per day to just 300,000 in 2019. Today, after significant challenges, production is slowly approaching the 1 million mark again.\n\nSince 2016, for the first time in its history, remittances from emigrants have become a significant source of Venezuelan tax revenues. The exodus of between seven and eight million people, according to United Nations estimates, represents an unprecedented event in recent Latin American history, highlighting the severity of Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and the erosion of its citizens\u2019 political rights. Despite implementing measures like food rationing based on the last digit of each citizen\u2019s identity card, the Maduro government has refused to acknowledge its responsibility for the crisis or the existence of a Venezuelan diaspora.\n\nThe disastrous performance of the Chavista administration triggered a political shift. In December 2015, the Venezuelan opposition achieved a decisive victory in the parliamentary elections, sending shockwaves through Chavismo. In response, Chavismo moved quickly to consolidate control over all state institutions. This led to the absolute concentration of power in the hands of Maduro and a select group of loyalists, while the government implemented social programs aimed at maintaining Chavista support and building networks of loyalty.\n\nMaduro introduced the Carn\u00e9 de la Patria, a document offering access to a range of digital subsidies, though the contributions are now minimal, along with the CLAP food bags, which are part of the Local Supply and Production Committees. While the population continues to accept these initiatives, surveys consistently show a sharp decline in popularity. However, any assistance remains inadequate given the collapse of the country\u2019s productive activity. In the meantime, Venezuelans are facing a period marked by political uncertainty and looming economic instability.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

            "article_content": "Recent data breaches have highlighted the critical need to improve guest Wi-Fi infrastructure security in modern business environments. Organizations face increasing pressure to protect their networks while providing convenient access to visitors, contractors, temporary staff, and employees with BYOD. Implementing secure guest Wi-Fi infrastructure has become essential for authenticating access, protecting data, maintaining compliance across all geographies, and ensuring business continuity.\n\nEvolved security solutions now combine zero-trust architecture with cloud-based captive portals to enhance network protection. These systems enable organizations to implement strict access controls, verify every device's security status, and maintain network separation. Through advanced features like conditional access and device registration, businesses can now offer secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining complete visibility and control over their network resources.\n\nChallenges in Wi-Fi Security Today\n\nDistributed organizations implementing guest Wi-Fi networks face increasingly sophisticated security challenges. The complexity of implementing and managing secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining network integrity has become a critical concern for both IT administrators and Security practitioners.\n\nCommon security vulnerabilities\n\nModern guest Wi-Fi networks face several significant security threats:\n\nLack of Network Micro-Segmentation: Networks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.\n\nNetworks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data. Weak Encryption: Most of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association.\n\nMost of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data.\n\nAttackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data. Inadequate Authentication: Some networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks.\n\nSome networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks. Rogue Access Points (APs): Attackers can set up rogue APs mimicking legitimate Guest Wi-Fi to lure users and steal sensitive information.\n\nIf not properly secured, the Wi-Fi guest networks pose significant security risks. Weak access controls allow unauthorized users to exploit the network, leading to data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. A critical issue is the lack of network segmentation; without proper isolation, attackers on the guest network may access internal systems, risking data breaches.\n\nInsufficient authentication and weak password practices further heighten vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement VLANs, strict authentication, and active monitoring. A well-segmented guest network helps maintain security while offering convenient access to visitors.\n\nWhy is BYOD the most critical category to monitor?\n\nBYOD introduces a mix of unmanaged and potentially insecure devices into the network. These devices often lack corporate-level security controls and might already be compromised with malware, creating a direct entry point for attackers once connected to the network.\n\nIf the attacker has access to the network through a BYOD, sensitive corporate data accessed via BYOD devices may increase the likelihood of unintentional or malicious data leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the potential actions that can be implemented to mitigate such issues :\n\nProper Network Segmentation\n\nAsset inventory\n\nEncryption\n\nAuthentication Mechanism (like Captive Portal)\n\nProfiled Security Policies\n\nMonitoring and Threat Detection\n\nZero Trust Approach\n\nPotential consequences for businesses\n\nSecurity breaches in guest Wi-Fi networks can have devastating impacts on organizations. Recent studies indicate that 40% of businesses have experienced information compromise through public Wi-Fi networks. The financial implications are significant, with some companies reporting ransomware payments exceeding $1 million to recover their data.\n\nBeyond immediate financial losses, businesses face:\n\nDamage to brand reputation and customer trust\n\nDisruption of normal business operations\n\nPotential loss of intellectual property\n\nCompromise of internal network resources\n\nLegal and compliance considerations\n\nOrganizations must navigate complex regulatory requirements when implementing guest Wi-Fi management systems. The legal framework includes multiple layers of compliance, they need to warrant the security level for their network while ensuring the confidentiality of the users' data, and they need to cooperate with the authorities when required while complying with limited data retention period obligation. It is even more difficult for international organizations because they need to monitor and stay updated on any regulations' changes in various countries and jurisdictions, operating at international levels creates diverse and even contradictory obligations, for example, the data retention policies are different among countries, in France, it is required to retain data logs for 1 year, but it is 6 years in Italy, while the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires users' data to be deleted after the purposes have been achieved. Some key regulations need to be taken into consideration:\n\nTherefore, businesses must implement proper documentation, monitoring systems, and security controls to maintain compliance with these regulations. Regular security audits and network infrastructure updates are essential to maintaining legal compliance while providing secure guest access.\n\nLeveraging Cloud Captive Portals for Enhanced Security\n\nCloud-based captive portal solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern network security infrastructure. These sophisticated systems provide organizations with centralized control over guest access while maintaining robust security protocols.\n\nHow Cloud Captive Portals Work\n\nCloud-captive portals function as gateway systems that authenticate users before granting network access. The system intercepts initial connection attempts and redirects users to a secure login page. Organizations can implement various authentication methods, including:\n\nSocial login integration\n\nSponsor\n\nDeclarative Email\n\nSMS Authentication\n\nThese solutions operate without additional hardware requirements, making them infrastructure-agnostic and instantly deployable across global locations.\n\nIntegration with Zero Trust frameworks\n\nModern Cloud Captive Portals should align seamlessly with Zero Trust security principles by implementing continuous verification and limited access protocols.\n\nThe integration enables:\n\nDevice Profiling & Authentication\n\nIntegrity\n\nAccess Control\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\nAutomation\n\nTraffic Monitoring & Compliance\n\nRequired security features to deploy a cloud captive portals solution\n\nModern captive portal solutions shall incorporate multiple layers of security protection. Innovative solutions now integrate with leading security solutions, enabling administrators to implement granular access controls and URL filtering.\n\nCloudi-Fi platform supports comprehensive compliance requirements through regional data center deployment, ensuring adherence to local privacy regulations. Automated encryption of personal data and transparent collection processes provide users and administrators complete control over information handling.\n\nAdvanced features include integration with cloud-based security platforms, enabling:\n\nCloud firewall implementation\n\nContent filtering capabilities\n\nBandwidth Control\n\nAutomated device onboarding\n\nThese capabilities offer a robust security framework that protects both the organization's network and user data while maintaining seamless access for authorized users.\n\nBenefits of a Zero Trust Captive Portal Solution\n\nThe implementation of Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift in securing guest Wi-Fi networks, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more comprehensive verification model. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations manage and secure guest network access.\n\nZero Trust Cloud Captive Portal solutions provide a scalable, centralized access control layer across multiple sites or large office campuses. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, they allow seamless deployment without needing extensive on-prem hardware, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and secure, device-specific access. The cloud-based platform dynamically scales to handle high volumes of traffic and multiple entry points, while continuously monitoring user behaviors. This architecture not only simplifies management but also enhances security, as threats are isolated, and access is tightly controlled based on identity, device, and risk assessment, all through a unified, cloud-driven approach.\n\nAdapting Zero Trust principles for guest access\n\nOrganizations must carefully adapt Zero Trust principles to maintain security while ensuring a seamless guest experience. The implementation requires a balanced approach that considers security requirements and user convenience. Key adaptation strategies include:\n\nRole-based permissions for the access control\n\nSponsoring, social login with MFA, mail address, \u2026 for user authentication\n\nSegmentation for network isolation\n\nTime-limited access tokens for session management\n\nBenefits of traditional security models\n\nZero Trust Architecture offers significant advantages compared to conventional security approaches. The model eliminates the inherent vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security by implementing continuous verification and granular access controls.\n\nThe transformation from traditional to zero-trust security brings multiple operational improvements:\n\nEnhanced Security Posture Elimination of lateral movement threats\n\nReal-time threat detection and response\n\nComprehensive audit trails Operational Efficiency Automated device onboarding\n\nCentralized policy management\n\nSimplified compliance reporting\n\nThe architecture's ability to maintain strict security controls while supporting dynamic access requirements makes it particularly effective for guest Wi-Fi environments. By implementing least-privilege access principles, organizations can ensure that guests receive only the necessary network resources while maintaining complete visibility and control over all network activities.\n\nIntegrating Zero Trust principles with cloud-based management platforms enables distributed organizations to effortlessly scale their guest Wi-Fi security efficiently. This combination offers network and security administrators powerful tools for monitoring network usage, enforcing security policies, and responding to potential threats in real time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transformation of guest Wi-Fi security through cloud-captive portals and Zero Trust Architecture marks a significant advancement in corporate network protection. Modern organizations require robust security solutions that extend beyond traditional perimeter defenses. The combination of continuous verification, granular access controls, and advanced monitoring capabilities creates a comprehensive security framework that addresses current and emerging threats while maintaining operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness leaders must recognize the critical role of secure guest Wi-Fi in maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data.

They built custom generative AI applications on their cloud provider using OpenAI\u2019s APIs for broader analysis, providing access to their LLMs (large language models) and ChatGPT to get more strategic and valuable answers to their business questions. The process was costly and complex, and it delivered suboptimal results. That all changed when they adopted federated learning.\n\nThe strategy of federation in AI deployments\n\nFederated learning is emerging as a game-changing approach for enterprises looking to leverage the power of LLMs while maintaining data privacy and security. Rather than moving sensitive data to LLM providers or building isolated small language models (SLMs), federated learning enables organizations to train LLMs using their private data where it resides. Everyone who worries about moving private enterprise data to a public space, such as uploading it to an LLM, can continue to have \u201cprivate data.\u201d Private data may exist on a public cloud provider or in your data center.\n\nThe real power of federation comes from the tight integration between private enterprise data and sophisticated LLM capabilities. This integration allows companies to leverage their proprietary information and broader knowledge in models like GPT-4 or Google Gemini without compromising security. More importantly, it means not having to deal with moving petabytes of data to a public cloud that\u2019s also hosting an LLM."

When it is done, it will be opened to the public to explore.\n\nTwo skeletons were also found in the house, with analysis of the pair revealing the shocking events following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, as one of them, a woman, was holding onto jewellery and coins.\n\nTrying to protect themselves in a small room, they were brutally killed as a mix of superheated volcanic gas and ash, also called a pyroclastic flow, made its way through Pompeii.\n\nDespite all the discoveries made, a third of the city still lies underneath the volcanic debris, though this new excavation, the most extensive in years, has provided more information about Roman life.\n\nThe archaeologists have been followed by a BBC documentary team for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig, which is available to watch on BBC iPlayer."

Alongside that were children's toys made of clay, cartonnage (a material used to make funerary masks and coffins) as well as funerary masks that covered mummies.\n\nThere were also winged scarabs, beads and funerary amulets.\n\nAdvert\n\nMore basic offerings were also present, including a pottery table used for bread, wine and meat. Archery bows were also present in the tomb.\n\nZahi Hawass (Mohamed Elshahed/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Hawass himself, he said the find could 'reconstruct history' as it has been told.\n\nThe hope is that it will now provide a fuller picture of the lives people had, as well as the culture they were a part of, in Ancient Egypt.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe ancient city of Luxor is famous for housing the Valley of the Kings, included the world famous King Tutankhamun's tomb, discovered in 1922.\n\nEgypt is full of surprises (Mohamed Elshahed/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSituated 340 miles from the Pyramids of Giza, it is known as the 'world's greatest open-air museum'.\n\nThe recent find is different to, say, Tutankhamun, who was buried in a constructed tomb. This week's revelation showed burial chambers carved in to rock to create tombs in the environment that surrounded Ancient Egyptians."

            "article_content": "Astronaut James Irwin salutes in front of the landing module of the Apollo 15 on the moon in 1971.\n\nThe internet is absolutely full of myths and urban legends about space and just about everything else, so readers must be a skeptical these days.\n\nFrom claims of aliens crashing on Earth and UFOs being hidden on military bases, to Mars being abnormally large and the moon turning green, space tends to attract some outlandish or at least highly unproven claims that should be vetted carefully.\n\nHere are some of the biggest space myths and conspiracy theories that just won't go away.\n\n1. The Apollo moon landings were fake\n\nNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin assemble the American flag on the moon during their Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969. NASA astronauts on the International Space Station marked the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch with a video message on July 16. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nTwelve NASA astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, but in the decades since Apollo 11 astronauts first set foot on the moon, many theories have been put forward claiming that the whole Apollo program was staged. However, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has since released photos of the landing sites as they appear on the lunar surface many years later.\n\nSome of the questions moon landing deniers ask are \"Why are there no stars in the sky in the moonwalkers' photos? Why are the U.S. flags fluttering on the surface? Why do you see footprints in the pictures, but no marks from the lunar modules that landed there?\"\n\nIt turns out those questions are easy to answer than you may think.\n\nThere are no stars in the sky for the same reason you don't see stars during the day on Earth, according to NASA: The bright glow of daylight on the surface washes them out.\n\nU.S. flags planted into the lunar soil had metal rods sewn in them to appear as though they were moving, according to NASA. Without these wires, the flag would have hung straight down, making for a pretty lackluster photo prop.\n\nAnd the lunar modules, though heavier, didn't put prominent marks in the surface in some places because their mass was more evenly distributed than the astronauts' weight was in their boots.\n\n2. NASA is a lie\n\nNASA's Artemis 1 moon rocket arrives at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building on Sept. 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA's Kennedy Space Center)\n\nSome people actually believe NASA's whole function is not to explore space, but to generate space-related hoaxes. (The Apollo moon landing is a famous example that we'll explore in the next slide.) People who believe this conspiracy, sometimes flagged with the hashtag \"#NASAhoax\" on social media, will say that amazing space pictures of Mars, Pluto and even Earth are fake, computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nNASA was formed in 1958 \"to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes,\" according to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law shortly after the start of the space race against the Soviet Union.\n\nSince then, NASA has launched hundreds of satellites into orbit around Earth, the moon and several other worlds. In fact, NASA spacecraft have orbited, flown by or landed on every planet in the solar system. NASA also sends astronauts into orbit, where they conduct research at the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n\n\nIf you're not convinced, you are free to travel to Florida's Space Coast to watch a rocket launch for yourself. It's also quite easy to see the space station and other satellites with your own eyes with the help of a satellite tracker.\n\n3. The Earth is flat\n\nEarth as seen from space (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThis myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space \u2014 which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.\n\n\n\nOne way of demonstrating to yourself that the Earth is round is to consider how orbits of satellites work. Satellites constantly \"fall\" around the Earth as they are pulled around by our planet's gravity; they just need to be traveling fast enough at a high enough altitude to not slam into the atmosphere. Or, you can look at the amazing pictures taken by astronauts at the ISS.\n\n4. Planet Nine will kill us\n\nArtist's illustration of the hypothetical Planet Nine, which may lie undiscovered in the outer solar system. (Image credit: Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nIn April 2016, the New York Post tweeted, \"A newly discovered planet could destroy Earth as soon as this month.\" The newspaper was referring to Planet Nine, a theoretical planet at the edge of the solar system. An accompanying video also claimed that the new planet would be throwing all sorts of asteroids and comets at Earth, which would supposedly end up pummeling our planet.\n\n\n\nAlthough the existence of a ninth planet has not been confirmed, astronomers are actively looking for one to help explain motions of some objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects beyond Neptune. If the planet is actually found, the planet will pose no threat to us, according to the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown (who is one of the original backers of the Planet Nine theory).\n\n5. Alien research is happening at Area 51\n\nArea 51's restricted area covers over 90,000 acres (36,000 hectares) . (Image credit: Roger Holden via Getty Images)\n\nThe 1996 movie \"Independence Day\" is one of the main sources of the Area 51 hoax, which claims that aliens and their technology \u2014 recovered from crashed flying saucers \u2014 are being studied secretly at a classified military base about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. Some people in the area around the base claim that they have seen strange lights or objects flying in or out of this area.\n\n\n\nWhile the testing and development conducted at Area 51 is classified, the U.S. government has acknowledged its existence (although the CIA officially calls it \"Homey Airport\" or \"Groom Lake\").\n\nA part of Edwards Air Force Base, the area was a known location for high-technology airplane flights in the 1960s and 1970s. It first served as a proving ground for Lockheed U-2 and A-12 OXCART spy planes as early as 1955. UFO sightings reported in the area were indeed unidentified objects, but only because the planes were top-secret \u2014 not because they were flown by aliens.\n\n6. There is a killer planet known as \"Nibiru\"\n\nArtist's conception of the fictional rogue planet Nibiru, or Planet X. Nibiru does not exist, so don't be fooled. (Image credit: gilderm | sxc.hu)\n\nConspiracy theorists say another dangerous planet is Nibiru, which was first mentioned in the 1976 book \"The Twelfth Planet,\" by Zecharia Sitchin. In the book, Sitchin translated ancient Sumerian cuneiform and claimed that the text is proof of a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru that orbits the sun every 3,600 years.\n\n\n\nYears later, self-proclaimed psychic Nancy Lieder claimed to have communicated with extraterrestrials who said Nibiru would collide with Earth in 2003. When that didn't happen, the date was moved to 2012 (and linked, of course, with the 2012 doomsday predictions). Of course, the collision never occurred, the world didn't end in 2012 and no astronomer has ever found a planet on a collision course with Earth.\n\n7. There is a face on Mars\n\nThe original 'Face on Mars' image taken by NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, in grey scale, on July, 25 1976. Image shows a remnant massif located in the Cydonia region. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took a picture of what appeared to be a face on Mars. Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.\n\n\n\nNASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.\n\n8. The moon Iapetus is an alien Death Star\n\nSaturn's moon Iapetus. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIapetus is a moon of Saturn that looks somewhat like the infamous Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with a large crater that resembles the fictional weapon's superlaser focus lens. The Death Star is a planet-killing machine that destroys entire worlds with its outrageously powerful laser. It was prominently featured in the 2016 movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" as well as in 1977's \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\"\n\n\n\nA Daily Mail article published in May 2016 claimed Iapetus is an artificial object crafted by aliens. As \"evidence,\" the article cited a photo taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. In the photo, there's a line around the moon's equator that resembles the equatorial trench around the Death Star.\n\nBut this line isn't nearly as interesting as the Death Star's trench, which houses the battle station's engines, thrusters and docking bays. That line is nothing more than a mountain ridge, and Iapetus is actually just made up of boring old rock and ice. Cassini has flown by the moon to take pictures several times without being blasted by deadly alien lasers.\n\nSaturn's moon Mimas, with it's giant crater Herschel, also looks surprisingly like the Death Star.\n\n9. Saturn's hexagon is alien technology\n\nThis movie, made from images obtained by Cassini's imaging cameras, is the first to show Saturn's hexagon in color filters and the first movie to show a complete view from the north pole down to about 70 degrees north latitude. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/Hampton University)\n\nSaturn's hexagon was first spotted when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by the giant, ringed planet in 1980. The bizarre, six-sided structure on the round planet's north pole caused quite the stir, because straight lines and polygons are not so common in nature.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the Voyager returned its first images of Saturn's strange feature, even stranger theories arose to explain it, including that it was somehow related to alien technology, or perhaps even was a gateway to hell. The hexagon is not artificial, but rather a weird-looking hurricane at Saturn's pole.\n\nNASA has done several flybys of this region with the Cassini spacecraft, studying the haze particles and other features of the storm, to try to learn more about its unusual properties.\n\n10. Mars is as big as the moon\n\nThe solar system to scale. The diameter of Jupiter (middle, with red spot) is about 11 times that of Earth (third planet from the left). Mars is the second-smallest planet in the solar system (fourth planet from left). (Image credit: Lunar and Planetary Institute)\n\nOriginating in 2003, the infamous Mars hoax asserts that Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in the 60,000 years prior, and that the planet will appear as large as the full moon. What started out as a misconstrued email turned into a recurring rumor that gets reshared every August and, naturally, has spread to social media as it became more popular.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mars is indeed relatively close to Earth in a cosmic sense, it will never be as large as the full moon. It will appear as a red dot in the sky, just as the ancient astronomers saw it. If you'd like to see Mars magnified, take out a telescope or look at one of NASA's spectacular Mars pictures."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them.

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "HANOI: On Sept 2, 2024, Vietnam\u2019s National Day, a month after being elected General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), To Lam stated that Vietnam would boldly step into a new era, with unwavering determination and a commitment to making greater contributions to maintaining peace, stability and sustainable development.\n\nThat statement underscored the nation\u2019s resolve to achieve its development goals, marking a historic turning point and opening a new chapter of progress for the country. The message resonated widely, gaining support from the Vietnamese people and drawing international attention.\n\nVietnam aims to transform into a modern, industrialised, upper-middle-income country by 2030, with the ultimate goal of achieving high-income status by 2045. The 14th National Congress of the CPV slated to open in January 2026 is set to provide the foundation for this ambitious new era, reflecting the country\u2019s determination to elevate its global standing and national prosperity.\n\nGeneral Secretary Lam has outlined seven strategic priorities to guide Vietnam towards these goals. Central to this vision is innovating the Party\u2019s leadership methods to ensure governance remains effective and forward-thinking. Strengthening Party-building efforts and refining the rule of law are also pivotal to fostering a stable and just society.\n\nStreamlining organisational structures is crucial for enhancing efficiency and effectiveness across all sectors. Driving digital transformation and technological development will further accelerate progress and modernisation. Efforts to combat waste and resource mismanagement are equally critical, ensuring sustainability and accountability.\n\nEqually significant is reforming personnel policies and improving human resource management to build a skilled and dynamic workforce capable of meeting the demands of the new era. Finally, implementing robust economic strategies will help Vietnam avoid the middle-income trap, setting the stage for sustained and inclusive growth.\n\nBridging vision and action\n\nAs Vietnam embarks on its journey into a new era of development, expert perspectives highlight the profound significance of the nation\u2019s vision and strategic direction under General Secretary Lam\u2019s leadership. These insights underscore the collective determination to achieve ambitious goals while addressing the challenges of modernisation and innovation.\n\nNguyen Van Dang, PhD, of the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics explained why the term \u201cthe era of the nation's rise\u201d and the associated political determination have been so enthusiastically received by the public.\n\n\"It is because we have proactively identified a clear timeframe for future achievements, reflecting the Party and State leadership's resolute commitment to significant socioeconomic transformations. Over 40 years of reforms, Vietnam has made substantial strides in economics, politics, society, foreign relations, and international trade.\n\n\"These achievements have fostered a collective mindset of urgency and aspiration among the Vietnamese people to elevate the nation to new heights. The public warmly welcomes General Secretary Lam\u2019s vision and determination to transform Vietnam into a high-income developed nation by the mid-21st century, aspiring to join the ranks of the world's leading countries,\" Dang said.\n\nDr Tran Dinh Thien, an economist, former director of the Vietnam Institute of Economics, said: \"This new era is defined by extraordinary goals\u2014achieving digital transformation, intelligence-driven development, and green growth, which are among humanity's highest aspirations.\n\n\u201cThese ambitious targets demand a truly exceptional era of action.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Professor Vu Minh Khuong at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore praised General Secretary Lam\u2019s message as both strategic and groundbreaking.\n\n\"Its strategic aspect lies in the courageous decision to propel the nation forward to an unprecedented level in the coming years. Clearly, the choices we make today will determine where we stand tomorrow.\n\n\"Leadership decisions are critical\u2014they will decide whether a nation rises or falls, how fast it rises, and how far it progresses. Poor decisions lead to decline, often rapid and far-reaching. This truth is evident in the lessons of human history as well as in our recent realities,\" Khuong said.\n\nKhuong highlighted three remarkable attributes of the message\u2019s groundbreaking nature: firstly, its ability to resonate deeply with human emotions, stirring a collective national spirit; secondly, its alignment with the trends of the modern era; and thirdly, its emphasis on institutional choice, which creates a synergy of internal strength\u2014a self-reinforcing power that grows stronger with every step forward.\n\n\"General Secretary To Lam\u2019s message is exceptionally clear. Its distinctiveness lies not only in its content but also in the actions that follow. As a Vietnamese living abroad, I feel an immense sense of pride and renewed faith in our nation\u2019s future,\" Kh\u01b0\u01a1ng said.\n\nAccording to Carl Thayer, an expert in Southeast Asian security and diplomacy, Vietnam holds numerous advantages to forge ahead with determination.\n\n\u201cVietnam\u2019s advantages are manifold. It has a large population base, a global diaspora, untapped abundant natural resources, a strategic location in the heart of an economically vibrant region adjacent to global shipping lanes, a culture that prizes education, political stability, a substantial network of strategic partners, leadership with a long-term vision and determination to innovate, and growing prestige and influence in the international community,\u201d he noted.\n\nHowever, challenges remain on the horizon.\n\n\u201cVietnam must successfully implement an institutional revolution and streamline its political system to attract increased foreign investment, which is critical to propelling the country into the digital age. This will demand significant efforts to develop human resources. Additionally, Vietnam must prepare to mitigate the adverse effects of a potential US-China trade war, which could be exacerbated by Donald Trump\u2019s threat to raise tariffs on Chinese exports to the US or impose punitive tariffs on Vietnam,\u201d he explained.\n\nInstitutional reform: The core of development\n\nThayer\u2019s assessment aligns with the views of General Secretary Lam, who has identified institutional reform as the most pressing priority for Vietnam's development. Speaking at a national conference in December 2024, General Secretary Lam described the restructuring of Vietnam's political system as a \u201crevolution\u201d in governance. This ambitious overhaul involves merging redundant agencies, reallocating responsibilities, and improving operational efficiency to enhance the effectiveness of state apparatus and governance.\n\nBy streamlining Party, State, and socio-political organisations, Vietnam aims to eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies and foster innovation.\n\n\u201cThis restructuring is essential for the nation\u2019s rising era,\u201d said Gen Sec Lam. \u201cWe must act with decisiveness and urgency.\u201d\n\nWithin just a few months of 2024, the groundwork for this systemic overhaul has been laid and implementation has commenced.\n\nTaking August 3, 2024 as a starting point\u2014when Lam was elected as General Secretary of the CPV Central Committee\u2014it took just over a month for him to first address the initiative during the closing remarks of the 10th Plenum of the 13th Central Committee on 20 September. He stated: \"We will continue to focus on building and streamlining the organisational structure of the Party, the National Assembly, the Government, the Motherland Front, and socio-political organisations to operate effectively and efficiently. Among these, the organisational apparatus of the Party must become the nucleus of intellectual leadership, serving as the 'general staff' and the vanguard leading the State agencies.\"\n\nBy 5 November, in an article titled \"Streamlined, Strong, Efficient, and Effective\", General Secretary L\u00e2m explored in depth the inefficiencies within Vietnam's political system. For the first time, he characterised the restructuring initiative as a \"revolution\", stating: \"The confluence of strategic opportunities after 40 years of reform presents a historic chance for the nation to enter an era of development and the rising era of the Vietnamese nation. This also necessitates an urgent and decisive revolution to build a truly streamlined, effective, and efficient political system that meets the demands of the new revolutionary phase.\"\n\nThis sentiment was reinforced in his closing speech at the 13th Central Committee\u2019s plenum on 25 November, where he reiterated the utmost political determination: \"Implementing the Central Committee\u2019s directives on reviewing Resolution 18 of the Central Committee and optimising the organisational apparatus of the political system is of paramount importance. This is a revolutionary endeavour to streamline the organisational structure of our political system for effective and efficient operation.\"\n\nWhat distinguishes this restructuring revolution is its decisiveness. The Central Committee\u2019s plan leaves no institution untouched. From smaller entities such as organisational magazines to major bodies like ministries, National Assembly committees, and government agencies, all are under review for potential reorganisation. Specific proposals include reducing the number of government ministries by five and eliminating two subordinate agencies, while the National Assembly will see four of its committees merged or restructured.\n\nAlthough the precise figures for staffing reductions and cost savings have yet to be calculated, the expected savings are anticipated to be substantial. More importantly, this reorganisation seeks to enhance the operational efficiency of Vietnam's entire political system. By unblocking critical bottlenecks that have hindered national development, it aims to catalyse the momentum of the rising era.\n\nDigital transformation and technological innovation\n\nDigital transformation and technological innovation lie at the heart of Vietnam's strategy for its emerging era. On 22 December 2024, the Politburo issued Resolution 57, marking a significant milestone in the development of science and technology, innovation, and national digital transformation.\n\nResolution 57 sets an ambitious target for Vietnam to rank among the top three Southeast Asian nations in AI research, digital competitiveness, and e-government by 2030. It provides a detailed roadmap for enhancing labour productivity and embedding innovation within the country's socio-economic framework.\n\nThe resolution tackles key policy and regulatory challenges in the science and technology sector by introducing a progressive approach that prioritises effective governance while encouraging innovation. It represents a clear shift from the previous restrictive mindset that favoured prohibition over control.\n\nThis resolution authorises the Politburo to pilot new initiatives, even those that involve risks, venture investments, or potential delays in scientific research. It supports research institutions in establishing mechanisms that allow organisations and scientists to commercialise their research findings by starting and managing businesses. Funding for scientific and technological research will be allocated through a fund-based model, supported by dedicated science and technology development funds.\n\nAdditionally, the resolution offers preferential policies that benefit businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), encouraging them to invest in digital transformation, scientific research, and technological innovation. These initiatives are designed to enhance operational efficiency, increase competitiveness, and promote a culture of innovation across all sectors.\n\nFormer Minister of Science and Technology Nguyen Quan said that the implementation of Resolution 57 would significantly enhance Vietnam's scientific and technological capacity, playing a crucial role in the nation's transformation during this dynamic era.\n\nVice Chairman Nguyen Phuong Tuan of the NA\u2019s Committee for Science-Technology and Environment said that Resolution 57 aims to remove all barriers, not just legal ones, that hinder businesses' participation in scientific research, technological development, and innovation. The resolution positions \"people and businesses as central factors, driving forces, and primary resources, with scientists as key facilitators\".\n\nPrior to the adoption of Resolution 57, on 5 December 2024, NVIDIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Planning and Investment to establish two state-of-the-art AI centres in Vietnam: NVIDIA\u2019s third global AI research hub\u2014the Vietnam Research and Development Centre (VRDC)\u2014and an AI Data Centre.\n\nThe Vietnam AI Research and Development Centre (VRDC) and the AI Data Centre will serve as key platforms for NVIDIA and its domestic partners to advance the research, development, and deployment of cutting-edge AI technologies. These centres are expected to play a crucial role in supporting AI research initiatives, developing AI applications, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, and creating job opportunities for Vietnam's talent pool.\n\nDriving towards high-income status\n\nNguyen Van Dang, PhD, of the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics highlighted Vietnam's remarkable transformation over nearly 40 years of economic reform. The country transitioned from being a low-income nation to joining the ranks of middle-income countries in 2008-2009. With GDP per capita rising from less than US$200 in the 1990s to approximately $4,300 today, this represents a convincing testament to Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s economic progress.\n\nIn international trade, Vietnam has shifted from near-isolation to becoming a proactive global participant. It has signed free trade agreements with nearly 20 countries, engaged with major international organisations, and established comprehensive strategic partnerships with global superpowers. This deep integration underscores Vietnam's proactive and successful engagement with the global economy.\n\nInternational experts are optimistic about Vietnam's socioeconomic outlook for 2025. According to the UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), Vietnam's GDP per capita is expected to reach $4,783, bringing the country closer to achieving upper-middle-income status. This would place Vietnam 124th globally in per capita income, reflecting notable progress in enhancing living standards.\n\nSimilarly, both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) project positive growth for Vietnam in 2025, with GDP growth estimates of 6.5 and 6.6 per cent, respectively, driven by a robust recovery in manufacturing, trade, and fiscal policies.\n\nLooking ahead to 2045, the World Bank\u2019s report \"Vietnam 2045: Trading up in a Changing World \u2013 Pathways to a High-Income Future\" emphasises the need for Vietnam to shift from labour-intensive, low-value manufacturing to high-skill, technology-driven industries. This transformation necessitates investments in technology, workforce skills, and innovation to maintain competitiveness in a changing global trade environment.\n\nRecommendations include reducing non-tariff trade barriers, enhancing education and vocational training for high-tech industries, strengthening connections between domestic firms and global value chains, and ensuring low-carbon, climate-resilient exports.\n\nAndrea Coppola, World Bank Lead Country Economist for Vietnam, acknowledged the country's progress in institutional reform but stressed the need for further adjustments to achieve its high-income ambitions.\n\nCoppola praised Vietnam's consensus-based decision-making system for avoiding hasty decisions but noted its tendency to delay necessary reforms. He called for a shift from a \"prohibition\" mindset to one of \"facilitation\", reducing unnecessary regulations to foster creativity and efficiency. This flexible approach, he argued, would empower civil servants to innovate and improve state efficiency.\n\nCoppola also highlighted the importance of restructuring government operations to address inefficiencies, including duplicative roles and misaligned incentives. He recognised Vietnam's efforts in revising its Public Investment Law as a step forward but recommended additional improvements in budgeting processes and legal frameworks.\n\nWith sustained reforms and strategic investments, Vietnam is well-positioned to achieve its goal of becoming a high-income economy by 2045 while navigating a dynamic global trade landscape. - Vietnam News/ANN"
