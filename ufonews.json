UK\u2019s most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on \u2013 as expert reveals \u2018electromagnetic PLASMA\u2019 theory\n\nTHE UK's most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on - as an expert revealed a new \"electromagnetic plasma\" theory.\n\nMystery lights spotted by SAS troopers in December 1980 could have been down to a \"mass psychosis\" caused by \"electromagnetic plasma\" coming from the earth, they revealed.\n\n3 The mystery lights are believed to be down to a 'mass psychosis'. Pictured, a sculpture now at the site Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The Rendlesham Forest UFO incident information board Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow Credit: Alamy\n\nMany high ranking officers from the US Air Force personnel reported seeing a triangular alien craft in Rendlesham Forest, a remote part of Suffolk.\n\nOne even claimed to have got close enough to touch a \"triangular spacecraft\".\n\nBut despite multiple investigations into the sighting no explanation for the glowing scenes was ever found.\n\nPhilip Mantle, an expert in UFO sightings, has revealed he may know what really happened that night.\n\n\"If you look at what those involved said to begin with, the only concrete info was that they saw strange lights in the forest - that's what we start with,\" he told Metro.\n\nThe plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow.\n\nPhillip said: \"He was concerned this plasma emitted a type of electromagnetic energy, which could interfere with aircraft communications of cause cognitive impairment.\"\n\nBritish UFO expert Albert Budden later showed that the Earth produces electromagnetic forces which can emit light - otherwise called the plasma.\n\nPhillip added: \"Some people can be hypersensitive to these lights - in other words allergic - and can have the most bizarre experience you'll think is absolutely real.\n\n\"It could be these soldiers came into contact with it and all hallucinated.\"\n\nHe also discounted old theories, which suggested SAS troops staged the sighting as revenge on US troops, saying \"pranking\" would not have taken place in the heat of the Cold War.\n\nThe theory was upheld by UFO enthusiast Dr David Clarke who said, \"lights and coloured flares were rigged in the woods and black helium balloons were coupled to remote-controlled kites.\"\n\nBut like Phillip, former Ministry of Defence UFO investigator Nick Pope, told the Sun Online he was sceptical of such claims.\n\nNasa discovers mysterious green spots on Mars that could be signs of ancient alien life Despite its nickname of 'the Red Planet', mysterious green dots have been discovered in the sand on Mars. Nasa's Perseverance rover, which has been navigating Mars for nearly four years, stumbled upon the new mystery in a region called \"Serpentine Rapids\". After scraping away the top layer of regolith in a red rock outcrop named \"Wallace Butte\", the rover uncovered a \"striking\" array of colours within the rock, Nasa wrote. Colours of white, black and even green were discovered. \"One of the biggest surprises for the rover team was the presence of the drab-green-colored spots within the abrasion patch, which are composed of dark-toned cores with fuzzy, light green rims,\" Nasa added. The green patches can also be found on Earth's so-called 'red beds' - areas of sediment where water, carrying iron, has filtered through, and eventually hardens into rock.\n\nHe told the Sun Online: \"It's classic friend-of-a-friend stuff: a ufologist claims he was contacted by a former SAS soldier, who claims he was involved in a prank.\n\n\"Frankly, there's no evidence such a prank even occurred, let alone that it played a role in the infamous Rendlesham Forest incident.\n\n\"Having undertaken a cold case review of this incident for the MoD, I can confirm that the events in Rendlesham Forest 40 years ago remain unexplained.\n\nThe US airman Jim Penniston's claim that he touched the aircraft is also dubious, according Philip, who said his account changed over time.\n\nHe said: \"Jim underwent hypnosis a few years back and said the craft was a machine from the futures.\"\n\nHe admitted however that the plasma theory could also be an incorrect assumption as UFO researchers all \"suffer confirmation bias\".\n\nHe added: \"But I'm sure Rendlesham's legend will only continue to grow in the years ahead.\""

            "article_content": "Podcasts can be a great way to learn complex subjects, but not everything you're reading has been discussed in an episode. AI audio maker ElevenLabs is solving that with a new feature that reshapes documents you upload into an audio show with virtual hosts discussing the subject matter. The newGenFM feature is part of the ElevenLabs Reader App and will turn any mix of PDFs, articles, and digital books into your own personal podcast episodes.\n\nThe new feature shares many similarities with Google NotebookLM, which uses Google Gemini AI models to turn documents into podcast-style shows where synthetic personalities discuss whatever you've uploaded to each other. As with Google's feature, GenFM analyzes the information you upload and produces a synthetic podcast with two AI co-hosts discussing the material. GenFM even attempts to match the voices to the topic under discussion.\n\nIf you're an auditory learner or need to absorb information while doing other things, GenFM is likely to appeal to you. That said, while GenFM restricts itself to the documents you upload, you'll likely still want to be wary of any accidental hallucinations or misunderstood data. You can see and hear some examples in the demo video below.\n\nAI podcast future\n\nThough GenFM and Google NotebookLM are pursuing the same kind of product, ElevenLabs' AI-generated podcast efforts are a step beyond Google's. NotebookLM is currently limited to the web and can only make shows in English. In contrast, GenFM's AI hosts can converse in 32 languages. Still, both tools cater to more diverse ways of learning and lifestyles.\n\nThe potential demand from students alone will likely justify the work behind GenFM. And, unlike some other ways AI composition tools are used in academia, this doesn't raise ethical questions about cheating or plagiarism. They also increase accessibility to those with impaired vision who don't want to hear a long document read out when they could hear a podcast about it. They also democratize access to information, enabling individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties to engage with content more easily.\n\nYou might also like"

            "article_content": "As you scroll through your social media feed or let your favorite music app curate the perfect playlist, it may feel like artificial intelligence is improving your life \u2013 learning your preferences and serving your needs. But lurking behind this convenient facade is a growing concern: algorithmic harms.\n\nThese harms aren\u2019t obvious or immediate. They\u2019re insidious, building over time as AI systems quietly make decisions about your life without you even knowing it. The hidden power of these systems is becoming a significant threat to privacy, equality, autonomy and safety.\n\nAI systems are embedded in nearly every facet of modern life. They suggest what shows and movies you should watch, help employers decide whom they want to hire, and even influence judges to decide who qualifies for a sentence. But what happens when these systems, often seen as neutral, begin making decisions that put certain groups at a disadvantage or, worse, cause real-world harm?\n\nThe often-overlooked consequences of AI applications call for regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with this rapidly evolving technology. I study the intersection of law and technology, and I\u2019ve outlined a legal framework to do just that.\n\nSlow burns\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of algorithmic harms is that their cumulative impact often flies under the radar. These systems typically don\u2019t directly assault your privacy or autonomy in ways you can easily perceive. They gather vast amounts of data about people \u2014 often without their knowledge \u2014 and use this data to shape decisions affecting people\u2019s lives.\n\nSometimes, this results in minor inconveniences, like an advertisement that follows you across websites. But as AI operates without addressing these repetitive harms, they can scale up, leading to significant cumulative damage across diverse groups of people.\n\nConsider the example of social media algorithms. They are ostensibly designed to promote beneficial social interactions. However, behind their seemingly beneficial facade, they silently track users\u2019 clicks and compile profiles of their political beliefs, professional affiliations and personal lives. The data collected is used in systems that make consequential decisions \u2014 whether you are identified as a jaywalking pedestrian, considered for a job or flagged as a risk to commit suicide.\n\nWorse, their addictive design traps teenagers in cycles of overuse, leading to escalating mental health crises, including anxiety, depression and self-harm. By the time you grasp the full scope, it\u2019s too late \u2014 your privacy has been breached, your opportunities shaped by biased algorithms, and the safety of the most vulnerable undermined, all without your knowledge.\n\nThis is what I call \u201cintangible, cumulative harm\u201d: AI systems operate in the background, but their impacts can be devastating and invisible.\n\nWhy regulation lags behind\n\nDespite these mounting dangers, legal frameworks worldwide have struggled to keep up. In the United States, a regulatory approach emphasizing innovation has made it difficult to impose strict standards on how these systems are used across multiple contexts.\n\nCourts and regulatory bodies are accustomed to dealing with concrete harms, like physical injury or economic loss, but algorithmic harms are often more subtle, cumulative and hard to detect. The regulations often fail to address the broader effects that AI systems can have over time.\n\nSocial media algorithms, for example, can gradually erode users\u2019 mental health, but because these harms build slowly, they are difficult to address within the confines of current legal standards.\n\nFour types of algorithmic harm\n\nDrawing on existing AI and data governance scholarship, I have categorized algorithmic harms into four legal areas: privacy, autonomy, equality and safety. Each of these domains is vulnerable to the subtle yet often unchecked power of AI systems.\n\nThe first type of harm is eroding privacy. AI systems collect, process and transfer vast amounts of data, eroding people\u2019s privacy in ways that may not be immediately obvious but have long-term implications. For example, facial recognition systems can track people in public and private spaces, effectively turning mass surveillance into the norm.\n\nThe second type of harm is undermining autonomy. AI systems often subtly undermine your ability to make autonomous decisions by manipulating the information you see. Social media platforms use algorithms to show users content that maximizes a third party\u2019s interests, subtly shaping opinions, decisions and behaviors across millions of users.\n\nThe third type of harm is diminishing equality. AI systems, while designed to be neutral, often inherit the biases present in their data and algorithms. This reinforces societal inequalities over time. In one infamous case, a facial recognition system used by retail stores to detect shoplifters disproportionately misidentified women and people of color.\n\nThe fourth type of harm is impairing safety. AI systems make decisions that affect people\u2019s safety and well-being. When these systems fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. But even when they function as designed, they can still cause harm, such as social media algorithms\u2019 cumulative effects on teenagers\u2019 mental health.\n\nBecause these cumulative harms often arise from AI applications protected by trade secret laws, victims have no way to detect or trace the harm. This creates a gap in accountability. When a biased hiring decision or a wrongful arrest is made due to an algorithm, how does the victim know? Without transparency, it\u2019s nearly impossible to hold companies accountable.\n\nClosing the accountability gap\n\nCategorizing the types of algorithmic harms delineates the legal boundaries of AI regulation and presents possible legal reforms to bridge this accountability gap. Changes I believe would help include mandatory algorithmic impact assessments that require companies to document and address the immediate and cumulative harms of an AI application to privacy, autonomy, equality and safety \u2013 before and after it\u2019s deployed. For instance, firms using facial recognition systems would need to evaluate these systems\u2019 impacts throughout their life cycle.\n\nAnother helpful change would be stronger individual rights around the use of AI systems, allowing people to opt out of harmful practices and making certain AI applications opt in. For example, requiring an opt-in regime for data processing by firms\u2019 use of facial recognition systems and allowing users to opt out at any time.\n\nLastly, I suggest requiring companies to disclose the use of AI technology and its anticipated harms. To illustrate, this may include notifying customers about the use of facial recognition systems and the anticipated harms across the domains outlined in the typology.\n\nAs AI systems become more widely used in critical societal functions \u2013 from health care to education and employment \u2013 the need to regulate harms they can cause becomes more pressing. Without intervention, these invisible harms are likely to continue to accumulate, affecting nearly everyone and disproportionately hitting the most vulnerable.\n\nWith generative AI multiplying and exacerbating AI harms, I believe it\u2019s important for policymakers, courts, technology developers and civil society to recognize the legal harms of AI. This requires not just better laws, but a more thoughtful approach to cutting-edge AI technology \u2013 one that prioritizes civil rights and justice in the face of rapid technological advancement.\n\nThe future of AI holds incredible promise, but without the right legal frameworks, it could also entrench inequality and erode the very civil rights it is, in many cases, designed to enhance.\n\nSylvia Lu, Faculty Fellow and Visiting Assistant Professor of Law, University of Michigan\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "A Settlement Plagued by Misfortune\n\n\n\nThe Dudley Curse: Fact or Folklore?\n\n\n\nModern-Day Mystery\n\n\n\nIn the heart of Connecticut lies a chilling legend\u2014a ghost town so shrouded in mystery that stepping foot there is not only discouraged but outright illegal. Dudleytown, a deserted settlement within the Dark Entry Forest in Cornwall, Connecticut, is infamous for its eerie history, supernatural lore, and a supposed curse that has haunted the land and its settlers.Dudleytown was established in the early 1740s when members of the Dudley family, along with others, settled in the valley. Named after the family, this area initially served as farmland. However, due to the region\u2019s infertile soil and rocky terrain, many residents left by the 19th century in search of better opportunities.The town\u2019s decline wasn\u2019t just about agriculture\u2014it was riddled with peculiar deaths and inexplicable tragedies. Nathaniel Carter, one of the settlers, lost six family members to cholera before relocating to New York, where his remaining family members were tragically killed. Similarly, Gershon Hollister died under mysterious circumstances while building a barn, and his neighbor, William Tanner, was said to be tormented by visions of creatures emerging from the woods at night.General Herman Swift, a Revolutionary War hero, faced personal tragedy when his wife was struck by lightning on their porch. Overcome with grief, he, too, met a tragic end. Stories of mysterious deaths and bizarre occurrences led many to believe the town was cursed.Legend has it that the misfortunes of Dudleytown trace back to a curse on the Dudley family. This curse allegedly began with Edmund Dudley, an English nobleman executed for treason during King Henry VIII\u2019s reign. His descendants, said to be plagued by death and disaster, carried this supposed curse to America. However, historians have found no direct link between Edmund Dudley and the Dudleys of Dudleytown, debunking this aspect of the legend.Despite this, the stories persisted, bolstered by unexplained phenomena reported by residents. Some claimed to see ghostly figures lurking in the forest, while others spoke of \"phantom hands\" touching trespassers who dared to explore the abandoned site.By 1900, Dudleytown was entirely deserted. The last family to live there either vanished or perished, leaving only crumbling cellar holes and stone foundations as remnants of the town. In 1918, Dr. William Clarke purchased the land and attempted to make it a vacation home. However, his wife reported terrifying encounters with creatures in the woods, prompting the couple to abandon the property.Dr. Clarke later helped establish the Dark Entry Forest Association, which aimed to preserve the forest and protect it from further intrusion. Today, the site is private property, and trespassers face legal action.Despite warnings from the Connecticut State Police, thrill-seekers and ghost enthusiasts still attempt to visit Dudleytown, drawn by tales of paranormal activity. Many claim to feel an inexplicable presence, with some reporting being touched by unseen forces. These chilling accounts, combined with the area's dark history, continue to fuel the town\u2019s reputation as one of America\u2019s most haunted locations.Dudleytown remains a compelling tale of tragedy, mystery, and folklore\u2014a ghost town that, for better or worse, refuses to fade into obscurity."

I'm looking on my end and it shows $16,' she said in a TikTok video.\n\nThe revelation came when she learned her friend was not a Prime member.\n\n'He gets a discount on the products. I have to pay additional,' she continued.\n\n'I thought my Amazon Prime membership covered the two-day shipping. But it does not. I find that to be fraudulent.'\n\nThe video, which has more than 100,000 comments, was flooded with people saying they have canceled their Prime for that reason.\n\n'I literally have been debating about canceling my Amazon Prime this is the sign I needed,' one user commented.\n\nWhile another claimed to have canceled theirs while watching the video.\n\nAmazon users are canceling their Prime memberships after discovering shopping on the platform is cheaper without the $139 service\n\nAmazon's website states that 'Prime members get free two-day shipping on millions of items, and free one-day shipping on more than 15 million items,' but some consumers have suggested that the shipping costs are baked into item prices.\n\nOne user commented on the video that shopping without Prime is cheaper because 'when you spend over $25, it's free shipping.'\n\nOther Amazon members shared frustrations about their orders not arriving within the promised two-day delivery.\n\n'Once I realized my purchases did not arrive in the time stated I canceled,' another user shared.\n\nIn the comments of LoveTheLawrences_ video, some suggest the pricing issue could be the next class action lawsuit against Amazon.\n\nAmazon was hit with a class action lawsuit this year that accused the e-commerce giant of failing to meet its stated 'guaranteed' delivery for some purchases.\n\nHowever, a Seattle judge dismissed the case in June citing that the customer had not shown how Amazon's delivery practices would violate Washington's consumer protection law.\n\nThe lawsuit said Amazon met a delivery date for a purchase but missed the four-hour window the consumer picked for their package's arrival.\n\n'It is not unfair or deceptive for Amazon to fail to abide by promises it did not make,' Evanson wrote.\n\nAmazon's website states that 'Prime members get free two-day shipping on millions of items, and free one-day shipping on more than 15 million items,' but some consumers have suggested that the shipping costs are baked into item prices\n\nBut Amazon is still facing legal troubles with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which accused the company of deceptively enrolling millions of online shoppers into the e-commerce giant's Prime service without their consent and making it hard for them to leave.\n\nThe FTC accused Amazon last year of using 'manipulative, coercive or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically renewing Prime subscriptions.'\n\nAmazon has denied any wrongdoing in the lawsuit, which also names three of its senior executives as defendants.\n\n'The three individual defendants, whose lives have been upended by the FTC's baseless and unjust allegations, are particularly eager to see those allegations fail, and any delay further prejudices them,' Amazon said in a\n\nAmazon said in a filing last month opposing the FTC's request to push the trial back to July 2025.\n\nThe lawsuit is among several federal and state government actions challenging Amazon's business practices.\n\nThe FTC last year accused Amazon in an antitrust lawsuit of abusing its market power, in part by curbing the ability of its sellers to offer better prices on other platforms."

            "article_content": "Advertisement Discovery of fossilized footprints reveals the moment two ancient human species crossed paths Share Copy Link Copy\n\nMore than 1.5 million years ago, two different species of ancient humans crossed paths on a lakeshore, perhaps locking eyes with each other. These early forerunners of Homo sapiens wandered in a landscape teeming with wildlife, including giant maribou storks that stood 6.5 feet tall.A stunning discovery of fossilized footprints pressed into soft mud preserved the unexpected and extraordinary moment, suggesting that the two distinct types of hominin were able to live as neighbors sharing a habitat rather than as competitors who kept to their own territory.\"It's surprising that you would have two kinds of similarly sized, large-bodied hominin species on the same landscape,\" said Kevin Hatala, first author of a study on the footprints that published in the journal Science on Thursday.\"We see them in the very same lake margin environment, passing within this area within hours to a couple of days of one another. They probably would have been aware of each other's existence. They saw each other and they might have interacted,\" added Hatala, who is an associate professor of biology at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.The first part of the find occurred in July 2021 during an excavation at Koobi Fora, on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya, where the skeletal remains of several ancient human relatives have been found. That excavation revealed one hominin footprint, alongside several other tracks made by large birds. The team decided to rebury the tracks with fine sand until a detailed excavation was possible.The dig took place in 2022, when Hatala and his colleagues exposed 23 square meters (248 square feet) of sediment, revealing 11 more hominin tracks similar to the first in a line that suggested they were made by the same individual, plus three isolated footprints that were oriented in a perpendicular direction.The researchers also found 94 nonhuman tracks belonging to birds and cow- and horse-like animals. The largest bird track was 27 centimeters (10.6 inches) across and likely belong to a kind of giant stork known as Leptoptilos.\"There's one long trackway with 12 (hominin) footprints in it. It was made at a decent walking pace \u2026 especially since they were walking through mud. There's not a clear destination at the end,\" Hatala said.\"It's hard to say what exactly they were doing, but they walked in that perfect zone of mud,\" he said. \"If you think about the shoreline of a lake or a modern beach, you've got kind of a narrow zone where the mud is perfect for making footprints. If you move too far this way, it's too dry, if you move too far the other way, it's too wet. And they're walking almost like in a straight line through the perfect area for their footprints to be made, which is very lucky for us,\" he said.The three other footprints perpendicular to the trackway were scattered across the site. Hatala thinks they were made by three separate individuals, their other tracks perhaps wiped out by other animals walking around the surface at the same time.Pristinely preservedHatala and his colleagues couldn't directly date the footprints. But Hatala said the fossils were found below \u2014 and therefore were \"slightly older\" than \u2014 a layer of volcanic ash on the same site known as Elomaling'a Tuff, which has been dated to 1.52 million years ago, according to the study.However, the researchers said they are confident that the tracks were imprinted within hours to a few days of one another because there is no cracking on the surface of the footprints, which would be the case if they were exposed to air and dried under the sun for a longer period.Instead, the scientists said the prints were all pristinely preserved in a similar fashion under the accumulating strata of sediment, thanks to fine and silty sand that gently covered the tracks soon after they had formed.\"This was probably a delta system, with lots of shallow, low-energy water in this area and lots of nice muds,\" Hatala said.The term hominin refers to all species in the human family tree that emerged after the split from the ancestors of the great apes 6 million to 7 million years ago. This group includes more recently extinct species such as Neanderthals, which disappeared 40,000 years ago, and Australopithecus afarensis, represented by the famous Lucy skeleton in Ethiopia, which was 3.2 million years old.Homo sapiens, our own species, is the only living type of hominin, making the idea of encountering another species from the same lineage particularly tantalizing to imagine. The researchers found some clues as to which groups of ancient humans crossed paths during this encounter.Who did the footprints belong to?The team concluded that hominins belonging to the species Homo erectus and the smaller-brained Paranthropus boisei made the footprints. P. bosei made the long trackway, while Homo erectus made the other three footprints, the study suggested. The skeletal remains of both species have been found at the site.However, it wasn't immediately obvious that the footprints were made by two different species. Hatala, who is an expert in foot anatomy, determined they reflected different patterns of gait, stance and motion only after detailed 3D imaging and analysis.Through experiments in the field and in the lab, he compared the footprints with those made by living humans, including 59 of the Daasanach people in Ethiopia, who typically don't wear shoes, as well as other fossilized hominin prints and tracks made by chimpanzees.Hatala found that the 12-print trackway was made by an individual whose footprints didn't fall within the range of variation seen in Homo sapiens, unlike the three scattered footprints, which plotted more closely to those made by living humans.\"Homo erectus, from the neck down, they look very similar to modern humans, and within this time period, they are the best candidate for being a direct ancestor of ours. We hypothesize that those more humanlike footprints are more likely Homo erectus just because the rest of their anatomy is so human,\" Hatala said.\"Paranthropus boisei, they look quite different. Most of the fossils that are confidently attributed to them are skulls or teeth. They have very large jaws, very large teeth and large attachments for chewing muscles. It looks like they adapted to eating a very different kind of diet than Homo erectus,\" he said. Hatala explained that Bosei likely ate a plant-based diet, whereas Homo erectus was more of an omnivore.Hatala and his colleagues reviewed old fossil data from the site and found evidence the two species overlapped at the site for a significant period of time \u2014 perhaps over the course of 100,000 years, he said.\"That's exciting to see and to us that implies that direct competition between the two of them must have been relatively low, that they must have been OK with one another living on the same landscape. They weren't driving each other out,\" he said.\"It would have been a risky area, there would have been hippos, crocodiles, other sorts of dangerous animals that were living in those areas, too,\" Hatala added. \"So there must have been some appeal for both of them to go to those areas repeatedly over such a long time.\"The footprints are the first physical proof that different hominin species overlapped in exactly the same time and space, dodging predators and finding food in the ancient landscape, according to the study. Homo erectus went on to thrive for 1 million years more. Paranthropus boisei, however, went extinct within the next few hundred thousand years. Scientists don't know why.Briana Pobiner, a research scientist and museum educator at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's Human Origins Program, said it was \"mind-blowing\" to find footprints of not just one but two species walking in the same area.\"Maybe, they actively competed for the same food; maybe they just eyed each other warily from across a grassy patch. Maybe they ignored each other entirely,\" said Pobiner, who was not involved the new research.While it's the first time that footprints have suggested hominins of two species directly encountered one another, genetic evidence has revealed that Neanderthals interbred with Homo sapiens and Denisovans, a little understood hominin only known from a scant few fossils. Denisova Cave in Siberia was home to a girl who had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father.Maybe, Pobiner said, P. boisei and H. erectus \"were similar enough that they even mated with each other on occasion.\"\"This finding tells us that they lived in the same place, at the same time, and walked around practically next to each other,\" she said.\"It's impossible to go back in time to actually observe these species 1.5 million years ago \u2014 but having both of their footprints on the same surface? That's the next best thing.\""
