            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nA UFO expert, Carl Nally of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), claims the spate of recent mysterious drone sightings could be a precursor to an alien invasion. He also says they will be conducting this invasion using an invasion portal located here on Earth.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Mirror, Nally believes that the unexplained drone sightings that have been proliferating all over the United States and abroad would have been positively identified as drones by the American government if they were, in fact, nothing more than unmanned aircraft. Especially since many of these sightings have occurred near military bases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them, but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nHe believes that one explanation for all of these supposed drones not being properly identified by governments may have to do with the use of portals. A similar theory has also been applied to cryptids like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d Carl Nally continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nOne portal Nally believes exists is located over Athlone, Slane, Boyle, Wicklow, and West Cork in Ireleand.\n\nHe cites research being conducted by a astronomer Dr. Eamonn Ansbro and New Zealand airline pilot Dr. Bruce Cathie as possible evidence that these portals are being used by aliens. \u201c\u201dThey are entering earth at an increasingly rapid pace, and the fact that the entry coincides with sightings over military bases \u2013 that is concerning,\u201d Nally told the Westmeath Independent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge number of reports from people in the Midlands who report seeing orb or tic tac shaped UFOs,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cDr. Ansbro and Dr. Cathie have developed a theory that UFOs operate on tracks which they can enter and exit the Earth from,\u201d Nally explained. \u201cThey have been working on this theory for the past 12 to 15 years. They have been researching sites where UFOs are most often seen. Their mathematical theory is proven to be 92% accurate.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The rising panic over mystery drones swarming the skies of Mid-Atlantic states reminds us that, in the centuries-long hunt to identify UFOs, humans are usually the weakest link. America has real national security challenges in the new era of unmanned aerial vehicles in warfare. But an invasion of mystery drones over New Jersey isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAs it turns out, just as eyewitnesses often bungle the details of, say, a car accident on the corner, we are notoriously unreliable when it comes to identifying and reporting UFOs. A huge percentage of \u201csightings\u201d turn out, upon investigation, to be the planet Venus or other surprisingly bright astronomical phenomena; people on the ground regularly misjudge distances in the sky so that even objects miles away are perceived to be close by.\n\nThe UFO mistaken-identity problem is a big part of the reason that the military and scientists now refer to such sightings more precisely as UAP, or unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 a label meant to capture that many sightings might not be \u201cobjects\u201d at all but are more likely to be known, or as yet unknown, astronomical and atmospheric phenomena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven skilled aviators make mistakes. On Oct. 1, 1948, Lt. George Gorman, a World War II veteran and pilot in the North Dakota Air National Guard, gave chase in his P-51 fighter after spotting the bright light of a UFO race past him in the skies over Fargo. At speeds of over 400 mph, he engaged it in a dogfight for nearly 30 minutes, the ball-shaped UFO bobbing and weaving around him as it executed turns that he felt were aerodynamically impossible. He finally broke off the engagement, never identifying the bogey. \u201cJust when we were about to collide, I guess I got scared,\u201d he told investigators, adding later: \u201cIt is hard to believe your own eyes when something with no wings walks off and leaves you standing still.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later determined that Gorman had been chasing a weather balloon launched about 10 minutes before he spotted it. The balloon had simply been floating along in the night sky, and he\u2019d been diving and racing all around it.\n\nJ. Allen Hynek, the astronomer and godfather of \u201cufology,\u201d who spent a quarter-century working with the Air Force on its UFO studies and coined the phrase \u201cclose encounters of the third kind,\u201d told an interviewer late in his career, \u201cPilots have been known to swerve their planes violently when they suddenly encounter a very bright meteor they think is on a collision course, but which later proves to have been 50 to 100 miles away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people who are serious about studying UAP are trying to get humans out of the reporting loop: At a congressional hearing last summer, Ryan Graves \u2014 a former Navy aviator who had his own experiences encountering UAP and now leads an advocacy organization called Americans for Safe Aerospace \u2014 proposed a more reliable alternative to the grainy, black-and-white (but supposedly revealing) photos that dot the internet: sensors. Similarly, Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb, one of the leading voices in UAP studies, argues that we need to far better understand what a \u201cregular\u201d sky looks like before trying to determine what\u2019s \u201canomalous.\u201d As Loeb told me last year: \u201cTrust in data. People are a waste of time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the self-centered confidence that underlies so many UFO reports, that people\u2019s first instinct upon spotting a bright, moving light in the night sky is not to assume the obvious \u2014 say, a star, meteor, satellite or faraway jetliner \u2014 but instead to imagine that, after an alien craft journeyed thousands of light-years across interstellar space to visit Earth, the aliens would pick that moment on a random Tuesday night to reveal themselves to someone on a dark, rural road or in a suburban backyard. Occam\u2019s razor, the useful medieval theory that argues the simplest explanation is usually the best, would tell you that the sound of hoofbeats more likely means horses than zebras.\n\nPartly, that instinct stems from something fundamental. The question \u201cAre we alone?\u201d is one of the three most basic questions that have fascinated humans since the first caveman campfires, a question that ranks alongside \u201cWhat happens after death?\u201d and \u201cIs there a God?\u201d as the most profound and potentially life-altering mysteries we wrestle with. Who wouldn\u2019t want to knock out an answer to one of the Big Three while taking out the garbage late at night?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, our cultural fascination with UFOs stems from the fact that it is a rare area where we can all gaze upon the deepest frontier of knowledge. As an ordinary person, I can\u2019t add much to the already-advanced scientific and mathematical questions of our time: I\u2019m not liable to crack string theory wide open during a weekend barbecue, nor is my tinkering in the garage likely to deliver to humanity the secret to nuclear fusion."

AI matting uses trained models to find edges, which results in a better outcome due to the model \"understanding\" what shape a given object has.\n\nOnline background remover tools are often slow, reduce the quality of the original image, and result with a white background instead of a transparent background. Then you're back to square one in the editing process needing a new background provided by different design tools.\n\nSystem requirements for Mac\n\nAiarty Image Matting is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems.\n\nThe Mac minimum requirement for Intel models is macOS 10.15 and Apple Silicon is macOS 11. For either, the Mac needs at least 8GB of RAM and more than 500GB free.\n\nGet Aiarty Matting at a discount for a limited time\n\nAiarty Matting is among the best options to remove image backgrounds on Mac.

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nA UFO expert, Carl Nally of UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), claims the spate of recent mysterious drone sightings could be a precursor to an alien invasion. He also says they will be conducting this invasion using an invasion portal located here on Earth.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Mirror, Nally believes that the unexplained drone sightings that have been proliferating all over the United States and abroad would have been positively identified as drones by the American government if they were, in fact, nothing more than unmanned aircraft. Especially since many of these sightings have occurred near military bases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing situation, the way we see it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would imagine that, when anything appears over a military base, a military helicopter would go up and investigate them, but they haven\u2019t done that.\n\n\u201cThey call them drones. Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\u201d\n\nHe believes that one explanation for all of these supposed drones not being properly identified by governments may have to do with the use of portals. A similar theory has also been applied to cryptids like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar that it\u2019s happening in a lot of places at the same time,\u201d Carl Nally continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to that on this side of the world. At some point, they will make themselves known, and why not now?\u201d\n\nOne portal Nally believes exists is located over Athlone, Slane, Boyle, Wicklow, and West Cork in Ireleand.\n\nHe cites research being conducted by a astronomer Dr. Eamonn Ansbro and New Zealand airline pilot Dr. Bruce Cathie as possible evidence that these portals are being used by aliens. \u201c\u201dThey are entering earth at an increasingly rapid pace, and the fact that the entry coincides with sightings over military bases \u2013 that is concerning,\u201d Nally told the Westmeath Independent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge number of reports from people in the Midlands who report seeing orb or tic tac shaped UFOs,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cDr. Ansbro and Dr. Cathie have developed a theory that UFOs operate on tracks which they can enter and exit the Earth from,\u201d Nally explained. \u201cThey have been working on this theory for the past 12 to 15 years. They have been researching sites where UFOs are most often seen. Their mathematical theory is proven to be 92% accurate.\u201d"

It's a given that Demon Slayer is a winner, so we kept it off this roundup because you've undoubted already watched, but the other titles are prime for a good binge if you're relaxing before the new year.\n\nYou can visit Crunchyroll for some of these, but Hulu, Netflix and Prime offer anime and Max has Uzumaki.

The number of Large Language Models (LLMs) seems to have grown exponentially since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT burst into the public consciousness in late 2022. It is estimated that US$154 billion was spent on AI by businesses in 2023, while the most recent McKinsey global survey on AI reveals that up to 65 percent of firms were regularly using generative AI (GenAI) in their operations. But beyond the hype and billion-dollar figures, it\u2019s still a little unclear where and how the technology is really being used.\n\nOur research aimed to go beyond surveys of business managers and included real-world data on how AI is being adopted. To achieve this, we went to the source to analyse the activities of software developers and how they were interacting with some of the leading open-weight LLMs. These are freely available LLMs that can be accessed, modified and redistributed with minimal restrictions.\n\nWe found significant variations in the adoption of AI based on geography, company size and industry. Perhaps unsurprisingly, start-ups and technology firms were the largest users, with US companies way ahead when it comes to embracing the potential of AI. Educational institutions were another key locus of AI activity, with a particularly high adoption of Llama with this segment. What also emerged was the domination of United States, with Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Llama and Elon Musk\u2019s Grok way ahead of other open-source LLMs in market share.\n\nOpen access data\n\nOur search for concrete usage data led us to the popular developer platform GitHub, an important repository for AI code and other resources. This includes a number of notable open-weight LLMs such as Grok, Meta\u2019s Llama, Yi by the Chinese group 01.AI and Mistral by its eponymous French AI start-up.\n\nThe beauty of GitHub is the ability to identify which developers have downloaded (\u201cforked\u201d) which LLM code to power AI applications, and therefore, offers insights into what LLMs are proving popular among developers. As developers are the one pushing technological boundaries it perhaps offers insights into AI trends.\n\nEqually important, the open nature of GitHub also allowed us to identify a decent percentage of those developer\u2019s country of residence, employer sector and employer size. While not an exact science, our data provide a snapshot of how developers from different countries, company sizes and industries are adopting LLMs. We benchmarked AI adoption numbers against the use of TensorFlow, one of the most widely used machine learning developer tools released by Google back in 2015."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of the bright, very early active galactic nucleus that was found by Ba\u00f1ados and his colleagues, which has fundamental implications for black hole growth in the earliest billion or so years of cosmic history. Credit: NSF/AUI/NSF NRAO/B. Saxton\n\nAstronomers have discovered an important piece of the puzzle of how supermassive black holes were able to grow so quickly in the early universe: a special kind of active galactic nucleus so distant that its light has taken more than 12.9 billion years to reach us. This so-called blazar serves as a statistical marker: its existence implies the presence of a large but hidden population of similar objects, all of which should emit powerful particle jets.\n\nThis is where the discovery becomes important for cosmic evolution: black holes with jets are thought to be able to grow considerably more quickly than without jets. The research appears in a paper published in Nature Astronomy and another in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nActive galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely bright centers of galaxies. The engines driving their enormous energy output are supermassive black holes. Matter falling onto such black holes (accretion) is the most efficient mechanism known to physics when it comes to setting free enormous amounts of energy. That unmatched efficiency is why AGN are able to produce more light than all the stars in hundreds, thousands\u2014or even more\u2014of galaxies put together and in a volume of space smaller than our own solar system.\n\nAt least 10% of all AGN are thought to emit focused high-energy beams of particles, known as jets. These jets shoot out from the direct vicinity of the black hole in two opposite directions, sustained and guided by magnetic fields in the \"accretion disk\" of material: the disk formed by gas swirling around, and falling into, the black hole. For us to see an AGN as a blazar, something very improbable needs to happen: Earth, our base of observations, must be in just the right location for the AGN jet to point directly toward us.\n\nThe result is the astronomical analog of someone shining the beam of a really bright flashlight directly into your eyes: a particularly bright object in the sky. Characteristically for a blazar, we also see quick changes in brightness on time scales of days, hours, or even less than that\u2014a consequence of random changes in the swirling accretion disk at the base of the jet and of instabilities in the jet's interplay between magnetic fields and charged particles.\n\nFinding active galactic nuclei in the very early universe\n\nThe new discovery was the result of a systematic search for active galactic nuclei in the early universe conducted by Eduardo Ba\u00f1ados, a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy who specializes in the first billion years of cosmic history, and an international team of astronomers.\n\nSince light takes time to reach us, we see distant objects as they were millions or even billions of years ago. For the more distant objects, the so-called cosmological redshift, due to cosmic expansion, shifts their light to far longer wavelengths than the wavelengths at which the light was emitted. Ba\u00f1ados and his team exploited this fact, searching systematically for objects that were redshifted so far that they did not even show up in the usual visible light (of the Dark Energy Legacy Survey, in this case) but that were bright sources in a radio survey (the 3 GHz VLASS survey).\n\nAmong 20 candidates that met both criteria, only one designated J0410\u20130139 met the additional criterion of showing significant brightness fluctuations in the radio regime\u2014raising the possibility that this was a blazar.\n\nThe researchers then dug deeper, employing an unusually large battery of telescopes, including near-infrared observations with ESO's New Technology Telescope (NTT), a spectrum with ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), additional near-infrared spectra with the LBT, one of the Keck telescopes and the Magellan telescope, X-ray images from both ESA's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra space telescopes, millimeter wave observations with the ALMA and NOEMA arrays, and more detailed radio observations with the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory's VLA telescopes to confirm the object's status as an AGN, and specifically a blazar.\n\nThe observations also yielded the distance of the AGN (via the redshift) and even found traces of the host galaxy in which the AGN is embedded. Light from that active galactic nucleus has taken 12.9 billion years to reach us (z=6.9964), carrying information about the universe as it was 12.9 billion years ago.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

As a real-life analogy, imagine that you read about someone who has won $100 million in a lottery. Given how rare such a win is, you can immediately deduce that there must have been many more people who participated in that lottery but have not won such an exorbitant amount.\n\n\"Similarly, finding one AGN with a jet pointing directly towards us implies that at that time, there must have been many AGN in that period of cosmic history with jets that did not point at us.\"\n\nLong story short, in the words of Silvia Belladitta, a post-doc at MPIA and co-author of the present publication, \"Where there is one, there's one hundred more.\"\n\nLight from the previous record-holder for the most distant blazar has taken about 100 million years less to reach us (z=6.1). The extra 100 million years might seem short in light of the fact we are looking back more than 12 billion years, but they make a crucial difference. This is a time when the universe is changing rapidly. In those 100 million years, a supermassive black hole can increase its mass by an order of magnitude.\n\nBased on current models, the number of AGN should have increased by a factor of five to ten during those 100 million years. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.8 billion years ago would not be unexpected. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.9 billion years ago, as in this case, is a different matter altogether.\n\nHelping black holes grow since 12.9 billion years ago\n\nThe presence of a whole population of AGN with jets at that particular early time has significant implications for cosmic history and the growth of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies in general. Black holes whose AGN have jets can potentially gain mass faster than black holes without jets.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is difficult for gas to fall into a black hole. The natural thing for gas to do is to orbit the black hole, similar to the way a planet orbits the sun, with increased speed as the gas gets closer to the black hole (\"angular momentum conservation\"). In order to fall in, the gas needs to slow down and lose energy. The magnetic fields associated with the particle jet, which interact with the swirling disk of gas, can provide such a \"braking mechanism\" and help the gas to fall in.\n\nThis means the consequences of the new discovery are likely to become a building block of any future model of black-hole growth in the early universe: they imply the existence of an abundance of active galactic nuclei 12.9 billion years ago that had jets, and thus had the associated magnetic fields that can help black holes grow at considerable speed."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA quantum circuit (left) is passed to an encoder (top) that creates a feature set for the ML model (right) based on the circuit and the quantum processor unit (QPU) targeted for execution. The executed noisy expectation values serve as the input to the model whose aim is to predict their noise-free value. To achieve this, the model is trained beforehand (bottom, blue highlighted path) against target values of example circuits. These are obtained either using noiseless simulations in the case of small-scale, tractable circuits or using the noisy QPU in conjunction with a conventional error mitigation strategy in the case of large-scale, intractable circuits. The trained model operates without the need for additional mitigation circuits, thus reducing runtime overheads. Credit: Liao et al. Execution and training for tractable and intractable circuits with ML-QEM\n\nQuantum computers have the potential of outperforming classical computers in some optimization and data processing tasks. However, quantum systems are also more sensitive to noise and thus prone to errors, due to the known physical challenges associated with reliably manipulating qubits, their underlying units of information.\n\nEngineers recently devised various methods to reduce the impact of these errors, which are known as quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques. While some of these techniques achieved promising results, executing them on real quantum computers is often too expensive or unfeasible.\n\nResearchers at IBM Quantum recently showed that simple and more accessible machine learning (ML) techniques could be used for QEM. Their paper, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, demonstrates that these techniques could achieve accuracies comparable to those of other QEM techniques, at a far lower cost.\n\n\"We started to think about how to depart from conventional physics-based QEM methods and whether ML techniques can help to reduce the cost of QEM so that more complex and larger-scale experiments could come within reach,\" Haoran Liao, co-first author of the paper, told Phys.org.\n\n\"However, there seemed to be a fundamental paradox: How can classical ML learn what noise is doing in a quantum calculation running on a quantum computer that is doing something beyond classical computers? After all, quantum computers are of interest for their ability to run problems beyond the power of classical computers.\"\n\nAs part of their study, the researchers carried out a series of tests, where they used state-of-the-art quantum computers and up to 100 qubits to complete different tasks. They focused on tasks that are impossible to complete via brute-force calculations performed on classical computers, but that could be tackled using more sophisticated computational methods running on powerful classical computers.\n\n\"This interesting 'paradox' is another motivation for us to think about whether careful designs can tailor ML models to find the complicated relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer to help quantum computations,\" said Liao.\n\nThe primary objective of the recent study by Liao and his colleagues was to accelerate QEM using widely used ML techniques, demonstrating the potential of these techniques in real-world experiments. The team first started experimenting with a complex graph neural network (GNN), which they used to encode the entire structure of a quantum circuit and its properties, yet they found that this model performed not very well.\n\n\"It surprised us to find that a simpler model, random forest, worked very well across different types of circuits and noise models,\" explained Liao.\n\n\"In our exploration of the ML techniques for QEM, we tried to shape and vary the noise to see how different techniques ML or conventional, perform in different scenarios, so we can better understand the capability of ML models in 'learning' the noise\u2013we are not passive bystanders, but active agents.\n\n\"We not only tried to benchmark but also demystify the 'black box' nature of the ML models in the context of learning relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a more powerful quantum computer. \"\n\nTop three panels: Average expectation values from 100-qubit Trotterized 1D TFIM circuits run on the ibm_brisbane QPU. Top panel corresponds to a Clifford circuit, whose ideal, noise-free expectation values are represented by the green dots. The random-forest-mimicking-ZNE (RF-ZNE) curve corresponds to training the random forest (RF) model on zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) and readout-error-mitigated hardware data. This approach enables efficient, low-overhead error mitigation in scenarios where ideal outcomes from classical simulation are infeasible. Bottom panel: The error between ZNE-mitigated and RF-ZNE mitigated expectation values. The approach achieves a 25% reduction in overall and 50% reduction in runtime deployment in terms of quantum resource overhead compared to ZNE, as shown in the inset. Credit: Liao et al.\n\nThe experiments carried out by Liao and his colleagues demonstrate that ML could help to accelerate physics-based QEM. Remarkably, the model that they found to be most promising, known as random forest, is also fairly simple and could thus be easy to implement on a large scale.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the future, they could help to enrich the present understanding of quantum errors, while also potentially improving the accessibility of QEM methods.\n\n\"Is the relationship between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer fundamentally unlearnable? We didn't know the answer,\" said Liao.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons why this would be impossible to determine. However, we showed this key relationship is in fact learnable by ML models in practice. We also showed that we are not passive bystanders, but we can shape the noise in the computation to improve the learnability further.\"\n\nLiao and his colleagues also successfully demonstrated that ML techniques for QEM are less costly, yet they can achieve accuracies comparable to those of alternative physics-based QEM techniques. Their experiments were the first to demonstrate the potential of machine learning algorithms for QEM at a utility scale.\n\n\"Even in the most conservative setting, ML-QEM demonstrates more than a 2-fold reduction in runtime overhead, addressing the primary bottleneck of error mitigation and a fundamentally challenging problem with a substantial leap in efficiency,\" said Liao.\n\n\"Most conservatively, this translates into at least halving experiment durations\u2014e.g., cutting an 80-hour experiment to just 40 hours\u2014drastically reducing operational costs and doubling the regime of accessible experiments.\"\n\nAfter gathering these promising results, Liao and his colleagues plan to continue exploring the potential of AI algorithms for simplifying and upscaling QEM. Their work could inspire other research groups to conduct similar studies, potentially contributing to the advancement and future deployment of quantum computers.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, and we're excited about the field of AI for quantum,\" added Liao. \"We would like to emphasize that at least in the context of QEM, ML is not to replace, but to facilitate physics-based methods, that they can build off each other.\n\n\"This opens the door for what's possible with ML in quantum and is an invitation to the community that ML can perhaps accelerate and improve many other aspects of quantum computations.\"\n\nMore information: Haoran Liao et al, Machine learning for practical quantum error mitigation, Nature Machine Intelligence (2024).

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nIt is fair to say that 2024 hasn't been kind to the Woolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW) share price.\n\nConcerns over market share losses, allegations of price gouging, ACCC legal action, and a supermarket inquiry have weighed heavily on the retail giant's shares.\n\nWill things be better for Woolworths shares in 2025? Let's find out.\n\nWoolworths share price outlook\n\nThere certainly is a lot to watch next year. But the team at Goldman Sachs believes that all the potential bad news is more than priced into the Woolworths share price right now.\n\nAs a result, its analysts feel that 2024's weakness is 2025's buying opportunity. Commenting on the supermarket inquiry, which is likely to be the number one concern for investors, the broker said:\n\nNone of the listed areas of further deep-dive are a surprise based on the initial scoping/material submitted to ACCC and channel checks; our discussion with the channel suggests 2 issues would be most in-focus i.e. 1) price-establishment (as flagged by separate ongoing legal proceedings between the ACCC and WOW/COL) and 2) retail site access as entry barriers. Whilst from a retail competition perspective, the ACCC highlighted the aggregate WOW AU Food(A$51B)/COL Food(A$39B) market share in Australia National Take-Home Food & Grocery sales was 57.3% in 2022/23 vs 53.6% in 2006/07 (+3.7%), it does exclude grocery sales from \"category specialists\" including Chemist Warehouse (FY24 Network Sales of A$9B) and Amazon (GSe CY23 GMV ~A$6B) as well as Bunnings pushing into consumables categories including Cleaning and Pet. Net net, while we do not take any view on the final outcome, we remain of the view that earnings and valuation risks from the Inquiries are sufficiently priced in and reiterate Buy WOW and Neutral COL.\n\nHow big could the returns be?\n\nAccording to a recent note, the broker sees scope for the Woolworths share price to deliver mouth-watering returns in 2025.\n\nIts analysts currently have a buy rating and $36.20 price target on the supermarket giant's shares.\n\nBased on its current share price of $30.36, this implies potential upside of 19% for investors between now and this time next year.\n\nIn addition, the broker is expecting a fully franked 96 cents per share dividend in FY 2025. This represents an attractive 3.15% dividend yield, which boosts the total potential return beyond 22%.\n\nCommenting on its buy rating, the broker said:"

            "article_content": "Barn in Weld County, Colorado. Photo by Fred Hendricks\n\nOLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee late Tuesday released a 1,547-page bill to fund the government through March 14, 2025, and provide various forms of assistance to farmers.\n\nCongress is expected to pass the measure before midnight Friday, when the current continuing resolution expires, although a short-term extension of the CR could be needed if Congress does not finish its work on time.\n\nThe bill extends the 2018 farm bill through fiscal year 2025, includes $21 billion in relief for farmers and ranchers who have experienced natural disasters and $10 billion in economic assistance to farmers. It also funds USDA \u201corphan\u201d programs that do not have baseline funding for one year.\n\nThe bill allows the sale of E15 gasoline year round and nationwide. But it does not, as Democrats and environmentalists had proposed, move approximately $14 billion in remaining climate-focused agricultural conservation funds from the Inflation Reduction Act into the farm bill.\n\nIt also allows families whose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits have been stolen to be reimbursed up to two times per year.\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn \u201cGT\u201d Thompson, R-Pa., said, \u201cThe bill released this evening provides much-needed relief for agriculture, including $10B in emergency economic aid, which will help address the significant losses incurred due to both weather- and market-related issues. This addition of economic support is an important financial bridge, one that will help mitigate the severe downturn in the agricultural economy.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to the 119th Congress, I hope to move quickly to enact a five-year farm bill that aligns the farm safety net with the needs of producers, among many other policies, to minimize the need for annual economic aid.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the partnership of incoming-(Senate Agriculture Committee) Chairman [John] Boozman, (R-Ark.) as well as members and stakeholders, all who quickly and effectively highlighted the needs in farm country. These tireless efforts will lessen much of the stress for the men and women who fight to produce the food, fiber, and fuel that sustain our great nation.\u201d\n\nBoozman, currently the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he \u201csecured significant economic assistance for America\u2019s farmers struggling to maintain operations due to rising inflation, high input costs, and low commodity prices in the continuing resolution Congress is expected to vote on in the coming days.\n\n\u201cAn updated farm bill with an improved safety net would have minimized the need for emergency economic assistance. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to even consider a new farm bill this year. We must redouble our efforts and pass a bipartisan five-year farm bill.\n\nSenate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., who is retiring, said, \u201cI am so pleased that we were able to secure much-needed economic and natural disaster assistance for farmers across the country and that we did it without pitting one part of the farm bill against another.\n\n\u201cWe should also celebrate that this agreement prevents a $1.5 billion cut to SNAP by extending protections to people who had their benefits stolen through no fault of their own. It invests in ag research by funding the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and permanently funding 1890 scholarships, which are so critical to growing the next generation of ag professionals. It allows for the sale of year-round E-15, which is a critical market. And it fully funds all the popular programs used by farmers and rural communities that would run out of funding if we did not act.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there is one critically important part that did not get into this package. I believe that it is political malpractice not to increase the funds available in the conservation title of the farm bill by bringing conservation and rural energy funding from the Inflation Reduction Act into the farm bill.\n\n\u201cMoving those resources would have made a permanent and lasting investment in popular conservation and energy programs while adding nearly $20 billion to the farm bill baseline and creating an additional $10 billion offset. This could have been used to increase economic assistance, as Democrats proposed, or it could have been invested in other farm bill needs. This idea had bipartisan support among the committee leaders and would have greatly helped Congress write a new farm bill next year.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear. The $10 billion investment in economic disaster assistance that we agreed to is being paid for by increasing the deficit. It could have been fully paid for by using the $10 billion in savings from moving the conservation dollars into the farm bill baseline.\n\n\u201cWhile I am relieved that we reached an agreement, it\u2019s shocking that Republican leadership failed to support such a common-sense and bipartisan proposal.\u201d\n\nFARM GROUPS\n\nZippy Duvall, president of the Republican-leaning American Farm Bureau, who had urged members of Congress not to support a bill that did not include aid to farmers, now urged its passage.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that for many farmers, the critical funding in this bill could make the difference between planting a crop next year and giving up,\u201d Duvall said. \u201cWe appreciate that members of Congress rolled up their sleeves to ensure farmers can continue to deliver the safest, most affordable and abundant food supply in the world.\n\n\u201cWe urge Congress to pass this legislation and then return in January ready to tackle the challenges facing agriculture. Another one-year extension of the farm bill addresses immediate needs, but only a new, modernized farm bill will bring certainty for America\u2019s families, farmers, ranchers and rural communities.\u201d\n\nRob Larew, president of the Democratic-leaning National Farmers Union, told his members in an action alert: \u201cContact your representatives and tell them to vote YES on the Further Continuing Appropriations and Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2025.\u201d\n\nNational Cotton Council Chairman Joe Nicosia said, \u201cThe much-needed economic and disaster relief will help mitigate the financial stress caused by a combination of increased production costs, weakening market prices, and production losses caused by natural disasters. We extend our gratitude to the House and Senate leadership for providing critical support to U.S. cotton producers. We urge all members of Congress to support the end-of-year spending package so that farmers can receive the additional support they desperately need.\u201d\n\nIndependent Community Bankers of America President and CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey said, \u201cICBA and the nation\u2019s community banks thank congressional leaders for including a $10 billion farm aid package in the CR that is moving toward potential enactment later this week. Many of our nation\u2019s farmers and ranchers are in a perilous financial state due to low commodity prices, high input costs, and declining revenues in recent years. The farm aid package will assist producers suffering from economic losses and help our nation\u2019s community bankers continue working with producers to ensure access to affordable credit.\u201d\n\nMike Lavender, policy director for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, was less enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cFor the hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers whose livelihood depends on building the productivity, sustainability, and resilience of their operation through conservation, today\u2019s deal is a colossal setback,\u201d Lavender said. \u201cFaced with a generational opportunity to improve the futures of farm families nationwide, this deal instead prioritizes politics. NSAC thanks the many members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who have fought tirelessly on behalf of farmers to defend these investments. From here, the 2025 farm bill reauthorization becomes an even more important moment to recoup a small fraction of the conservation investment left on the table today. Congress cannot continue prioritizing short-term aid while shortchanging farmers\u2019 long-term needs. It is well past time for Congress to get serious about a farm bill rooted in sound policies that meet the needs of all farmers.\u201d\n\nMelissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs for the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said, \u201cThe climate-focused conservation funds included in the IRA help farmers make their operations more resilient, building buffers against extreme weather like droughts, floods and other stressors. Congress should protect the remaining climate-focused IRA funds to ensure they continue to make farmers more climate-resilient.\u201d\n\nSen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., noted that she was the author of a provision to allow nationwide, year-round sale of E15 fuel, a blend made of gasoline and 15% bioethanol.\n\n\u201cMy legislation is the only permanent, nationwide solution to unleashing the power of year-round E15,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cThis will once and for all solidify President Trump\u2019s pledge to allow the sale of year-round E15 \u2014 giving America\u2019s producers and consumers the certainty they deserve. This will put an end to years of patchwork regulations and finally make nationwide year-round E15 a reality.\u201d\n\nFischer pointed out that the National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy, American Coalition for Ethanol, American Petroleum Institute, SIGMA, National Association of Truck Stop Operators, and National Association of Convenience Stores all supported her bill.\n\nRenewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said, \u201cWe are very pleased to see that the long-awaited fix allowing year-round E15 is included in this package. This language would finally remove an outdated, red-tape regulatory barrier, and we remain hopeful that the continuing resolution will move swiftly through Congress and to the president\u2019s desk for signature.\u201d\n\nGrowth Energy CEO Emily Skor said, \u201cWe are grateful for the tireless work of our numerous congressional champions to get this bill included, and that congressional leadership has endorsed this common-sense, bipartisan, bicameral energy solution, and encourage senators and representatives to vote in favor of this package so that year-round E15 becomes the law of the land.\u201d"

            "article_content": "This post was sponsored by Bluehost. The opinions expressed in this article are the sponsor\u2019s own.\n\nWhich hosting service is best for agencies?\n\nHow do I uncover what will be best for my clients in 2025?\n\nWhat features should my hosting service have in 2025?\n\nHosting has evolved well beyond keeping websites online.\n\nHosting providers must align their services to meet clients\u2019 technological needs and keep up with constantly changing technological advances.\n\nToday, quality hosting companies must focus on speed, security, and scalability. Staying ahead of hosting trends is critical to maintaining competitive offerings, optimizing workflows, and meeting client demands.\n\nSo, what should you watch for in 2025?\n\nThe next 12 months promise significant shifts in hosting technologies, with advancements in AI, automation, security, and sustainability leading the way.\n\nUnderstanding and leveraging these trends enables agencies and professionals to provide better client experiences, streamline operations, and reduce the negative effects of future industry changes.\n\nTrend 1: Enhanced AI & Automation Implemented In Hosting\n\nAI and automation are already transforming hosting, making it smarter and more efficient for service providers, agencies, brands, and end-point customers alike.\n\nHosting providers now leverage AI to optimize server performance, predict maintenance needs, and even supplement customer support with AI-driven features like chatbots.\n\nAs a result, automating routine tasks such as backups, updates, and resource scaling reduces downtime and the need for manual intervention. These innovations are game-changing for those managing multiple client sites and will become increasingly important in 2025.\n\nIt only makes sense.\n\nAutomated systems free up valuable time, allowing you more time to focus on strategic growth instead of tedious maintenance tasks. AI-powered insights can also identify performance bottlenecks, enabling you to address issues before they impact your website or those of your clients.\n\nAgencies that adopt these technologies this year will not only deliver exceptional service but also be able to position themselves as forward-thinking.\n\nBluehost embraces automation with features like automated backups, one-click updates, and a centralized dashboard for easy site management. These tools streamline workflows, enabling agencies and professionals to manage multiple sites with minimal effort while ensuring optimal performance.\n\nTrend 2: Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Cloud Solutions Are Now Essential\n\nIn 2025, as businesses demand more flexibility and reliability from their online infrastructure, multi-cloud and hybrid cloud solutions will become essential in the hosting world.\n\nThese approaches offer the best of both worlds:\n\nThe ability to leverage multiple cloud providers for redundancy and performance.\n\nThe option to combine public and private cloud environments for greater control and customization.\n\nFor agencies managing diverse client needs, multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies provide the scalability and adaptability required to meet modern demands. Multi-cloud solutions allow agencies to distribute their clients\u2019 workloads across multiple cloud providers, ensuring that no single point of failure disrupts their operations.\n\nThis feature is particularly valuable for agencies with high-traffic websites, where downtime or slow performance can have a significant impact on revenue and user experience. Hybrid cloud solutions, on the other hand, let agencies blend the scalability of public clouds with the security and control of private cloud environments.\n\nThis service is ideal for clients with sensitive data or compliance requirements, such as ecommerce or healthcare businesses.\n\nBluehost Cloud provides scalable infrastructure and tools that enable agencies to customize hosting solutions to fit their clients\u2019 unique requirements. Our cloud hosting solution\u2019s elastic architecture ensures that websites can handle sudden traffic spikes without compromising speed or reliability.\n\nAdditionally, our intuitive management dashboard allows agencies to easily monitor and allocate resources across their client portfolio, making it simple to implement tailored solutions for varying workloads.\n\nBy adopting multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies, agencies can offer their clients enhanced performance, improved redundancy, and greater control over their hosting environments.\n\nWith our scalable solutions and robust toolset, agencies can confidently deliver hosting that grows with their clients\u2019 businesses while maintaining consistent quality and reliability. This flexibility not only meets today\u2019s hosting demands but also helps position your agency for long-term success in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nTrend 3: Edge Computing & CDNs Replace AMP For Improving Website Speed\n\nAs online audiences grow, the demand for faster, more responsive websites has never been higher. Edge computing and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are at the forefront of this evolution, enabling websites to reduce latency significantly. For agencies managing clients with diverse and international audiences, these technologies are crucial for improving user experience and ensuring website performance remains competitive.\n\nEdge computing brings data processing closer to the end user by leveraging servers located at the \u201cedge\u201d of a network, reducing the time it takes for information to travel.\n\nCombined with CDNs that cache website content on servers worldwide, these technologies ensure faster load times, smoother navigation, and better performance metrics.\n\nThese features are especially beneficial for media-heavy or high-traffic websites, where even a slight delay can impact engagement and conversions.\n\nBluehost integrates with leading CDN solutions to deliver content quickly and efficiently to users across the globe. By leveraging a CDN, Bluehost ensures that websites load faster regardless of a visitor\u2019s location, enhancing user experience and SEO performance.\n\nThis integration simplifies the optimization of site speed for agencies with multiple clients. By adopting edge computing and CDN technology, you can help your clients achieve faster load times, improved site stability, and higher customer satisfaction.\n\nBluehost\u2019s seamless CDN integration enables you to deliver a hosting solution that meets the expectations of a modern, global audience while building trust and loyalty with your clients.\n\nTrend 4: Core Web Vitals & SEO Hosting Features Make Or Break Websites\n\nCore Web Vitals play an important role in today\u2019s SEO, as Google is increasingly emphasizing website performance and user experience in its ranking algorithms. Today, loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability impact a site\u2019s ability to rank well in search results and keep visitors engaged.\n\nThat means optimizing Core Web Vitals isn\u2019t just an SEO task for agencies managing client websites. Fast load times and responsive design are critical parts of delivering a high-quality digital experience. For example, metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which measures how quickly a page\u2019s main content loads, depend heavily on hosting infrastructure.\n\nAgencies need hosting solutions optimized for these metrics to ensure their clients\u2019 sites stay competitive in the SERPs.\n\nBluehost offers a WordPress-optimized hosting environment with features specifically designed to improve load times and server response speeds. From advanced caching technology to robust server architecture, Bluehost ensures that sites meet Core Web Vitals standards with ease.\n\nAdditionally, our hosting solutions include tools for monitoring site performance, allowing agencies to proactively address any issues that could impact rankings or user experience.\n\nBy prioritizing Core Web Vitals and leveraging SEO-focused hosting features, agencies can enhance their clients\u2019 visibility, engagement, and overall online success. With Bluehost\u2019s optimized hosting solutions, you\u2019ll have the tools and infrastructure needed to deliver fast, stable, and high-performing websites that delight users and search engines.\n\nTrend 5: Sustainable Hosting Practices Help Reduce Energy Consumption\n\nSustainability is no longer just a buzzword. It\u2019s a key consideration for businesses and agencies alike. As 2025 progresses, more clients will prioritize environmentally conscious practices, and hosting providers will step up to offer greener solutions, such as energy-efficient data centers and carbon offset programs.\n\nMigrating to a sustainable hosting provider not only supports client values but also demonstrates a commitment to responsible business practices, which will resonate more with consumers in 2025 than ever before.\n\nEfficient hosting practices reduce energy consumption and create a more sustainable digital ecosystem. It will also allow you to help clients meet their environmental goals without compromising on performance.\n\nThese benefits are especially valuable for clients with higher energy and performance demands, such as those in ecommerce, media-heavy, or high-traffic industries.\n\nBluehost has long been recognized as a trusted hosting provider that operates with efficiency in mind.\n\nOur robust, energy-efficient infrastructure already aligns with the sustainability goals of environmentally conscious clients.\n\nIn addition, our long-standing reputation, proven history with WordPress, and demonstrable reliability enhance your clients\u2019 sustainability objectives, ensuring they can operate responsibly and confidently.\n\nBy choosing sustainable hosting practices and partners like Bluehost, you can contribute to a greener digital future while reinforcing your clients\u2019 environmental commitments and strengthening client relationships by aligning with their values.\n\nTrend 6: Security Must Be A Core Offering\n\nSecurity is a non-negotiable priority for any website. Cyber threats like data breaches, malware, and DDoS attacks are on the rise, and the consequences of a breach, including lost revenue, damaged reputations, and potential legal issues, can devastate clients. As a result, offering secure hosting solutions with proactive security measures is essential to safeguarding clients\u2019 businesses and building trust.\n\nThese key features include SSL certificates, which protect sensitive data while boosting SEO rankings and user trust, and regular malware scans to prevent vulnerabilities.\n\nThey should also include automated backups that enable quick restoration in the event of a crash or attack and provide comprehensive protection and peace of mind. Essential security features are standard in Bluehost hosting plans, including SSL certificates, daily automated backups, and proactive malware scanning.\n\nThese built-in tools eliminate the need for additional solutions, added complexity, or costs. For agencies, our security features reduce risks for your clients and provide peace of mind.\n\nBy choosing a hosting provider like Bluehost, you can prioritize client security, reinforce client trust, and minimize emergencies, allowing you to avoid spending time and resources addressing threats or repairing damage.\n\nIn short, by partnering with Bluehost, security becomes a core part of your agency\u2019s value proposition.\n\nTrend 7: Hosting Optimized For AI & Machine Learning Is Key To High Visibility On SERPs\n\nAs artificial intelligence and machine learning become increasingly integrated with websites and applications in 2025, hosting providers must keep pace with the increasing demands these technologies place on infrastructure.\n\nAI-driven tools like chatbots, recommendation engines, and predictive analytics require significant computational power and seamless data processing.\n\nAI and machine learning applications often involve handling large datasets, running resource-intensive algorithms, and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Hosting optimized for these needs ensures that websites can perform reliably under heavy workloads, reducing latency and downtime and delivering consistent performance.\n\nIf you plan to be successful, you\u2019ll also require scalable scalable hosting solutions. These solutions allow resources to expand dynamically with demand, accommodate growth, and handle traffic surges.\n\nBluehost\u2019s scalable hosting is built to support advanced tools and applications, making it an ideal choice for agencies working on AI-driven projects. Our robust infrastructure delivers consistent performance, and flexibility allows you to scale easily as your client\u2019s needs evolve. By leveraging Bluehost, agencies can confidently deliver AI-integrated websites that meet modern performance demands.\n\nTrend 8: Managed Hosting Helps You Focus More On Profits\n\nIn 2025, websites will become increasingly complex. Businesses will require higher performance and reliability, and everyone will be looking to operate as lean and efficiently as possible. These trends mean managed hosting will become the go-to solution for agencies and their clients.\n\nManaged hosting shifts time-intensive technical maintenance away from agencies and business owners by including features such as automatic updates, performance monitoring, and enhanced security. In short, managed hosting enables you to simplify workflows, save time, and deliver consistent quality to your clients.\n\nThese hosting services are particularly valuable for WordPress websites, where regular updates, plugin compatibility checks, and security enhancements occur frequently but are essential to maintaining optimal performance.\n\nManaged hosting also typically includes tools like staging environments, which allow agencies to test changes and updates without risking disruptions to live sites and ensure you can deliver a seamless experience to clients.\n\nBluehost offers managed WordPress hosting that includes automatic updates, staging environments, and 24/7 expert support. These features allow you to handle technical details efficiently while focusing on delivering results for your clients without added stress or time.\n\nTrend 9: The Shift Toward Decentralized Hosting Boosts Your Brand\u2019s Longevity\n\nIn 2025, expect to see decentralized hosting gain attention as a futuristic approach to web hosting. Like Bitcoin and similar advancements, the technology leverages blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks to create hosting environments that prioritize privacy, resilience, and independence from centralized control.\n\nWhile this model appears to provide exciting new opportunities, it\u2019s still in the early stages. It faces challenges in scalability, user-friendliness, and widespread adoption, which agencies can\u2019t typically rely on for client sites.\n\nDecentralized hosting may become a viable option for specific use cases, such as privacy-focused projects or highly distributed systems. However, centralized hosting providers still offer the best balance of reliability, scalability, and accessibility for most businesses and agencies today.\n\nFor these reasons, agencies managing client websites will continue to focus on proven, reliable hosting solutions that deliver consistent performance and robust support.\n\nSo, while decentralized hosting may gain traction this year, Bluehost will continue to provide a trustworthy hosting environment designed to meet the needs of modern websites. With a strong emphasis on reliability, scalability, and user-friendly management tools, we offer a proven solution agencies can depend on to deliver exceptional client results.\n\nTrend 10: Scalable Hosting For High-Growth Websites Is Key For Growth\n\nAs businesses grow, their websites will experience increasing traffic and resource demands. High-growth websites, such as e-commerce platforms, content-heavy blogs, or viral marketing campaigns, require hosting solutions that can scale instantly. And scalable hosting is critical to delivering consistent user experiences and avoiding downtime during peak periods.\n\nScalable hosting like Bluehost ensures your clients\u2019 websites can easily adjust resources like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to meet fluctuating demands.

Our unmetered bandwidth and infrastructure were built to handle traffic surges, ensuring websites remain fast and accessible.\n\nThese features make us the ideal choice for agencies looking to future-proof their clients\u2019 hosting needs.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve in 2025, keeping up with the latest trends in hosting is essential for agencies to provide top-tier service, drive client satisfaction, and maintain a competitive edge.

            "article_content": "When Jeremiah and Laura Burke produced their documentary about Pastor David Platt, they never imagined it would reach a global audience. Released in fall 2023, the film has garnered more than 100,000 views on Conversations that Matter alone, with additional viewership across other platforms.\n\nAn earlier BNG article about the documentary \u2014 The Real David Platt: The Hijacking of McLean Bible Church \u2014 has drawn tens of thousands of readers.\n\nIt is unusual for a group of laypeople to lead such a public revolt against their own church and pastor as what has happened at McLean, a five-campus nondenominational megachurch in suburban Washington, D.C. It is more unusual for laity to take their own church to court. And it is unheard of to create a two-part documentary series outlining grievances against the pastor.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what has happened at McLean Bible Church, where the arrival of David Platt as pastor in 2017 set off a chain of events not unprecedented in American churches but absolutely unprecedented in the public nature of the dispute. The disaffected members have their own website to tell their story.\n\nOne reason for the public attention is that Platt came to the pastorate from the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention International Mission Board.\n\nSome longtime McLean members did not want anything to do with the SBC because they are proudly nondenominational.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Platt and other church leaders have denied any wrongdoing and have protrayed themselves as victims of a campaign by disgruntled church members.\n\nJeremiah and Laura Burke\n\nAmong those leading the charge against Platt are Jeremiah and Laura Burke. He is a self-described \u201ctypical layman\u201d who comes from a business background in wealth management.\n\n\u201cI was a member of McLean since 2005 \u2026 just a rank-and-file member. A Christian husband and father of four children, just a regular everyday guy, nothing unique,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who David Platt was until he started speaking at McLean and became the pastor of the church.\u201d\n\nHis awareness of church politics at McLean heightened only after Platt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cIt had come to my attention that he had written a couple of books because he spoke in the summer of 2015,\u201d Burke recalled. \u201cHe had come to the church and was a guest pastor for a weekend event, and that was my first exposure to David Platt. Then it wasn\u2019t again until 2016 or 2017, when the church started transitioning out of their prior senior pastor, that David\u2019s name started coming up as being the new pastor to replace long-time pastor Lon Solomon.\u201d\n\nWhile initially open to Platt\u2019s leadership despite his admiration for Solomon, Burke\u2019s perspective began to shift by 2020.\n\n\u201cThere was a series of issues that had come to light over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen David first came on, I guess there was a gloominess over the church in a sense, in that it didn\u2019t seem like everyone was aware of what was happening but you kind of just trust your leadership. It seemed like there were some things that were just not right in the whole transition process.\u201d\n\nBurke reflected on the sudden leadership change: \u201cFor the 10 years I was at McLean, you had a solid pastor. Lon Solomon was a stalwart leader and then all of a sudden, he was gone, David came in and Lon never came back. We had been in Israel on a trip with him, he does these tours to Israel. I remember him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die in the pulpit. I\u2019m not leaving this church.'\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by Baptist News Global, Solomon provided this statement: \u201cIf you have seen Part 2 of the video series, you will see that I was removed by the elders from all operational involvement at MBC early in 2017 as a part of my separation agreement. Also, as part of my separation agreement, I am not at liberty to comment on events at MBC or David Platt.\u201d\n\nThe summer of 2020\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked a turning point, as Platt addressed racial and social issues from the pulpit, following controversy from his 2019 prayer over former President Donald Trump. McLean historically had attracted political figures, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, but Burke perceived a shift in atmosphere: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to see famous political people there. David made a story out of it. I guess a lot of people interpreted it as an apology, and that kind of riled some people up.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further complicated matters.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when COVID came up, the shutting down the church was another huge exodus of people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was problematic because everybody started going to other churches. At McLean you had to register to attend, you had to let them know you were coming.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point for Burke came when he discovered the nondenominational church\u2019s connection to the SBC, which he believed violated church bylaws prohibiting denominational affiliation. His investigation revealed McLean\u2019s involvement with the SBC of Virginia and the North American Mission Board through church planting initiatives.\n\n\u201cI just started to research whether we were part of the SBC or not,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn December 2020, at the first congregational meeting they had in person, I remember a lady asking if we were part of the denomination and David said from the pulpit no. However, that\u2019s not what I discovered.\u201d\n\nSBC church planting partnerships\n\nNot only was Platt educated and ordained by Southern Baptists and served in Southern Baptist leadership, the Bible church got involved in church planting partnerships with the SBC North American Mission Board.\n\nChurch leaders contend this partnership with the SBC \u201cwas not a secret.\u201d The SBC connection predated Platt\u2019s tenure, coordinated primarily through Clint Clifton, who Burke identifies as \u201cseemingly the genesis of this SBC relationship.\u201d\n\nThe discovery left Burke feeling betrayed: \u201cI had no idea I was a Southern Baptist. I had no idea for years that I was a Southern Baptist.\u201d\n\nThe conflict escalated to the point where Burke and his family were charged with trespassing at their own church. Determined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nDetermined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nConflict remains, as does attention\n\n\u201cI feel like I have two jobs now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally grassroots, but the amount of people who have seen it is kind of mind boggling. It\u2019s all over the world at this point; people in Romania and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have seen it. There\u2019s a gentleman who reached out from Russia asking if he could have permission to translate it into Russian and distribute it through Russia. It\u2019s been overwhelming.\u201d\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nSeven years after Platt\u2019s arrival as pastor, the dispute is not resolved and Burke and other unhappy members and former members continue to press their case. Their next target is seeking to document where tens of thousands of dollars from NAMB went because they do not believe all the named church plants even exist.\n\nChurch leaders, meanwhile, released their own investigation that stated: \u201cAfter review of numerous financial transactions associated with this partnership, we are encouraged that no improper financial transactions were discovered either during annual external audits by an independent accounting firm or during the discovery process in the lawsuit. We can say, however, that the financial transactions for the church planting partnership were sometimes confusing.\u201d\n\nThat report also said: \u201cIt is unquestionably clear that MBC did not give up any independence or cede any authority over our local church to the SBC or any other denomination. We at MBC remain committed to maintaining our autonomy and independence as a local body of believers according to our understanding of what the Bible teaches about the authority of the local church, and we are grateful that we are moving closer and closer to a day when these kinds of legal updates will no longer be necessary.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nUnderstanding the David Platt story | Analysis by Maina Mwaura\n\nDavid Platt hopes for a biblical gospel instead of an American gospel\n\nFor now, David Platt has won the battle against internal critics at McLean Bible Church\n\nDavid Platt steps up schedule to step down at IMB"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of the bright, very early active galactic nucleus that was found by Ba\u00f1ados and his colleagues, which has fundamental implications for black hole growth in the earliest billion or so years of cosmic history. Credit: NSF/AUI/NSF NRAO/B. Saxton\n\nAstronomers have discovered an important piece of the puzzle of how supermassive black holes were able to grow so quickly in the early universe: a special kind of active galactic nucleus so distant that its light has taken more than 12.9 billion years to reach us. This so-called blazar serves as a statistical marker: its existence implies the presence of a large but hidden population of similar objects, all of which should emit powerful particle jets.\n\nThis is where the discovery becomes important for cosmic evolution: black holes with jets are thought to be able to grow considerably more quickly than without jets. The research appears in a paper published in Nature Astronomy and another in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nActive galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely bright centers of galaxies. The engines driving their enormous energy output are supermassive black holes. Matter falling onto such black holes (accretion) is the most efficient mechanism known to physics when it comes to setting free enormous amounts of energy. That unmatched efficiency is why AGN are able to produce more light than all the stars in hundreds, thousands\u2014or even more\u2014of galaxies put together and in a volume of space smaller than our own solar system.\n\nAt least 10% of all AGN are thought to emit focused high-energy beams of particles, known as jets. These jets shoot out from the direct vicinity of the black hole in two opposite directions, sustained and guided by magnetic fields in the \"accretion disk\" of material: the disk formed by gas swirling around, and falling into, the black hole. For us to see an AGN as a blazar, something very improbable needs to happen: Earth, our base of observations, must be in just the right location for the AGN jet to point directly toward us.\n\nThe result is the astronomical analog of someone shining the beam of a really bright flashlight directly into your eyes: a particularly bright object in the sky. Characteristically for a blazar, we also see quick changes in brightness on time scales of days, hours, or even less than that\u2014a consequence of random changes in the swirling accretion disk at the base of the jet and of instabilities in the jet's interplay between magnetic fields and charged particles.\n\nFinding active galactic nuclei in the very early universe\n\nThe new discovery was the result of a systematic search for active galactic nuclei in the early universe conducted by Eduardo Ba\u00f1ados, a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy who specializes in the first billion years of cosmic history, and an international team of astronomers.\n\nSince light takes time to reach us, we see distant objects as they were millions or even billions of years ago. For the more distant objects, the so-called cosmological redshift, due to cosmic expansion, shifts their light to far longer wavelengths than the wavelengths at which the light was emitted. Ba\u00f1ados and his team exploited this fact, searching systematically for objects that were redshifted so far that they did not even show up in the usual visible light (of the Dark Energy Legacy Survey, in this case) but that were bright sources in a radio survey (the 3 GHz VLASS survey).\n\nAmong 20 candidates that met both criteria, only one designated J0410\u20130139 met the additional criterion of showing significant brightness fluctuations in the radio regime\u2014raising the possibility that this was a blazar.\n\nThe researchers then dug deeper, employing an unusually large battery of telescopes, including near-infrared observations with ESO's New Technology Telescope (NTT), a spectrum with ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), additional near-infrared spectra with the LBT, one of the Keck telescopes and the Magellan telescope, X-ray images from both ESA's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra space telescopes, millimeter wave observations with the ALMA and NOEMA arrays, and more detailed radio observations with the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory's VLA telescopes to confirm the object's status as an AGN, and specifically a blazar.\n\nThe observations also yielded the distance of the AGN (via the redshift) and even found traces of the host galaxy in which the AGN is embedded. Light from that active galactic nucleus has taken 12.9 billion years to reach us (z=6.9964), carrying information about the universe as it was 12.9 billion years ago.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter\u2014daily or weekly.\n\n'Where there is one, there's one hundred more'\n\nAccording to Ba\u00f1ados, \"The fact that J0410\u20130139 is a blazar, a jet that by chance happens to point directly towards Earth, has immediate statistical implications. As a real-life analogy, imagine that you read about someone who has won $100 million in a lottery. Given how rare such a win is, you can immediately deduce that there must have been many more people who participated in that lottery but have not won such an exorbitant amount.\n\n\"Similarly, finding one AGN with a jet pointing directly towards us implies that at that time, there must have been many AGN in that period of cosmic history with jets that did not point at us.\"\n\nLong story short, in the words of Silvia Belladitta, a post-doc at MPIA and co-author of the present publication, \"Where there is one, there's one hundred more.\"\n\nLight from the previous record-holder for the most distant blazar has taken about 100 million years less to reach us (z=6.1). The extra 100 million years might seem short in light of the fact we are looking back more than 12 billion years, but they make a crucial difference. This is a time when the universe is changing rapidly. In those 100 million years, a supermassive black hole can increase its mass by an order of magnitude.\n\nBased on current models, the number of AGN should have increased by a factor of five to ten during those 100 million years. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.8 billion years ago would not be unexpected. Finding that there was such a blazar 12.9 billion years ago, as in this case, is a different matter altogether.\n\nHelping black holes grow since 12.9 billion years ago\n\nThe presence of a whole population of AGN with jets at that particular early time has significant implications for cosmic history and the growth of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies in general. Black holes whose AGN have jets can potentially gain mass faster than black holes without jets.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is difficult for gas to fall into a black hole. The natural thing for gas to do is to orbit the black hole, similar to the way a planet orbits the sun, with increased speed as the gas gets closer to the black hole (\"angular momentum conservation\"). In order to fall in, the gas needs to slow down and lose energy. The magnetic fields associated with the particle jet, which interact with the swirling disk of gas, can provide such a \"braking mechanism\" and help the gas to fall in.\n\nThis means the consequences of the new discovery are likely to become a building block of any future model of black-hole growth in the early universe: they imply the existence of an abundance of active galactic nuclei 12.9 billion years ago that had jets, and thus had the associated magnetic fields that can help black holes grow at considerable speed."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA quantum circuit (left) is passed to an encoder (top) that creates a feature set for the ML model (right) based on the circuit and the quantum processor unit (QPU) targeted for execution. The executed noisy expectation values serve as the input to the model whose aim is to predict their noise-free value. To achieve this, the model is trained beforehand (bottom, blue highlighted path) against target values of example circuits. These are obtained either using noiseless simulations in the case of small-scale, tractable circuits or using the noisy QPU in conjunction with a conventional error mitigation strategy in the case of large-scale, intractable circuits. The trained model operates without the need for additional mitigation circuits, thus reducing runtime overheads. Credit: Liao et al. Execution and training for tractable and intractable circuits with ML-QEM\n\nQuantum computers have the potential of outperforming classical computers in some optimization and data processing tasks. However, quantum systems are also more sensitive to noise and thus prone to errors, due to the known physical challenges associated with reliably manipulating qubits, their underlying units of information.\n\nEngineers recently devised various methods to reduce the impact of these errors, which are known as quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques. While some of these techniques achieved promising results, executing them on real quantum computers is often too expensive or unfeasible.\n\nResearchers at IBM Quantum recently showed that simple and more accessible machine learning (ML) techniques could be used for QEM. Their paper, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, demonstrates that these techniques could achieve accuracies comparable to those of other QEM techniques, at a far lower cost.\n\n\"We started to think about how to depart from conventional physics-based QEM methods and whether ML techniques can help to reduce the cost of QEM so that more complex and larger-scale experiments could come within reach,\" Haoran Liao, co-first author of the paper, told Phys.org.\n\n\"However, there seemed to be a fundamental paradox: How can classical ML learn what noise is doing in a quantum calculation running on a quantum computer that is doing something beyond classical computers? After all, quantum computers are of interest for their ability to run problems beyond the power of classical computers.\"\n\nAs part of their study, the researchers carried out a series of tests, where they used state-of-the-art quantum computers and up to 100 qubits to complete different tasks. They focused on tasks that are impossible to complete via brute-force calculations performed on classical computers, but that could be tackled using more sophisticated computational methods running on powerful classical computers.\n\n\"This interesting 'paradox' is another motivation for us to think about whether careful designs can tailor ML models to find the complicated relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer to help quantum computations,\" said Liao.\n\nThe primary objective of the recent study by Liao and his colleagues was to accelerate QEM using widely used ML techniques, demonstrating the potential of these techniques in real-world experiments. The team first started experimenting with a complex graph neural network (GNN), which they used to encode the entire structure of a quantum circuit and its properties, yet they found that this model performed not very well.\n\n\"It surprised us to find that a simpler model, random forest, worked very well across different types of circuits and noise models,\" explained Liao.\n\n\"In our exploration of the ML techniques for QEM, we tried to shape and vary the noise to see how different techniques ML or conventional, perform in different scenarios, so we can better understand the capability of ML models in 'learning' the noise\u2013we are not passive bystanders, but active agents.\n\n\"We not only tried to benchmark but also demystify the 'black box' nature of the ML models in the context of learning relationships between noisy and ideal outputs of a more powerful quantum computer. \"\n\nTop three panels: Average expectation values from 100-qubit Trotterized 1D TFIM circuits run on the ibm_brisbane QPU. Top panel corresponds to a Clifford circuit, whose ideal, noise-free expectation values are represented by the green dots. The random-forest-mimicking-ZNE (RF-ZNE) curve corresponds to training the random forest (RF) model on zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) and readout-error-mitigated hardware data. This approach enables efficient, low-overhead error mitigation in scenarios where ideal outcomes from classical simulation are infeasible. Bottom panel: The error between ZNE-mitigated and RF-ZNE mitigated expectation values. The approach achieves a 25% reduction in overall and 50% reduction in runtime deployment in terms of quantum resource overhead compared to ZNE, as shown in the inset.

Remarkably, the model that they found to be most promising, known as random forest, is also fairly simple and could thus be easy to implement on a large scale.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the future, they could help to enrich the present understanding of quantum errors, while also potentially improving the accessibility of QEM methods.\n\n\"Is the relationship between noisy and ideal outputs of a quantum computer fundamentally unlearnable? We didn't know the answer,\" said Liao.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons why this would be impossible to determine. However, we showed this key relationship is in fact learnable by ML models in practice. We also showed that we are not passive bystanders, but we can shape the noise in the computation to improve the learnability further.\"\n\nLiao and his colleagues also successfully demonstrated that ML techniques for QEM are less costly, yet they can achieve accuracies comparable to those of alternative physics-based QEM techniques. Their experiments were the first to demonstrate the potential of machine learning algorithms for QEM at a utility scale.\n\n\"Even in the most conservative setting, ML-QEM demonstrates more than a 2-fold reduction in runtime overhead, addressing the primary bottleneck of error mitigation and a fundamentally challenging problem with a substantial leap in efficiency,\" said Liao.\n\n\"Most conservatively, this translates into at least halving experiment durations\u2014e.g., cutting an 80-hour experiment to just 40 hours\u2014drastically reducing operational costs and doubling the regime of accessible experiments.\"\n\nAfter gathering these promising results, Liao and his colleagues plan to continue exploring the potential of AI algorithms for simplifying and upscaling QEM. Their work could inspire other research groups to conduct similar studies, potentially contributing to the advancement and future deployment of quantum computers.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, and we're excited about the field of AI for quantum,\" added Liao. \"We would like to emphasize that at least in the context of QEM, ML is not to replace, but to facilitate physics-based methods, that they can build off each other.\n\n\"This opens the door for what's possible with ML in quantum and is an invitation to the community that ML can perhaps accelerate and improve many other aspects of quantum computations.\"\n\nMore information: Haoran Liao et al, Machine learning for practical quantum error mitigation, Nature Machine Intelligence (2024).

            "article_content": "Instead of issuing the permit as expected, the Trump administration was hitting the brakes to launch a broad study of the potential cumulative impacts of planned offshore wind projects. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting it,\u201d Theoharides said, remembering the day. \u201cEverything had looked really smooth up until that point.\u201d\n\nMomentum had been building for years, which was why it was surprising when Governor Charlie Baker pulled his new energy and environment secretary, Katie Theoharides, aside to deliver some bad news.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Massachusetts was poised for a big moment. Any day, the federal government would be issuing a final environmental permit for what was sure to be a game changer: the first industrial offshore wind project in the United States, Vineyard Wind.\n\nIt was the beginning of a \u201chinder and delay\u201d strategy that came to define the Trump administration\u2019s approach to offshore wind, said Jeremy McDiarmid, general counsel at the clean trade group Advanced Energy United.\n\nNow, people in the clean energy industry are bracing for a much more overt effort from the second Trump administration to slow or stop wind power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast go-around, the interruption seemed plausible; a cumulative impact study could be justified by some as a responsible step. Except, that\u2019s not been required of the oil and gas industry. \u201cIt seemed pretty clear that they were doing it just to derail this offshore wind train,\u201d said John Rogers, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nIt appeared a new double standard was being applied \u2014 one that would set back clean energy just as Massachusetts and other states were committing to slashing their greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis, relying heavily on offshore wind.\n\nVineyard Wind turbine size comparison to other buildings and landmarks. Ryan Huddle/Globe Staff\n\nAfter President Biden took office in 2021, permits got back on track, though projects were well behind. Vineyard Wind, for example, was initially scheduled to be completed in 2023; instead, it only began construction last year and was interrupted for months after a blade on one of the turbines broke this summer.\n\nNow, among the potential threats the industry is anticipating from Trump are new tariffs or shrinking tax incentives that could drive up the costs to unsustainable levels, or even a halt in permits or new leases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis regulatory uncertainty increases the cost of development, it increases financing costs, it probably reduces the number of investors that are interested in accepting this risk,\u201d said McDiarmid. \u201cThe offshore wind developers don\u2019t start to earn money until the electrons flow.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high: Wind farms provide a huge boost to the state reaching its clean energy goals. When Vineyard Wind 1 is fully online, for instance, it will provide enough electricity for more than 400,000 homes and meet 5.5 percent of the state\u2019s annual electricity demand. Another project, known as New England Wind 1, would have a similar effect.\n\nDevelopers lay out billions of dollars to bring an offshore wind project to fruition, and are ultimately paid back when they sell the electricity to utilities. Because offshore wind projects have lower operating costs relative to fossil fuels when completed, supporters say wind should eventually bring costs down for ratepayers.\n\nThere are some key differences between now and eight years ago, when Trump first entered office: The industry is far more developed, with multiple projects up and down the coast, projects being built, planned, or in various stages of permitting.\n\nWhile much of this is happening in coastal blue states, the industry is bringing an economic boom to red states too. Louisiana, for example, is a pivotal part of the supply chain, supplying the equipment and vessels used in building wind farms. Those jobs and contracts in Republican-held states might make it tougher to stop progress entirely.\n\nNonetheless, Trump these days is more vocal in his antipathy to wind turbines, claiming in May that \u201cthey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is.\u201d He has embraced discredited antiwind claims about how wind affects whales, birds, and the environment, and vowed on his first day in office to issue an executive order halting offshore wind projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere are other threats, too. Blades for the Vineyard Wind turbines, for instance, are manufactured in Canada, which Trump has threatened with a 25 percent tariff. Smaller parts of the offshore wind supply chain could also be affected by tariffs on China and Mexico, adding significant costs.\n\nA wind turbine with a broken blade at Vineyard Wind 1. Accidents involving blades made by GE Vernova have delayed projects off the coasts of Massachusetts and England. RANDI BAIRD/NYT\n\nIn addition, tax credits included in the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 which Trump has vowed to roll back \u2014 have helped support offshore wind supply manufacturers. JSW Steel, for instance, is expanding a plant in Mingo Junction, Ohio, to produce steel slabs for offshore wind pole towers, backed by $43.5 million in federal tax credits.\n\nManufacturers rely on those incentives, and Washington needs to keep them in place \u201cto ensure this industry thrives,\u201d said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president at Oceantic Network, a trade group for companies in the offshore wind business.\n\nThough some steps \u2014 namely tariffs \u2014 can be done via presidential executive order, it\u2019s not clear if Trump\u2019s other threats to offshore wind can be as easily realized.\n\nIndustry experts say Trump may not have the authority to revoke federal permits that are already issued. If so, then four permitted projects off the Massachusetts coastline \u2014 Vineyard Wind 1, Revolution Wind, and New England Wind 1 and 2 \u2014 should be safe. Of those, Vineyard Wind and Revolution Wind are already under construction. New England Wind 1 is further behind, having only recently been selected via a state procurement process, and New England Wind 2 has not been selected, but is available for future procurements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fate of other offshore wind projects planned for New England is less clear. SouthCoast Wind and Vineyard Wind 2 are on track for federal permits over the next two years. Another project, called Starboard Wind, also has not received all its federal permits.\n\n\u201cThese are the projects that I think face the biggest risks, because that creates the most latitude and areas for engagement with the federal government,\u201d said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.\n\nTogether, those three would produce a total of 3.67 gigawatts of clean energy, enough power for an estimated 1.8 million homes. Massachusetts has already contracted for 1.9 gigawatts from SouthCoast Wind and Vineyard Wind 2, and Rhode Island has contracted a small amount from SouthCoast Wind.\n\nIn Massachusetts, each project has an integral role in getting the state to its legally mandated target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nA view of Vineyard Wind's GE Haliade-X steel tower sections in New Bedford, June 14, 2023. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\n\nWhile offshore wind isn\u2019t the only way the state plans to convert from fossil fuels for electricity, it \u201cmoves the needle the most,\u201d said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Green Energy Consumers Alliance.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s very hard to get Massachusetts to net zero without offshore wind,\u201d said Theoharides, the former energy secretary who worked for the offshore wind industry for a year after leaving office.\n\nAny delays to the industry are coming at a particularly bad time, too. Demand for electricity in New England has been rising with the adoption of heat pumps and electric vehicles. At the same time, fossil fuel power plants are shutting down. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not sustainable to take capacity off without replacement in a rising demand environment,\u201d Dolan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, even if the industry hits major delays during the next four years of the Trump administration, \u201cit\u2019s not going to erase the offshore wind industry by any means,\u201d said McDiarmid. \u201cI think the industry is way too mature for that.\u201d\n\nSabrina Shankman can be reached at sabrina.shankman@globe.com.
