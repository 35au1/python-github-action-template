            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

            "article_content": "George Clinton\u2019s real UFO encounters: \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nPeople weren\u2019t meant to be this informed all the time. It\u2019s quite literally not natural for us to know this much information and have such a big-picture view of the world. For most of us, we have to focus on what we ourselves can change for the sake of our own mental health. Having too much of a big-picture view of the world will only stress us out. That said, we could go the George Clinton way, take the big picture to such a degree that we all become one, and see just how ludicrous it is to care about our petty differences.\n\nClinton sums this up best in an interview with Rolling Stone. When asked about white artists performing Black music, he is fairly supportive of the idea: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to learn from each other, blend from each other, and it moves around like that.\u201d So far, so down to earth. Suddenly, that figurative statement becomes literal in the funniest way possible.\n\nAdding, \u201cWe gonna be dealing with aliens. You think Black and white gonna be a problem? Wait till you start running into motherfuckers with three of four dicks!\u201d\n\nA good point well made, George. You see, Clinton didn\u2019t just use the whole sci-fi/afrofuturism vibe of Parliament/Funkadelic as an image. He\u2019s all in on the idea of life beyond the stars because, if you ask him about it, he\u2019s met them in person.\n\nHe goes on to talk about an alien encounter he had with bass icon Bootsy Collins. Right from the off, he answers the question that all of us would have and says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t high.\u201d He says the two of them were driving together after a morning fishing trip, and at around midday, \u201cA light hit the car, and a substance like mercury out of the thermometer rolled up the side of the car.\u201d\n\nIn a further interview with the YouTube channel Nowness, he expanded on what happened next: \u201cWe just drove up to my house\u2026 my daughter came outside and said to us, \u2018Y\u2019all look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u2019\u201d Then it gets really weird. Years later, he recalled that, shortly after they got back, his daughter \u201cwas talking about going to bed. We\u2019d (gone fishing) around 9:30 or 10 in the morning. Why would she be going to bed? Time was amiss; we\u2019d never even contemplated the time being missing.\u201d\n\nIn the same conversation, he goes on to talk about how rather than these visitors being invaders or colonisers, he likes to believe they\u2019re our ancestors. That they\u2019re a shared part of our DNA that can help bring us together. Which is the core of all this. For all his talk about out-there concepts we\u2019d normally find in sci-fi films, to him, this is about us realising all that we have in common.\n\nIt makes no sense to discuss the concept of \u2018white music\u2019 and \u2018Black music\u2019 when it should be all about how much we, as humans, can connect with each other. It\u2019s a charming thought, one put best later in the same interview. When asked what he\u2019d like to say to these aliens if given the chance, he says he\u2019d like to ask, \u201cHow do y\u2019all dance? If you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nReal talk, it\u2019s a question we could do a whole lot of good by asking each other first."

            "article_content": "A week after last November\u2019s national election the social media-fed onslaught of conspiracy theories about vote stealing suddenly disappeared. But in line with the typical human-nature aversion to a vacuum, a new conspiracy frenzy immediately arose to fill the void. Multiple sightings of drones in the skies of New Jersey were assigned a range of increasingly outlandish explanations, most of which gained oxygen from the already dense atmosphere of science and government distrust that drove the election.\n\nIt has since turned out that the drones seen over the Garden State were, by and large,\n\nperfectly legal commercial and private drones that were only recently approved to fly at night. To be fair, there are still a couple of sightings not yet explained. But one explanation I particularly enjoyed was in response to a video taken by the former Maryland governor. He insisted that he had captured the threatening visitors on his phone camera, but astronomers told him \u201cwith all respect\u201d that he had instead successfully recorded the twinkling stars of the constellation Orion.\n\nOkay, it is too easy to poke fun. It is also a bit dishonest: There are actually many phenomena that we simply cannot explain, both in the skies and on earth. Indeed, the same day as the first reported sightings of the New Jersey drones, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Accountability convened a hearing entitled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\u201d For clarification, \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena\u201d or \u201cUAP\u201d is the new name for UFO-like things. The change was made to remove \u2014 not entirely successfully \u2014 the stigma attached to people who report UFO sightings.\n\nAs one might expect from this current congressional committee\u2019s makeup and leadership, political and personal axes were finely ground throughout the hearing. But scattered throughout those silly sparks was also some sobering information. Those of you with the stomach for such things can watch the whole 2.5-hour hearing (https://bit.ly/40i9NXE) and come to your own conclusions. I found the following three takeaways from the presentations particularly compelling.\n\nFirst, there is simply no evidence of a concerted deep-state governmental/scientific cover-up or conspiracy about UAP ne\u00e9 UFO sightings. Indeed, the information provided at the hearing was more transparent than one might reasonably expect in such a setting.\n\nSecond, it is clear that these phenomena, many of which are corroborated by visual recordings and additional testimonies from highly credible witnesses, do exist in the real world in ways we can\u2019t yet fathom. For example, just the physics of UAP aerial movements would generate g-forces in the thousands (most humans can survive up to 6 g or so), making them completely beyond our understanding and capabilities.\n\nFinally, despite the alarm raised by many congressional committee members, there is no evidence that these phenomena are reflective of a higher intelligence, much less one that intends harm to the U.S. or to the human species as a whole. There is likely other life out there somewhere in some form, but it is not threatening us. Humans throughout history have too easily named anything they could not explain rationally in terms of some kind of higher power and/or existential threat despite a total lack of evidence.\n\nThe truth is that we really can\u2019t say for sure if there is a higher intelligence out there or not. But humans continue to ascribe the unknown to some kind of more powerful entity, even as science continues to scrape away our ignorance. That said, I actually find it kind of comforting just how much we already know despite the extreme limits of our senses and the relative crudeness of our tools to expand those senses. For example, the microscope was only invented a couple hundred years ago, revealing the much larger and weirder world of microorganisms cohabiting the same space as us!\n\nThere are undoubtedly many further UAP-like revelations in our future. All of these surprises will ultimately turn out to have perfectly natural explanations, i.e., with no need to invoke superior intelligences much less ones with bad intentions towards us. It is true that living within that kind of uncertainty is certainly difficult and even a bit unnerving. But it is a far more authentic and less destructive way of life than making up explanations with no basis in reality.\n\nFintan Steele is an ex-Benedictine monk and priest with a Ph.D. in biology/genetics.

            "article_content": "Over the last year, much of the gen AI hype has focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on what people say. NVIDIA took the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas as an opportunity to announce Cosmos, a new platform for streamlining the development of World Foundation Models (WFMs) that improve how machines perceive, decide, act, and learn from physical sensor data.\n\nA good example is streamlining the development of advanced driver-assistance and autonomous driving systems. The world\u2019s largest carmaker, Toyota, plans to standardize on the NVIDIA DriveOS platform integrated with Cosmos for its next-generation vehicles. Others like Aurora and Continental hope it will streamline the development of autonomous trucks. Others with varying driver assistance and autonomy plans include BYD, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Rivian, and Volvo Cars, among many others.\n\nMore autonomous cars are a big deal, and NVIDIA expects they could drive $5 billion in revenues by 2026. Also, the company received two separate safety certifications for its Drive Hyperion autonomous driving platform and Drive OS vehicle operating system from T\u00dcV Rheinland and T\u00dcV S\u00dcD for cybersecurity and safety. Although this is specific to cars, it speaks volumes about NVIDIA\u2019s progress in readying the platform for safety-critical use cases required for other use cases like robots, industrial control systems and electronics design exemplified by partners like Siemens Digital Industries and Cadence.\n\nNVIDIA has also launched Mega, an Omniverse Blueprint for developing and optimizing physical AI and robot fleets at scale in a digital twin before deploying it into facilities. For example, Accenture is working with KION Group, a supply chain solutions company, to use Mega for optimizing operating in retail, consumer packaged goods and parcel services scenarios. Enterprises can digitalize their facilities using a combination of design files, video, lidar and synthetically generated data to create and test robot management approaches.\n\nThe three big takeaways include how this:\n\nenhances AI workflows spanning how people think and write about the world with physical sensor data from cameras, lidar, and radar. builds on NVIDIA\u2019s extensive ecosystem of Universal Scene Description (USD) tooling. presents a new three computer paradigm that streamlines workflows across AI development, simulation & testing, and deployment on robots, vehicles, and industrial control systems.\n\nBuilding on LLM gains\n\nWFMs are an emerging category of foundation models trained to understand, predict, and generate the behavior of physical environments, much like LLMs do for text. Cosmos is trained using diffusion and autoregressive models rather than the transformers underlying most LLMs.\n\nWFMs are trained on video, sensor feed and physics simulation to capture spatial relationships between objects and how they interact in the world. In contrast, LLMs are trained primarily on text to learn nuances of language, grammar and the relationship between concepts.\n\nWFMs are better at generating realistic video sequences and sensor data representations predicting future states of physical environments and generating synthetic data from training robots and autonomous cars. LLMs are better at writing code and summaries, identifying relationships between concepts, and translating plain language prompts into appropriate formats for other tools.\n\nA good example lies in connecting the dots between text and physics-based world representations. For example, a user can describe an edge case in plain language that characterizes the environment, objects, actions and unusual or challenging conditions. The LLM could translate this into a structured representation for a 3D scene graph suitable for the WFM.\n\nComplementing USD\n\nCosmos builds on NVIDIA's considerable work in promoting USD as a standard glue for representing 3D data across vendors and various open-source tools. This provides a more consistent data representation and improves collaboration. However, it does not inherently address the challenges of simulating physically accurate scenarios that require additional tooling and integration.\n\nMore significantly, Cosmos also provides an ecosystem of tools to improve data processing, curation, and labeling. This will be a bigger deal than it sounds because it will make adding metadata and context to existing data sets easier to improve processing and reduce hallucinations when processed by other neural (ML/AI) or symbolic tools (most enterprise apps and logical software code).\n\nNew deployment paradigm\n\nThe last big takeaway is NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cthree computer\u201d paradigm that promises to streamline the development of physics-aware applications across training, simulation, and deployment. The three computers include:\n\nThe DGX platform, hosted in data centers, allows developers to train physics-aware models.\n\nOmniverse and OVX platforms help test and refine realistic digital twins and simulations in virtual environments that mimic real-world physics.\n\nAGX is an energy-efficient supercomputer for running AI inference on embedded systems like cars and robots and distilling relevant updates for continual learning from real-world perception, decisions, and action.\n\nThe big deal is that these three components are engineered to work together and make it easier to feed data and insights from real-world deployments into the training and simulation phases. For example, data from the AGX system could highlight areas where the models excel or need improvement. The integration also makes it easier to continually refine and enhance the AI models to be more accurate and robust.\n\nMy take\n\nIt's important to note that none of these developments are coming completely out of the blue. This is a consolidation and simplification of workflows across the ecosystem of chips and applications NVIDIA has already worked on for digital twins, simulation, and AI. This will simplify the process of developing physical AI systems across different tools and vendors.\n\nAnother thing to note is that competition is heating up for new AI-specific chips from big vendors like AMD and Intel, along with a host of neural-chip startups. Some of these solutions may support better price/energy/performance benefits on various AI-specific training and inferencing processes. However, none of them address the considerable data integration, contextualization, and labeling challenges required to build more trustworthy and capable AI systems, which NVIDIA has and continues to do.\n\nThere has also been considerable speculation that the AI bubble will soon burst due to over-investment in data centers and questionable returns from existing approaches. I think the dawn of physical AI opens a new chapter of growth in applying AI to more practical problems. However, this will require finding better ways to organize and contextualize data across many complementary approaches rather than just throwing exabytes of data at a giant AI model."

            "article_content": "Jan. 7\u2014They're here, but they're \"docile.\"\n\nThat's the description that Chris Sanders, a paranormal investigator out of Phoenix, Arizona, uses when he describes the level of ghostly activities in Lockport.\n\nSanders is currently visiting Niagara County at a friend's house in Lockport, who is also subbing as a camera person for his jaunts into the unknown. They, and others, have been visiting the local hot spots of haunted encounters in the area. After investigating, which usually consists of staying a night in the so-called \"haunted houses\" Sanders then videos of the experience onto his Youtube channel, which can be found through the social media handle: CLS Paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I have a friend who lives out here and I came out here to visit him. I actually drove from Arizona and he asked me, because he watches my show, if I wanted to do a couple ghost hunts out here. I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we've done quite a few places,\" Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander's visited such spots like Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \"intrigued\" by him than \"aggressive\" Sanders said that was fine with him. He's still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some of these places I've done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they're more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I've been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost hunting places. Here in Lockport that's not the case,\" he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what's unknown \u2014 the big questions like \"what happens when we die?\" \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There's millions of ghost hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \"spirit dice,\" as well as white noise boxes and light-up \"rem pods\" that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he's trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\"You usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\" he said. \"A residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that's almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\"I walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes its a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014but I asked them. I said, 'I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?' They all started laughing,\" he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \"concrete evidence\" of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \"something\" in the attic.\n\n\"We set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camera woman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children that were haunting the second floor.\n\n\"She was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \"haunted\" in the meantime.\n\n\"I will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they're off (for more ghost hunting trips),\" he said."

            "article_content": "Part of what makes The Sims 4 such an enduring favorite among cozy gamers is that the options for how to play are basically endless. For some, it\u2019s all about Create a Sim, while others spend hours building their dream house in Build Mode. And then, there\u2019s always those generational challenges, carefully crafted a legacy family with specific rules and specifications. But it\u2019s not just Simmers who have endless options in The Sims 4. Their Sims have a true wealth of options when it comes to their chosen career, and some are better than others.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nFor those who have the game fully loaded with Expansion Packs, there are over 50 career options in The Sims 4. While some are part-time ways for teenage Sims to earn a few Simoleons, many are in-depth adventures up the career ladder to the covered Career Level 10. But which Sims 4 careers are the very best? Based on their depth and engagement, these 10 top the list.\n\n1. Reaper\n\nA Reaper gets to work in The Sims 4 Life & Death\n\nExpansion: Life & Death\n\nThe Reaper career is the newest addition to The Sims 4, and it shows. This career brings everything gamers love about Active careers, while polishing up some of the issues that earlier careers bring into play. Starting as a Grimtern and working their way up, Sims in this career field learn to reap souls and comfort the beloved they\u2019ve left behind.\n\nDoes it get a little bit repetitive eventually? Yes. But there are a good variety of daily tasks and showing up to work with The Grim Reaper himself never quite gets old.\n\n2. Detective\n\nClose the case in Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAn oldie but still a goodie, the Detective career was one of the first Active options in The Sims 4. In this job, Sims spend each day collecting clues to solve cases \u2013 with the active help of the big gamer in the sky, of course.\n\nThis is quite an involved career, with players engaged in tasks like visiting crime scenes and interrogating suspects. For those looking to feel involved in their Sims\u2019 career paths, it\u2019s a must.\n\n3. Doctor\n\nScanning patients is part of a day\u2019s work in The Sims 4 doctor career\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAnother entry from the original trio of Active careers is the Doctor role. Starting with patient intake and cleaning a lot of hospital beds, Sims work their way up to diagnosing and treating patients over time.\n\nThe tasks for this career can get repetitive once you reach the higher ranks, but it\u2019s nearly always entertaining. It\u2019s also hard work, with many steps to diagnose each patient before the day is done. Unfortunately, the Doctor career remains glitchy to this day, but that doesn\u2019t fully remove its charm.\n\n4. Freelancer\n\nFreelance candlemaking is a thing in Eco Lifestyle\n\nExpansion: Base Game, with more options from packs like Paranormal Stuff and Eco Lifestyle\n\nJust like in real life, the Freelancer career comes with its pros and minuses in The Sims 4. Your Sim will sign up with a specific agency based on their skills, from becoming a Freelance Writer, Crafter, or Artist down to investigating the Paranormal.\n\nThe Freelancer career can be glitchy, but when it works, it\u2019s very engaging. Sims will accept and complete gigs, with increasingly high-paid options as they successfully finish prior jobs. Ticking off the tasks can keep gamers engaged far more successfully than heading to the office for an Active career.\n\n5. Actor\n\nPut on a show as a Sims 4 actor\n\nExpansion: Get Famous\n\nFor Sims who dream of the spotlight, the Actor career offers an opportunity to rise through the ranks from one-off commercial gigs to their own feature film. Added three years after the initial introduction of Active careers, the Actor profession does away with some of the issues from earlier iterations.\n\nOn-the-job tasks include getting hair and makeup done, getting to know co-stars and the crew, and rehearsing lines before finally filming some scenes. This career offers some flexibility as players can choose which acting gigs their Sim takes on, making it a more dynamic option than straightforward ladder-climbing careers.\n\n6. Interior Decorator\n\nShowing off swatches as a Sims 4 interior decorator\n\nExpansion: Dream Home Decorator\n\nFor those Simmers who spend more time in Build Mode than anywhere else, this is the Active career to go for. As an Interior Decorator, Sims will get to step inside homes around town, remodeling them with new decor and furniture.\n\nThe gameplay for this career involves listening to clients and then getting into the Build Mode nitty gritty to bring them to life. While there isn\u2019t as much variety here as with some other Active careers, it\u2019s a great choice for those who treat The Sims 4 like an interior decorating game anyway.\n\n7. Video Game Streamer\n\nGaming for fun and profit in The Sims 4\n\nExpansion: High School Years\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the inception of it all, but there are few things quite as entertaining as having a Sim get really into gaming. The High School Years expansion added a new part-time career that reflects the reality of streaming as a way to make a living in the modern era.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t as dynamic as an Active career or as in-depth as a full-time profession, the Video Game Streamer job is just a ton of fun. Sims raise that video gaming skill and spend time streaming, earning money through tips from fans and learning the ropes for the Entrepreneurial skill. Whether it\u2019s a gateway to a longer-term Freelance career or your Sim\u2019s supplement during college, this part-time job is one of the best.\n\n8. Culinary\n\nEven home chefs know how to hustle in Sims 4\n\nExpansion: Base Game\n\nSome Simmers are in it for the cooking, as the constant stream of new cooking-centered content for The Sims 4 can attest. The Culinary career has been around from the beginning, but it\u2019s still one of the best thanks to the constant addition of new recipes and ways to prep food.\n\nThe Culinary career isn\u2019t an active one, but players will spend plenty of time cooking or mixing drinks for the daily tasks. With so many recipes to choose from and the recently expanded array of kitchen gadgets, Simmers can really get a lot out of this career even if they\u2019re only with their Sims at home.\n\n9. Business Owner\n\nSell clothes, cupcakes, and more in The Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nOwning a business doesn\u2019t always work as EA intended, but it\u2019s still one of the most interesting ways to deeply engage with the work element of The Sims 4. Sims can own a variety of business lots, from retail to bakeries and food carts and beyond.\n\nRunning these businesses is a full-on process, from buying or building the lot to creating and selling merchandise. Set prices, engage with customers, and get ready to earn\u2026 or not. This way of bringing in Simoleons is a bit like owning a real business and will take over the day-to-day, but some Simmers like it that way.\n\n10. Landlord\n\nCollecting rent in The Sims 4 Landlord career\n\nExpansion: For Rent\n\nOpinions on The Sims 4: For Rent are a bit mixed, but the ability to buy Residential Rentals and become a landlord is one of the best things the game offers. It\u2019s incredibly dynamic, with the ability to fill an owned unit with tenants, create house rules, and more.\n\nAs a Property Manager, players enjoy a variety of interactions that let them engage with their tenants, including asking about the living conditions and evicting them. Notifications will bring in various issues that Sims need to manage in their units, keeping gamers on their toes \u2013 sometimes a little too much."

A humpback whale and her calf are performing acrobatics. They throw themselves into the air before slamming down their black and white pectoral fins into the sapphire-coloured sea.\n\nThis spectacle is taking place just metres from the shoreline. \u201cThey\u2019re having the time of their life!\u201d, a stranger next to me exclaims. As am I \u2013 and I\u2019ve only been here for less than 48 hours.\n\nPart of the appeal is feeling like I\u2019ve stepped off the tourist trail on an island that has been highlighted by Abta, the travel association, as one of this year\u2019s top destinations to watch.\n\nTasmania receives around 1.3 million visitors per year, most of whom come from Victoria on the mainland (Melbourne sits around 250km/155 miles north across the treacherous Bass Strait). Fewer than 30,000 British tourists come to Tasmania each year, most of them to go bushwalking during the Australian summer.\n\nIn an effort to boost winter visits, Tourism Tasmania last year adopted an unorthodox approach to attracting Australian visitors by advertising a series of voluntary \u201codd jobs\u201d, including wombat walker, oyster organiser, stargazer and paranormal investigator. Thousands entered for a chance to win one of the 10 places, and it\u2019s not hard to see why.\n\n\u201cTassie\u201d offers the best of Australia in microcosm. The island state, which is around the size of Ireland, encompasses diverse landscapes, weird and wonderful wildlife, and some of the best beaches I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s Australia\u2019s most heavily forested and mountainous state with 450 peaks to explore, 19 national parks and some of the planet\u2019s cleanest air thanks to its isolated position in the Southern Ocean.\n\nI have come here on a week-long road trip. After acclimatising in the easygoing capital Hobart, I head north to Freycinet National Park, a reserve on the east coast Freycinet Peninsula of beaches, forests and the pink granite Hazards mountains.\n\nWineglass Bay on the Freycinet Peninsula (Photo: Jason Charles Hill)\n\nI\u2019m staying at Freycinet Lodge, the only accommodation in the park. Overlooking Coles Bay, there\u2019s a sense of being embedded in nature. Wallabies and possums make frequent appearances.\n\nA hike across the peninsula to Wineglass Bay is taxing on the knees, but sinking my toes into the soft sand on what is frequently voted one of the world\u2019s best beaches, is worth every drop of sweat. Best of all, there are fewer than 10 of us here, despite this being one of Tasmania\u2019s most photographed places.\n\nIt\u2019s a recurring talking point on my journey. The east coast, in particular, is embroidered with white beaches fringed by turquoise water, with nobody else on them. It feels almost perverse.\n\nMy 1,330km route around the top half of the island is mostly spent on three major roads. The landscape shifts from plateaus to dense forest and mountains by the hour, via vineyards, sheep farms, beaches and remote towns.\n\nOn the north-east coast, the water and white sand of the Bay of Fires region contrast with granite rocks that are splashed with bright orange lichen.\n\nAfter an idyllic afternoon of beach-hopping, I head to the Bay of Fires Bush Retreat, a boutique campsite with 10 luxurious bell tents.\n\nThe camp\u2019s communal spaces are designed for mingling and I\u2019m soon drinking local pinot noir and trading stories with guests from Brisbane and New Zealand around the fire pit. Waking to the dawn chorus from the comfort of my cosy bed is a magical experience.\n\nEn route to the riverside city of Launceston, I stop for a session at Derby\u2019s floating sauna. Located on a tranquil lake that\u2019s home to platypus, the picture windows frame views of the bush that attracts mountain bikers to the area.\n\nLaunceston was a Unesco City of Gastronomy in 2021 and, appropriately, I\u2019m staying at Stillwater, one of Tasmania\u2019s most decorated restaurants, that\u2019s also home to seven chic bedrooms. Housed in an 1830s former flour mill on the edge of the Tamar River, it\u2019s an atmospheric space where I enjoy a dinner of pink ling \u2013 a sweet, mild-tasting fish \u2013 with braised leek, lemon risotto and courgette.\n\nCataract Gorge is a glorious nature reserve on the edge of the city that\u2019s flanked by mountain ash trees and roamed by peacocks. I take an early-morning stroll along this dramatic canyon, which has the world\u2019s longest single-span chairlift and an Art Deco lido.\n\nHursey Seafoods is award-winning (Photo: Lusy Productions/Discover Tasmania)\n\nMy next destination is Stanley, a fishing village on a peninsula on the north-west coast that feels like the end of the earth. It\u2019s the home of Hursey Seafoods, a restaurant that recently took the top spot at the National Seafood Industry Awards. The crayfish is the biggest and juiciest I\u2019ve tried. I sleep it off at the Ship Inn, a former sailor\u2019s tavern.\n\nFurther south, Cradle Mountain is a Unesco-protected national park of glacial lakes, ancient rainforest, dramatic gorges and mountain peaks, where winter visitors might see the Aurora Australis, or southern lights.\n\nIt\u2019s not long before I spot wallabies, echidnas and wombats. A walk around Dove Lake, surrounded by the snow-capped massif, is a delight, from where I head to Devils at Cradle, a sanctuary for the endangered Tasmanian devil. These carnivorous marsupials \u2013 whose bite can crush bone \u2013 are being reintroduced to the Australian mainland.\n\nDove Lake in Cradle Mountain National Park (Photo: Posnov/Getty Images)\n\nWhile south of Hobart, Bruny Island is home to a rare and native albino wallaby population that thrives against the odds.\n\nThe west coast fishing town of Strahan is my final stop before Hobart. I wander along Ocean Beach, a stretch of golden sand spanning more than 40km. The sun is shining \u2013 no small thing for a settlement that only experiences around 17 clear days annually.\n\nEarly the next morning I board a Gordon River Cruise to glimpse one of the world\u2019s last temperate wildernesses, an expedition that glides through mirror-calm waters and the notorious Hells Gates, where Macquarie Harbour meets the Southern Ocean. It\u2019s a stirring end to a trip that I\u2019m not ready to end.\n\nA passenger on board asks, \u201cAre you visiting the mainland?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asked repeatedly on the road trip. With more hiking trails than traffic, outstanding wilderness and a world-class food scene, it has barely crossed my mind."

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

Maximize the Value of Your Affiliate Partnerships!\n\nAs digital marketing has evolved over the last couple of decades, companies have used affiliate marketing to drive traffic to their websites and generate sales. This article will explore how affiliate coupon codes can affect your brand and how Bluepear\u2019s advanced brand protection technology can address the challenges while ensuring fair traffic generation.\n\nUnderstanding the Potential Challenges of Coupon Affiliates\n\n1. The Potential Impact of Coupon Codes on Your Marketing Funnel\n\nThese coupon codes often appeal to existing customers instead of attracting new ones. Usually, those who seek out affiliate coupon codes are already familiar with your brand and are ready to make a purchase. These customers likely had the opportunity to learn about your products through ads, organic searches, word of mouth, or an influencer who is affiliated with your program.\n\nThus, affiliate coupon sites can end up at the bottom of the conversion funnel, which can lead to additional costs for traffic that has already been attracted to your site through other channels.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\n2. Coupon Codes Can Lead to Discount-Seeking Behavior & Lower Cart Values\n\nCoupons incentivize discounts merely by their nature. As with many brands, your goal for offering a deal will likely attract new and repeat customers. However, this can also backfire because it teaches consumers to secure the lowest price possible for the products they want. This can result in reduced average order value (AOV) over time, which can impact profitability. Encouraging a reliance on discounts can be an unintentional consequence of coupon affiliates.\n\n3. Customer Frustrations & the Risk to Brand Reputation\n\nCoupon affiliate programs work to accomplish their own business goals, which is to attract a constant stream of traffic to their own websites. To do this, they scrape all the possible codes and distribute them all, whether they are valid or not. This can lead to customers coming across expired coupon codes, which may create a less favorable experience with your brand.\n\n4. A Lack of Transparency in Coupon Code Distribution\n\nA common problem with affiliate coupon sites is that they often fail to disclose the methods of attracting users to their websites. They may be driving traffic through paid search campaigns, deceptive SEO practices, or unapproved partnerships with other websites and marketing platforms. This lack of clarity can make it more difficult for brands to formulate an effective marketing strategy for their affiliate programs.\n\nAffiliates who don\u2019t disclose their network connections and activities leave many brands in the dark about whether their codes are being used in ways that decrease the value of their brand, if and when violations occur, and what specific affiliates or third-party partners engage in the misuse of these codes. This uncertainty can challenge trust and hinder collaborative relationships between brands and affiliate partners.\n\nHow Bluepear Can Help Brands Track Coupon Affiliates\n\nThough coupon affiliate programs are often seen as a challenge in digital marketing, Bluepear can provide a solution with its brand protection technology. Below is a hypothetical brand, \u201cJam,\u201d to illustrate how Bluepear\u2019s technology helps combat affiliate coupon misuse.\n\nStep 1: Identifying Violations\n\nJam has to establish clear guidelines in its affiliate program terms and conditions. These terms include prohibitions on promotion through coupon codes and brand bidding.\n\nThough the policies clearly outline these guidelines, Jam notices that users access codes after searching ads that feature phrases like \u201c20% off Jam coupon.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Using Bluepear to Detect Coupon Misuse\n\nJam partners with Bluepear, and with their help, they are able to gain visibility into how their coupons are being misused. Bluepear makes this possible through tech-driven features:\n\nFiltering for Coupon Codes\n\nBluepear provides Jam with a platform that includes a coupon code filter, which is built to identify all instances in which the brand\u2019s name is associated with coupon advertisements.\n\nAnalyzing Violations\n\nThe Bluepear platform provides a comprehensive analysis that shows specific violators, including insightful information such as screenshots where search results show the brand\u2019s name and mentioned discounts. The platform also captures landing pages where these instances of misuse are found and the affiliate IDs linked to these actions.\n\nBuilding Evidence\n\nBluepear collects and stores all affiliate violations, helping Jam gather the evidence required to address the issue with their affiliate networks or partners.\n\nStep 3: Taking Action\n\nBeyond identifying and collecting proof of coupon code misuse, Bluepear\u2019s system also includes a feature that will send the affiliate a notification letter with attached evidence. This feature will streamline the process of addressing affiliate program misuse, save Jam precious time, and ensure affiliate accountability.\n\nWhy Choose Bluepear for Protecting Your Brand?\n\nBluepear is proud to offer an all-encompassing solution for managing and monitoring partners participating in \u0430ffiliate programs. Its features will empower your brand to:\n\nIdentify Misuse at Scale\n\nBluepear\u2019s analytic tools will help your team unveil any patterns of voucher misuse among your affiliate partners and networks.\n\nEnforce Compliance with Your Terms & Conditions\n\nThe brand can notify affiliates who violate program terms directly through the Bluepear platform. The brand can attach screenshots or links as proof.\n\nOptimize Traffic Generation\n\nWith increased transparency with traffic sources, your brand can ensure that your affiliate coupon codes are being used by new customers only.\n\nPreserve Your Brand\u2019s Reputation\n\nBluepear\u2019s active monitoring of coupon code misuse will help you address the issues of distribution of codes and maintain your brand\u2019s reputation.\n\nMaximize the Value of Your Affiliate Partnerships!\n\nWhile affiliate coupon codes may appear to be a simple and effective way to boost sales, they can come with challenges, including potential impacts on AOV and brand reputation, which may outweigh the perceived benefits. However, with the help of Bluepear, you can regain control over your affiliate program. Discover how Bluepear\u2019s brand technology can safeguard your brand and optimize your affiliate marketing strategy today.\n\nDigital Trends partners with external contributors.

            "article_content": "Source: Creatista/Shutterstock\n\nThe linguistic contributions Gen Zers brought to our society are officially vintage in the face of Gen Alpha\u2019s influence. Born after 2010, this iPad generation is fluent in a rapidly evolving language that leaves many parents scratching their heads.\n\nWords and phrases that once felt like the cutting edge of cool, like \"lit\" or \"fire,\" are now gathering digital dust. For parents, it feels like the gap between generations has never been wider, as our teens communicate in a code of memes, viral trends, and game references. Parents find themselves asking, \"Is this a curse, a dance move, or a video game boss I should know about?\"\n\nTrying to have a conversation with a Gen Alpha teen can feel like stepping into a never-ending \"Skibidi Toilet\" meme\u2014bizarre, fast-paced, and hard to follow. It\u2019s not just about knowing the words; it\u2019s about understanding the cultural ecosystem those words belong to.\n\nMany parents express frustration, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re not speaking the same language anymore,\u201d or outright dismiss the new slang as being too reductionist, or degenerate. What was once straightforward communication now feels like navigating an inside joke. However, by embracing the nuances of our teens\u2019 worldview, we can begin to bridge the communication gap.\n\nSpeaking Gen Alpha\n\nDescribed by some as \"cringe\" or even \"brain rot,\" this generation\u2019s slang often leaves parents feeling out of the loop, and sometimes downright stupid, as they attempt to decode it. Terms like \"negative aura\" have replaced the familiar Gen Z phrase \"bad vibes,\" and while the meaning may be similar, the shift in language can make parents feel like they\u2019re always a step behind.\n\nTake the word \"sigma,\" for example. To Gen Alpha, calling someone \"sigma\" means they\u2019re cool or a leader. Meanwhile, \"Ohio\" has taken on the meaning of something cringe-worthy or embarrassing. And if your teens say they \"have rizz,\" don\u2019t panic\u2014the word was added to the dictionary in 2023 and just means that they have charm or charisma.\n\nParenting Toward Individuation\n\nAt the heart of every generation\u2019s linguistic evolution is the desire to differentiate themselves from those who came before. Each generation creates new phrases and trends not only to connect with their peers on a deeper level but also to separate themselves from previous generations. This creates a social gap that can make communication with parents feel strained.\n\nThe culture Gen Alpha is creating\u2014through slang, social media trends, and online memes\u2014is a living, breathing expression of their values, humor, worldview, and communication style. It is important to remember that the teenage years are a time of individuation, socialization, and identity formation.\n\nThanks to social media, Gen Alpha slang has evolved more rapidly but still serves the same purpose, which is for adults to not understand. Teens know they are at times annoying their parents, and they mean to. It\u2019s important to allow our teens to have their own language and space to be themselves. While researching the new slang is an option, asking your child what they mean, or reflecting back what you understood, will help your teen feel heard. Curiosity is the most important aspect of parenting; rather than trying to crack the code of Gen Alpha slang, the key is being attuned to their emotions.\n\nFrom Big Sad to Big Happy\n\nAs confusing as Gen Alpha\u2019s communication style may seem, it's important to remember that this is developmentally appropriate and a natural part of the individuation process.\n\nAs parents, we have the privilege of witnessing our children\u2019s identities unfold, and by embracing their unique expressions, we can bridge the generational gap and foster deeper connections."

A new study published in the journal Science describes how anthropogenic air pollution impacts the process of the formation of ice from supercooled cloud water droplets, which impacts our climate.\n\n\"There was an 8% reduction in cloud cover and an 18% reduction in cloud optical thickness,\" according to the study. \"Additionally, daily glaciation-induced snowfall accumulations reached 15 millimeters. Glaciation events downwind of industrial aerosol hot spots indicate that anthropogenic aerosols likely serve as ice-nucleating particles.\"\n\nDo you worry about air pollution in your town?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nResearchers studied cloud formations near 67 major industrial sites around the world. They discovered that pollution particles trigger ice formation, leading to snowfall that creates noticeable gaps or holes in cloud cover.\n\nWhy are air pollution's effects on cloud formation important?\n\n\"The findings indicate that industrial aerosols facilitate the formation of ice within clouds rather than just liquid droplets,\" according to the One Green Planet report. \"This ice formation not only contributes to localized snowfall but also affects the physical properties of clouds. Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved. Models failed to explain the record heat observed in 2023. Climate models are essential tools for enhancing our understanding and forecasting of climate behavior across seasonal to centennial time frames.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you believe there are factories near you causing undue pollution, you can also look into getting involved locally through community organizations directly or through donations.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n\n\n"

One such revolutionary moment is being celebrated in 2025, which the United Nations has declared to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. This marks the centenary of the advent of quantum mechanics, which began in a flurry of papers 100 years ago. Just as it would be impossible to make sense of modern biology without Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, our fundamental understanding of the physical world is now rooted in quantum principles. Modern physics is quantum physics.\n\nThe word quantum refers to the way matter absorbs or releases energy \u2014 in discrete packets, or quanta. Its use in physics comes from the German word quant, which is derived from a Latin term meaning \u2018how much\u2019. In around 1900, physicists such as Max Planck and Albert Einstein began to describe, in an ad hoc way, why several phenomena of the subatomic realm could not be explained using the classical mechanics developed by Isaac Newton and others some two centuries earlier. Then, in 1925, quantum came to be used to describe the fundamentals of an entirely new form of mechanics \u2014 the branch of physics that describes the relationship between forces and the motion of physical objects.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nAs science historian Kristian Camilleri describes in an Essay on the startling developments of that year and those that followed, the physicist Werner Heisenberg travelled to the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea in the summer of 1925 in search of relief from severe hay fever. Shortly after this, he submitted to the journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik a paper whose title translates as \u2018On quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relationships\u2019 (W. Heisenberg Z. Physik 33, 879\u2013893; 1925). This prompted further studies in the following months by Heisenberg and his close collaborators, as well as work using an alternative approach by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\nThe revolution did not begin with physicists throwing away the laws of classical mechanics, but with their radically reinterpreting classical concepts such as energy and momentum. However, it did require its initiators to abandon dearly held common-sense ideas \u2014 for example, the expectation that subatomic objects such as particles have a well-defined position and momentum at any given time. Instead, the physicists found that natural phenomena had an inherently unknowable nature. Classical physics, in other words, is only an approximate representation of reality, and manifests itself only at the macroscopic level. A century on, this insight into the nature of the physical world still thrills and bamboozles in equal measures. Many Nature readers will know about the philosophical quandaries raised by quantum cats that are simultaneously dead and alive, and about the industry that is growing around quantum computing.\n\nOthers will know how quantum ideas gave rise to the lasers that beam information through the cables of the Internet, and the transistors that provide the processing power of electronic chips. But quantum ideas also shape our understanding of nature, at all levels, explaining why solid objects don\u2019t fall apart and how stars shine and, ultimately, die.\n\nA quantum year\n\nCommemorative events are being planned all over the world for the coming 12 months. They include an opening ceremony for the UN year at the headquarters of the UN scientific organization UNESCO in Paris in February; special events at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California, in March; and a workshop for physicists on Heligoland in June. The organizers\u2019 collective ambition is to celebrate not just the centenary of quantum mechanics, but also the science and applications that arose from it in the past century \u2014 and to explore how quantum physics might bring further change in the century to come.\n\nThis billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed?\n\nIn May, Ghana, the country that originally proposed that the UN proclaim 2025 the year of quantum science, is hosting an international conference on the topic in Kumasi. And in August, science historians will meet to celebrate the quantum century in Salvador de Bahia in Brazil.\n\nThis meeting will be the high point of a 20-year research programme that set out to re-examine the development of quantum theory. One major aim of that work, says historian Michel Janssen at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was to establish the contributions of a collective of scientists, many of whom \u2014 particularly women \u2014 have not been recognized in the history of the field.\n\nThese \u201chidden figures\u201d include Lucy Mensing, who was a member of the same group as Heisenberg and worked out some of the first applications of his quantum-mechanical theory, says Daniela Monaldi, a historian at York University in Toronto, Canada. One of the most notable events of the year will be the publication of a biographical volume of essays on 16 of them, Women in the History of Quantum Physics.\n\nFor all that it has already brought, the quantum revolution still has unfinished business. In the years in which researchers were laying the foundations of quantum mechanics, they also began to rebuild other branches of physics \u2014 such as the study of electromagnetism, and states of matter \u2014 from quantum foundations. They also looked to extend their theories to encompass objects that move at close to light speed, something that the original quantum theory did not. These efforts drastically expanded the scope of quantum science and led researchers to develop the standard model of particles and fields, a process that finally came together in the 1970s.\n\n\u2018A truly remarkable breakthrough\u2019: Google\u2019s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone\n\nThe standard model has been incredibly successful, culminating in the 2012 discovery of its linchpin elementary particle, the Higgs boson. But these extensions lie on less-solid theoretical ground than quantum mechanics does \u2014 and leave several phenomena unexplained, such as the nature of the \u2018dark matter\u2019 that seems to greatly outweigh conventional, visible matter in the wider cosmos. Moreover, one important phenomenon, gravity, still resists being quantized.\n\nOther conceptual problems of quantum physics remain open. In particular, researchers struggle to understand what exactly happens when experiments \u2018collapse\u2019 the fuzzy probabilities of quantum objects into one precise measurement, a key step in creating the \u2014 still remorselessly classical \u2014 macroscopic world we live in. Over the past few decades, researchers have been developing ways to turn these quirks of quantum reality into useful technologies. The resulting applications in computing, ultra-secure communications and innovative scientific instruments are still in their nascent stages.\n\nQuantum theory keeps on giving. This year is an opportunity to celebrate and to make the broader public aware of the role that quantum physics has in their lives \u2014 and to inspire future generations, whoever they are and wherever they are in the world, to contribute to another quantum century."

            "article_content": "Demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) services is being cited as the reason why spending on datacentre hardware and software hit a record high in 2024.\n\nAccording to figures from IT analyst Synergy Research Group, total spending in the datacentre hardware and software market was up 34% year-on-year during 2024, as a result of hyperscale providers and private enterprises looking to kit out AI-ready server farms.\n\nJohn Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, said this trend had led to more investment in graphics processing units (GPU), which had in turn \u201clit a fire under a market\u201d that was already \u201cchugging along nicely\u201d.\n\nAs a result, the datacentre hardware and software market enjoyed record growth rates in 2024, with total sales in excess of $280bn, which he described as unprecedented results.\n\n\u201cWhile the ongoing success of public cloud has been the main driving force behind datacentre investments for well over a decade now, no one imagined a 2024 market for datacentre gear reaching over $280bn,\u201d said Dinsdale.\n\nThese figures are based on actual sales data from the first three quarters of 2024, combined with Synergy\u2019s own fourth quarter forecast data for the datacentre hardware and software market.\n\nThe Synergy data shows that sales of datacentre kit to public cloud providers were up 50% in 2024, while the amount of spend attributed to enterprises was also up 21% year-on-year. \u201cIn recent years, growth in the enterprise sector has been rather anaemic, [and] for over 10 years now, cloud providers have increasingly driven the market for datacentre gear \u2013 and Synergy\u2019s five-year forecast shows there will be no letup in this trend,\u201d said Dinsdale.\n\nRead more about datacentres and generative AI At AWS Re:Invent 2024, CEO Matt Garman shared details of how its GenAI technologies are helping enterprises accelerate the pace of Microsoft and VMware datacentre migrations.\n\nJensen Huang used the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings to discuss the massive growth in accelerated datacentre computing experienced by Nvidia.\n\nPublic cloud providers now account for more than half of the spend (55%) in the datacentre hardware and software market, Dinsdale continued, up from 20% 10 years ago. \u201cOur forecast shows it reaching almost 65% five years from now,\u201d he added.\n\nAround 85% of the spend in this market is generated by the sale of servers, storage and networking kit, confirmed Synergy, while the remaining 15% comes from sales of cloud management, security and virtualisation software.\n\nOne notable trend, called out by Synergy, is how prominently Nvidia now features among the roll-call of datacentre hardware providers, thanks in no small part to the fact its GPU technology is being sold directly to both hyperscalers and enterprises.\n\n\u201cExcluding original design manufacturers, Dell is the overall leader in the server and storage segment, with Inspur being a clear leader in server sales to public cloud providers,\u201d said Synergy, in its research note.\n\n\u201cCisco is the leader in the networking segment, while Microsoft features prominently in the rankings due to its position in server operating systems and virtualisation applications. Nvidia now features heavily as a supplier both to other system vendors and directly to service providers.\u201d"

The billionaire also alleged the company violated its founding claim as a nonprofit by pursuing profit.\n\nOpenAI has denied the allegations.\n\nMusk has proven to be a powerful figure in politics thanks to his proximity to President-elect Donald Trump (Getty Images)\n\nIn December, the artificial intelligence company posted a lengthy, accusatory blog post that included screenshots of emails and texts showing Musk agreeing the company should pivot from nonprofit to for-profit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey claimed Musk bitterly left the company after the board refused to make him CEO or agree to his suggestion to merge Tesla and OpenAI. They claim Musk started his artificial intelligence company, xAI, to compete directly with OpenAI.\n\n\u201cHe says a lot of things, starts them, undoes them, gets sued, sues, gets in fights with the government, gets investigated by the government. That\u2019s just Elon being Elon,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg.\n\nBut Altman believes that he and Musk still share a \u201cconviction\u201d that artificial intelligence is important but needs to be handled carefully.\n\nDespite Musk\u2019s close proximity to Trump \u2013 having been named co-chair of the advisory board the Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 Altman does not think Musk would go so far as to use his power to quash a competitor.\n\n\u201cMay turn out to be proven wrong,\u201d Altman added."

            "article_content": "Sudan has been engulfed in a severe humanitarian and political crisis since the civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted on April 15, 2023. The political vacuum created after the fall of Omar al-Bashir\u2019s regime in 2019, combined with a power struggle and deepening mistrust, has pushed the country into a full-scale civil war. The conflict has not only brought catastrophic consequences for the Sudanese people but has also become more complex due to the involvement of regional and global actors.\n\nIn this context, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative to end the conflict and ensure regional stability has the potential to contribute significantly to resolving the crisis in Sudan while enhancing T\u00fcrkiye's diplomatic presence in Africa. However, it is essential to understand the origins and progression of Sudan's civil war to evaluate the opportunities and challenges of this initiative effectively.\n\nRoots of the Sudan civil war\n\nThe roots of Sudan's civil war can be traced back to the political vacuum that emerged after al-Bashir\u2019s regime was overthrown in April 2019. The power struggle between the two main factions of the transitional government, the SAF and the RSF, has been at the heart of the conflict. Disputes over the integration of the RSF into the national army ignited tensions. The aim of RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, to operate as an independent force clashed with SAF leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan\u2019s opposition to such autonomy. The conflict escalated into open warfare on April 15, 2023, when the RSF launched attacks on military installations in Khartoum, quickly spreading across the country.\n\nThe war has brought Sudan to the brink of a humanitarian and economic collapse. Khartoum has become the epicenter of the conflict, with its infrastructure severely damaged. Interruptions in electricity, water and health care services have displaced millions. According to the United Nations, over 8 million people have been internally displaced, while more than 3 million have fled to neighboring countries. The conflict\u2019s expansion into West Darfur has raised allegations of ethnic cleansing, with the RSF and allied militias accused of targeting the Fur population. Attacks by Baggara Arab militias have drawn significant international condemnation.\n\nCease-fire efforts and failures\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has been further complicated by the competing interests of regional and global actors. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) support for the RSF has led the SAF to view the UAE as a party to the conflict. Meanwhile, Russia's ties with the RSF reflect its ambitions to access Sudan's natural resources and establish a military base on the Red Sea coast. Neighboring countries like Chad, South Sudan and the Central African Republic face mounting challenges from refugee flows and border security issues. The United States and the European Union have highlighted human rights violations in West Darfur, calling for stronger sanctions against the conflict parties.\n\nDespite numerous efforts, cease-fire initiatives have repeatedly failed. Temporary truces brokered by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in May 2023 were quickly violated. The African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have sought to present a comprehensive peace framework. Still, a lack of trust between the warring parties has rendered these efforts unsuccessful. The inability of either side to gain a decisive advantage has prolonged the conflict.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative\n\nT\u00fcrkiye has intensified its efforts to mediate the Sudanese civil war and restore regional stability. On Jan. 4, 2025, Deputy Foreign Minister Burhanettin Duran\u2019s official visit to Port Sudan marked a concrete step in this direction. T\u00fcrkiye has adopted a proactive role by leveraging humanitarian diplomacy, economic cooperation and confidence-building measures to address the conflict.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye possesses three critical advantages in mediating the Sudan crisis. First, its historical ties with Sudan and its humanitarian aid initiatives have fostered a positive perception among the Sudanese public. Second, T\u00fcrkiye's recent normalization of relations with the UAE provides a potential dialogue channel between SAF and RSF. Third, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s capacity to collaborate with regional organizations like the African Union and IGAD enhances the legitimacy of its mediation efforts.\n\nHowever, T\u00fcrkiye faces several challenges in this process. The UAE\u2019s overt support for the RSF may lead the SAF to question T\u00fcrkiye's neutrality. Furthermore, the deep mistrust within Sudan and the competing interests of global actors (the U.S., Russia, China and Iran) limit T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s maneuvering space. Therefore, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s ability to propose practical measures, such as confidence-building steps between the SAF and the UAE, temporary cease-fires and resource-sharing agreements, will be crucial for progress.\n\nThe civil war that began in Sudan on April 15, 2023, has evolved into a crisis that affects not only Sudanese society but also the broader region. The humanitarian disasters and international power struggles stemming from the war make its resolution even more challenging.\n\nIn this context, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s mediation initiative offers a critical opportunity to achieve regional stability and enhance its diplomatic influence in Africa. The success of this initiative hinges on T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s commitment to impartiality, the development of trust-building measures between the warring parties and effective collaboration with regional and international actors. By carefully implementing a multidimensional strategy, T\u00fcrkiye could play a lasting role in resolving the Sudanese crisis and establish a model for addressing similar conflicts in the region. Every step in this process must be meticulously planned and executed to sustain the Sudanese people's hope for peace."

            "article_content": "The war between Russia and Ukraine has become a major geopolitical crisis of the 21st century. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, numerous countries, including the US, UK, EU, Australia, Canada, and Japan, have imposed over 19,535 sanctions against Russia. Their primary focus has been on Russia's financial resources. Approximately half of its total reserves\u2014amounting to $350 billion\u2014were frozen, impacting its foreign currency reserves. According to the EU, approximately 70 percent of the assets of Russian banks were frozen by a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.\n\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine has undoubtedly influenced the relationship between Moscow and its allies. Following the imposition of sanctions on Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a significant swing towards China, signing a series of agreements. The impact of this war was not only on Western and Russian relations but also on Russia's close allies. In this regard, Central Asian countries are now forced to strike a difficult balance between their long-standing relations with Russia and other large powers. While the region has historically relied on Russia for economic and security relationships, the protracted conflict has produced new challenges and possibilities, prompting these countries to pursue a more assertive but cautious foreign policy. At the same time, this upheaval and Russia's dependence on China create a golden opportunity for China to strengthen its ties with Central Asia.\n\nThough, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the five Central Asian countries have gained more political and economic independence. Historically, the Central Asian Republics (CARs)\u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan\u2014have always viewed Russia as a guarantor of security for internal stability and protection against foreign threats. Since their independence from the Soviet Union, Central Asian countries have faced a difficult transition from a common Soviet history to divergent nation-building and economic liberalisation pathways. The five Central Asian states are part of one or more Russian-led organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and the Eurasian Economic Union. These institutions provide forums for regional security and economic partnership with Russia, allowing Russia to maintain a substantial influence in Central Asia's geopolitical landscape. For example, in 2021, when the Taliban reclaimed control in Afghanistan, Russia stationed military equipment on the Tajik-Afghan border as part of the CSTO and conducted joint military drills with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan within 20 kilometres from the Afghan border. This exhibition aims to demonstrate Russia's military readiness in its own backyard in the event of an attack on Central Asia by the Taliban or other terrorist outfits. Similarly, in January 2022, Moscow dispatched soldiers from the CSTO to quash unrest in Kazakhstan.\n\nEconomically, Central Asia also depended on Russia. Moscow's energy and trade participation in the region was intended to lock the governments into a vital dependency, giving the Kremlin control over their internal and foreign policy decisions. For example, Kazakhstan exports 80 percent of its oil through the Caspian oil pipeline, which passes through Russian territory. The number of economic migrants who go to Russia for work is relatively high compared to other migrant workers worldwide. For example, approximately nine million Central Asians live and work in Russia, and practically every major city relies on their labour. According to a June 2022 report by the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM), remittances from Russia to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan accounted for 31 percent and 27 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2020. The majority of this money is expected to come from their employees in Russia. In 2021, remittances from Russia accounted for 55 percent of total transfers to Uzbekistan and 51 percent to Kazakhstan.\n\nHowever, the CARs' internal unrest, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and growing concerns about sovereignty have forced Central Asian nations to look for new allies for long-term security cooperation and are diversifying their foreign policy in an effort to reduce Moscow's influence. Furthermore, Western sanctions on Russia led the CARs to seek alternate channels to sell commodities to the world market. Therefore, CARs have responded to the altering geopolitical landscape in a variety of ways, including preserving economic links with Russia, avoiding outright criticism of Moscow, and increasing partnerships with other global powers such as China, the West, and Turkey.\n\nSince the beginning of the Russian-Ukraine war, Central Asian leaders have also been at the forefront of the so-called \"multi-vector\" foreign policy approach, aiming for balanced relations with Russia as well as other countries such as China, the West, and Turkey. The states of the region refused to accept Russia's recently seized areas in Ukraine, and some issued public declarations in support of Ukraine's territorial integrity in the early days of the 2022 war.\n\nNonetheless, these powers did not openly condemn Vladimir Putin and his \"special military operation.\" Various factors are at play here, including economic reliance, Central Asian immigration, and membership in Russia-led institutions.\n\nMoreover, according to polls, the majority of Central Asians\u201470 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 55 percent in Kazakhstan, and 30 percent in Uzbekistan\u2014ascribe the regions current economic difficulties to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The popularity of the Russian language is declining, entertainment venues are refusing to host Russian performers, and there have been multiple anti-war protests in Almaty and Bishkek. Russia has blocked Central Asian media sites for attempting to provide unbiased coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. The public conversation has returned to the topic of decolonisation.\n\nOn the other hand, Central Asia is a strategically important region for China due to its abundant resources, transit links, and shared border, which are vital for China's security. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) underscores its interest in the region, leveraging growing unease and Russia's focus on Ukraine. Central Asian nations increasingly rely on China for both security and economic resources, potentially challenging Russian dominance and jeopardising Moscow's security interests. Despite a recent decline in historical hostility between the two sides, Russia believes that China's increasing economy might soon enable it to contest Moscow's geopolitical sway in Central Asia.\n\nNotably, China is assisting the CARs in strengthening their security and law enforcement capabilities by capitalising on their worries about Russia. During his visit to Central Asia in September 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that he supported Kazakhstan's territorial integrity in light of these exceptional circumstances. When Xi called the China-Central Asia Summit to order in Xi'an in May 2023, he emphasised the significance of the security, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the CARs. In the midst of the intensifying powerplay among the world's strongest nations, Beijing is taking big measures to expand its regional influence in order to counter the US's encirclement of China.\n\nChina is still dedicated to its long-standing regional objectives. With over half of China's trade and investment going to Kazakhstan, Beijing sees the country as its main economic partner in Central Asia. China's economic interests are further supported by the transportation opportunities that have emerged since Russia's invasion.\n\nBeijing is becoming increasingly interested in playing the role of a security supplier in the region due to its rising concerns about the unrest in Afghanistan and Central Asia. This development may cause future difficulties with Moscow. China-Central Asia's security cooperation has already been strengthened by BRI efforts. More robust security allies like China could undermine Russia's position as the principal security guarantor. China's growing influence in Central Asia after the invasion presents a challenge to Moscow's dominance, potentially altering the dynamics of security cooperation and posing future complications for Moscow.\n\nMd Tariqul Islam Tanvir is Erasmus scholar in the International Master in Central & East European, Russian & Eurasian Studies programme at the University of Glasgow.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nWe welcome your contributions and analysis of global events, and responses to our articles.

This led to a sharp drop in RS's stock price, which hit the floor on Tuesday.\n\nBroker sources have revealed that the rapid decline in RS stock price on January 7 and continued selling pressure on January 8 may be linked to forced sales, likely through investment tools such as block trades in single stock futures or margin borrowing outside of the typical market mechanisms (off-market share pledges).\n\n\"Leverage of RS and RSXYZ shares for liquidity has been a long-standing practice. This approach was feasible during stable or bullish market conditions. However, as multiple cases emerged and share prices faced persistent selling pressure, maintaining liquidity became unsustainable. Compounding this issue is the RS Group's financial difficulties, which have deterred interest in big lot transactions,\" the source said."

Whereas the S&P 500 has gained nearly 189%, not including dividends, over the last 10 years, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia have respectively skyrocketed by 1,350%, 2,710%, and 28,610%!\n\nNVDA Chart\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\n\nThe other consistent characteristic of the Magnificent Seven is their sustained competitive advantages within their respective industries.\n\nNvidia accounts for the lion's share of graphics processing units (GPUs) deployed in enterprise AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nApple is the clear market share leader in domestic smartphone sales with iPhone, and also has the most robust share repurchase program of any publicly traded company.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure is the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform, while Windows remains the world's leading operating systems for personal computers.\n\nAmazon has the world's most-dominant online marketplace, and its cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is No. 1 in global market share.\n\nAlphabet's Google commands almost a 90% share of worldwide internet search, while Google Cloud slots in behind AWS and Azure as the global No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider.\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent of the world's top social media site, Facebook, and attracted 3.29 billion daily active users to its family of apps during the September-ended quarter.\n\nTesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and one of the few very EV-focused businesses to have shifted to recurring profitability.\n\nBut while these seven companies share similar traits, their outlooks meaningfully differ for 2025. As the bull market looks to extend into a third year, one Magnificent Seven stock stands out as a bargain, while another is worth avoiding in 2025.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven Stock to buy hand over fist in 2025: Alphabet\n\nAmong this group of more than a half-dozen outperformers, Alphabet stands out as the cream of the crop in the new year.\n\nThough we'll dive into Alphabet's higher-margin growth opportunities in a moment, the first thing to note is its absolute dominance in internet search. Over the trailing decade, Google has accounted for 89% to 93% of worldwide internet search share. In other words, businesses have made Google their go-to when targeting their message(s) at users, which is typically great news for Alphabet's ad-pricing power.\n\nAlphabet is also the parent company of streaming platform YouTube, which is the second most-visited social site behind Meta's Facebook. The proliferation of Shorts (short-form videos lasting less than 60 seconds), coupled with roughly 2.5 billion monthly active users, should steadily improve YouTube's subscription and ad-pricing power.\n\nTo build on the above, history is most definitely in Alphabet's corner. Even though ad spending tends to be highly cyclical, periods of economic growth last substantially longer than recessions. This is a way of saying that ad-fueled companies like Alphabet spend a considerable portion of their time basking in the sun, rather than sulking under the proverbial clouds.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's longer-term growth prospects primarily hinge on its cloud-service platform. Google Cloud is expected to deliver sustained double-digit revenue growth. Businesses are still in the relatively early stages of increasing their cloud-service spending. Further, Alphabet's incorporation of generative AI solutions into Google Cloud should be beneficial to its customers and dramatically increase operating cash flow from this segment in the latter-half of the decade.\n\nAlphabet's veritable treasure chest of cash on its balance sheet is a competitive edge, as well. It closed out the third quarter with $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which affords a hearty capital-return program. Aside from Apple, no other S&P 500 company has repurchased more of their stock over the last decade than Alphabet -- $286.7 billion, as of Sept. 30, 2024.\n\nLastly, Alphabet's valuation makes sense for opportunistic long-term investors. Its shares are currently valued at 15.7 times forecast cash flow for 2025, which represents a 13% discount to the company's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nA human face emerging from a sea of pixels and circuitry, which is representative or artificial intelligence.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid in the new year: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not all Magnificent Seven components are necessarily worth buying. As we power forward into 2025, the one member I'd suggest steering clear of is none other than Nvidia.\n\nThere are certainly tangible catalysts that explain why Nvidia has gained well over $3 trillion in market value over the last two years. At the top of the list is its utter dominance of AI-GPUs. The company's H100 GPU (commonly referred to as the \"Hopper\") and next-generation Blackwell chip are the \"brains\" of high-compute data centers.\n\nNvidia has also undeniably benefited from AI-GPU scarcity. Demand for the company's AI solutions has handily swamped supply, which has allowed Nvidia to charge a premium price for its products. The end result has been a double-digit point increase in the company's gross margin.\n\nThe concern is that all of Nvidia's catalysts have been more than fully baked into its share price.\n\nFor instance, competition is picking up from all angles. On top of direct GPU developers (e.g., Advanced Micro Devices) increasing their output, Nvidia could lose out on valuable data center real estate because of the actions of its top customers.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are some of Nvidia's core customers by net sales, and they're all developing GPUs to use in their respective data centers. Even though these chips won't match the Hopper or Blackwell in terms of computing speed, they're going to be more readily available and considerably less costly than Nvidia's hardware.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's November victory also adds big-time question marks to Nvidia's future. Trump previously announced plans to implement a 35% tariff on imported goods from China on his first day in office, which could lead to testy trade relations with the world's No. 2 economy. This comes atop Joe Biden's administration restricting shipments of high-powered AI chips and related equipment to China since 2022.\n\nHistory is no friend of Nvidia, either. Over the last three decades, there hasn't been a next-big-thing innovation or technology that's avoided an early stage bubble-bursting event. The cause of these boom-bust cycles is investors overestimating the early stage adoption and/or utility of new technologies. Given that most businesses lack well-defined plans to generate a positive return on their AI investments, it would appear that artificial intelligence is the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nFinally, Nvidia's valuation is worrisome. Although its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't egregiously high, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 32 (which was north of 40 in June and July) is consistent with a multiple where other market-leading businesses rolled over during previous bubble-bursting events.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "article_content": "While some handheld gaming PC manufacturers are busy cornering the comically large form factor market, Lenovo has slipped in to announce several new - and considerably more portable - devices of its own, including the Legion Go 2 and a handheld utilising SteamOS.\n\nStarting with the Legion Go 2, that's Lenovo's currently still-in-prototype second generation handheld gaming PC, which - alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers - sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. It can also sport up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage, to further boost its beefy credentials.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no hint of a release window or price for the Legion Go 2 just yet, with Lenovo instead choosing to focus its attention on its other newly announced handheld gaming PC: the more modest, and more imminently available, Legion Go S.\n\nA prototype of Lenovo's Legion Go 2. | Image credit: Lenovo\n\nThe Legion Go S offers a sleeker alternative to Lenovo's existing Legion Go, doing away with the former's detachable controllers in favour of a more rounded all-in-one design. It features an 8-inch, 16:10 IPS LCD multi-touch screen (with a 120Hz variable refresh rate and 1920 x 1200 resolution), alongside hall-effect thumbsticks, a redesigned D-pad, and dual stage triggers.\n\nAs for the insides, Legion Go S includes either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or Z1 Extreme processor, and can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. All this lives inside a 299mm x 127.6 x 22.6 shell and weighs upwards of 730g - around 90g heavier than Steam Deck. Lenovo tells The Verge it's targeting two to 2.5 hours of battery life for demanding games.\n\nThe SteamOS version of Lenovo's Legion Go S (the Windows 11 variant is white). | Image credit: Lenovo\n\nLenovo's first Legion Go S model begins shipping this month, costing \u00a3649.99/$729.99 with the Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It'll be followed in May by a slightly lower-specced \u00a3600/$599.99 variant, featuring the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage. Both machines utilise Windows 11, but Lenovo is also working on a SteamOS-powered Go S, making it the first authorised third-party handheld gaming device to utilise Valve's operating system. This is the cheapest of the bunch, costing $499.99 with the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage - and The Verge reports it should also arrive in May.\n\nFor anyone with an eye on the slightly more distant future, however, Digital Foundry has taken a look at AMD's newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - the kind that'll be packed into Lenovo's second generation Legion Go 2 - if you're curious to learn more."

            "article_content": "Understanding Dell's New Branding\n\nDell's new branding efforts in a nutshell\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus\n\nThe Dell Pro and Pro Max Lineups\n\nDell's Pro Max 14 and 16 Premium\n\nThe step down from Premium to Dell Pro Plus includes 13, 14, and 16-inch models, and comes as either a traditional laptop or a 2-in-1 form factor. Regardless of the size and design, all of these machines use the same BIOS to make life easier for IT departments. Dell Pro Plus notebooks use 50% recycled aluminum shells.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the Dell Pro machines have some design features in common. They all have dedicated HDMI, USB, and Thunderbolt connectivity options. They're also all available with 5G modems for WAN connectivity as well as Wi-Fi 7 for local wireless networks. We also know that other Meteor Lake notebooks feature beastly battery life, and Dell says these will last up to 21 hours away from the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also Dell Pro Desktops coming. These have a variety of form factors including micro, slim desktop, and tower configurations. These have both Intel Core Ultra and AMD Ryzen CPU options, and will be Dell's first commercial desktops with NPUs on board.\n\nDell Pro AI Studio\n\nDell talks in-depth about AI PCs and Dell Pro AI Studio at CES\n\nDell talks in-depth about AI PCs and Dell Pro AI Studio at CES\n\nThe Dell 14 and 16 Plus\n\nThe Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1 is the first consumer notebook with the new branding\n\nBranding efforts are tricky business. Choose an obtuse name and it can be tricky to know what you're even selling. Of course, Dell's branding hasn't fallen into that category, but names like Latitude and Inspiron can be tough to decipher if you're new to PCs. That's why the largest privately-owned PC manufacturer, Dell, not only announced a truckload of new AI PCs at CES, it also rolled out a new series of brands to simplify its product lineup and help consumers understand what they're buying. Meet Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Max.Before we dive too deeply into the names, we want to point out there are lots of PCs coming very soon under these three umbrellas. The first wave of machines are mostly laptops with names that indicate screen sizes. As we go, we'll see things like Dell Pro 13 Premium and Dell 16 Plus, and it will all make sense after understanding the new branding. While the first wave of AI PCs were Snapdragon X1 Elite-based notebooks, these are for the most part x86 notebooks using Lunar Lake CPUs from Intel's Core Ultra 200 series.At first it might appear that Dell has taken iPhone names and applied them to PCs, but it's not quite that simple as there are suffixes that can be applied to each. It's basically three categories of device: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Within each category, suffixes indicate things like build quality and performance tiers. First is the non-suffixed name, which is the base model, and then the Plus is a step-up and Premium is pretty self-explanatory. Understanding it as a 3x3 grid helped this author wrap his brain around it. All the same, a name like Dell Pro Max 16 Premium doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.The Dell branding will encompass everything that targets individual consumers -- fare thee well, Inspiron, Inspiron Plus, and XPS brands. These names have served the company well. However, in 2025 they've been replaced with Dell base models and their suffixed brethren: Dell Plus and Dell Premium.That means folks shopping on Amazon or at Best Buy for a home computer are going to see three brands, just like they have in the past. The names should also be clearer; it's obvious that Dell Plus is better than Dell, while Dell Premium sits on top. And it should be noted that Dell's gaming brand Alienware isn't going anywhere, either. New models in Alienware's lineup were just announced, as a matter of fact.After that are the models targeted at corporate buyers. Dell Pro more-or-less replaces the Latitude brand of business notebooks and desktops. Meanwhile, the high-performance Precision lineup has been dubbed Dell Pro Max. And of course those brands all have their own base, Plus, and Premium branding applied to them. Pretty straightforward, right? Right, so let's move on to the systems themselves.The first machines to roll out under the new branding are, for the most part, Dell Pro and Pro Max PCs. We'll start with the Dell Pro 13 Premium and 14 Premium. As their names imply, they ship with 13 and 14-inch displays with 16:10 aspect ratios and either FHD+ or QHD+ resolutions. Later this year, these notebooks will be available with Tandem OLED displays (first seen on the M4 iPad Pro) for a 24% increase in efficiency and a 49% weight reduction compared to previous OLED designs. The early models will instead come with mini-LED backlit IPS displays.The Dell Pro Premium notebooks are also built upon 90% recycled magnesium frames that keep the weight down to as low as 2.36 pounds. Despite the light weight, these systems meet the MIL-STD H durability spec so they can survive long days in the airport or driving around. These notebooks also have dual-fan cooling systems that the company says keeps them quiet while increasing air flow by 20%. Dell Pro Premium cooling systems will be riding atop Intel Core Ultra 200v-series processors.The same Lunar Lake CPUs which have on-board NPUs that enable Copilot+ features in Windows will also drive Dell Pro AI Studio. This would be easy to dismiss as the company's own take on on-device AI, but it's actually quite a bit more. Dell Pro AI Studio goes a lot farther than just configuring some settings for different workloads, though; Dell Pro AI Studio has its own collection of validated models that have been optimized for the hardware of a Dell Pro PC that can be easily deployed on-device using the Dell Management Portal. This video presentation from Dell goes into much more detail.Of course, all of these features can be done through public repositories like HuggingFace or downloading random repos from different hardware makers on GitHub. However, having all of this collected and (more importantly) validated by the OEM makes getting a useful AI model onto a PC a breeze. This lets Dell Pro users focus on getting work done rather than setting up an environment.Consumer PCs aren't left out of the initial launch of Dell's rebranding efforts. The Dell 14 Plus and 16 Plus will be available as both traditional notebooks and 2-in-1 designs. To start with, these systems will have Intel Core Ultra 200v processors that increase battery life 39% over the previous generation of Inspiron Plus notebooks.Later this year, Dell says it will flesh out the consumer offerings to include desktops and notebooks. There will be options based on not only Intel Core CPUs, but also AMD Ryzen and Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors as well. As these machines launch and Dell continues with its rebranding efforts, we'll be sure to bring more. For now, you can see more about Dell Pro computers directly from Dell itself."

This includes the creation of landing zones, defining the VPN, gateway connections, network policies, storage policies, hosting key services within a private subnet and setting up the right IAM policies (resource policies, setting up the organization, deletion policies). Creating awareness of the policy of least privilege and addressing frustrations when cloud users ask for more to play with, and as a cloud CoE team, you are rightfully holding your ground that comes with it. The cloud CoE team should collect feedback from the users and tweak policies along the way as they deem fit. As the enterprise user community matures through this learning curve, the CoE team has a pivotal role to play in engaging them proactively, supporting them, meeting their needs and helping them address their pain points to lay a strong foundation for building a robust cloud infrastructure that is scalable to deliver business value.\n\nPartnering with the enterprise architecture team in this stage of the cloud journey can speed up cloud maturity and buttress the foundation further on solid bearings. The cloud CoE team of architects should work with the EA to align with the reference architecture patterns that the CoE team would like the application teams/product teams to follow in their solution design. This strategic and collaborative work serves as a blueprint for the architects to \u2018show and tell\u2019 the concept of designing cloud-effective solutions and shape mindsets towards the \u2018making money with the cloud\u2019 vision. Every company that wants to succeed in scaling AI solutions and capabilities today needs to get this design thinking working for them. Otherwise, it\u2019s like the story of \u2018sour grapes\u2019 with high cloud cost bills coming their way with little value added in the AI domain as it has been for a lot of companies in 2024.\n\n3. WALK FASTER: Develop cloud adoption planning and migration roadmap\n\nWith the CoE and EA teams working in tandem, it\u2019s time to engage the business stakeholders/product owners and develop the plan and roadmap. Understanding business constraints and priorities, and evaluating domains that have opportunities to expand their revenue and grow exponentially upon moving to the cloud are the key parameters to keep in mind. I recommend a structured approach for this phase of the journey."

They litter the Old Testament and the New; once you start seeing them, you can\u2019t stop.\n\nA modern example of a short chiasm would be If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Jesus makes a pithy chiastic statement in Mark 2:27: \u201cThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nBut most chiastic structures are longer than one line, sometimes stretching across entire chapters, with a hinge point in the middle. Westerners are accustomed to a conclusion landing at the end, like the moral of the story or the punchline of a joke, but the ancient Near Eastern mind liked to embed the main idea dead center.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognize this structure as we read Scripture, from the Psalms to the words of Jesus, we risk placing the emphasis on the wrong point. As a Bible teacher, I see how chiasms honor the truism that repetition is the mother of learning. Chiasms are memory aids, God\u2019s kindness to past generations of worshipers who likely never held Scripture in their hands as well as to modern Christians in our distracted age. They are meant to help us remember.\n\nModern readers may wonder why this particular form of parallelism appealed so heavily to the ancient Near Eastern mind. I certainly did\u2014that is, until my mother died.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you have to take me to this appointment.\u201d I looked over at my diminutive 79-year-old mother, perched in the passenger seat, eyes apologetic, fretting with her purse.\n\nLike many in her generation, my mom found it difficult to accept even help that was easy to supply. \u201cYou are a person to love, not a problem to solve\u201d had become my mantra to her each time she expressed dismay at having interrupted my life in any way.\n\nBefore you begin to assume that my mother and I had an enviable relationship, let me say we did not\u2014but through much hard work, we found a real sweetness together in her final years. In December of 2021, her kids and grandkids moved her into an apartment five minutes from my home. We set up her antique furniture, hung her favorite pictures, and put out her favorite vase, the one with wisteria around the rim. I was excited to be able to drop in or run errands for her so easily.\n\nI planned a family dinner for her 80th birthday that January. Three days before it, she texted that she had a stomach bug and wasn\u2019t sure she would make it. She assured me she was fine. Please don\u2019t come over. But she was sicker than she thought.\n\nHer birthday passed in the ICU, and a week later she was placed on palliative care, coming home to my house for hospice. No more beeping monitors and sterile overhead lights. No more masks and visitor restrictions. Instead, a room flooded with sunshine, warm with color, and filled with loved ones.\n\nShe was, at this point, no longer communicative. But I knew if she could have spoken, she would have repeated the words she had strained to say again and again during her brief hospital stay: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to be a burden.\u201d\n\nMy brothers and I took our place at her bedside to keep a vigil familiar to many reading this. We listened as her breathing became more and more labored with each passing day. We witnessed the hard work of dying.\n\nOn the second day, the hospice nurse told me, \u201cYou know, you can coach her. Give her encouragement. Tell her she\u2019s doing well.\u201d I played her favorite hymns. I held her hand. I helped keep her clean and comfortable. I whispered a thousand times, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home. You\u2019re a person to love, not a problem to solve.\u201d\n\nAt last, she reached the end of her travail. A final deep exhale, a crashing silence.\n\nAnd it hit me: the marvelous and terrible symmetry of a long human life.\n\nEighty years earlier, hadn\u2019t she entered this world in a similar way\u2014through a great labor, with a deep inhale and a piercing wail? Had she not received much the same care in the hours after her birth that we provided in the hours before her death?\n\nI suspect the reason the ancients loved a chiasm was because it is the recognizable shape of the sweep of life. Perhaps God, in his kindness, designed it to be such. Bookends. Repetition. Symmetry.\n\nI reasoned that the other concentric layers of a human life could be mapped as well. Every human life is unique, but what might be the general pattern? I sketched out my thoughts.\n\nThe chiasm of a human life. The idea is not unique to me. I recall the saying that we are first children to our parents, then parents to our children, then parents to our parents, and finally children to our children.\n\nIf life is a chiasm, and if chiasms teach, what does the chiasm of life seek to teach us? If we become students of it, I believe it can \u201cteach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom\u201d (Ps. 90:12).\n\nRemembering that seasons of life follow a patterned order helps us inhabit the season we are in and prioritize how to use the time we are given. Since death announced its presence in Genesis 3, our days have been numbered. Perhaps God, in his infinite kindness, gave us a chiasm, a patterned measuring rod, to number those days rightly.\n\nKnowing that aging means the relinquishing of freedoms and abilities helps us embrace that process rather than hold onto self-reliance. It helps us to anticipate the next season, to savor the one we are in, and to be grateful for the ones we have already left behind.\n\nRecognizing that in some seasons we give care and in some we receive care helps us accept care when it\u2019s our turn to receive. We are not problems to solve in our extreme age any more than we were in our infancy. We are simply people to love, in a stage when others repay a debt of care they themselves received in their time.\n\nThe chiastic structure of life explains why we feel such shock when a life is cut short. We expect intuitively that human life should make a full arc. The asymmetry of a young or untimely death creates dissonance. No bookend. No parallel. No full circle. My mother\u2019s death was a good one by many measures, not least because of its blessed symmetry.\n\nBut if a chiasm puts the main point at the middle, how are our middle years noteworthy? Midlife offers a unique opportunity, a moment of perspective at the crossroads. If we have paid close attention to how we entered the chiasm, we will be better able to exit it with grace and submission. Looking back over the first half of life can help us anticipate the second half\u2014in both its losses and its gains.\n\nIf we focus just on our abilities and responsibilities, we see only gains in the first half of the chiasm of life and only parallel losses in the second. In a culture that values youth and vigor, we risk losing sight of what we learn over the years: wisdom. The wisdom of aging means that even as our bodies increasingly fail us, our internal lives grow richer and steadier. Bodies decline, but people develop.\n\nAt 55, I can already track the decline in my physical abilities. I am still in a stage where I am the supplier of help to others, but if the Lord grants me length of years, I will one day be only a recipient\u2014fed and clothed and cared for by someone else\u2019s hands and feet.\n\nThe days in which my body can yield help to others are numbered, and I want to number them rightly. My parents have helped me with the math. Watching them pass into old age has brought into focus for me the preciousness of the years I have left. My earliest caregivers have moved to receiving care. Their physical abilities grow more limited, but their insights are deepening.\n\nThey are the evidence to me that, while failing joints and heart valves and eyesight and hearing may increasingly unsteady our bodies, wisdom increasingly steadies our souls. Bodies decline, people develop. The lamp of wisdom burns brighter as the oil of life experience grows in supply.\n\nFor the believer, old age is an invitation toward burgeoning luminosity.\n\nIn my attic is a relic of days gone by: a cassette player my husband owned as a teen. In the living room is another relic\u2014the vase with wisteria trim. My mother\u2019s, passed on to me. It\u2019s not of enormous value, but unlike its electronic upstairs neighbor, its value is steadily growing with age.\n\nHere is where we bump into the problem with the way our culture views not just aging but also the elderly. My husband, Jeff, and I are affectionately called \u201cthe Olds\u201d by our kids, who thankfully still seek our advice and who regard us as a source of wisdom obtained through length of years. But our children are increasingly the exception.\n\nSo many cultural shifts have happened in so little time that many parents and children are estranged by their differing views. Whereas one\u2019s elders used to be seen as those increasing in wisdom with every passing year, they are now likely to be seen as increasingly obsolete (\u201cOkay, boomer\u201d). Less like a vase, more like a cassette player.\n\nWhen I listen to my 84-year-old father\u2019s advice, it occurs to me that he always waits patiently for me to end my question before responding. At 55, I often sit with a younger person to hear about their difficulty in marriage, parenting, or ministry; recognize a familiar pattern a few minutes into the telling; and, at the right moment, offer the same advice I have given on similar occasions.\n\nWe have a way of hitting the same roadblocks. If I have acquired a modest level of wisdom in middle age, how much more does my father hold at 84? There is godly wisdom, a gift God grants, but there is also the wisdom of age\u2014gained by sheer length of years and attention to those around us.\n\nThe wisdom of age is the basis for the fifth commandment\u2019s requirement to honor father and mother, a command given not to children, as we often assume, but to adults. (Note that the commands following it deal with the very adult sins of murder, adultery, theft, bearing false witness, and covetousness.)\n\nThe fifth commandment is intended to instruct adult children to show honor to elderly parents. The Puritans interpret correctly its greater implications in the Westminster Catechism, noting that it included showing honor to all who are our superiors in age and experience.\n\nPut succinctly: Honor the Olds. They know some things you don\u2019t. Their bodies are declining, but their personhood is ever developing. We can miss this so easily. I once heard a woman in her 30s gently reminding an audience of younger women that \u201colder Christian women are still valuable in the church.\u201d In accordance with the fifth commandment, I would offer a slightly altered wording. Those older than us are not still valuable. They are, rather, increasingly valuable.\n\nIn a culture that fetishizes youth and views aging as a journey into irrelevance and uselessness, God\u2019s family takes the view that people possess an ever-developing value, one that renders their contributions essential and indispensable.\n\nOur elders have much to offer us\u2014until they reach the stage in the chiasm of life when they don\u2019t. At some point, old age will take from them even the ability to think or communicate. And yet, they will still teach us. Aging requires a fortitude like nothing else. Caring for the aged grants unforeseen blessings to the younger generation. Those who hold the hand of the dying learn secrets to make them wise. They learn that the elderly are not an obligation but a sacred trust. My mother was luminous in her dying.\n\nThe grand symmetry of the human life can yield wisdom if we give it our attention. We move from the helplessness of birth to seasons of growth and possibility under the watchful care of our parents. We become caregivers to our children, then to our parents. We watch growth and possibility turn to decline and limited ability in our own lives. We return to helplessness. And we leave this life much as we entered. How kind of the Lord to give us a roadmap for aging until our last enemy, death, is defeated.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the lie that the first half of life is to be clung to. When we behold the arc from beginning to end, we learn to value all of it. We learn not just to number our days but to cherish them\u2014the days of our youth, the days of our twilight, and all the days in between.\n\nDon\u2019t let a youth-obsessed culture rob you of your sense of the value of all parts of life. We need our aging faces and slowing bodies to tell us the truth: that time is passing, and that it is exceedingly precious. Each season yields its own exquisite fruit. No need to cling to what was never meant to last. God is faithful in every season.\n\nJen Wilkin is an author, Bible teacher, and cohost of the Knowing Faith podcast."

            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

Ice-laden clouds cover less area, are thinner, and reflect less sunlight compared to their droplet-only counterparts. This results in darker clouds that absorb more infrared radiation, potentially diminishing the cooling effect typically provided by brighter clouds.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research illuminates the influence of industrial pollutants on weather patterns and their potential implications for climate modeling, a crucial but underexplored component of atmospheric science.\n\nWhat should be done with the information revealed in this groundbreaking study?\n\nThe new study's findings have wide-reaching implications for climate science, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into which pollutants most effectively drive ice nucleation and how to integrate these processes into future climate models.\n\nClimate scientists have their hands full when it comes to studying the impacts of particle pollution on our warming world. A recent Pennsylvania State University study pointed out how microplastics could affect our planet's weather and climate.\n\nThere is little argument that climate models need to be improved.

One such revolutionary moment is being celebrated in 2025, which the United Nations has declared to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. This marks the centenary of the advent of quantum mechanics, which began in a flurry of papers 100 years ago. Just as it would be impossible to make sense of modern biology without Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, our fundamental understanding of the physical world is now rooted in quantum principles. Modern physics is quantum physics.\n\nThe word quantum refers to the way matter absorbs or releases energy \u2014 in discrete packets, or quanta. Its use in physics comes from the German word quant, which is derived from a Latin term meaning \u2018how much\u2019. In around 1900, physicists such as Max Planck and Albert Einstein began to describe, in an ad hoc way, why several phenomena of the subatomic realm could not be explained using the classical mechanics developed by Isaac Newton and others some two centuries earlier. Then, in 1925, quantum came to be used to describe the fundamentals of an entirely new form of mechanics \u2014 the branch of physics that describes the relationship between forces and the motion of physical objects.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nAs science historian Kristian Camilleri describes in an Essay on the startling developments of that year and those that followed, the physicist Werner Heisenberg travelled to the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea in the summer of 1925 in search of relief from severe hay fever. Shortly after this, he submitted to the journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik a paper whose title translates as \u2018On quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relationships\u2019 (W. Heisenberg Z. Physik 33, 879\u2013893; 1925). This prompted further studies in the following months by Heisenberg and his close collaborators, as well as work using an alternative approach by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\nThe revolution did not begin with physicists throwing away the laws of classical mechanics, but with their radically reinterpreting classical concepts such as energy and momentum. However, it did require its initiators to abandon dearly held common-sense ideas \u2014 for example, the expectation that subatomic objects such as particles have a well-defined position and momentum at any given time. Instead, the physicists found that natural phenomena had an inherently unknowable nature. Classical physics, in other words, is only an approximate representation of reality, and manifests itself only at the macroscopic level. A century on, this insight into the nature of the physical world still thrills and bamboozles in equal measures. Many Nature readers will know about the philosophical quandaries raised by quantum cats that are simultaneously dead and alive, and about the industry that is growing around quantum computing.\n\nOthers will know how quantum ideas gave rise to the lasers that beam information through the cables of the Internet, and the transistors that provide the processing power of electronic chips. But quantum ideas also shape our understanding of nature, at all levels, explaining why solid objects don\u2019t fall apart and how stars shine and, ultimately, die.\n\nA quantum year\n\nCommemorative events are being planned all over the world for the coming 12 months. They include an opening ceremony for the UN year at the headquarters of the UN scientific organization UNESCO in Paris in February; special events at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California, in March; and a workshop for physicists on Heligoland in June. The organizers\u2019 collective ambition is to celebrate not just the centenary of quantum mechanics, but also the science and applications that arose from it in the past century \u2014 and to explore how quantum physics might bring further change in the century to come.\n\nThis billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed?\n\nIn May, Ghana, the country that originally proposed that the UN proclaim 2025 the year of quantum science, is hosting an international conference on the topic in Kumasi. And in August, science historians will meet to celebrate the quantum century in Salvador de Bahia in Brazil.\n\nThis meeting will be the high point of a 20-year research programme that set out to re-examine the development of quantum theory. One major aim of that work, says historian Michel Janssen at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was to establish the contributions of a collective of scientists, many of whom \u2014 particularly women \u2014 have not been recognized in the history of the field.\n\nThese \u201chidden figures\u201d include Lucy Mensing, who was a member of the same group as Heisenberg and worked out some of the first applications of his quantum-mechanical theory, says Daniela Monaldi, a historian at York University in Toronto, Canada. One of the most notable events of the year will be the publication of a biographical volume of essays on 16 of them, Women in the History of Quantum Physics.\n\nFor all that it has already brought, the quantum revolution still has unfinished business. In the years in which researchers were laying the foundations of quantum mechanics, they also began to rebuild other branches of physics \u2014 such as the study of electromagnetism, and states of matter \u2014 from quantum foundations. They also looked to extend their theories to encompass objects that move at close to light speed, something that the original quantum theory did not. These efforts drastically expanded the scope of quantum science and led researchers to develop the standard model of particles and fields, a process that finally came together in the 1970s.\n\n\u2018A truly remarkable breakthrough\u2019: Google\u2019s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone\n\nThe standard model has been incredibly successful, culminating in the 2012 discovery of its linchpin elementary particle, the Higgs boson. But these extensions lie on less-solid theoretical ground than quantum mechanics does \u2014 and leave several phenomena unexplained, such as the nature of the \u2018dark matter\u2019 that seems to greatly outweigh conventional, visible matter in the wider cosmos. Moreover, one important phenomenon, gravity, still resists being quantized.\n\nOther conceptual problems of quantum physics remain open. In particular, researchers struggle to understand what exactly happens when experiments \u2018collapse\u2019 the fuzzy probabilities of quantum objects into one precise measurement, a key step in creating the \u2014 still remorselessly classical \u2014 macroscopic world we live in. Over the past few decades, researchers have been developing ways to turn these quirks of quantum reality into useful technologies.
