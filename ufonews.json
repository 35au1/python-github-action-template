            "article_content": "He has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansjurgen Kohler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (Cenap), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says Kohler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office Cenap.\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" Kohler says.\n\nAccording to its director, Cenap has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, Kohler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines). Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa\n\nConspiracy theorists\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, Kohler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Strange footage captured over the US appeared to show a hovering UFO with an odd glow over a military base.\n\nAn anonymous user posted the footage from Tennessee to Reddit, showing the \u201cbright orange light\u201d over Fort Campbell, a base on the border with the state of Kentucky. The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

            "article_content": "You\u2019ve no doubt noticed artificial intelligence finding its way into every app, service, and hardware device. It\u2019s now unusual to see a tech product launch where AI isn\u2019t the main talking point. Meta is one of the companies pushing AI the hardest, with its own set of AI models, and a selection of AI bots and tools inside its own apps. (Experts and critics also say Meta may be taking their AI too far, which Meta responded to by removing multiple AI profile accounts.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram recently, then you may have spotted a new Meta AI bot, ready and waiting to be of assistance. Here\u2019s how you can make use of it\u2014and what your options are in terms of security and privacy.\n\nHow to find Meta AI\n\nYou\u2019ll find Meta AI front and center in Meta\u2019s apps: In the Facebook Messenger app, for example, tap Chats and you\u2019ll see a Meta AI input box right at the top, above your real life friends and family members. Tap inside that box, and you can start chatting about whatever topic you like. You can also tap Meta AI on the tab bar at the bottom.\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the WhatsApp app (you\u2019ll see the Meta AI logo on the Chats tab), and in the Instagram app (tap the message button, in the top right corner of the home tab, and Meta AI is at the top). The Meta AI logo is a glowing blue and purple circle, and it\u2019s hard to miss as you use the apps.\n\nMeta AI is prominently displayed in your chats. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get Meta AI up, inside one-to-one or group chats with real people: Tag @MetaAI in your conversation, type out a prompt, and you\u2019ll get the same response as you would if you were chatting to the AI bot directly\u2014except, of course, the other chat participants will be able to see the message and response.\n\nThe AI bot chats all use the same underlying model (called Llama), but your chats aren\u2019t synced between the three apps. Unfortunately for AI skeptics, there\u2019s no way to hide or turn off Meta AI: You just have to ignore it if you don\u2019t want to use it. However, you can delete, mute, and archive Meta AI chats just like any other conversation\u2014just long press on the AI chat in the main conversation list.\n\nHow to use Meta AI\n\nIf you\u2019ve used an AI chatbot like Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the way these tools work: You can ask Meta AI to look up facts from the web, write poetry, or suggest ideas for something. You can get recommendations for podcasts, inspiration for a birthday party, or suggestions about how to fix a faucet leak.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI for advice and instruction on just about any topic\u2014though as usual with generative AI, be careful of putting too much trust in the answers. These AI bots are built to imagine new text, and that can lead to hallucinations. Sometimes Meta AI will reference the web (when looking up facts, for example)\u2014and when this happens you\u2019ll see web links within the response. Tap on these links to check the facts.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions about just about anything. Screenshot: Meta\n\nImage generation is included here: Just ask Meta AI to create or draw an image of whatever you like. It could be a cat sat on a wall, a cabin in the woods, or a person exploring the surface of Mars. The more detail you can add, the more closely the result is going to match your original vision\u2014and you can specify the style of the image too, whether it\u2019s a photo, a painting, or something else.\n\nThere are some interesting image-related tricks you can try: For example, you can use it to create a new profile picture for yourself. Two suggestions from Meta are \u201cimagine me as royalty\u201d or \u201cimagine me in a surrealist painting\u201d, so you can see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019re also able to edit an AI-generated image by tapping and holding on it, then typing in your additional prompt.\n\nMeta AI can generate images for you as well. Screenshot: Meta\n\nMeta itself splits what you can do into three main sections: learn (\u201csummarize the history of the Universe\u201d), create (\u201cimagine dogs playing chess\u201d), and connect (\u201cplan a game night with friends\u201d). That gives you some idea of what\u2019s possible, and you can now interact with Meta AI with your voice if you want\u2014just tap the sound button to the right of the input box.\n\nOne of the features recently added to Meta AI is the ability to use photos in your chats\u2014either picked from your phone\u2019s gallery or taken through the camera. You can identify objects and landmarks, create AI images based on existing photos, and more: Try snapping a picture of a cake and asking how to make it, for example."

            "source": "San Diego Union-Tribune",
            "article_content": "It has come to my attention that world leaders like JD Vance and Steve Bannon are avid and enthusiastic readers of a computer engineer named Curtis Yarvin. He has written mostly about politics but also about technology and current affairs.\n\nWhat might be most alarming to some that our future vice president is taking Yarvin\u2019s work as an influence, is that his writings are largely composed of anti-democratic and pro-authoritarian themes, along with some inclusion of racism (he claimed that some races are more suited for slavery; I invite you to guess what race he thinks that is).\n\nYou see, Yarvin is one of the founders of something called the \u201cDark Enlightenment\u201d movement, which \u201cargues\u201d against democracy and against egalitarianism \u2013 a school of thought that people have equal intrinsic value and are deserving of equal rights.\n\nThe reason I placed \u201cargues\u201d in quotes is because Yarvin\u2019s writings do not fall under the category of rigorous political philosophy. They are often written in a style that is purposefully and pretentiously difficult to understand that makes it nearly impossible to extract comprehensible arguments.\n\nInstead of concrete arguments, Yarvin\u2019s writings are mostly composed of unsubstantiated claims and obscure references that he doesn\u2019t explain to make it perfectly clear to his audience how well-read he is.\n\nDespite fashioning himself as a political theorist, he is far from a competent one. Here\u2019s a small sample where he is explaining that his \u201cdeep-right\u201d movement must involve authoritarianism:\n\n\u201cThe deep right knows that all government is absolute. Because of this, the deep right is only interested in paths to absolute power.\u201d\n\nWhy would all governments be absolute? If his primary reason for thinking that his deep-right movement should seek to bring about an authoritarian regime rests on this dubious assumption, then it\u2019s already completely undermotivated. He doesn\u2019t explain why a government like ours isn\u2019t a straightforward counterexample.\n\n\u201cIt treats all other paths as traps, since they are by definition dead ends.\u201d\n\nWhat definition? Why must they be dead ends? He doesn\u2019t explain or argue for any of this.\n\n\u201cThe more attractive the first steps into a trap, the deadlier the trap in the end\u2014and political traps can last decades.\u201d\n\nWhy would we believe that the attractiveness of the steps into a trap correlates with the deadliness of the trap? Again, there are no arguments to be found. This small passage is highly representative of Yarvin\u2019s writings in general: a lot of bold, eye-catching claims, and very few reasons provided to actually believe them. In most cases, philosophy of this kind is better categorized as bad poetry, not as a means to systematically examine theories and concepts or a means to form rational beliefs about them.\n\nThis is precisely where people like JD Vance and Steve Bannon have gone wrong. They have confused bad poetry that mentions the Dark Enlightenment, for reasons to believe in the goals of the Dark Enlightenment.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cIdealism is not Great\u201d, he attempts to \u201cargue\u201d that Idealism, and not religion, is to blame for the violence and destruction that has gone along with religious systems. The entire thing relies on him merely presupposing that this is the case, and a fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication of the concept of platonic universals (Idealism): a philosophical theory that identifies properties like \u201credness\u201d as abstract entities whose nature can be instantiated by concrete objects like apples.\n\n\u201cAn Idealist is a person who believes that universals exist independently. Specifically, in the modern sense, your Idealist believes in concepts such as Democracy, the Environment, Peace, Freedom, Human Rights, Equality, Justice, etc., etc. What do these concepts have in common?[\u2026]they are impossible to define precisely. It\u2019s fairly clear that they have no meaning at all. For example, John Rawls wrote a whole book called A Theory Of Justice which purports to be a rigorous rational derivation of the New Deal regime.\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect demonstration of his being well read enough to mention the concepts of academic disciplines but not educated enough to use them correctly. Subscribing to the theory of platonic realism has no bearing at all on political leanings or really, anything of practical concern at all.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with Rawls. Rawls\u2019 work does not deal at all with the general nature of properties. Instead, he attempts to explore the nature of Justice. Contrary to what Yarvin claims, he does indeed define it and it does not depend at all on Rawls being a Platonic Realist.\n\n\u201cA little while ago I explained that religion, if we define it as a system of belief involving anthropomorphic paranormal entities, cannot directly affect reality.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Opinion Columnists | Thank Jimmy Carter for cheap airfare, smartphones and FedEx\n\nThank Jimmy Carter for cheap airfare, smartphones and FedEx Opinion Columnists | Jon Coupal: New laws coming in the new year Californians need to know about\n\nJon Coupal: New laws coming in the new year Californians need to know about Opinion Columnists | Trump\u2019s claim that we need \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 is extremely baseless\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that we need \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 is extremely baseless Opinion Columnists | Year in review: From a republic to a \u2018kakistocracy\u2019\n\nYear in review: From a republic to a \u2018kakistocracy\u2019 Opinion Columnists | Will Democrats fix their brand problem ahead of California\u2019s gubernatorial election? I had the misfortune of clicking on his link: he does not explain that at all, he just claims that it\u2019s the case. Let\u2019s be as charitable as possible and say that he thinks that by defining religion as such, it becomes a platonic form, which itself could not have causal efficacy in the world. Why does this need to be expressed? A system of belief can certainly affect reality. My parent\u2019s adherence to the system of belief that tells them that God wants them to attend mass, directly causes them to attend mass.\n\nThis is nonsensical junk food for pseudointellectuals. If we were to someday depart from democracy, these idiotic ramblings should play no part in it at all. And yet, it is reportedly informing people in our highest offices.\n\nThere is a reason peer-review exists and it\u2019s not to stop the radical ideas of \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d that go against the system \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanism that filters out unrigorous nonsense like this so that we don\u2019t have to waste time on it. There are plenty of academics who have published legitimate attacks on the merits of democracy and egalitarianism. It\u2019s a good thing that JD Vance and Steve Bannon want to read about political philosophy, but why look to a computer scientist for answers?\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.

Wolfe went to a relative's home on N. 5th Street where he was arrested, police said. On Saturday morning, Wolfe was arraigned by District Judge Rachel Wiest-Benner. He is being held without bail.\n\nSunbury Police Chief Travis Bremigen said Sunbury Officer Trey Kurtz arrived at the 5th Street home after being called by the homeowner. Bremigen said Kurtz spoke with Wolfe who told him he drove with White to a friend's house on Court Street and smoked what he thought was marijuana, police said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWolfe told Kurtz he was unsure what he smoked was marijuana, according to court documents. He also told police that he used a paranormal meter to check a statue for energy and received a high reading of paranormal activity, which made him feel scared, police said.\n\nWolfe then told Bremigen that \"in that moment\" he believed his friend was trying to put a white rag with something on it over his mouth with the intent to harm him, police said.\n\nWolfe told police he thought his friend and White were all trying to kill him so he panicked and ran out of the house to retrieve his handgun from his vehicle, according to court documents. Police reported Wolfe said he grabbed a gun and put a live round into the chamber, police said.\n\nWolfe told officers that's when White opened the front passenger door of the vehicle and Wolfe fired one shot in what he said was self-defense, police said. White was struck in the chest. By the time medical personnel arrived she could not be saved, Bremigen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBremigen first arrived at the scene with other officers and attempted to save the victim, he said.\n\nNorthumberland County Coroner Jim Kelley arrived at the scene and pronounced the woman dead, Bremigen said.\n\nWolfe said that after the shooting he drove to his relative's house on N. 5th Street. The relative called police immediately, Bremigen said.\n\nBremigen secured a search warrant from Wiest-Benner and officers were able to recover a small black 9mm handgun lying on the floor of the N. 5th Street home, according to police.\n\nWolfe was interviewed a second time at the Sunbury Police Department and Bremigen said Wolfe gave the same statements. Wolfe added he did not see any weapons on White when she approached him at the vehicle, police said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWolfe told police he concealed a loaded 9mm handgun in his vehicle without having a concealed weapon permit, police said.\n\nKurtz and Officer Gary Bregensir asked Wolfe if it was possible White was entering the vehicle to leave with him and Wolfe took a deep breath and said \"that's a good question,\" police said.\n\nBregensir said he asked Wolfe why he did not render aid to White, his girlfriend of seven years, to which Wolfe allegedly responded, \"I was too messed up,\" according to court documents.\n\nPolice said they also searched a Market Street home because Wolfe said he had lived there, and officers were able to allegedly retrieve a large amount of suspected synthetic marijuana and multiple smoking devices.\n\nWolfe was sent to Northumberland County Jail and will now appear before Wiest-Benner for a preliminary hearing at a later date."

There are even a couple of graves which have almost been swallowed up by tree trunks.\n\nThe land was developed as a cemetery in 1847 but the area has been left to become more of a wildlife haven in recent years. That has added to the mystique of the area.\n\nREAD MORE: I try a Hull deli as I embark on a New Year's health kick - but get distracted by cake\n\nREAD MORE: Five things to look forward to in January 2025 in Hull\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are the Quaker graves, the memorial to cholera victims and many strange tales behind the headstones. There are also plenty of fairy doors and other bizarre items if you look closely. But there is one tree which is truly curious.\n\nDeep in the grounds is the \"Penny Tree\", where hundreds of pennies are stuck to the trunk in long lines. The coins have been placed quite high up in the tree so you would need to be agile or have a ladder to get to them.\n\nThere are hundreds of the coins just below where the branches begin in a spiral form. But many of the coins appear to have been plucked out or have fallen out over time.\n\nThe Penny Tree in Hull General Cemetery\n\nAccording to this legend, anyone who climbs up and removes a penny will suffer bad luck. The story is a hoax, however, created by a local paranormal group and local artist Lee Sendall in the early 2000s who also etched a number of faces on some of the trees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther people have since used the tree to etch their own names and pictures into it. There are a number of faces and figures and even a dancing fairy.\n\nLee was also responsible for \u201cLittle Doug,\u201d a strange artefact put on display in Hull Maritime Museum in 2006. It looked like some alien foetus which was inspired by the mermaid exhibits of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe ''Little Doug'' exhibit by Lee Sendell at the Maritime Museum, Queen Victoria Square in Hull\n\nLee even created a back story to say it was brought over by a soldier from North Africa during the Second World War and was preserved by being buried in an allotment in Hull.\n\nHe is a colourful character who also threatened to sue the organisers of the London Olympics after claiming designs he submitted for an arts competition run by Olympics chiefs were ripped off by director of the opening ceremony Danny Boyle.\n\nHe submitted plans for a spiralled mound and a similar hill was then used in the opening ceremony which was supposedly based on Glastonbury Tor."

            "article_content": "Stephen King\u2019s favourite horror character from his books\n\nTo hit a debut novel out of the park like Stephen King did with Carrie in 1974 is to instantly establish yourself as one of the premier writers of the day. However, perhaps more impressive than simply getting a good book out to the public is that it was a uniquely poised piece of horror fiction.\n\nThe celebrated genre may be one of the most ardently mythologised, with fandoms strong enough to make Taylor Swift blush, but it isn\u2019t always the most marketable to a widespread audience. Stephen King changed all that, and his books became some of the most successful novels ever written. And, as cinema exploded into a new phase in the latter parts of the 20th century, King\u2019s books would be routinely leant on for inspiration.\n\nFew authors can boast as many movie adaptations as King\u2019s 65. The writer has given the cinematic world classics like The Shining and The Shawshank Redemption as well as It and Stand By Me, a range of stories that not only celebrate the unique talent of King but the widespread range of characters within them. The narrative may be what attract most filmmakers to his work, but it is the characters within them that make those movies unforgettable.\n\nWhen asked to pick out his favourite character from his oeuvre, King was quick to land on his favourite. Naturally, it came from one of his scarier books, but still, that\u2019s about the only thing one might have predicted. Many would have thought The Shining protagonist Jack Torrance would be number one, especially considering his issues with Stanley Kubrick over his portrayal. You might also be persuaded into thinking that Pennywise, the demon clown from It might be the writer\u2019s favourite.\n\nHowever, the character King called his favourite to write during a keynote speech at George Washington University was Annie Wilkes from Misery. The picture was directed by Rob Reiner, who had previously directed King\u2019s novella The Body into the definitive coming-of-age classic Stand By Me four years earlier, with stars James Caan and Kathy Bates playing a writer and one of his obsessed fans, respectively.\n\nBates steals the show as Annie Wilkes, the maniacal fan in question who not only engineers the near-fatal crash that leaves Caan in her carer but then proceeds to begin the battle of wits to try and keep him in her home. The movie and the book operate as a brutal reflection on fan culture, which may well have been drawn from King\u2019s heightened experiences of a new life under the spotlight as more and more of his books became global hits and cinematic spectacles.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Wilkes would become his favourite character. Not only is King\u2019s character an irredeemable villain, but she is able to deliver this terror through a less than usual presence. Previously, King\u2019s monsters would be either animalistic, paranormal or twisted men. Here, with a woman as the lead character, he was able to change the narrative entirely.\n\nThe movie would not only become a commercial success but also achieve the only Oscar that has been given for a Stephen King adaptation as Bates picked up \u2018Best Actress\u2019 in 1991, giving Wilkes a slightly more questionably vulnerable spin. While King would likely resist picking favourites too often, for the most part, it is easy to see how Wilkes may win out every time he is asked."

Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

            "article_content": "But mammals weren\u2019t always part of the planet\u2019s history. Their journey is thought to have begun around 225 million years ago during the Late Triassic. The first ones looked almost nothing like the mammals we are used to seeing today. Instead, they were tiny, shrew-like creatures that barely stood a chance against the massive dinosaurs that dominated the planet at the time. However, against all odds, they withstood their harsh surroundings as the last surviving descendants of an older group, the Therapsids, from which they evolved.\n\nNow, paleontologists in Mallorca, Spain, have unearthed what seems to be a fossil of a therapsid that could be the oldest ever discovered, dating back to nearly 280 million years ago. The research, which was published in the journal Nature Communications, describes this ancient creature as a vaguely dog-like predator with fearsome saber teeth. Yet to be named, the fossil is believed to belong to a group known as gorgonopsians\u2014ancient predators more closely related to mammals than any living animals."

            "article_content": "Reading Time: 9 Minutes \u2022 Print this page\n\nA wall of bright signs warn me before I step closer: \u201cDangerous Animals \u2013 Do Not Touch\u201d. As I carefully inch closer to the aquarium tank, I notice that sitting inside in a shell is an inconspicuous animal no bigger than a golf ball. A series of striking, metallic blue markings appear magically over its body, and it stretches its rubber-like arms to close the two shell pieces together, vanishing from view.\n\nOctopuses are the only invertebrate known to use tools. This coconut octopus uses empty shells and even coconuts as a mobile fortress. Image credit: Yury Ivanov/@diveivanov\n\n\u201cMeet the most intelligent invertebrate on the planet,\u201d Dr Wen-Sung Chung announces as he proudly introduces his \u201cblueys\u201d \u2013 blue-lined octopuses \u2013 that form part of his research. He\u2019s studying the nervous system and behaviour of cephalopods, the group of molluscs that includes octopuses and squids. Despite their appearance, these tiny little blueys can be deadly, especially if you\u2019re a crustacean. They carry tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin for paralysing prey that\u2019s 1000 times more potent than cyanide. But these creatures are far more astounding than the fearsome reputation that proceeds them. They have truly remarkable intelligence, evident in behaviours such as the tool use I just witnessed with a shell. It\u2019s a surprising sign of higher cognition usually only seen in vertebrates such as birds and mammals.\n\nNot so \u2018dumb\u2019\n\nAristotle, one of the greatest minds in history, claimed octopuses were \u201cdumb\u201d. But they have some serious sea smarts that seem to defy logic. They\u2019re unlike anything in the animal kingdom, having survived ice ages and asteroids, outliving dinosaurs and spreading their arms to survive in every part of our oceans. In captivity, tales abound of these marine masterminds navigating complex mazes, unscrewing lids and outsmarting aquarists by escaping their tanks and raiding neighbouring ones for food. In the wild they team up with fish to hunt, rewire their own brains when it gets too cold and can even change colour, despite being colour-blind.\n\nThe mimic octopus, which lives in sandy habitats devoid of any shelter, even impersonates some of the ocean\u2019s deadliest residents. Its repertoire includes lionfish and stingrays and it can choose which species to mimic based on the threat it faces. If harassed by a damselfish, for example, it transforms into a sea snake.\n\nCephalopod scientist Dr Wen-Sung Chung\u2019s work on the blue-lined octopus is providing valuable insights into octopus intelligence. Image credits: Sheree Marris\n\nWen-Sung\u2019s fascination with these otherworldly animals began at Taiwan\u2019s National Museum of Natural Science with a preserved giant squid. Their \u201cweirdness\u201d captivated him, inspiring a life-long career that has included some significant breakthroughs such as the discovery of cephalopod statolith structures, which allow octopuses and squid to detect sound pressures and hear.\n\nAn opportunity to take up a residency at The University of Queensland saw his journey come full circle when he became part of an international team filming the enigmatic giant squid at 750m using the deep-sea camera platform Medusa.\n\nWen-Sung is now an expert in cephalopod visual ecology and neurobiology. For the past decade, he\u2019s been on a mission to unravel the secrets of octopus adaptability and cognitive abilities. It\u2019s groundbreaking research that not only offers a window into the surprisingly sophisticated lives of cephalopods but is also inspiring human innovation.\n\nHidden beauties\n\nI join Wen-Sung on one of his research expeditions at Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), home to The University of Queensland\u2019s Moreton Bay Research Station. The island is the perfect location for his work. Its diverse habitats of sandy plains, seagrass meadows and vibrant reefs are home to more than 10 octopus species, including the blue-lined, reef, hammer, red-spot night, scribbled night, plain-spot, veined and southern star-eyed octopus. In fact, Australia could be considered the octopus capital of the world, boasting more than 70 of the 300 species documented globally.\n\nArmed with booties, gloves, buckets and nets, we make our way across the sandy flats, navigating around armies of soldier crabs, and shuffle out into ankle-deep water. Finding octopuses is like playing a game of hide and seek with the world champions of the game. They don\u2019t just blend in: they become part of their surroundings, breaking up the outline of their bodies in magical ways that is nothing short of marine sorcery.\n\nLuckily, Wen-Sung knows the telltale signs. \u201cYou really need to understand the biology of the animals to find them,\u201d he explains. It\u2019s not long until he calls me over with excitement, pointing to what looks like nothing more than a tuft of seaweed. Amused by my puzzled face, he traces the outline of eight arms. It\u2019s a cryptically camouflaged algae octopus. Not only has it taken on the colour of the surrounding seaweed, it\u2019s changed the texture of its skin to match. It\u2019s the ultimate 3D camouflage \u2013 unparalleled in the animal kingdom.\n\nThe cryptically camouflaged algae octopus, another of Wen-Sung\u2019s study subjects, uses remarkable 3D mimicry to blend seamlessly with marine plants by changing both the texture and colour of its skin Image credit: Alamy\n\nAt nightfall, we head back out with our underwater torches to search for nocturnal octopus species, which would now be emerging from their daytime slumber to feast. Fish are darting around us as we wade through the shallows and our torch beam lights up a resting wobbegong shark.\n\nIt draws our attention to something bright red nearby that quickly vanishes into the sand \u2013 the red-spot night octopus. It\u2019s an impressively large species nearly a metre long. Wen-Sung inspects the deep tunnel the octopus disappeared into. We need to be on the lookout as it may pop up elsewhere, because these crafty cephalopods often create multiple escape tunnels \u2013 another sign of intelligence.\n\nWhat drives this level of brainpower in an invertebrate? The simple answer is survival. Millions of years ago, octopuses followed a different line of evolution to their clam and snail relatives by shedding the hard shell, trading security for freedom and flexibility. It made them into a tasty piece of unprotected protein in an environment where just about everything is looking for a meal.\n\nWith no protective armour, octopuses, such as this day octopus, rely on ingenious strategies to deter predators, including making themselves seem larger and more intimidating. Image credit: Ernie Black/@ernieblackphoto\n\nTo survive in the diverse habitats they share with a range of predators, octopuses have developed ingenious survival strategies. They\u2019re also born into a world without parental guidance and have short lifespans, which means they must learn fast and constantly adapt. All this is done while processing multiple visual inputs, controlling eight agile arms with hundreds of information-gathering suckers, and coordinating millions of colour-changing skin cells. It\u2019s enough to make your head spin \u2013 and certainly requires serious brainpower.\n\nTo investigate how all of these behaviours can be coordinated, Wen-Sung has been mapping the brains of various species of octopus and studying the structure and organisation of their nervous system, from hatchling all the way through adulthood.\n\nTo achieve this, he\u2019s needed to modify existing MRI techniques by deviating from the standard protocol settings usually reserved for vertebrate brains such as those of humans and other mammals, which are more rigid with different neural pathways compared to the soft brain tissues of octopuses.\n\nAfter hundreds of hours and much trial and error, he was able to successfully scan the brains of various octopus species in high resolution and, in a world-first, capture and map their complicated neurology in 3D. The insights this provides have been ground-breaking and changed what we thought we knew about the brains of these marine masterminds.\n\nUpdating knowledge\n\nMost of our knowledge of the octopus brain has been based on research from the 1950s and the exploration of cognitive ability restricted to a single species, the common octopus, an accessible and abundant species that\u2019s easy to keep in captivity. With more than 300 octopus species worldwide, this research certainly hasn\u2019t painted a comprehensive picture of the intelligence or brains of the group as a whole.\n\nThis is why Wen-Sung\u2019s work and the incredible breakthroughs he\u2019s made are so important. One of his discoveries is that the octopus brain continues to grow throughout the lives of these animals. It can grow 100 to 5000 times in volume from hatching to adulthood, and the rate at which this growth proceeds is ridiculously fast, when you consider the average lifespan of an octopus is only two years. Compare that to human brains, which reach maximum size at 14 or 15 years of age, then start to gradually shrink.\n\nA pale octopus. Image credits: Sheree Marris\n\nAs with the human brain, however, and unique among invertebrates (excluding their squid relatives), octopuses exhibit brain-folding, which is a sign of intelligence. The more folding there is, the more surface area is created, allowing more neurological inputs and greater processing power. Octopuses have the largest brain size-to-body ratio of any animals, which makes sense, given all the multi-tasking they do. This also tells us that the octopus is investing a significant amount of energy into its nautical noggin.\n\nOne of Wen-Sung\u2019s biggest discoveries has been that not all octopus brains are the same. The design, level of folding and size of the visual processing centre of an octopus brain, are influenced by habitat and lifestyle and vary between species. For example, the reef octopus, which is only active during the day, has a more complex brain and larger optic lobes compared to the nocturnal blue-lined octopus.\n\nMasters of deception\n\nCoral reefs are busy and challenging environments to live in. The reef octopus has to process a large amount of information and camouflage is important to its survival. The species has the highest number of colour-changing cells of any species and has been recorded changing its appearance more than 300 times in a day. It\u2019s also the species that has been recorded cooperatively hunting with gropers to flush fish out of coral bommies.\n\nTo support his work and explore the ability for the brain to change, adapt and learn \u2013 known as neural plasticity \u2013 Wen-Sung has also conducted a range of experiments to test octopus intelligence. This involved food incentives and problem-solving challenges such as identifying different shapes. \u201cThe most compelling evidence of intelligence is just how quickly they learn,\u201d he says. He has even taught one octopus to count. It\u2019s evidence that octopuses have brain structures, such as memory and learning centres, that are functionally similar to those in mammals, positioning octopuses as a valuable model group for neurophysiological studies in other higher-order species.\n\nResearch on the southern sand octopus has uncovered a compound in its venom that shows real promise in slowing the growth of cancerous melanoma cells. Image credit: Sheree Marris\n\nScientists have even recently discovered octopuses can edit their own physiology to adapt to temperature change by editing their RNA (ribonucleic acid), which is responsible for reading and decoding information in the DNA, to build proteins to carry out cellular function. Unlike DNA-driven evolution, which takes generations, octopuses can make these changes in days, which is truly extraordinary.\n\nThe significance of Wen-Sung\u2019s work and the benefit of it, even to us humans, can\u2019t be underestimated. Creating a brain template that maps and understands octopus neurology will open the gate to understanding evolution of not only cephalopods but of land-based animals.\n\nA pale octopus with its own reflection. Image credit: Sheree Marris\n\nHis work is also opening up a wealth of opportunities for human innovation. Octopuses are fast becoming marine muses for us mere mortals, sparking innovation and inspiring us in ways we never thought possible. The hormones that spur rapid brain growth in an octopus could prove useful for people who need growth stimulants.\n\nUnderstanding the flexibility and remarkable autonomy of octopus arms that comes through a simple neural network (see below), could have applications for the engineering of soft robotics able to be used in natural disasters for accessing collapsed buildings or navigating terrain inaccessible to humans. Researchers are also exploring how octopuses can deliberately detach and regrow limbs \u2013 a process that could one day inform treatments for neural injuries or regenerative medicine.\n\nIllustration credits: Gilang Ayyoubi Hartanto\n\nFor all the danger signs on the tanks where Wen-Sung keeps his blueys, there\u2019s a deeper irony. The same venom that ensures humans keep their distance may one day help save lives. Research on the southern sand octopus has uncovered a compound in its venom that shows real promise in slowing the growth of cancerous melanoma cells.\n\nWen-Sung\u2019s work underscores how truly extraordinary octopus brains are and he\u2019s only just begun to unravel their mysteries. \u201cOctopuses are the epitome of discovery science,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more I find and watch, the more I realise how much is still to learn about these weirdly wonderful animals.\u201d It\u2019s impossible not to be swept along by his energy and enthusiasm.\n\nWe humans like to think we\u2019re the clever ones, but these eight-armed teachers have some valuable lessons to share, proving that brains come in all shapes and are sometimes even shaped like a donut. Who\u2019s dumb now, Aristotle?\n\nRead more\n\nThe latest book by Victorian-based marine scientist Sheree Marris, Octopuses: Underwater Wonders, is a stunning journey into the lives of these otherworldly creatures.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Understanding community safety through accurate crime data helps residents make informed decisions about where to live and work. Law enforcement experts and data analysts provide several reliable methods for accessing and interpreting local crime statistics, emphasizing the importance of using official sources for accurate information.\n\nOfficial data sources\n\nLocal police departments serve as primary sources for accurate crime information. Most departments maintain public websites featuring detailed crime reports categorized by neighborhood or zip code. These resources typically include annual reports, current crime statistics, and specific details about homicides and other violent crimes within their jurisdictions.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies often provide sections labeled \u201cCrime Statistics\u201d or \u201cAnnual Reports\u201d on their websites. These comprehensive documents include detailed information about homicides, property crimes, and arrests within specific timeframes, allowing residents to track patterns and trends in their areas.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Crime Data Explorer provides comprehensive nationwide statistics. This federal database allows users to filter information by location and specific crime types, offering valuable insights into local safety patterns and trends over time. The platform\u2019s design enables detailed analysis of murder rates and other violent crimes across different regions.\n\nCity resources\n\nMany metropolitan areas maintain public crime dashboards that display current statistics. These platforms often provide interactive maps and regular updates about criminal activities within specific neighborhoods. City officials emphasize the importance of these tools for maintaining community awareness and safety.\n\nThese dashboards typically offer real-time or near-real-time updates, allowing residents to monitor recent criminal activities in their areas. Many systems include features for comparing crime rates across different neighborhoods or zip codes, providing valuable context for understanding local safety conditions.\n\nThird-party platforms\n\nSeveral independent organizations aggregate crime data into user-friendly formats. NeighborhoodScout compiles information from multiple sources to create detailed safety profiles for specific areas. The platform includes crime rates, risk indexes, and comparative analysis tools that help residents understand their neighborhood\u2019s safety level.\n\nCrimeMapping.com utilizes official police data to generate interactive maps showing recent criminal activities. Users can customize searches to focus specifically on homicides or other violent crimes within their zip codes. The platform provides regular updates and historical data for comprehensive analysis.\n\nSpotCrime offers another valuable resource, featuring interactive maps highlighting recent crimes, including violent offenses. The platform allows users to set up alerts for real-time updates about criminal activities in their areas, helping residents stay informed about potential safety concerns.\n\nUnderstanding statistics\n\nCrime analysts emphasize the importance of proper data interpretation. Population size significantly affects crime rates, particularly in smaller communities where few incidents can dramatically impact statistical representations. Experts recommend examining murder rates calculated per 100,000 residents while considering the community\u2019s total population for context.\n\nLaw enforcement experts recommend examining trends over extended periods, typically five to ten years, rather than focusing on isolated incidents or short-term fluctuations. This longitudinal approach provides more accurate insights into community safety patterns and helps identify meaningful trends in violent crime rates.\n\nContextual analysis\n\nSecurity specialists stress the importance of comparing local statistics with surrounding areas. This broader perspective helps residents better understand their neighborhood\u2019s relative safety within the larger community context. Experts recommend evaluating multiple adjacent zip codes to gain a comprehensive understanding of regional safety patterns.\n\nCrime prevention experts note that not all incidents appear in official records. Understanding these limitations helps residents make more informed decisions about their safety and security measures. They emphasize the importance of using multiple data sources to create a more complete picture of local safety conditions.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nLaw enforcement officials encourage resident participation in safety initiatives. Many police departments host regular community meetings to discuss crime trends and prevention strategies. These gatherings provide opportunities for direct interaction with local law enforcement and often include detailed discussions of recent criminal activities and prevention efforts.\n\nNeighborhood watch programs often maintain additional crime tracking resources. These community-based initiatives frequently offer detailed insights into local safety concerns and prevention efforts, complementing official data sources with ground-level observations and reports.\n\nDigital resources\n\nModern technology provides various tools for staying informed about local crime. Many communities use alert systems like Nixle to share real-time updates about criminal activities and safety concerns. These platforms often allow users to customize notifications based on location and crime type.\n\nSocial media platforms have become increasingly important for tracking local safety information. Law enforcement agencies regularly use these channels to communicate with residents about ongoing investigations, safety concerns, and crime prevention strategies.\n\nPractical applications\n\nUnderstanding local crime statistics supports various decision-making processes:\n\nInformed decision-making becomes crucial when relocating or choosing schools. Property owners can implement appropriate security measures based on specific crime patterns in their areas. Community organizations can develop targeted safety initiatives addressing local concerns.\n\nMoving forward\n\nAccessing and understanding local crime statistics represents an important step toward community safety. Regular monitoring of crime data helps residents stay informed about safety trends while enabling proactive participation in local crime prevention efforts.\n\nThis knowledge empowers residents to make informed choices about their safety while contributing to broader community security initiatives. Through consistent monitoring and engagement with available resources, community members can work together to create safer neighborhoods for everyone.\n\nThis story was created using AI technology."

Open the Promo Codes tab at the top of the screen. Enter a code in the Enter code here text box. Hit Enter Code and receive your goodies.\n\nRetroStudio Wiki Link\n\nIf you don\u2019t know where to get started with RetroStudio, check out the RetroStudio Wiki page. It contains useful information, including all about each past and current event happening in the game, as well as details on all of the playable games and tools you can use to create your own experiences in the classic way.\n\nWhy Are My RetroStudio Codes Not Working?\n\nRetroStudio codes can contain everything from upper and lowercase letters to special characters and numbers, so typing out these codes can be a bit tricky. If the codes are too hard on your eyes, you can copy and paste them directly from the article and into the game. Do this as soon as possible to avoid the codes from expiring. Don\u2019t worry too much, as most of the newer codes don\u2019t have expiration dates and can be used multiple times.\n\nWhat Is RetroStudio?\n\nRetroStudio is a Roblox experience that wants to emulate the way Roblox used to operate years ago, from the popular games to the UI itself. If you have an itch to go back in time and play iconic titles such as Greenwood Town and Raft without a paddle, this is the perfect way to do it.\n\nOnce you\u2019re done time traveling and want to explore the robust current world of Roblox experiences, don\u2019t forget to stop by our dedicated Roblox Codes section right here on Twinfinite!\n\nTwinfinite is supported by our audience.

This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

            "article_content": "Reading Time: 9 Minutes \u2022 Print this page\n\nA wall of bright signs warn me before I step closer: \u201cDangerous Animals \u2013 Do Not Touch\u201d. As I carefully inch closer to the aquarium tank, I notice that sitting inside in a shell is an inconspicuous animal no bigger than a golf ball. A series of striking, metallic blue markings appear magically over its body, and it stretches its rubber-like arms to close the two shell pieces together, vanishing from view.\n\nOctopuses are the only invertebrate known to use tools. This coconut octopus uses empty shells and even coconuts as a mobile fortress. Image credit: Yury Ivanov/@diveivanov\n\n\u201cMeet the most intelligent invertebrate on the planet,\u201d Dr Wen-Sung Chung announces as he proudly introduces his \u201cblueys\u201d \u2013 blue-lined octopuses \u2013 that form part of his research. He\u2019s studying the nervous system and behaviour of cephalopods, the group of molluscs that includes octopuses and squids. Despite their appearance, these tiny little blueys can be deadly, especially if you\u2019re a crustacean. They carry tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin for paralysing prey that\u2019s 1000 times more potent than cyanide. But these creatures are far more astounding than the fearsome reputation that proceeds them. They have truly remarkable intelligence, evident in behaviours such as the tool use I just witnessed with a shell. It\u2019s a surprising sign of higher cognition usually only seen in vertebrates such as birds and mammals.\n\nNot so \u2018dumb\u2019\n\nAristotle, one of the greatest minds in history, claimed octopuses were \u201cdumb\u201d. But they have some serious sea smarts that seem to defy logic. They\u2019re unlike anything in the animal kingdom, having survived ice ages and asteroids, outliving dinosaurs and spreading their arms to survive in every part of our oceans. In captivity, tales abound of these marine masterminds navigating complex mazes, unscrewing lids and outsmarting aquarists by escaping their tanks and raiding neighbouring ones for food. In the wild they team up with fish to hunt, rewire their own brains when it gets too cold and can even change colour, despite being colour-blind.\n\nThe mimic octopus, which lives in sandy habitats devoid of any shelter, even impersonates some of the ocean\u2019s deadliest residents. Its repertoire includes lionfish and stingrays and it can choose which species to mimic based on the threat it faces. If harassed by a damselfish, for example, it transforms into a sea snake.\n\nCephalopod scientist Dr Wen-Sung Chung\u2019s work on the blue-lined octopus is providing valuable insights into octopus intelligence. Image credits: Sheree Marris\n\nWen-Sung\u2019s fascination with these otherworldly animals began at Taiwan\u2019s National Museum of Natural Science with a preserved giant squid. Their \u201cweirdness\u201d captivated him, inspiring a life-long career that has included some significant breakthroughs such as the discovery of cephalopod statolith structures, which allow octopuses and squid to detect sound pressures and hear.\n\nAn opportunity to take up a residency at The University of Queensland saw his journey come full circle when he became part of an international team filming the enigmatic giant squid at 750m using the deep-sea camera platform Medusa.\n\nWen-Sung is now an expert in cephalopod visual ecology and neurobiology. For the past decade, he\u2019s been on a mission to unravel the secrets of octopus adaptability and cognitive abilities. It\u2019s groundbreaking research that not only offers a window into the surprisingly sophisticated lives of cephalopods but is also inspiring human innovation.\n\nHidden beauties\n\nI join Wen-Sung on one of his research expeditions at Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), home to The University of Queensland\u2019s Moreton Bay Research Station. The island is the perfect location for his work. Its diverse habitats of sandy plains, seagrass meadows and vibrant reefs are home to more than 10 octopus species, including the blue-lined, reef, hammer, red-spot night, scribbled night, plain-spot, veined and southern star-eyed octopus. In fact, Australia could be considered the octopus capital of the world, boasting more than 70 of the 300 species documented globally.\n\nArmed with booties, gloves, buckets and nets, we make our way across the sandy flats, navigating around armies of soldier crabs, and shuffle out into ankle-deep water. Finding octopuses is like playing a game of hide and seek with the world champions of the game. They don\u2019t just blend in: they become part of their surroundings, breaking up the outline of their bodies in magical ways that is nothing short of marine sorcery.\n\nLuckily, Wen-Sung knows the telltale signs. \u201cYou really need to understand the biology of the animals to find them,\u201d he explains. It\u2019s not long until he calls me over with excitement, pointing to what looks like nothing more than a tuft of seaweed. Amused by my puzzled face, he traces the outline of eight arms. It\u2019s a cryptically camouflaged algae octopus. Not only has it taken on the colour of the surrounding seaweed, it\u2019s changed the texture of its skin to match. It\u2019s the ultimate 3D camouflage \u2013 unparalleled in the animal kingdom.\n\nThe cryptically camouflaged algae octopus, another of Wen-Sung\u2019s study subjects, uses remarkable 3D mimicry to blend seamlessly with marine plants by changing both the texture and colour of its skin Image credit: Alamy\n\nAt nightfall, we head back out with our underwater torches to search for nocturnal octopus species, which would now be emerging from their daytime slumber to feast. Fish are darting around us as we wade through the shallows and our torch beam lights up a resting wobbegong shark.\n\nIt draws our attention to something bright red nearby that quickly vanishes into the sand \u2013 the red-spot night octopus. It\u2019s an impressively large species nearly a metre long. Wen-Sung inspects the deep tunnel the octopus disappeared into. We need to be on the lookout as it may pop up elsewhere, because these crafty cephalopods often create multiple escape tunnels \u2013 another sign of intelligence.\n\nWhat drives this level of brainpower in an invertebrate? The simple answer is survival. Millions of years ago, octopuses followed a different line of evolution to their clam and snail relatives by shedding the hard shell, trading security for freedom and flexibility. It made them into a tasty piece of unprotected protein in an environment where just about everything is looking for a meal.\n\nWith no protective armour, octopuses, such as this day octopus, rely on ingenious strategies to deter predators, including making themselves seem larger and more intimidating. Image credit: Ernie Black/@ernieblackphoto\n\nTo survive in the diverse habitats they share with a range of predators, octopuses have developed ingenious survival strategies. They\u2019re also born into a world without parental guidance and have short lifespans, which means they must learn fast and constantly adapt. All this is done while processing multiple visual inputs, controlling eight agile arms with hundreds of information-gathering suckers, and coordinating millions of colour-changing skin cells. It\u2019s enough to make your head spin \u2013 and certainly requires serious brainpower.\n\nTo investigate how all of these behaviours can be coordinated, Wen-Sung has been mapping the brains of various species of octopus and studying the structure and organisation of their nervous system, from hatchling all the way through adulthood.\n\nTo achieve this, he\u2019s needed to modify existing MRI techniques by deviating from the standard protocol settings usually reserved for vertebrate brains such as those of humans and other mammals, which are more rigid with different neural pathways compared to the soft brain tissues of octopuses.\n\nAfter hundreds of hours and much trial and error, he was able to successfully scan the brains of various octopus species in high resolution and, in a world-first, capture and map their complicated neurology in 3D. The insights this provides have been ground-breaking and changed what we thought we knew about the brains of these marine masterminds.\n\nUpdating knowledge\n\nMost of our knowledge of the octopus brain has been based on research from the 1950s and the exploration of cognitive ability restricted to a single species, the common octopus, an accessible and abundant species that\u2019s easy to keep in captivity. With more than 300 octopus species worldwide, this research certainly hasn\u2019t painted a comprehensive picture of the intelligence or brains of the group as a whole.\n\nThis is why Wen-Sung\u2019s work and the incredible breakthroughs he\u2019s made are so important. One of his discoveries is that the octopus brain continues to grow throughout the lives of these animals. It can grow 100 to 5000 times in volume from hatching to adulthood, and the rate at which this growth proceeds is ridiculously fast, when you consider the average lifespan of an octopus is only two years. Compare that to human brains, which reach maximum size at 14 or 15 years of age, then start to gradually shrink.\n\nA pale octopus. Image credits: Sheree Marris\n\nAs with the human brain, however, and unique among invertebrates (excluding their squid relatives), octopuses exhibit brain-folding, which is a sign of intelligence. The more folding there is, the more surface area is created, allowing more neurological inputs and greater processing power. Octopuses have the largest brain size-to-body ratio of any animals, which makes sense, given all the multi-tasking they do. This also tells us that the octopus is investing a significant amount of energy into its nautical noggin.\n\nOne of Wen-Sung\u2019s biggest discoveries has been that not all octopus brains are the same. The design, level of folding and size of the visual processing centre of an octopus brain, are influenced by habitat and lifestyle and vary between species. For example, the reef octopus, which is only active during the day, has a more complex brain and larger optic lobes compared to the nocturnal blue-lined octopus.\n\nMasters of deception\n\nCoral reefs are busy and challenging environments to live in. The reef octopus has to process a large amount of information and camouflage is important to its survival. The species has the highest number of colour-changing cells of any species and has been recorded changing its appearance more than 300 times in a day. It\u2019s also the species that has been recorded cooperatively hunting with gropers to flush fish out of coral bommies.\n\nTo support his work and explore the ability for the brain to change, adapt and learn \u2013 known as neural plasticity \u2013 Wen-Sung has also conducted a range of experiments to test octopus intelligence. This involved food incentives and problem-solving challenges such as identifying different shapes. \u201cThe most compelling evidence of intelligence is just how quickly they learn,\u201d he says. He has even taught one octopus to count. It\u2019s evidence that octopuses have brain structures, such as memory and learning centres, that are functionally similar to those in mammals, positioning octopuses as a valuable model group for neurophysiological studies in other higher-order species.\n\nResearch on the southern sand octopus has uncovered a compound in its venom that shows real promise in slowing the growth of cancerous melanoma cells. Image credit: Sheree Marris\n\nScientists have even recently discovered octopuses can edit their own physiology to adapt to temperature change by editing their RNA (ribonucleic acid), which is responsible for reading and decoding information in the DNA, to build proteins to carry out cellular function. Unlike DNA-driven evolution, which takes generations, octopuses can make these changes in days, which is truly extraordinary.\n\nThe significance of Wen-Sung\u2019s work and the benefit of it, even to us humans, can\u2019t be underestimated. Creating a brain template that maps and understands octopus neurology will open the gate to understanding evolution of not only cephalopods but of land-based animals.\n\nA pale octopus with its own reflection. Image credit: Sheree Marris\n\nHis work is also opening up a wealth of opportunities for human innovation. Octopuses are fast becoming marine muses for us mere mortals, sparking innovation and inspiring us in ways we never thought possible. The hormones that spur rapid brain growth in an octopus could prove useful for people who need growth stimulants.\n\nUnderstanding the flexibility and remarkable autonomy of octopus arms that comes through a simple neural network (see below), could have applications for the engineering of soft robotics able to be used in natural disasters for accessing collapsed buildings or navigating terrain inaccessible to humans. Researchers are also exploring how octopuses can deliberately detach and regrow limbs \u2013 a process that could one day inform treatments for neural injuries or regenerative medicine.\n\nIllustration credits: Gilang Ayyoubi Hartanto\n\nFor all the danger signs on the tanks where Wen-Sung keeps his blueys, there\u2019s a deeper irony. The same venom that ensures humans keep their distance may one day help save lives. Research on the southern sand octopus has uncovered a compound in its venom that shows real promise in slowing the growth of cancerous melanoma cells.\n\nWen-Sung\u2019s work underscores how truly extraordinary octopus brains are and he\u2019s only just begun to unravel their mysteries. \u201cOctopuses are the epitome of discovery science,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more I find and watch, the more I realise how much is still to learn about these weirdly wonderful animals.\u201d It\u2019s impossible not to be swept along by his energy and enthusiasm.\n\nWe humans like to think we\u2019re the clever ones, but these eight-armed teachers have some valuable lessons to share, proving that brains come in all shapes and are sometimes even shaped like a donut. Who\u2019s dumb now, Aristotle?\n\nRead more\n\nThe latest book by Victorian-based marine scientist Sheree Marris, Octopuses: Underwater Wonders, is a stunning journey into the lives of these otherworldly creatures.\n\n"

Instead, they were tiny, shrew-like creatures that barely stood a chance against the massive dinosaurs that dominated the planet at the time. However, against all odds, they withstood their harsh surroundings as the last surviving descendants of an older group, the Therapsids, from which they evolved.\n\nNow, paleontologists in Mallorca, Spain, have unearthed what seems to be a fossil of a therapsid that could be the oldest ever discovered, dating back to nearly 280 million years ago. The research, which was published in the journal Nature Communications, describes this ancient creature as a vaguely dog-like predator with fearsome saber teeth.

            "article_content": "Pinned\n\nDrivers headed toward the Lincoln Tunnel in Weehawken, N.J., on the first day of congestion pricing on Sunday.\n\nCongestion pricing arrived in New York City exactly one second after midnight on Sunday.\n\nAnd despite the freezing temperatures, a crowd of about 100 people gathered at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 60th Street in Manhattan to mark the occasion.\n\nIt was mainly supporters who showed up to clap and chant, \u201cPay that toll! Pay that toll!\u201d But one opponent tried to drown them out by banging a cowbell. And the exchanges grew a bit testy at times across the congestion pricing divide.\n\nThe tolling program, the first of its kind in the nation, finally became reality on New York streets after decades of battles over efforts to unclog some of the most traffic-saturated streets in the world. In the weeks leading up to its start, the program survived multiple legal challenges seeking to derail it at the last minute, including from the State of New Jersey.\n\nIt will most likely be some time, however, before it becomes clear whether congestion pricing works, or whether it can withstand continuing attempts to overturn it by a broad array of opponents, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, who takes office later this month.\n\nNoel Hidalgo, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, was among the first drivers to pay the toll. As he drove his Mini Cooper across the threshold, toll supporters cheered and clapped from the curb.\n\nAnother driver posted a photo on social media of a silver car with metal cans dangling from the rear bumper. \u201cJust tolled\u201d was written on the rear windshield.\n\nMost passenger cars are now being charged $9 once a day at detection points set up along the borders of the new tolling zone, from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan.\n\nImage Congestion pricing scanners above First Avenue at East 60th Street in Midtown Manhattan on Sunday morning. Drivers will be tolled via E-ZPass or license plate readers. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nShortly after noon, about 12 hours after tolling began, transportation leaders declared that the plan had rolled out without a hitch, but cautioned that the tolling system was complicated and that it was too soon to know how it was faring.\n\n\u201cWe will start to know specific numbers and have some comparatives within a few days, and we\u2019re going to share that information publicly,\u201d said Janno Lieber, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency overseeing the program.\n\nSo far, the M.T.A. does not intend to make any adjustments to the program, Mr. Lieber said.\n\nTraffic data for the congestion zone was mixed on Day 1. The average travel speed initially inched upward 3 percent to 15.1 miles per hour at 8 a.m. Sunday, compared with 14.6 m.p.h. at the same time on the first Sunday in January last year, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics firm. But by noon, the travel speed had fallen to 13 m.p.h., slightly slower than in 2024.\n\nImage The congestion pricing zone extends from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nStill, the real test for the tolling program will come during the workweek. The M.T.A. said it had chosen to introduce the program on a Sunday to be able to work out any kinks while traffic was sparse. Light snow was forecast for the region on Monday, which could affect commuter data if fewer people choose to drive.\n\nOn a typical weekday, at least half a million vehicles enter the congestion pricing zone, a metric that officials will be tracking \u201cvery, very closely,\u201d Mr. Lieber said.\n\nManoj Bhandari\u2019s car will no longer be among them. Though he normally drives into his Midtown office at least twice a week from New Jersey, he said he would now only take the train. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive for me and it\u2019s expensive for everybody,\u201d said Mr. Bhandari, 54, who was parked outside the Lincoln Tunnel on Sunday. \u201cWe won\u2019t be using our car anymore.\u201d\n\nTransportation officials have projected that congestion pricing will reduce the number of vehicles entering the congestion zone by at least 13 percent.\n\nOther drivers seemed to accept that there was no way around the new tolls. Oscar Velasquez, 54, a carpenter who lives on Long Island, said he was going to have to pay more now to haul his tools to jobs around the city. \u201cOne of these days, they\u2019re going to charge you for walking,\u201d Mr. Velasquez said as he idled on West 66th Street in his Chevy pickup truck.\n\nThe tolls are expected to help generate $15 billion to pay for crucial repairs and improvements to New York\u2019s aging subway system, buses and two commuter rail lines. The work includes modernizing subway signals, making stations more accessible for riders with disabilities and expanding the city\u2019s electric bus fleet.\n\nThose upgrades could improve the commute for Emily Rose Prats, 36, of Brooklyn, who supports congestion pricing. She has spinal degradation and standing for long periods can cause her great discomfort, so she has avoided the subway and the bus, which can be unreliable.\n\n\u201cThe improvements from congestion pricing are supposed to be an upgrade to the signals, which will mean faster trains, shorter headways, shorter commutes, less wait times,\u201d Ms. Prats said. \u201cAll of that is something that will help me be able to take advantage of a public amenity that we pay for.\u201d\n\nCongestion pricing is being introduced in New York at a time when traffic has surged on city streets since nearly disappearing five years ago in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. New York was named the world\u2019s most congested city, beating out London, Paris and Mexico City, in a 2023 traffic scorecard compiled by INRIX.\n\nThough congestion policy has successfully reduced traffic in other global cities, including London, Stockholm and Singapore, it has never gotten far in this country. Besides New York, a handful of other cities, like Washington and San Francisco, have explored the concept.\n\nThe program has been unpopular in the polls, and some transit experts noted that neither Mayor Eric Adams nor Gov. Kathy Hochul had commented on the start of congestion pricing by Sunday afternoon even though it will have a major impact on the city and state.\n\nMr. Adams has supported the plan while expressing reservations about it, and is running for re-election this year. Ms. Hochul paused the program in June over concerns that it would hurt the city\u2019s recovery and brought it back in November with a 40 percent reduction in the tolls, down to $9 from $15.\n\nThe tolls will increase to $12 by 2028, and to $15 by 2031. The new plan is set to generate about $500 million per year during its first three years, and then $700 million when fees first go up, then close to $1 billion when the original toll is restored. The money will be used to secure $15 billion through bond financing, which would be paid back with tolling revenue.\n\nImage Revenue from the tolling plan will be used to finance crucial improvements and upgrades to New York City\u2019s aging public transit system. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times\n\nMr. Lieber of the M.T.A. said that officials did not expect New Yorkers to change their behavior overnight.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to have to adjust to this as more and more people become aware of it and start to factor it into their planning,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a coffee shop near Lincoln Center, Terry Kotnour, a retired consultant, praised congestion pricing. \u201cThat\u2019s the cost of living here,\u201d said Mr. Kotnour, 82, who gave up his car long ago. \u201cWe have fairly good mass transit, so use it instead.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Kevin Chau, 27, a software engineer from Queens who rides Citi Bike, said that he hoped Manhattan would become safer for cyclists. \u201cLess cars on the road means it\u2019s less dangerous for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many critics, including suburban commuters, said the program will do little to reduce traffic while punishing drivers who live outside Manhattan.\n\nOn the same day that congestion pricing began, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also began to charge drivers higher fees to travel between New Jersey and New York on bridges and tunnels, which it controls. (The rate is now $16.06 for passenger vehicles during peak hours, up by 68 cents from the previous fee.)\n\nImage Empty lanes at the New Jersey entrance of the Holland Tunnel.

Bryan Anselm for The New York Times\n\nRoselyn Cano, 21, just bought a car last week to commute from the Bronx to her job at an exercise studio on East 59th Street in Manhattan because she did not feel safe taking the subway. \u201cAnd then a couple of days later we get hit with the congestion toll,\u201d said Ms. Cano, who sat at a reception desk at the studio tallying up the costs of the new toll along with her car payment, auto insurance, parking and the toll she already pays crossing from the Bronx into Manhattan.\n\nSome New Yorkers were already devising workarounds to avoid paying the new tolls.\n\nCynthia Jones, who lives on the Upper West Side, was taking an exercise class at the studio. Her husband had dropped her off at 61st Street, one block north of the tolling zone. \u201cI walked the rest of the way here,\u201d she said.\n\nReporting was contributed by Wesley Parnell , Bernard Mokam , Nate Schweber , Olivia Bensimon , Anusha Bayya , Camille Baker , Sean Piccoli and Emma Fitzsimmons ."

            "article_content": "Researchers have discovered that a machine learning (ML) model, using dynamic ensemble selection (DES), outperforms experienced pulmonologists in cancer lung diagnosis. Lung cancer is the cause of cancer deaths in the world, mainly due to late detection. Improving survival rates is dependent on the early detection approach. A recent study was conducted by Ricco N. and colleagues which was published in the journal of Scientific Reports .\n\nThis was a retrospective analysis of data from 38,944 patients suspected to have LC within the Region of Southern Denmark from 2009 to 2018. The study included 9,940 patients with complete data, with 2,505 (25%) diagnosed with LC. The DES model involved smoking history and key blood biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, total calcium, sodium levels, leukocyte and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein. It was compared against the performance of five pulmonologists in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and others.\n\nKey Findings:\n\nModel Performance:\n\nThe DES model resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77\u00b10.01.\n\nSensitivity: 76.2%\u00b12.04%, 6.5% better than the average pulmonologist.\n\nSpecificity: 63.8%\u00b12.3%.\n\nPositive predictive value (PPV): 41.6%\u00b11.2%.\n\nF1-score: 53.8%\u00b11.0%.\n\nComparison with Pulmonologists:\n\nDEs model outperformed all the five pulmonologists, while sensitivity was exceptionally high, particularly for early-stage detection.\n\nSignificant Biomarkers:\n\nSmoking status, LDH, serum calcium levels, low sodium levels, leucocytes, neutrophil count and CRP values were the strongest predictors of LC.\n\nThe DES ML model clearly outperformed pulmonologists in detecting lung cancer with higher sensitivity and identification of critical biomarkers for risk stratification. These findings show the ability of ML in changing the current landscape of early detection strategies for improving outcomes for patients at risk of LC. ML-driven models integrated into health care could provide decision-making support to clinicians and may decrease the rate of late-stage cancer diagnosis.\n\nReference:"

In no ambiguous terms, the US administration acted to stop the spread of communist ideology in Japan. For this specific purpose, the US government negotiated a grand bargain with Japan. In return for safeguarding the status and wealth of the wartime Japanese industrial elite, Japan was ready to shake hands with the country that had just dropped two nuclear bombs on its soil. For the US, defending Japan meant protecting the US credibility and its vital national interests.

New data reported in the past few days indicate that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Mr. Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been."

            "article_content": "The recently released Thelio Astra from American computer manufacturer System76 is being touted as \"the fastest Arm desktop computer in the world\" \u2013 or at least that's what developer and influencer Jeff Geerling declared after putting the system through its paces.\n\nIn Geerling's testing using the Cinebench 2024 benchmark, the top-tier variant of the Thelio Astra, powered by the 128-core Ampere Altra Max M128-30, achieved an eye-watering 5,003 points in multi-threaded mode. This score edges out the certified world record of 4,723 points set by AMD's EPYC 7713 chip with a similar number of cores.\n\nGiven these figures, it's no surprise that the Astra also excelled in Blender rendering workloads. Geerling specifically highlighted the system's impressive 1.7 TFLOPS of double-precision compute power.\n\nWhen it comes to the overall package, this is far from your average pre-built desktop. The entry-level $3,299 model already packs a serious punch with 64 cores, 64GB of RAM, and an RTX A400 GPU. However, the top configuration Geerling tested \u2013 priced just shy of $7,000 \u2013 pulls out all the stops with 128 cores, 512GB of octa-channel RAM, 40TB of storage capacity, and an RTX 6000 Ada GPU.\n\nAll this hardware is housed in a sleek, quiet tower, which again is a surprise considering the near server-grade specs. Patriots will also be pleased to know that it's an American-made system, coming straight out of System76's Denver facility.\n\nGeerling did highlight some downsides with the system though. Beyond its ultra-premium pricing, single-threaded performance is underwhelming and barely inches past AMD's 2017 Threadripper 1950X in the same Cinebench test. That's sad considering the prodigious multi-core muscle.\n\nThere are also platform limitations to consider. The system is restricted to PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 RAM, which may feel outdated to some. Geerling was also less than thrilled with the lack of front I/O ports and noted some rattling from the PCIe brackets. And if you're thinking about gaming on this machine while running Windows, think again \u2013 Nvidia has yet to release Arm-compatible drivers.\n\nBut then again, the Thelio Astra isn't designed to be a gaming rig or a general-purpose desktop PC replacement. System76 is squarely targeting developers, with a particular emphasis on the automotive software industry, where it shines as a platform for \"rapid dev prototyping.\"\n\n\"System76 and Ampere ride together to make Thelio Astra the driving force behind AV development,\" the company notes on its website. If you're in that niche and have cash to burn, this could be the latest must-have Arm toy for you."

            "article_content": "The task of astrobiologists who seek evidence for extrasolar microbes is as simple as imitation. Primitive forms of extraterrestrial life should exist under physical conditions that were nurtured in natural environments similar to those on Earth. Hence, astrobiologists plan to search for the molecular products of microbes-as-we-know-them on rocky exoplanets with atmospheres in the habitable zone of their host stars.\n\nThe latest Decadal Survey in Astrophysics of the National Academies, Astro2020, recommended a 6-meter space telescope operating in the infrared, optical and ultraviolet bands, capable of high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. Scheduled for launch by NASA in the 2040s, this Habitable Worlds Observatory will be designed to search for spectroscopic biosignatures of microbial life in roughly 25 habitable zone exoplanets at a likely cost of over 10-billion dollars.\n\nWhere to look becomes more subtle when dealing with intelligent forms of life because they can relocate and spread away from their birth exoplanet. Almost all forms of life, on Earth and beyond, died by now. Those who survive the longest on our cosmic street might have done so by escaping their home planet on artificially made space platforms to avoid existential risks from local catastrophes.\n\nAs much as nature is often viewed as a blessing, it could also be a curse. For example, there is strong evidence that Earth\u2019s surface became nearly entirely frozen with no liquid water exposed to the atmosphere during the Cryogenian period, more than 650 million years ago. Over the entire history of Earth, more than 99.9% of the over 5-billion speciesthat ever lived went extinct. Some of these species were wiped out by well-documented cataclysmic events, such as the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary event which was likely triggered by the impact of the Chicxulub meteor which eliminated 75% of plant and animal species on Earth including the non-avian dinosaurs. However, the majority of extinctions could have been the result of natural evolution with the livelihoods of some species destroyed by changes and unfavorable competition. The situation resembles political views which lose their livelihood after a devastating Presidential election.\n\nThe typical lifespan of a terrestrial species is 1-10 million years. This is an interesting factoid, since humans evolved from great apes through the lineage of hominini \u2013 which arose 5-7 million years ago. Keeping these facts in mind, the human species is getting close to the end of its expected natural lifespan. Will technology save us?\n\nAs much as technology could delay the existential threats from a snowball or a globally-warmed Earth, the evolution of the host star itself sets a time limit on the ability of a natural nuclear furnace to support life on a planet. Most stars formed billions of years before the Sun, and the Sun will boil off all oceans on Earth within a billion years. Recognizing this and other existential risks, a sufficiently advanced technological civilization would prefer to migrate away its birth habitat. This rationale inspires Elon Musk\u2019s vision to occupy Mars and make humanity a multi-planet species.\n\nHowever, once a technological civilization develops the ability to migrate away from its birth planet, it might also be capable of pursuing its goals far away from its host star on an artificial space platform, potentially powered by its own nuclear energy source. This could lengthen considerably the most important parameter in the Drake equation, namely the lifespan of a technological civilization.\n\nTraditionally, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) targeted the vicinity of stars. However, once technology allows escape from natural habitats, all bets are off. Space platforms carrying biological entities or hardware with artificial intelligence may be found anywhere. Technological probes that can self-replicate could fill up interstellar space in less than a few billion years using conventional chemical propulsion.\n\nGiven this realization, it makes most sense to start the search for technological debris around the nearest lamppost, our Sun. This is the rationale behind the Galileo Project, which under my leadership searches for technological artifacts within the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. Our research team operates a new observatory at Harvard University and constructs two additional observatories in Pennsylvania and Nevada. My students and postdocs also plan to analyze forthcoming data from the Rubin Observatory in Chile and the Webb telescope in the coming years. Finally, we hope to conduct expeditions in search for materials from crash sites of interstellar meteors.\n\nWhat other civilizations accomplished may exceed our imagination. Therefore, it is best not to anticipate what we might find but instead search for unfamiliar objects, not produced by nature or human-made technologies.\n\nWe must hedge our bets in the search for life. This means investing billions of dollars not only in seeking biological signatures of microbes in atmospheres of exoplanets but also in the search for technological artifacts that arrive near the Sun from interstellar space. With all these efforts, the keys of life might first be discovered around the nearest lamp post on our cosmic street.\n\nAvi Loeb is the head of the Galileo Project, founding director of Harvard University\u2019s \u2013 Black Hole Initiative, director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and the former chair of the astronomy department at Harvard University (2011-2020).

            "article_content": "Strange footage captured over the US appeared to show a hovering UFO with an odd glow over a military base.\n\nAn anonymous user posted the footage from Tennessee to Reddit, showing the \u201cbright orange light\u201d over Fort Campbell, a base on the border with the state of Kentucky. The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "A new breakthrough may help scientists solve some of the mysteries of the quantum realm.\n\nFor the first time, physicists have been able to measure the geometrical 'shape' a lone electron adopts as it moves through a solid. It's an achievement that will unlock a whole new way of studying how crystalline solids behave on a quantum level.\n\n\"We've essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn't be obtained before,\" says physicist Riccardo Comin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThe research was led by physicists Mingu Kang \u2013 formerly of MIT and now at Cornell University \u2013 and Sunjie Kim of Seoul National University.\n\nWithin the physical Universe, matter behaves in ways that are well described by classical physics.\n\nHowever, on a more fundamental level of particle interactions and methods of measurement, things can get a little weird. On the finest of scales, precision must give way to a more fuzzy description represented by waves of possibility known as quantum mechanics.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nWe refer to objects like electrons as particles, and that conveys the impression that they are like teeny tiny little balls. Given their size, the properties and behaviors of electrons are far more accurately described by their wave-like quantum nature.\n\nTo describe the wave aspect of electrons, physicists use wave functions: mathematical models that describe the properties of the wave as evolving possibilities of finding the particle in a specific place with specific features.\n\nSome of these features we can think of as a kind of geometry, often not unlike a curve or sphere that rotates in an infinite number of directions. Other forms of quantum geometry, like those of electrons in a lattice of atoms, are as complicated as a Klein bottle or a M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nDetermining some aspects of the messy quantum geometry of an electron in a solid has previously involved a lot of guesswork based on properties that physicists can measure.\n\nTo measure the quantum geometry of electrons, Kang, Jie, and their colleagues sought the measurement of a property known as the quantum geometric tensor, or QGT. This is a physical quantity that encodes the entire geometric information of a quantum state, similar to the way a two-dimensional hologram encodes information about a three-dimensional space.\n\nThe technique they used is called angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in which photons are fired at a material to dislodge electrons and measure their properties, such as polarization, spin, and angle.\n\nThis was directed at single crystals of a cobalt-tin alloy, a material known as a kagome metal \u2013 a quantum material whose properties the team had previously investigated using the same technique.\n\nThe results provided the researchers with the first measurement of the QGT in a solid, and from this, they were able to infer the rest of the quantum geometry of the electrons in the metal.\n\nThe team compared this to theoretically derived quantum geometry for the same material, allowing them to determine the usefulness of estimating the geometry compared to measuring it directly.\n\nAnd, they say, their technique will be applicable to a broad range of materials, not just the cobalt-tin alloy used for this study. It's a result that will have some interesting implications. For example, quantum geometry could be leveraged to discover superconductivity in materials where it is not usually found.\n\n\"The geometric interpretation of quantum mechanics underpins many recent advances in condensed-matter physics,\" an anonymous expert told Nature Physics.\n\n\"These authors have pioneered a methodology to experimentally access the quantum geometric tensor, which fundamentally characterizes the geometric properties of quantum states. The developed methodology is straightforward, applicable to various solid-state materials, and has great potential for boosting experimental activity in pursuit of geometric understanding of novel quantum phenomena.\"\n\nThe team's research has been published in Nature Physics."

            "article_content": "Swami Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna |\n\nHaridwar, January 5: In the presence of Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj, the President of Patanjali Yogpeeth, and Acharya Balkrishna, the General Secretary, the 30th foundation day of the Patanjali institution was celebrated at the Yog Bhavan Auditorium, located at Patanjali Wellness, Haridwar. In the program, with the presence of more than 6,000 officials from the Patanjali Yogpeeth organization across the country, Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj gave an introduction to the 30 years of service, struggle, and dedication and shed light on the future plans of Patanjali Yogpeeth. While announcing the five revolutions after the success of the Yoga Revolution, he said that Patanjali will initiate significant work for freedom in education, healthcare, economy, intellectual-cultural freedom, and liberation from diseases, indulgences, shame, and frustrations.\n\nFirst Revolution: Freedom in Education\n\nHe said that today, 50 to 90, and in some places, 99 percent educated individuals are unemployed, addicted, characterless, and dull children, whose childhood, youth, and our lineage are in danger. We have decided that first in India and then in the entire world, a new education system will be introduced, and its leadership will be done by India. Patanjali Gurukul, Acharyakulam, Patanjali University, and the Indian Education Board will now establish new benchmarks. Our resolution is that in the next five years, we will connect 500,000 schools with the Indian Education Board. This will be an innovative revolution in education.\n\nWe want to give children not only literacy but also subject knowledge, self-awareness, truth-oriented patriotism, and awareness of their pride and glory. We will include knowledge from across the world in Hindi, English, and Sanskrit, keeping up-to-date with the world, but 80% of the content will be from Vedas, philosophy, Upanishads, Puranas, and the pride of India. It will include spiritual sciences, Sanatan awareness, and Indian pride. This will not be Macaulay\u2019s education system. When the Indian Education Board affiliates first 100,000 schools and then 500,000 schools, India's childhood and youth will be secure. This is the resolution for freedom in education. Through the Indian Education Board, we will not teach the false greatness of foreign invaders, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or the British, but rather the true history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, and revolutionaries.\n\nSecond Revolution: Freedom in Healthcare\n\n\"Disease is not our nature; Yoga is our nature.\" Today, around the world, due to the consumption of synthetic medicines, steroids, and painkillers, people\u2019s bodies are deteriorating. For healthcare freedom, through Patanjali Wellness, Yoggram, Niramayam, hospitals, and health centers, and modern research, we are advancing the legacy of sages and science. We have published more than 5,000 research protocols and 500 research papers in world-class international journals, presenting solutions to incurable diseases before the world. Our resolution is to prevent people from becoming diseased and to liberate them from diseases through Yoga and Ayurveda.\n\nThird Revolution: Economic Freedom\n\nToday, the entire economy is trapped in the cruel claws of a handful of people. Our goal is prosperity for service and wealth for welfare. So far, Patanjali has done charity worth \u20b91 lakh crore in education, healthcare, research, character-building, and nation-building. With over 10,000 centers, 2.5 million trained Yoga instructors, and 1 crore workers selflessly serving, this is the service work of nation-building and character-building. Our resolution is to make the Swadeshi movement so powerful that India can emerge from economic exploitation, slavery, and poverty, and become supremely prosperous. By eliminating diseases like BP, diabetes, thyroid, asthma, arthritis, stress, and depression and saving on medicines, we save \u20b9700 to \u20b92,000 lakh crore annually for the country.\n\nFourth Revolution: Intellectual and Cultural Freedom\n\nIndia, which first gave the message of spiritual world knowledge to the world, cannot afford to endure intellectual and cultural slavery. Today, India depends on impoverished countries for everything, which have nothing but paper money, dollars, or pounds. True wealth is not just money but also good health, a happy family, character, spiritual wealth, and divine virtues. We must liberate India from intellectual and cultural slavery. Hence, we aim to elevate Sanatan Dharma, Vedic Dharma, Sage Dharma, and Yoga Dharma as the new religion of the era. More than 500 crore people worldwide have faith in Yoga Dharma and Sanatan Dharma. If we walk together, we will end religious terrorism, political terrorism, and the terror being perpetuated in the name of education and healthcare.\n\nFifth Revolution: Freedom from Addictions, Diseases, and Indulgences\n\nA dangerous game of addiction is spreading worldwide. In India, addiction has destroyed lives through diseases, intoxication, and obscenity. Our resolution is freedom from diseases, addictions, and obscenity. On completing 30 years, Patanjali resolves to make the world Yoga-oriented and create ideal global citizens through character-building.\n\nRemarks by Acharya Balkrishna Ji Maharaj\n\nAcharya Balkrishna remarked that with Swami Ji's unrelenting and extraordinary efforts, Patanjali's contribution is inspiring the world. Patanjali runs campaigns for charity using profits from its business. Patanjali is not a market but a family for India. With a team of over 500 world-class scientists, Patanjali is making evidence-based Ayurvedic medicines like juices, herbs, and tablets accessible worldwide. By integrating India\u2019s ancient knowledge with modern science, Patanjali has brought Yoga from caves to the masses, reaching millions in over 200 countries."
