Are they drones or UFOs? They would have identified them by now if they were drones \u2013 even just by shooting one of them down to see what it is. But they haven\u2019t done that, and that leads us to believe that, possibly, it could be UFOs again.\"\n\nAn official for the Department of Defence stated that while there is no suggestion 'malicious intent' in regards to the mysterious sightings, they 'don't know' the origin.\n\nNally has also shared his belief that aliens are able to quickly enter and exit Earth's atmosphere via a series of 'portals', with one of these being situation between the Irish towns of Athlone and Slane.\n\nAdvert\n\nCarl Natty claims the sightings are for another reason (The Morning Show)\n\nWhich certainly contradicts the widely held idea that aliens would make first contact with mankind by plonking themselves down on the White House lawn, but hey, the real world doesn't always revolve around the US.\n\nHowever before you start stockpiling tins of beans and multipacks of loo roll, Nally is keen to remind us that there are greater threats to humanity than aliens.\n\n\"f you put that [an alien invasion] on one side of the scales and AI on the other, I\u2019d be more concerned about AI,\" he said.\n\nAdvert\n\nGlad to see we've all got our priorities in order."

            "article_content": "The rising panic over mystery drones swarming the skies of Mid-Atlantic states reminds us that, in the centuries-long hunt to identify UFOs, humans are usually the weakest link. America has real national security challenges in the new era of unmanned aerial vehicles in warfare. But an invasion of mystery drones over New Jersey isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAs it turns out, just as eyewitnesses often bungle the details of, say, a car accident on the corner, we are notoriously unreliable when it comes to identifying and reporting UFOs. A huge percentage of \u201csightings\u201d turn out, upon investigation, to be the planet Venus or other surprisingly bright astronomical phenomena; people on the ground regularly misjudge distances in the sky so that even objects miles away are perceived to be close by.\n\nThe UFO mistaken-identity problem is a big part of the reason that the military and scientists now refer to such sightings more precisely as UAP, or unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 a label meant to capture that many sightings might not be \u201cobjects\u201d at all but are more likely to be known, or as yet unknown, astronomical and atmospheric phenomena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven skilled aviators make mistakes. On Oct. 1, 1948, Lt. George Gorman, a World War II veteran and pilot in the North Dakota Air National Guard, gave chase in his P-51 fighter after spotting the bright light of a UFO race past him in the skies over Fargo. At speeds of over 400 mph, he engaged it in a dogfight for nearly 30 minutes, the ball-shaped UFO bobbing and weaving around him as it executed turns that he felt were aerodynamically impossible. He finally broke off the engagement, never identifying the bogey. \u201cJust when we were about to collide, I guess I got scared,\u201d he told investigators, adding later: \u201cIt is hard to believe your own eyes when something with no wings walks off and leaves you standing still.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later determined that Gorman had been chasing a weather balloon launched about 10 minutes before he spotted it. The balloon had simply been floating along in the night sky, and he\u2019d been diving and racing all around it.\n\nJ. Allen Hynek, the astronomer and godfather of \u201cufology,\u201d who spent a quarter-century working with the Air Force on its UFO studies and coined the phrase \u201cclose encounters of the third kind,\u201d told an interviewer late in his career, \u201cPilots have been known to swerve their planes violently when they suddenly encounter a very bright meteor they think is on a collision course, but which later proves to have been 50 to 100 miles away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people who are serious about studying UAP are trying to get humans out of the reporting loop: At a congressional hearing last summer, Ryan Graves \u2014 a former Navy aviator who had his own experiences encountering UAP and now leads an advocacy organization called Americans for Safe Aerospace \u2014 proposed a more reliable alternative to the grainy, black-and-white (but supposedly revealing) photos that dot the internet: sensors. Similarly, Harvard astronomy professor Avi Loeb, one of the leading voices in UAP studies, argues that we need to far better understand what a \u201cregular\u201d sky looks like before trying to determine what\u2019s \u201canomalous.\u201d As Loeb told me last year: \u201cTrust in data. People are a waste of time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the self-centered confidence that underlies so many UFO reports, that people\u2019s first instinct upon spotting a bright, moving light in the night sky is not to assume the obvious \u2014 say, a star, meteor, satellite or faraway jetliner \u2014 but instead to imagine that, after an alien craft journeyed thousands of light-years across interstellar space to visit Earth, the aliens would pick that moment on a random Tuesday night to reveal themselves to someone on a dark, rural road or in a suburban backyard. Occam\u2019s razor, the useful medieval theory that argues the simplest explanation is usually the best, would tell you that the sound of hoofbeats more likely means horses than zebras.\n\nPartly, that instinct stems from something fundamental. The question \u201cAre we alone?\u201d is one of the three most basic questions that have fascinated humans since the first caveman campfires, a question that ranks alongside \u201cWhat happens after death?\u201d and \u201cIs there a God?\u201d as the most profound and potentially life-altering mysteries we wrestle with. Who wouldn\u2019t want to knock out an answer to one of the Big Three while taking out the garbage late at night?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, our cultural fascination with UFOs stems from the fact that it is a rare area where we can all gaze upon the deepest frontier of knowledge. As an ordinary person, I can\u2019t add much to the already-advanced scientific and mathematical questions of our time: I\u2019m not liable to crack string theory wide open during a weekend barbecue, nor is my tinkering in the garage likely to deliver to humanity the secret to nuclear fusion."

            "article_content": "UFOs have been spotted over an RAF base in Cornwall\n\nMysterious UFOs have been spotted over an RAF base following weeks of similar sightings. The unidentified objects were seen over the past couple of weeks in St Cleer near Liskeard, Cornwall, and in Porthtowan on the north coast. One dog walker told CornwallLive that they saw a strange light in the sky in Porthtowan at around 7.18pm last Monday (December 9). They said it hovered for about 10 minutes before it slowly moved south down the coast. Video footage shows the walker approaching the RAF base near Porthtowan along the path before they zoom into an odd light hovering in the distance. The dog walker said they believe what they saw is linked to another UFO sighting in Newquay recently.\n\nA \u201cblue or white object\u201d was also spotted hovering around the full moon by photographer Chris Piper, while he was looking back at motion pictures he took of the lunar halo - an optical illusion that causes a large bright ring around the moon - on Sunday night (December 15) in St Cleer.\n\nREAD MORE The UFOs sparking fears of alien invasion across America\n\nThere have been UFO sightings for the last few weeks in Cornwall\n\nHe said: \u201cI was photographing the lunar halo and it wasn't until I showed [the pictures] to my friend that he noticed the blue dot hovering around the moon. When I looked back at the motion pictures, it appeared to be moving.\u201d Just last week, CornwallLive reported that a stargazer spotted a mysterious \"phenomenon\" in Newquay at about 6.30pm also on Monday, December 9. \"Intrigued\" Monique Lyle grabbed her phone and started filming what looked \"like something out of a science fiction movie\" from the balcony. The 41-year-old said at the time: \"When I first saw the object, I was completely taken aback. I often stargaze, so I'm familiar with the night sky, and I knew immediately that this wasn\u2019t a star or any usual phenomenon like an aircraft. It was bright, changing colours, and seemed unusually close to town.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

AI matting uses trained models to find edges, which results in a better outcome due to the model \"understanding\" what shape a given object has.\n\nOnline background remover tools are often slow, reduce the quality of the original image, and result with a white background instead of a transparent background. Then you're back to square one in the editing process needing a new background provided by different design tools.\n\nSystem requirements for Mac\n\nAiarty Image Matting is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems.\n\nThe Mac minimum requirement for Intel models is macOS 10.15 and Apple Silicon is macOS 11.

It's a given that Demon Slayer is a winner, so we kept it off this roundup because you've undoubted already watched, but the other titles are prime for a good binge if you're relaxing before the new year.\n\nYou can visit Crunchyroll for some of these, but Hulu, Netflix and Prime offer anime and Max has Uzumaki. Check out our list of entertaining anime movies and shows that were among the best that this year had to offer.\n\nRead more: Best Streaming Services of 2024\n\nYukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha/Dandadan Production Committee Dandadan Dandadan is on multiple platforms, and it's one of my favorite anime releases of the year.

            "article_content": "Polygon readers enjoyed our list of last year\u2019s best anime openings so much, we\u2019re doing it again! So, with that in mind, we\u2019ve once again compiled a list of this year\u2019s best opening sequences, highlighting the most bop-worthy title tracks and the amazing artists who brought them to life on screen.\n\nDan Da Dan \u2014 \u2018Otonoke\u2019\n\nDirector: Abel G\u00f3ngora\n\nMusic by: Creepy Nuts\n\nDan Da Dan quickly asserted itself as one of this year\u2019s best anime when it premiered in theaters in September, followed by its television debut in October. Aside from its inherently zany premise of a misfit couple of high school classmates battling against an inexplicable deluge of paranormal and extraterrestrial adversaries, the anime also boasted one of this year\u2019s most striking opening sequences.\n\nAbel G\u00f3ngora, the Spanish animator and director known for his work on last year\u2019s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, the 2021 Star Wars: Visions short \u201cT0-B1,\u201d and the title sequence for 2020\u2019s Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!, delivers a visually bristling cinematic experience with Dan Da Dan\u2019s opening titles. Packed with extreme close-ups, psychedelic colors, and black silhouettes that pay homage to the opening of 1966\u2019s Ultraman, G\u00f3ngora is as bizarre and hard to forget as the anime itself. Combined with an infectiously hyperactive track by Japanese hip-hop duo Creepy Nuts, and you\u2019ve got an opening sequences for the ages.\n\nOne Piece \u2014 \u2018UUUUUS!\u2019\n\nDirector: Megumi Ishitani\n\nMusic by: Hiroshi Kitadai\n\nMegumi Ishitani is popularly considered by One Piece fans to be one of the best directors to ever work on the series. Known for her standout work as an episode director on episodes 957, 982, and 1,015 of the Wano Country Arc, as well as the \u201cOne Piece Fan Letter\u201d episode produced to celebrate the anime\u2019s 25th anniversary, Ishitani is recognized for her cinematic sensibilities when it comes to scale, pacing, and lighting.\n\nAll of those qualities are on full display in the series\u2019 26th opening sequence, which combines expressive \u201crubber hose animation,\u201d bright colors, and deft editing that complements the pacing of Hiroshi Kitadai\u2019s rousing track \u201cUUUUUS!\u201d Ishitani\u2019s opening is yet another stunning accomplishment in the director\u2019s nascent career, and a thrilling sequence that carries the torch of One Piece\u2019s legacy proudly forward.\n\nMashle: Magic and Muscles \u2014 \u2018Bling-Bang-Bang-Born\u2019\n\nDirector: Shun Enokido\n\nMusic by: Creepy Nuts\n\nCreepy Nuts were on a hot streak all throughout 2024. Before delivering the anime bop of the fall season with Dan Da Dan\u2019s aforementioned opening track \u201cOtonoke,\u201d Japanese hip-hop duo DJ Matsunaga and rapper-singer R-Shitei blew the door off the hinges with their track \u201cBling-Bang-Bang-Born\u201d for the second season of Mashle: Magic and Muscles.\n\nTo the tell the truth, Shun Enokido\u2019s opening animation is fine\u2026 but, well, just fine. It\u2019s obvious that Creepy Nuts\u2019 track is pulling most of the weight here, as the sequence itself is composed almost entirely of montage shots sharply contrasted with stark primary colors and split-screen transitions. The song really popped off on social media, with TikTok users creating mashups of the track and dancing in rhythm to the beat.\n\nMetallic Rouge \u2014 \u2018Rouge\u2019\n\nDirector: Motonobu Hori\n\nMusic by: Yu-ka\n\nOf all the anime openings to air in 2024, Metallic Rouge\u2019s took me by surprise. If I had a list of things I had expected to see and hear this year, an anime opening inspired by \u201980s new jack swing would not have been one of them. Nevertheless, Yu-ka\u2019s track \u201cRouge\u201d absolutely rocks. Series director Motonobu Hori combines sci-fi iconography and blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it foreshadowing to create an opening that\u2019s as evocative as it is entertaining to watch.\n\nDelicious in Dungeon \u2014 \u2018Sleep Walking Orchestra\u2019\n\nDirector: Yoshihiro Miyajima\n\nMusic by: Bump of Chicken\n\nEverything about Delicious in Dungeon\u2019s opening makes the audience feel like they\u2019re about to embark on an adventure. Bump of Chicken\u2019s \u201cSleep Walking Orchestra\u201d sets the tone perfectly, with a rousing melody played on a hammered dulcimer paired with Irish flute before transitioning into a thumping drum kick and whimsical rhythm guitar section. Yoshihiro Miyajima, the director of Delicious in Dungeon\u2019s first season, does an excellent job introducing viewers who aren\u2019t already familiar with Ryoko Kui\u2019s fantasy manga to its characters and universe. All in all, it\u2019s a lighthearted beat that beckons the audience to come along for the ride.\n\nThe Elusive Samurai \u2014 \u2018Plan A\u2019\n\nDirector: Miyuki Kuroki\n\nMusic by: DISH//"

            "article_content": "Scientists' best theories on how planets form could be wrong, new research suggests. Astronomers studying a still-forming planet beyond our solar system have found that its chemical makeup doesn't fully match the swirling gas and dust disk from which it formed. The finding challenges standard models of planet formation and implies they may be overly simplistic, the researchers say.\n\nThe budding planet, called PDS 70b, is a world nearly thrice as big as Jupiter and resides about 400 light-years from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. It is part of a two-planet system \u2014 one of the few known where planets are still coalescing, providing a valuable environment for astronomers to examine the link between newborn planets and their natal disk. PDS 70b circles its host star at a distance similar to Uranus' orbit around the sun, and previous observations have hinted that it could be nearing the end of its newborn era after accumulating mass for about 5 million years.\n\nIn May, astronomers used Hawaii's Keck II telescope to study the chemical makeup of PDS 70b, specifically looking at the abundance of carbon monoxide and water. The team used this information to infer how much carbon and oxygen is present in the planet's atmosphere \u2014 two of the most common elements in our universe after hydrogen and helium and thus key traces of planet formation.\n\nBy comparing these observations with archival data on the gases in the system's protoplanetary disk, the researchers found that the planet's atmosphere contains much less carbon and oxygen than expected. They described their findings in a paper published Wednesday (Dec. 18) in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n\"That was a bit surprising, and it shows that our widely accepted picture of planet formation was too simplified,\" study lead author Chih-Chun Hsu , an observational astrophysicist who is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University in Illinois, said in a statement .\n\nThe puzzling rise of planets\n\nScientists believe that planets, including those in our solar system, form when particles in the protoplanetary disk collide and stick together, eventually forming larger bodies through accretion. If this is indeed a universal process, planets should have similar chemical compositions to their disks.\n\nRelated: Scientists followed a mysterious signal \u2014 and found 2 black holes gorging on something like never before\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

First, PDS 70b could have incorporated the majority of its carbon and oxygen not directly from the gas in the protoplanetary disk but from solid material like ice and dust, which would have contained trapped carbon and oxygen.\n\nRecent James Webb Space Telescope observations of other planetary systems suggest such a process is possible and can hold sway over the chemical makeup of fledgling planets. If PDS 70b followed the same route, \"that ice and dust would have evaporated before going into the planet,\" study co-author Jason Wang , an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University, said in the statement. \"So, it might be telling us that we can't just compare gas versus gas \u2014 the solid components might be making a big difference in the carbon to oxygen ratio.\"\n\nAlternatively, the protoplanetary disk may have become enriched in carbon relatively recently, as other models of planet formation predict . Existing data about the system is not sufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities, but forthcoming observations of the second planet, PDS 70c, may provide the necessary insights for more detailed modeling of the system, the researchers said.\n\n\"By studying these two planets together, we can understand the system's formation history even better,\" Hsu said. \"But this is just one system. Ideally, we need to identify more of them to better understand how planets form.\""

Early testers found it's blowing OpenAI's Sora out of the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI made its Sora AI video generator available for general use earlier this month, while Google's is still in early preview. Still, people are sharing comparisons of the two models running the same prompts, and so far, Veo has proved more impressive.\n\nWhy is Google's Veo 2 doing better than Sora so far? The answer may be YouTube, which Google owns and has used to train these models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTED host and former Googler Bilawal Sidhu shared some comparisons of Google's Veo 2 and OpenAI's Sora on X.\n\nHe said he used the prompt, \"Eating soup like they do in Europe, the old fashioned way,\" which generated a terrifying result in Sora and something more impressive in Google's Veo 2.\n\nVeo 2 prompt: \"Eating soup like they do in Europe, the old fashioned way\" https://t.co/gX9gh1fFy6 pic.twitter.com/kgR7VP2URl \u2014 Bilawal Sidhu (@bilawalsidhu) December 18, 2024\n\nHere's another, which took a prompt that YouTube star Marques Brownlee had tried in a video reviewing Sora.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Veo 2 vs. OpenAI Sora\n\n\n\nTried MKBHD's prompt: \"A side scrolling shot of a rhinoceros walking through a dry field of low grass plants\"\n\n\n\nTook the 1st video I got out of Veo, and it's not even close. Prompt adherence & physics modeling? Leagues apart. Sora nails the look, but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mus9MdRsWo \u2014 Bilawal Sidhu (@bilawalsidhu) December 17, 2024\n\nThis one from EasyGen founder Ruben Hassid included a prompt for someone cutting a tomato with a knife. In the video he shared, we see how Google's Veo 2 had the knife going cleanly through the tomato and avoiding fingers, while the knife in Sora's video cut through the hand.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI tested Sora vs. the new Google Veo-2.\n\n\n\nI feel like comparing a bike vs. a starship: pic.twitter.com/YcHsVcUyn2 \u2014 Ruben Hassid (@RubenHssd) December 17, 2024\n\nGranted, these are cherry-picked examples, but the consensus among AI enthusiasts is that Google has outperformed.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz partner Justine Moore wrote on X that she had spent a few hours testing Veo against Sora and believed Sora's \"biases towards more motion\" while Veo focuses on accuracy and physics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSora vs. Veo 2:\n\n\n\nI spent a few hours running prompts on both models and wanted to share some comparisons \u2b07\ufe0f.\n\n\n\nIMO - Sora biases towards more motion, whereas Veo focuses more on accuracy / physics. And a larger % of clips from Veo are usable.\n\n\n\n\"man jumping over hurdles\" pic.twitter.com/WI9zIaJA64 \u2014 Justine Moore (@venturetwins) December 18, 2024\n\nGoogle has been open about tapping YouTube data for its AI, but it does not permit others to do the same. The New York Times previously reported that OpenAI had trained its models using some YouTube data anyway. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said OpenAI doing this would violate Google's policies.\n\nBI previously reported that Google's DeepMind also tapped YouTube's vast trove of content to build an impressive music generator that never saw the light of day.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

            "article_content": "What\u2019s Ahead in Generative AI in 2025? (Part One)\n\nPredictions for AI in the coming year.\n\nThe generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom will continue unabated over the next several years. As 2025 approaches, I predict the following key trends in generative AI.\n\nPrediction #1: Expanding Generative AI Usage\n\nAdoption of generative AI will accelerate across business and consumer markets in 2025 and beyond. Already, generative AI features are becoming a key differentiator in enterprise applications in the form of conversational user interfaces, embedded digital assistants, natural-language chatbots, task-oriented copilots, and other large language model (LLM)-powered productivity augmentations.\n\nTDWI research shows that productization of generative AI is starting to gain traction in enterprises. A recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness showed that 30% of organizations have already deployed the technology or have expressed a significant interest in adopting it in the coming year. By the same token, 46% are discussing how generative AI could be useful in their businesses.\n\nPrediction #2: More Transformative Experiences\n\nGenerative AI will transform the experience of more devices, applications, and services in 2025. Already, voice chatbots powered by generative AI are becoming a popular choice for the self-service experience of every app, including no-code business analytics tools.\n\nTDWI research shows that generative AI is rapidly changing how enterprises get work done. A recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that 37% of organizations have already built or are planning to deploy generative AI chatbots for customer support applications, 28% for marketing content generation, 26% for onboarding new employees, and for many other use cases. Over the next several years, we predict that generative AI will democratize many professions as knowledge workers adopt tools that enable them to single-handedly produce sophisticated deliverables that once required highly skilled teams and expensive, time-consuming production processes.\n\nTDWI research also shows that the generative AI application experience will grow more multimodal. In 2025 and beyond, multimodal LLMs will proliferate as developers create more generative AI apps that work with text, image, video, audio, and other data modalities. In the recent TDWI survey on achieving success with modern analytics, 46% of enterprises report either using generative AI text prompting now to generate images and other modalities or plan to do so over the next few years.\n\nPrediction #3: More Sophisticated Platforms and Tools\n\nGenerative AI will be a principal driver in the evolution of enterprise data foundations in 2025.\n\nDemand for multimodal applications of generative AI will drive evolution of enterprise data lakes, data pipelines, data governance, and much more. Likewise, adoption of generative AI will bring such platforms and tools as vector databases, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation into the enterprise mainstream.\n\nIn the coming year, prompt engineering will continue its rapid maturation into a substantial body of proven practices for eliciting the correct output from LLMs and other foundation models.\n\nWithin generative AI development tool sets, embedding libraries will become an essential component for developers to build increasingly sophisticated similarity searches that span a diverse range of data modalities. The recent TDWI survey on enterprise AI readiness shows that 28% of organizations already use or are deploying vector databases to store vector embeddings for use with AI models, while 32% plan to adopt those databases in the next few years.\n\nIn addition, generative AI developers in 2025 will have access to a growing range of tools for no-code development of \u201cagentic\u201d applications that provide autonomous LLM-driven copilot, chatbot, and other functionality and that can be orchestrated over more complex process environments. Agentic workflows, leveraging a new phenomenon known as a \u201clarge action model,\u201d will be a growing focus of intelligent process automation.\n\nPrediction #4: More Diverse Models and Data\n\nDevelopers will have access in 2025 to a growing range of sophisticated models and data for building, training, and optimizing generative AI applications\u2014including both commercial and open-source models.\n\nThe recent TDWI survey on data and analytics trends showed that around 25% of enterprises are experimenting with private or public generative AI models, while 17% are building generative AI apps that use company data with pretrained models. The survey also showed that 41% of enterprises are exploring how to use generative AI to build apps that use private data.\n\nOnline cloud marketplaces will become a favorite source of third-party training data for more enterprise AI developers. I also predict that enterprises will increasingly rely on synthetic data generation as an alternative for training generative AI in use cases where authentic source data is either too costly, restricted, or unavailable for their needs.\n\nRead more predictions about AI governance and ROI in Part Two of this article."

            "article_content": "Check Out the Key Software Development Trends That May Emerge in 2025\n\nThe world of software development is evolving at a pace we\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nEach year brings new breakthroughs, fresh approaches, and bold ideas that redefine how we build and interact with technology. By 2025, some trends will reshape the way developers and businesses operate, while others will open up new opportunities we might not even fully grasp yet.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what the future of software development might look like in 2025 and why these trends are worth paying attention to.\n\nGenerative AI: A New Coding Ally\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves all across industries, and in software development, it\u2019s become an essential tool. AI is no longer just an assistant; it\u2019s becoming an indispensable co-developer.\n\nIn 2025, AI-powered tools will:\n\nWrite code faster than ever, taking over repetitive tasks so developers can focus on solving real problems.\n\nDebug software more efficiently, spotting and fixing issues before they even cause disruptions.\n\nEmpower people who aren\u2019t traditional developers to build their own applications using natural language prompts.\n\nThink of AI as a partner that boosts creativity and efficiency for any software development company, and it can make software development not just faster but smarter.\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms: Breaking Down Barriers\n\nImagine a world where you don\u2019t need to know how to code to create software. That is the promise of low-code and no-code platforms, and by 2025, these tools will become even more powerful.\n\nFor businesses, this is a game-changer.

            "article_content": "Scientists' best theories on how planets form could be wrong, new research suggests. Astronomers studying a still-forming planet beyond our solar system have found that its chemical makeup doesn't fully match the swirling gas and dust disk from which it formed. The finding challenges standard models of planet formation and implies they may be overly simplistic, the researchers say.\n\nThe budding planet, called PDS 70b, is a world nearly thrice as big as Jupiter and resides about 400 light-years from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. It is part of a two-planet system \u2014 one of the few known where planets are still coalescing, providing a valuable environment for astronomers to examine the link between newborn planets and their natal disk. PDS 70b circles its host star at a distance similar to Uranus' orbit around the sun, and previous observations have hinted that it could be nearing the end of its newborn era after accumulating mass for about 5 million years.\n\nIn May, astronomers used Hawaii's Keck II telescope to study the chemical makeup of PDS 70b, specifically looking at the abundance of carbon monoxide and water. The team used this information to infer how much carbon and oxygen is present in the planet's atmosphere \u2014 two of the most common elements in our universe after hydrogen and helium and thus key traces of planet formation.\n\nBy comparing these observations with archival data on the gases in the system's protoplanetary disk, the researchers found that the planet's atmosphere contains much less carbon and oxygen than expected. They described their findings in a paper published Wednesday (Dec. 18) in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n\"That was a bit surprising, and it shows that our widely accepted picture of planet formation was too simplified,\" study lead author Chih-Chun Hsu , an observational astrophysicist who is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University in Illinois, said in a statement .\n\nThe puzzling rise of planets\n\nScientists believe that planets, including those in our solar system, form when particles in the protoplanetary disk collide and stick together, eventually forming larger bodies through accretion. If this is indeed a universal process, planets should have similar chemical compositions to their disks.\n\nRelated: Scientists followed a mysterious signal \u2014 and found 2 black holes gorging on something like never before\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe researchers propose two scenarios that could explain the observed discrepancy. First, PDS 70b could have incorporated the majority of its carbon and oxygen not directly from the gas in the protoplanetary disk but from solid material like ice and dust, which would have contained trapped carbon and oxygen.\n\nRecent James Webb Space Telescope observations of other planetary systems suggest such a process is possible and can hold sway over the chemical makeup of fledgling planets. If PDS 70b followed the same route, \"that ice and dust would have evaporated before going into the planet,\" study co-author Jason Wang , an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University, said in the statement. \"So, it might be telling us that we can't just compare gas versus gas \u2014 the solid components might be making a big difference in the carbon to oxygen ratio.\"\n\nAlternatively, the protoplanetary disk may have become enriched in carbon relatively recently, as other models of planet formation predict . Existing data about the system is not sufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities, but forthcoming observations of the second planet, PDS 70c, may provide the necessary insights for more detailed modeling of the system, the researchers said.\n\n\"By studying these two planets together, we can understand the system's formation history even better,\" Hsu said. \"But this is just one system. Ideally, we need to identify more of them to better understand how planets form.\""

            "article_content": "Target and touch totals are important but not as important as the market share. \u201cTargets\u201d is mostly a receiver stat (although there are some notable early exceptions). Touches are the currency of the running back.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is really simple. For pass-catchers, market share is targets divided by team pass attempts. For running backs, it is touches divided by team plays from scrimmage (not team touches, to be clear).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnap counts, depth of target and type of touch (running back receptions are far more valuable than carries) are also important but will generally not be discussed here. This is pure market share. Consider this a primary tool for assessing waivers and trades.\n\nHere\u2019s the list. Be sure to select the current week, though all the weeks of the season will be archived, so you can get a multi-week sample on a player if you so desire. Also, note I put great thought into providing these stats weekly. The objective here is to respond quickly to present trends. Yearly stats smoothen everything out to a somewhat meaningless middle. As our Gene McCaffrey so wisely says, \u201cTo be very right, you have to be willing to be very wrong.\u201d\n\nScoop City Newsletter Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Sign Up\n\nRunning Back Touches\n\nThis is the final market share report of the year, but I will update the sheet next week, gratis. Happy holidays!\n\nThere\u2019s not much for waivers this week, but there are tough calls to make in your Week 16 lineups.\n\nJerome Ford is rostered in less than half of Yahoo leagues (44 percent), so he could be on waivers in your league. But should we start him against the Bengals if we have him on our teams, or we can pick him up? I\u2019d have him about RB20, given that Jameis Winston is benched. Dorian Thompson-Robinson has basically no floor except whatever we think the Bengals\u2019 defense provides (which could be somewhat high). Maybe Ford is 15th. My point is he\u2019s not an automatic start.\n\nKendre Miller has a brutal matchup against Green Bay, and we\u2019re not sure Alvin Kamara is even out. If Kamara plays, that\u2019s probably the worst-case scenario for managers of both players. Miller and Kamara will have to contribute mostly as receivers, and they won\u2019t do much in the passing game without Derek Carr as their QB.\n\nTyjae Spears is similarly rostered (45 percent), so he\u2019s another RB you can possibly get for nothing. Again, he\u2019s a low-end RB2 for me, though that goes up a little if Mason Rudolph plays (more expected passes/completions/first downs). Rudolph is likely starting (see below).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see people thinking Tyler Allgeier is in play. He typically gets 10 touches \u2026 maybe a TD. But the Falcons offense is completely broken due to Kirk Cousins being toast. I\u2019d rather play Emanuel Wilson, given the likelihood of a lot of rushes from the Packers\u2019 backup RB at home against the Saints on Monday night.\n\nChase Brown (No. 3) is an automatic starter, of course, and the Cleveland defense is not nearly as good as its reputation. More automatic starts: No. 6 Rico Dowdle and No. 18 Bucky Irving, who is enjoying a historically efficient rookie rushing season. I guess No. 19 Rachaad White, who keeps scoring TDs, has to be played, too.\n\nBreece Hall (No. 24) is fringy, given his knee injury. The same applies to the Chiefs RBs (No. 25 Kareem Hunt and No. 26 Isiah Pacheco). Giants Tyrone Tracy Jr. and Devin Singletary (No. 29 and No. 28, respectively) are in the same bucket of plausibility in Flex10 formats if you have elite receivers.\n\nReceiver Targets\n\nAs for receivers on waivers, generally, I\u2019d rank them Romeo Doubs, Jalen Coker, Rashod Bateman.\n\nThe matchup with the Steelers is the major problem for Bateman. The Ravens are likely to score one to two TDs.\n\nI like Doubs (No. 55) more than the market because the top three Green Bay WRs each have two-TD ceilings and no floor. They\u2019re exactly the same. So Doubs has a 20 to 33 percent chance of winning a playoff game for you, no different than Jayden Reed, even though Reed will be started in almost all deeper formats.\n\nCoker gets the Cardinals, a sort of a neutral matchup, in the Mayor of Munchkin City Bowl (winner gets to keep the ruby slippers).\n\nJerry Jeudy (No. 2) is someone you have to sweat about playing now that DTR is replacing Jameis Winston \u2014 which is likely horrible for Jeudy \u2026 even against Cincy.\n\nTerry McLaurin (No. 11) has 10 TDs, so he\u2019s an automatic start, right? Well, the Eagles are one of those rare pass defenses with a shutdown corner who shadows the No. 1 WR, forcing teams to make very unconventional decisions \u2014 or at least think about them. McLaurin had zero targets in 20 snaps against Quinyon Mitchell in their meeting in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people who have been benching Keenan Allen (No. 4) should start him this week. Given that Allen plays the Lions (there is no \u201cD\u201d in Detroit), I\u2019d definitely pick him over McLaurin.\n\nTrey McBride, at No. 12, was the top TE in market share. The narrative next year will be that too many of his points were derived from non-TD plays, and he\u2019s not getting that many catches again. Well, my narrative is there is no such thing as a non-TD TE, so he\u2019ll probably get 10 TDs next year. I will draft him like he had at least 30 more fantasy points in 2024.\n\nBrian Thomas Jr. was 14th, perfect for those with him on their teams.\n\nOur No. 1 waiver wire TE, Brenton Strange, was the fourth-highest-targeted TE. The Jaguars play the Raiders in \u201cLost Wages.\u201d Strange finished behind Chig Okonkwo, but I need the Titans to play Mason Rudolph and not Will Levis to pick up Okonkwo. We know this is at least planned.\n\nThe Tennessee #Titans are planning to make a switch at quarterback this week, source told ESPN. Mason Rudolph is the logical candidate to step in for starter Will Levis, who likely heads to the bench barring surprise. \u2014 Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) December 17, 2024\n\nIf he\u2019s starting again in Week 16, Stone Smartt (the last T stands for \u201cTargets,\u201d says my Yahoo colleague and podcast partner Scott Pianowski) is in the top 12 TE conversation \u2013 early game against the Broncos, who shut down WRs and don\u2019t care about tight ends.\n\n(Top photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)"

            "article_content": "Snow business\n\nYesterday: Where the money went, and why\n\nToday: Should a lack of snow be considered a federal disaster?\n\nTomorrow: Efforts to 'save winter' in a warming climate\n\nThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist , a nonprofit environmental media organization.\n\nThe slopes haven\u2019t opened yet at Mt. Holiday, a small ski hill in Traverse City. They\u2019re still building up the base of snow.\n\nJim Pearson, the executive director, has been coming to the slope since he was a teenager in the mid-1980s. And he hopes they\u2019ll have a decent season thanks to some cold nights that have made up for slightly warmer days, a big difference from last season \u2014 northern Michigan\u2019s hottest winter on record.\n\n\u201cAll of it would melt, because it was getting into the 60s, it was 40s at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's no way we can compete with that kind of weather.\u201d\n\nWith businesses like Mt. Holiday battered by months of warm weather, the federal government declared a drought in over 40 Michigan counties , including in Grand Traverse County, where the ski hill is located.\n\nThat allowed Pearson to apply for a federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA), and Mt. Holiday received $480,000 interest-free for a year. It helped meet the payroll and catch up on bills.\n\n\u201cEven if we're not making snow that lasts, we still have to make snow,\u201d he said. That made for expensive electricity bills. \u201cYou have 10 [snow] guns running all night long for two or three days. That's a lot of power and a lot of expense.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture determines which areas fall under droughts and are available for assistance. But relying on the drought declarations for loans meant some counties that were harmed by the warmer winter, but didn\u2019t have that designation, didn\u2019t qualify for help.\n\nNow, a group of senators from Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota want to expand the program to include a new category of economic disaster: a lack of snow.\n\nHow it would work\n\nThe bill, introduced this September in the U.S. Senate, is called the Winter Recreation Small Business Recovery Act . It would make a small tweak to the language of the existing program.\n\nElected officials have pushed for such steps before; last spring, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on the federal government to provide more options, saying businesses struggling with warm winters didn't have a good way to access federal relief.\n\nThe idea is to ensure that businesses harmed by winters like the last one are able to get help. Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, was not made available for an interview with IPR. In a news release, he said Michigan had \"lost millions of dollars in revenue,\" and that ski hills had lost around $41 million and laid off thousands of employees.\n\n\u201cNo one had really contemplated the fact that a lack of snow and ice was a different kind of drought,\u201d said Brad Garmon, the executive director of the state\u2019s Outdoor Recreation Industry Office within the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.\n\nThe existing drought declaration doesn't work for many businesses that rely on snow. And while organizations and governments need long-term strategies to deal with a changing climate, Garmon said expanding the loan program would help make distribution of these funds more equitable.\n\nThe program \u201cwas so unevenly accessible and we had businesses that could need it but couldn't get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is a fix to one particular tool. It's not the fix, necessarily, for everything that we're facing.\u201d\n\nA Mt. Holiday employee checks on equipment in December 2024. (Photo: Izzy Ross/IPR News)\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nClimate trends are pointing to warmer winters for places like northern Michigan.\n\nSteven Dundas, an environmental economist and associate professor at Oregon State University who studies the intersection of economy and climate, agreed that this kind of loan program helps in the short term, but said that with \u201cmost climate models predicting reduced snowpack moving forward, this, to me, seems like a short-run fix for a long-run problem.\u201d\n\nEstimating how climate change could reshape the recreation economy is difficult, Dundas said; the range of factors and potential outcomes makes it hard to draw neat conclusions. For instance, warmer springs and falls could allow for certain outdoor activities to rise in some areas.\n\nStill, the effects of unpredictable winters and low snow can be devastating. Dundas pointed to a 2022 study published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management that gathered national data from short-term rentals like AirBnBs near ski resorts and correlated it to snowpack.\n\n\u201cThey suggest ski areas could see visitation drops around 60% with billions of dollars in annual damages,\" he said, with the authors predicting declines of 40 - 60% by the end of the century. Much of that is concentrated in Utah and California, but while the results varied widely by state, the study found places like Michigan could lose tens of millions of dollars in revenue from recreation each year.\n\nDundas said expanding the SBA loan program would help prepare for unusual weather rather than long-term shifts in the climate.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill is perfect for a weather shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we anticipate that that weather shock is going to become more common as climate changes, that requires kind of a little bit more out of the box thinking about policies that can help incentivize adaptation and resilience in these communities, rather than a boom-and-bust climate cycle with snowpack.\"\n\nSome left behind, this time\n\nThe sauna at Ruth Lake Resort in March 2024. (Courtesy: Dax Richer)\n\nFor many who depend on winter weather for their livelihood, even a small fix can make a big difference.\n\nThe Senate bill is trying to reach people like Dax Richer, one of the new owners of Ruth Lake Resort, in the Upper Peninsula\u2019s Baraga County. That county was not under a drought declaration, even though they didn\u2019t get enough snow to bring in many visitors, so his resort was not eligible for those federal loans.\n\n\u201cWe had absolutely no one stay at the resort during the winter months during our first year of owning it,\u201d he said. Richer and his husband were expecting to make around $125,000 this year. They made less than half that, around $47,000. \u201cWe're completely confused why our county, in the middle of all these other counties that received support, was singled out to not receive it.\u201d\n\nAnd while summers are still busy, if tourism doesn\u2019t work out, he said, they might turn the resort into long-term housing.\n\nBack at Mt. Holiday, the fragrance of burning wood drifts from a sauna trailer whose owner rents space in the parking lot, just one of the changes they\u2019ve made in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be out here, hiking, biking. I want to do concerts, running events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're in partnership with East Bay Township to expand those trails. Hopefully that'll start this summer.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re looking at a new norm, Pearson said, so they\u2019re hedging their bets.\n\nIPR\u2019s Claire Keenan-Kurgan contributed to this report."

The opinions expressed in this article are the sponsor\u2019s own.\n\nWhich hosting service is best for agencies?\n\nHow do I uncover what will be best for my clients in 2025?\n\nWhat features should my hosting service have in 2025?\n\nHosting has evolved well beyond keeping websites online.\n\nHosting providers must align their services to meet clients\u2019 technological needs and keep up with constantly changing technological advances.\n\nToday, quality hosting companies must focus on speed, security, and scalability. Staying ahead of hosting trends is critical to maintaining competitive offerings, optimizing workflows, and meeting client demands.\n\nSo, what should you watch for in 2025?\n\nThe next 12 months promise significant shifts in hosting technologies, with advancements in AI, automation, security, and sustainability leading the way.\n\nUnderstanding and leveraging these trends enables agencies and professionals to provide better client experiences, streamline operations, and reduce the negative effects of future industry changes.\n\nTrend 1: Enhanced AI & Automation Implemented In Hosting\n\nAI and automation are already transforming hosting, making it smarter and more efficient for service providers, agencies, brands, and end-point customers alike.\n\nHosting providers now leverage AI to optimize server performance, predict maintenance needs, and even supplement customer support with AI-driven features like chatbots.\n\nAs a result, automating routine tasks such as backups, updates, and resource scaling reduces downtime and the need for manual intervention. These innovations are game-changing for those managing multiple client sites and will become increasingly important in 2025.\n\nIt only makes sense.\n\nAutomated systems free up valuable time, allowing you more time to focus on strategic growth instead of tedious maintenance tasks. AI-powered insights can also identify performance bottlenecks, enabling you to address issues before they impact your website or those of your clients.\n\nAgencies that adopt these technologies this year will not only deliver exceptional service but also be able to position themselves as forward-thinking.\n\nBluehost embraces automation with features like automated backups, one-click updates, and a centralized dashboard for easy site management. These tools streamline workflows, enabling agencies and professionals to manage multiple sites with minimal effort while ensuring optimal performance.\n\nTrend 2: Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Cloud Solutions Are Now Essential\n\nIn 2025, as businesses demand more flexibility and reliability from their online infrastructure, multi-cloud and hybrid cloud solutions will become essential in the hosting world.\n\nThese approaches offer the best of both worlds:\n\nThe ability to leverage multiple cloud providers for redundancy and performance.\n\nThe option to combine public and private cloud environments for greater control and customization.\n\nFor agencies managing diverse client needs, multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies provide the scalability and adaptability required to meet modern demands. Multi-cloud solutions allow agencies to distribute their clients\u2019 workloads across multiple cloud providers, ensuring that no single point of failure disrupts their operations.\n\nThis feature is particularly valuable for agencies with high-traffic websites, where downtime or slow performance can have a significant impact on revenue and user experience. Hybrid cloud solutions, on the other hand, let agencies blend the scalability of public clouds with the security and control of private cloud environments.\n\nThis service is ideal for clients with sensitive data or compliance requirements, such as ecommerce or healthcare businesses.\n\nBluehost Cloud provides scalable infrastructure and tools that enable agencies to customize hosting solutions to fit their clients\u2019 unique requirements. Our cloud hosting solution\u2019s elastic architecture ensures that websites can handle sudden traffic spikes without compromising speed or reliability.\n\nAdditionally, our intuitive management dashboard allows agencies to easily monitor and allocate resources across their client portfolio, making it simple to implement tailored solutions for varying workloads.\n\nBy adopting multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies, agencies can offer their clients enhanced performance, improved redundancy, and greater control over their hosting environments.\n\nWith our scalable solutions and robust toolset, agencies can confidently deliver hosting that grows with their clients\u2019 businesses while maintaining consistent quality and reliability. This flexibility not only meets today\u2019s hosting demands but also helps position your agency for long-term success in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nTrend 3: Edge Computing & CDNs Replace AMP For Improving Website Speed\n\nAs online audiences grow, the demand for faster, more responsive websites has never been higher. Edge computing and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are at the forefront of this evolution, enabling websites to reduce latency significantly. For agencies managing clients with diverse and international audiences, these technologies are crucial for improving user experience and ensuring website performance remains competitive.\n\nEdge computing brings data processing closer to the end user by leveraging servers located at the \u201cedge\u201d of a network, reducing the time it takes for information to travel.\n\nCombined with CDNs that cache website content on servers worldwide, these technologies ensure faster load times, smoother navigation, and better performance metrics.\n\nThese features are especially beneficial for media-heavy or high-traffic websites, where even a slight delay can impact engagement and conversions.\n\nBluehost integrates with leading CDN solutions to deliver content quickly and efficiently to users across the globe. By leveraging a CDN, Bluehost ensures that websites load faster regardless of a visitor\u2019s location, enhancing user experience and SEO performance.\n\nThis integration simplifies the optimization of site speed for agencies with multiple clients. By adopting edge computing and CDN technology, you can help your clients achieve faster load times, improved site stability, and higher customer satisfaction.\n\nBluehost\u2019s seamless CDN integration enables you to deliver a hosting solution that meets the expectations of a modern, global audience while building trust and loyalty with your clients.\n\nTrend 4: Core Web Vitals & SEO Hosting Features Make Or Break Websites\n\nCore Web Vitals play an important role in today\u2019s SEO, as Google is increasingly emphasizing website performance and user experience in its ranking algorithms. Today, loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability impact a site\u2019s ability to rank well in search results and keep visitors engaged.\n\nThat means optimizing Core Web Vitals isn\u2019t just an SEO task for agencies managing client websites. Fast load times and responsive design are critical parts of delivering a high-quality digital experience. For example, metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which measures how quickly a page\u2019s main content loads, depend heavily on hosting infrastructure.\n\nAgencies need hosting solutions optimized for these metrics to ensure their clients\u2019 sites stay competitive in the SERPs.\n\nBluehost offers a WordPress-optimized hosting environment with features specifically designed to improve load times and server response speeds. From advanced caching technology to robust server architecture, Bluehost ensures that sites meet Core Web Vitals standards with ease.\n\nAdditionally, our hosting solutions include tools for monitoring site performance, allowing agencies to proactively address any issues that could impact rankings or user experience.\n\nBy prioritizing Core Web Vitals and leveraging SEO-focused hosting features, agencies can enhance their clients\u2019 visibility, engagement, and overall online success. With Bluehost\u2019s optimized hosting solutions, you\u2019ll have the tools and infrastructure needed to deliver fast, stable, and high-performing websites that delight users and search engines.\n\nTrend 5: Sustainable Hosting Practices Help Reduce Energy Consumption\n\nSustainability is no longer just a buzzword. It\u2019s a key consideration for businesses and agencies alike. As 2025 progresses, more clients will prioritize environmentally conscious practices, and hosting providers will step up to offer greener solutions, such as energy-efficient data centers and carbon offset programs.\n\nMigrating to a sustainable hosting provider not only supports client values but also demonstrates a commitment to responsible business practices, which will resonate more with consumers in 2025 than ever before.\n\nEfficient hosting practices reduce energy consumption and create a more sustainable digital ecosystem. It will also allow you to help clients meet their environmental goals without compromising on performance.\n\nThese benefits are especially valuable for clients with higher energy and performance demands, such as those in ecommerce, media-heavy, or high-traffic industries.\n\nBluehost has long been recognized as a trusted hosting provider that operates with efficiency in mind.\n\nOur robust, energy-efficient infrastructure already aligns with the sustainability goals of environmentally conscious clients.\n\nIn addition, our long-standing reputation, proven history with WordPress, and demonstrable reliability enhance your clients\u2019 sustainability objectives, ensuring they can operate responsibly and confidently.\n\nBy choosing sustainable hosting practices and partners like Bluehost, you can contribute to a greener digital future while reinforcing your clients\u2019 environmental commitments and strengthening client relationships by aligning with their values.\n\nTrend 6: Security Must Be A Core Offering\n\nSecurity is a non-negotiable priority for any website. Cyber threats like data breaches, malware, and DDoS attacks are on the rise, and the consequences of a breach, including lost revenue, damaged reputations, and potential legal issues, can devastate clients. As a result, offering secure hosting solutions with proactive security measures is essential to safeguarding clients\u2019 businesses and building trust.\n\nThese key features include SSL certificates, which protect sensitive data while boosting SEO rankings and user trust, and regular malware scans to prevent vulnerabilities.\n\nThey should also include automated backups that enable quick restoration in the event of a crash or attack and provide comprehensive protection and peace of mind. Essential security features are standard in Bluehost hosting plans, including SSL certificates, daily automated backups, and proactive malware scanning.\n\nThese built-in tools eliminate the need for additional solutions, added complexity, or costs. For agencies, our security features reduce risks for your clients and provide peace of mind.\n\nBy choosing a hosting provider like Bluehost, you can prioritize client security, reinforce client trust, and minimize emergencies, allowing you to avoid spending time and resources addressing threats or repairing damage.\n\nIn short, by partnering with Bluehost, security becomes a core part of your agency\u2019s value proposition.\n\nTrend 7: Hosting Optimized For AI & Machine Learning Is Key To High Visibility On SERPs\n\nAs artificial intelligence and machine learning become increasingly integrated with websites and applications in 2025, hosting providers must keep pace with the increasing demands these technologies place on infrastructure.\n\nAI-driven tools like chatbots, recommendation engines, and predictive analytics require significant computational power and seamless data processing.\n\nAI and machine learning applications often involve handling large datasets, running resource-intensive algorithms, and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Hosting optimized for these needs ensures that websites can perform reliably under heavy workloads, reducing latency and downtime and delivering consistent performance.\n\nIf you plan to be successful, you\u2019ll also require scalable scalable hosting solutions. These solutions allow resources to expand dynamically with demand, accommodate growth, and handle traffic surges.\n\nBluehost\u2019s scalable hosting is built to support advanced tools and applications, making it an ideal choice for agencies working on AI-driven projects. Our robust infrastructure delivers consistent performance, and flexibility allows you to scale easily as your client\u2019s needs evolve. By leveraging Bluehost, agencies can confidently deliver AI-integrated websites that meet modern performance demands.\n\nTrend 8: Managed Hosting Helps You Focus More On Profits\n\nIn 2025, websites will become increasingly complex. Businesses will require higher performance and reliability, and everyone will be looking to operate as lean and efficiently as possible. These trends mean managed hosting will become the go-to solution for agencies and their clients.\n\nManaged hosting shifts time-intensive technical maintenance away from agencies and business owners by including features such as automatic updates, performance monitoring, and enhanced security. In short, managed hosting enables you to simplify workflows, save time, and deliver consistent quality to your clients.\n\nThese hosting services are particularly valuable for WordPress websites, where regular updates, plugin compatibility checks, and security enhancements occur frequently but are essential to maintaining optimal performance.\n\nManaged hosting also typically includes tools like staging environments, which allow agencies to test changes and updates without risking disruptions to live sites and ensure you can deliver a seamless experience to clients.\n\nBluehost offers managed WordPress hosting that includes automatic updates, staging environments, and 24/7 expert support. These features allow you to handle technical details efficiently while focusing on delivering results for your clients without added stress or time.\n\nTrend 9: The Shift Toward Decentralized Hosting Boosts Your Brand\u2019s Longevity\n\nIn 2025, expect to see decentralized hosting gain attention as a futuristic approach to web hosting. Like Bitcoin and similar advancements, the technology leverages blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks to create hosting environments that prioritize privacy, resilience, and independence from centralized control.\n\nWhile this model appears to provide exciting new opportunities, it\u2019s still in the early stages. It faces challenges in scalability, user-friendliness, and widespread adoption, which agencies can\u2019t typically rely on for client sites.\n\nDecentralized hosting may become a viable option for specific use cases, such as privacy-focused projects or highly distributed systems. However, centralized hosting providers still offer the best balance of reliability, scalability, and accessibility for most businesses and agencies today.\n\nFor these reasons, agencies managing client websites will continue to focus on proven, reliable hosting solutions that deliver consistent performance and robust support.\n\nSo, while decentralized hosting may gain traction this year, Bluehost will continue to provide a trustworthy hosting environment designed to meet the needs of modern websites. With a strong emphasis on reliability, scalability, and user-friendly management tools, we offer a proven solution agencies can depend on to deliver exceptional client results.\n\nTrend 10: Scalable Hosting For High-Growth Websites Is Key For Growth\n\nAs businesses grow, their websites will experience increasing traffic and resource demands. High-growth websites, such as e-commerce platforms, content-heavy blogs, or viral marketing campaigns, require hosting solutions that can scale instantly. And scalable hosting is critical to delivering consistent user experiences and avoiding downtime during peak periods.\n\nScalable hosting like Bluehost ensures your clients\u2019 websites can easily adjust resources like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to meet fluctuating demands.

            "article_content": "Mainframe migration can feel like standing on a tightrope over a canyon. It\u2019s a crucial step for companies wanting to stay agile and scalable, but the fear of downtime\u2014that dreaded gap where everything stops\u2014can keep IT leaders awake at night. The thought of systems going dark, customers losing access, and revenue slipping away is enough to make anyone anxious.\n\nBut here\u2019s the silver lining: you can minimize downtime by using smart strategies like refactoring and rearchitecting. These methods aren\u2019t just technical jargon; they\u2019re like safety nets that help you cross that tightrope with confidence. When done right, they reduce disruptions and make your business applications ready for a smoother, brighter future.\n\nThink of refactoring as spring cleaning for your code\u2014it stays the same on the outside but gets tidier and more efficient inside. Rearchitecting, on the other hand, is like renovating a house to give it a stronger foundation. Together, these approaches keep your business humming along while you make the big move. Curious about how this works in practice? Let\u2019s dive in and see how companies worldwide are making migrations less scary and more successful.\n\nWhy Downtime is the Ultimate Migration Challenge\n\nDowntime isn\u2019t just a technical hiccup. It\u2019s a gut-punch to productivity, a storm cloud over customer satisfaction, and a hammer to team morale. Imagine your e-commerce site grinding to a halt for an hour. Orders stop. Customers leave. Trust erodes. According to Information Technology Intelligence Consulting (ITIC), 97% of companies say an hour of downtime costs over $100,000. For big enterprises, that number can hit millions.\n\nNow picture migrating your entire mainframe\u2014the brain of your business\u2014without a solid plan. The stakes are sky-high. That\u2019s why strategies like refactoring and rearchitecting are lifesavers. They don\u2019t just reduce downtime; they make the whole process smoother and less stressful.\n\nRefactoring: Small Changes, Big Impact\n\nRefactoring is like giving your legacy system a makeover, one piece at a time. You clean up the code without changing what it does. Imagine upgrading a busy highway without closing it down. Crews work on small sections while traffic keeps moving. Refactoring works the same way\u2014it lets you upgrade parts of your application gradually, so your operations keep running smoothly.\n\nAccording to Kumaran Systems, refactoring brings real benefits:\n\nLower Risk: Small changes mean fewer chances for big failures.\n\nSeamless Operation: Your users barely notice as the system improves.\n\nBetter Code: Cleaner code means easier maintenance in the future.\n\nRearchitecting: A New Blueprint for Efficiency\n\nSometimes, you need more than a cleanup; you need a complete redesign. That\u2019s where rearchitecting comes in. It\u2019s like tearing down old walls and building a stronger, more modern structure.\n\nThink of it like renovating a house. Instead of patching cracks, you replace weak sections with sturdy new beams. In tech terms, you redesign the system\u2019s architecture to work with modern tech like cloud services or microservices. This approach makes systems faster, more scalable, and more resilient.\n\nHow does rearchitecting reduce downtime?\n\nParallel Deployment: New systems run alongside old ones until the switch is seamless.\n\nLoad Balancing: Traffic shifts gradually, avoiding sudden shutdowns.\n\nPerformance Boost: Modern systems handle more users and data without breaking a sweat.\n\nReal-Life Insight:\n\nImagine the complexity of modernizing a supply chain system for an organization as vast and mission-critical as the U.S. Air Force. Their system, responsible for ensuring supplies reach personnel worldwide, was built on over 1.3 million lines of COBOL code. Rather than shutting everything down, the team used automated refactoring to carefully transform this aging codebase into Java, moving from mainframe infrastructure to a modern, open-system architecture on AWS.\n\nThink of it like meticulously updating a massive air traffic control system while planes are still in the air. Every change had to preserve the existing business logic and workflows to avoid disruption. The payoff? The new system delivered faster performance, greater scalability, and near-zero downtime. The Air Force didn\u2019t just upgrade their tech\u2014they ensured that operations stayed smooth, reliable, and ready for the future.\n\nSteps to a Stress-Free Migration\n\nPlan Ahead: Know your system inside and out.\n\nRefactor & Rearchitect: Use both strategies for the best results.\n\nTake it Slow: Migrate in phases, not all at once.\n\nTest in Parallel: Run new and old systems together to catch problems early.\n\nHave a Safety Net: Always back up data and plan for rollbacks.\n\nCommunicate: Keep everyone in the loop, from teams to customers.\n\nThe Human Side of Downtime\n\nDowntime isn\u2019t just technical; it\u2019s personal. IT teams feel the pressure. Customers lose patience. Leaders worry about their brand. But when a migration goes smoothly, the relief is palpable. Teams celebrate. Customers stay loyal. That fear of failure? It transforms into pride and confidence.\n\nRefactoring and rearchitecting aren\u2019t just tech terms; they\u2019re tools for a smoother journey. As one IT leader said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t just survive the migration; we thrived.\u201d\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMainframe migration doesn\u2019t have to mean chaos. With strategies like refactoring and rearchitecting, you can minimize downtime and come out stronger. Plan wisely, communicate clearly, and trust the process. Your future depends on it\u2014and with the right moves, that future will be brighter and uninterrupted."

            "article_content": "Home News Pastor Jack Hibbs dispels myths about Heaven\n\nJack Hibbs dispelled myths surrounding Heaven and highlighted the comforting promise of dwelling \u201cunder the shadow of the Almighty\u201d and the believer\u2019s eternal future with God in a recent sermon.\n\nIn a December sermon, Hibbs, senior and founding pastor of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Southern California, dove into Romans 11:33\u201336 as part of his ongoing series titled \u201cUnder the Shadow of the Almighty.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod desires you and I to be with Him forever. We talk about forever. We talk about eternity, but I don't think we meditate on eternity. I don't think we meditate on forever,\u201d the pastor said.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\n\u201cWe're going to be with Him, as believers, forever. And that's not a long time forever. It is infinite. It is beyond the recording of time. We sometimes think that God is up in Heaven with a long white beard and a whole lot of time on His hands. He is not. He dwells in a realm that is non-physical. I want you to think about this for a moment but don't think that it's ghostly or that it's somehow a fog. God is Spirit, and the Bible says they that worship Him, must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.\u201d\n\nDrawing parallels between God\u2019s faithfulness to Israel in the wilderness and His promises to the Church today, Hibbs explored the biblical imagery of living \u201cunder the shadow of the Almighty.\u201d He recounted how God guided the Israelites with a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night, providing protection and guidance in a barren land.\n\nHibbs painted a vivid picture of Heaven as a dynamic, exciting place of discovery. \u201cWhen you and I are in eternity with God, it will be for you and I a time endless in discovery,\u201d he said. \u201cGod has created you, the human being, with an overwhelming passion to discover. Our hearts are thrilled with the possibility of discovery. It's what drives all the sciences, all the disciplines. It drives curiosity. And Heaven is going to be like that for us.\u201d\n\nHe urged the congregation to embrace this truth by fostering curiosity and wonder, both in their earthly lives and in their anticipation of eternity: \u201cTeach your children to ask questions and seek God \u2014 it\u2019s the greatest gift you can give them.\u201d\n\nThe pastor described the spiritual realm as more tangible than the physical, emphasizing that everything in the material world has an expiration date. \u201cThe realm God has prepared for us is better than any physics you and I can enjoy here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you and I get to Heaven, Heaven's not going to be painted white. It's not white floors, white ceilings or white walls. It is what you see in this world that has fallen restored.\u201d\n\nAddressing the challenges of faith, Hibbs acknowledged the human tendency to question God\u2019s plans but reminded the congregation of the importance of trust. \u201cWho has known the mind of the Lord? Nobody. Who has become His counselor? Every single human has tried to tell God how to run the universe,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm just glad He doesn't listen.\u201d\n\nQuoting Psalm 46:10, Hibbs shared with believers that the Bible says to \u201cbe still and know that I am God,\u201d stressing the need for faith amid life\u2019s uncertainties. He also pointed to the glory of the new Jerusalem described in Revelation 21, envisioning a future where God\u2019s presence eliminates pain, fear and darkness.\n\n\u201cGod desires for you and I forever,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pastor concluded by inviting those who had not yet committed their lives to Christ to do so. \u201cIf today you\u2019re saying, \u2018That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the God I want. That\u2019s the God I need,\u2019 tell Him now,\u201d he urged.\n\nLeading the congregation in prayer, he offered a message of hope and renewal through faith in Jesus: \u201cIf you want to get woke, wake up to the fact that God has a plan for your life, and that's what He does,\u201d Hibbs stressed.\n\nThe pastor concluded with a challenge: to live in the reality of God\u2019s promises, embracing His eternal plan with faith and joy. \u201cThe more we yield to Him and say, \u2018Lord, whatever you want, do it,\u2019 the more we see His glory in our lives.\u201d"

Released in fall 2023, the film has garnered more than 100,000 views on Conversations that Matter alone, with additional viewership across other platforms.\n\nAn earlier BNG article about the documentary \u2014 The Real David Platt: The Hijacking of McLean Bible Church \u2014 has drawn tens of thousands of readers.\n\nIt is unusual for a group of laypeople to lead such a public revolt against their own church and pastor as what has happened at McLean, a five-campus nondenominational megachurch in suburban Washington, D.C. It is more unusual for laity to take their own church to court. And it is unheard of to create a two-part documentary series outlining grievances against the pastor.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what has happened at McLean Bible Church, where the arrival of David Platt as pastor in 2017 set off a chain of events not unprecedented in American churches but absolutely unprecedented in the public nature of the dispute. The disaffected members have their own website to tell their story.\n\nOne reason for the public attention is that Platt came to the pastorate from the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention International Mission Board.\n\nSome longtime McLean members did not want anything to do with the SBC because they are proudly nondenominational.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Platt and other church leaders have denied any wrongdoing and have protrayed themselves as victims of a campaign by disgruntled church members.\n\nJeremiah and Laura Burke\n\nAmong those leading the charge against Platt are Jeremiah and Laura Burke. He is a self-described \u201ctypical layman\u201d who comes from a business background in wealth management.\n\n\u201cI was a member of McLean since 2005 \u2026 just a rank-and-file member. A Christian husband and father of four children, just a regular everyday guy, nothing unique,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who David Platt was until he started speaking at McLean and became the pastor of the church.\u201d\n\nHis awareness of church politics at McLean heightened only after Platt\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cIt had come to my attention that he had written a couple of books because he spoke in the summer of 2015,\u201d Burke recalled. \u201cHe had come to the church and was a guest pastor for a weekend event, and that was my first exposure to David Platt. Then it wasn\u2019t again until 2016 or 2017, when the church started transitioning out of their prior senior pastor, that David\u2019s name started coming up as being the new pastor to replace long-time pastor Lon Solomon.\u201d\n\nWhile initially open to Platt\u2019s leadership despite his admiration for Solomon, Burke\u2019s perspective began to shift by 2020.\n\n\u201cThere was a series of issues that had come to light over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen David first came on, I guess there was a gloominess over the church in a sense, in that it didn\u2019t seem like everyone was aware of what was happening but you kind of just trust your leadership. It seemed like there were some things that were just not right in the whole transition process.\u201d\n\nBurke reflected on the sudden leadership change: \u201cFor the 10 years I was at McLean, you had a solid pastor. Lon Solomon was a stalwart leader and then all of a sudden, he was gone, David came in and Lon never came back. We had been in Israel on a trip with him, he does these tours to Israel. I remember him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die in the pulpit. I\u2019m not leaving this church.'\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by Baptist News Global, Solomon provided this statement: \u201cIf you have seen Part 2 of the video series, you will see that I was removed by the elders from all operational involvement at MBC early in 2017 as a part of my separation agreement. Also, as part of my separation agreement, I am not at liberty to comment on events at MBC or David Platt.\u201d\n\nThe summer of 2020\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked a turning point, as Platt addressed racial and social issues from the pulpit, following controversy from his 2019 prayer over former President Donald Trump. McLean historically had attracted political figures, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, but Burke perceived a shift in atmosphere: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary to see famous political people there. David made a story out of it. I guess a lot of people interpreted it as an apology, and that kind of riled some people up.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further complicated matters.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, when COVID came up, the shutting down the church was another huge exodus of people,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThis was problematic because everybody started going to other churches. At McLean you had to register to attend, you had to let them know you were coming.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point for Burke came when he discovered the nondenominational church\u2019s connection to the SBC, which he believed violated church bylaws prohibiting denominational affiliation. His investigation revealed McLean\u2019s involvement with the SBC of Virginia and the North American Mission Board through church planting initiatives.\n\n\u201cI just started to research whether we were part of the SBC or not,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIn December 2020, at the first congregational meeting they had in person, I remember a lady asking if we were part of the denomination and David said from the pulpit no. However, that\u2019s not what I discovered.\u201d\n\nSBC church planting partnerships\n\nNot only was Platt educated and ordained by Southern Baptists and served in Southern Baptist leadership, the Bible church got involved in church planting partnerships with the SBC North American Mission Board.\n\nChurch leaders contend this partnership with the SBC \u201cwas not a secret.\u201d The SBC connection predated Platt\u2019s tenure, coordinated primarily through Clint Clifton, who Burke identifies as \u201cseemingly the genesis of this SBC relationship.\u201d\n\nThe discovery left Burke feeling betrayed: \u201cI had no idea I was a Southern Baptist. I had no idea for years that I was a Southern Baptist.\u201d\n\nThe conflict escalated to the point where Burke and his family were charged with trespassing at their own church. Determined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nDetermined to share his story, Burke invested $25,000 of his own money in the documentary project.\n\nConflict remains, as does attention\n\n\u201cI feel like I have two jobs now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been totally grassroots, but the amount of people who have seen it is kind of mind boggling. It\u2019s all over the world at this point; people in Romania and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have seen it. There\u2019s a gentleman who reached out from Russia asking if he could have permission to translate it into Russian and distribute it through Russia. It\u2019s been overwhelming.\u201d\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nSeven years after Platt\u2019s arrival as pastor, the dispute is not resolved and Burke and other unhappy members and former members continue to press their case. Their next target is seeking to document where tens of thousands of dollars from NAMB went because they do not believe all the named church plants even exist.\n\nChurch leaders, meanwhile, released their own investigation that stated: \u201cAfter review of numerous financial transactions associated with this partnership, we are encouraged that no improper financial transactions were discovered either during annual external audits by an independent accounting firm or during the discovery process in the lawsuit. We can say, however, that the financial transactions for the church planting partnership were sometimes confusing.\u201d\n\nThat report also said: \u201cIt is unquestionably clear that MBC did not give up any independence or cede any authority over our local church to the SBC or any other denomination. We at MBC remain committed to maintaining our autonomy and independence as a local body of believers according to our understanding of what the Bible teaches about the authority of the local church, and we are grateful that we are moving closer and closer to a day when these kinds of legal updates will no longer be necessary.\u201d\n\nRelated articles:\n\nUnderstanding the David Platt story | Analysis by Maina Mwaura\n\nDavid Platt hopes for a biblical gospel instead of an American gospel\n\nFor now, David Platt has won the battle against internal critics at McLean Bible Church\n\nDavid Platt steps up schedule to step down at IMB"

Except, that\u2019s not been required of the oil and gas industry. \u201cIt seemed pretty clear that they were doing it just to derail this offshore wind train,\u201d said John Rogers, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nIt appeared a new double standard was being applied \u2014 one that would set back clean energy just as Massachusetts and other states were committing to slashing their greenhouse gas emissions to tackle the climate crisis, relying heavily on offshore wind.\n\nVineyard Wind turbine size comparison to other buildings and landmarks. Ryan Huddle/Globe Staff\n\nAfter President Biden took office in 2021, permits got back on track, though projects were well behind. Vineyard Wind, for example, was initially scheduled to be completed in 2023; instead, it only began construction last year and has since been interrupted after a blade on one of the turbines broke this summer.\n\nNow, among the potential threats the industry is anticipating from Trump are new tariffs or shrinking tax incentives that could drive up the costs to unsustainable levels, or even a halt in permits or new leases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis regulatory uncertainty increases the cost of development, it increases financing costs, it probably reduces the number of investors that are interested in accepting this risk,\u201d said McDiarmid. \u201cThe offshore wind developers don\u2019t start to earn money until the electrons flow.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high: Wind farms provide a huge boost to the state reaching its clean energy goals. When Vineyard Wind 1 is fully online, for instance, it will provide enough electricity for more than 400,000 homes and meet 5.5 percent of the state\u2019s annual electricity demand. Another project, known as New England Wind 1, would have a similar effect.\n\nDevelopers lay out billions of dollars to bring an offshore wind project to fruition, and are ultimately paid back when they sell the electricity to utilities. Because offshore wind projects have lower operating costs relative to fossil fuels when completed, supporters say wind should eventually bring costs down for ratepayers.\n\nThere are some key differences between now and eight years ago, when Trump first entered office: The industry is far more developed, with multiple projects up and down the coast, projects being built, planned, or in various stages of permitting.\n\nWhile much of this is happening in coastal blue states, the industry is bringing an economic boom to red states too. Louisiana, for example, is a pivotal part of the supply chain, supplying the equipment and vessels used in building wind farms. Those jobs and contracts in Republican-held states might make it tougher to stop progress entirely.\n\nNonetheless, Trump these days is more vocal in his antipathy to wind turbines, claiming in May that \u201cthey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is.\u201d He has embraced discredited antiwind claims about how wind affects whales, birds, and the environment, and vowed on his first day in office to issue an executive order halting offshore wind projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere are other threats, too. Blades for the Vineyard Wind turbines, for instance, are manufactured in Canada, which Trump has threatened with a 25 percent tariff. Smaller parts of the offshore wind supply chain could also be affected by tariffs on China and Mexico, adding significant costs.\n\nA wind turbine with a broken blade at Vineyard Wind 1. Accidents involving blades made by GE Vernova have delayed projects off the coasts of Massachusetts and England.

JSW Steel, for instance, is expanding a plant in Mingo Junction, Ohio, to produce steel slabs for offshore wind pole towers, backed by $43.5 million in federal tax credits.\n\nManufacturers rely on those incentives, and Washington needs to keep them in place \u201cto ensure this industry thrives,\u201d said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president at Oceantic Network, a trade group for companies in the offshore wind business.\n\nThough some steps \u2014 namely tariffs \u2014 can be done via presidential executive order, it\u2019s not clear if Trump\u2019s other threats to offshore wind can be as easily realized.\n\nIndustry experts say Trump may not have the authority to revoke federal permits that are already issued. If so, then four permitted projects off the Massachusetts coastline \u2014 Vineyard Wind 1, Revolution Wind, and New England Wind 1 and 2 \u2014 should be safe. Of those, Vineyard Wind and Revolution Wind are already under construction. New England Wind 1 is further behind, having only recently been selected via a state procurement process, and New England Wind 2 has not been selected, but is available for future procurements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fate of other offshore wind projects planned for New England is less clear. SouthCoast Wind and Vineyard Wind 2 are on track for federal permits over the next two years. Another project, called Starboard Wind, also has not received all its federal permits.\n\n\u201cThese are the projects that I think face the biggest risks, because that creates the most latitude and areas for engagement with the federal government,\u201d said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.\n\nTogether, those three would produce a total of 3.67 gigawatts of clean energy, enough power for an estimated 1.8 million homes. Massachusetts has already contracted for 1.9 gigawatts from SouthCoast Wind and Vineyard Wind 2, and Rhode Island has contracted a small amount from SouthCoast Wind.\n\nIn Massachusetts, each project has an integral role in getting the state to its legally mandated target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nA view of Vineyard Wind's GE Haliade-X steel tower sections in New Bedford, June 14, 2023. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\n\nWhile offshore wind isn\u2019t the only way the state plans to convert from fossil fuels for electricity, it \u201cmoves the needle the most,\u201d said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Green Energy Consumers Alliance.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s very hard to get Massachusetts to net zero without offshore wind,\u201d said Theoharides, the former energy secretary who worked for the offshore wind industry for a year after leaving office.\n\nAny delays to the industry are coming at a particularly bad time, too. Demand for electricity in New England has been rising with the adoption of heat pumps and electric vehicles. At the same time, fossil fuel power plants are shutting down. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not sustainable to take capacity off without replacement in a rising demand environment,\u201d Dolan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, even if the industry hits major delays during the next four years of the Trump administration, \u201cit\u2019s not going to erase the offshore wind industry by any means,\u201d said McDiarmid. \u201cI think the industry is way too mature for that.\u201d\n\nSabrina Shankman can be reached at sabrina.shankman@globe.com.
