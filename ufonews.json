            "article_content": "(Stacker) - When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Wisconsin using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

            "article_content": "Home Opinion Unmasking UFOs, aliens and demonic deception\n\nAs reported by The Economist earlier this year, \"UFOs are Going Mainstream.\" Believe it or not, 20 million people in the United States claim to have seen a UFO, and four million claim to have been abducted by aliens. So, what in the world is going on here? Are UFOs and \"aliens\" real?\n\nBefore attempting to answer this paranormal question, first consider an easier question: Are fallen angels (demons) and holy angels real? Yes indeed, as Scripture makes abundantly clear. And if UFOs and aliens are demonic manifestations, as many Christians believe, we would expect to find some clues in the Bible.\n\nOnce when Jesus encountered two demon-possessed men, the demons shouted, \"What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?\" (Matthew 8:29) Demons instantly become terrified once Jesus arrives on the scene.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nSo, what about \"alien abductions\" today? How do these traumatic experiences compare to demonic encounters in the New Testament? And most importantly, do today's harrowing \"alien\" episodes abruptly cease when the name of Jesus is introduced into the equation?\n\nGary Bates has researched this issue for over 25 years. As a best-selling author on the matter who also has an award-winning movie on \"aliens\" and UFOs, Gary said, \"There are over 400 cases that I am aware of where these abductions have been halted by people calling on the name of Jesus Christ ... the instant His name was called, it stopped.\"\n\nChristians of course are not surprised that the name of Jesus stops things like nightmares and other frightening phenomena, including \"alien\" ordeals. (See my 2011 CP op-ed, \"How to Say 'No' to Nightmares.\") Since we are not alone in the universe, we do at times cross paths with angels and demons.\n\nAs Gary stated, \"The Bible has always talked about another dimension. And we've had visitors from that dimension, and they're called angels. Good ones, bad ones ... God's angels always bring a message that is consistent with what we read in God's Word. The bad guys...are there to deceive and deflect and to take people's eyes away from the Creator.\"\n\nAs supernatural beings originally created by God to serve as holy angels, demons are fallen angels who rebelled against God and went the way of Lucifer. Demons are highly intelligent and also skilled impersonators. These shapeshifters can appear at your bedside as your deceased relative, or show up during a seance. They can also impersonate the mother of our Lord through various apparitions of Mary. And when people take part in certain New Age practices, demons even pretend to be \"Jesus\" the \"ascended master.\" And yes, demons can take on an alien appearance, or even the shape of a UFO.\n\nDemons want humans to interact with them in order to draw people into the spiritual clutches of the occult. If you open a wrong door in the spiritual realm, demons will come through it to trick you, oppress you and lead you away from the one door that leads to everlasting life in Paradise. Jesus said, \"I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved\" (John 10:9).\n\nInterestingly, many \"alien\" abductees are told they were chosen because they are special and are needed to spread the message of their \"alien\" abductors. An obsession with UFOs and \"aliens\" can even become a substitute religion. For example, the Heaven's Gate cult was a UFO religion that produced mass suicides by its members in 1997.\n\nWhile demons distract and disorient people in order to lead them further and further away from Christ, God's holy angels are \"ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation\" (Hebrews 1:14). Angels and demons are invisible to the human eye, unless of course they choose to visibly appear, such as when two holy angels appeared at Christ's empty tomb. They asked Mary, \"Woman, why are you crying?\" (John 20:13)\n\nDemons fear the risen Savior because the Messiah \"triumphed over them by the cross,\" (Colossians 2:15) and \"was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures\" (1 Corinthians 15:4). The fate of every demon is sealed, just like the fate of their master, Satan.\n\nThe Apostle John wrote, \"And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night forever ever and ever\" (Revelation 20:10). And this is why \"Satan is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short\" (Revelation 12:12).\n\nUFOs and \"aliens\" are merely one way the devil and his demons seek to distract people from accepting the good news of the Gospel (see John 3:16). Some people become so mesmerized by UFOs and \"aliens\" that they actually start pursuing mysterious phenomena. It is a seductive doorway into the occult.\n\nDr. Hugh Ross is an astrophysicist who points to \"a connection between occult involvement and UFO encounters.\" Christian UFO investigator David Wimbish agrees. He has \"engaged in significant research into the UFO phenomenon, and has suggested that not only can the occult lead one to have a UFO encounter, but interest in UFOs can also actually draw one into the occult.\"\n\nDr. Ron Rhodes writes, \"Many UFO investigators have followed a path that has taken them directly into the world of the occult. They believe they are rediscovering ancient spiritual truths and uncovering new realities about the universe ... it has led many to experiment with astral projection, to believe in reincarnation, etc.\"\n\nJacques Vallee, a well-known (secular) French UFO researcher says, \"The phenomena reported by (UFO) witnesses involve poltergeist effects, levitation, psychic control, healing, and out-of-body experiences. Vallee has personally investigated countless UFO sightings. His comments are based on years of firsthand experience.\"\n\nNegative consequences and dark side effects occur whenever demons interact with humans, even if the devious impersonators initially tell you they want to help you. This diabolical charade is one way they gain access into the lives of unsuspecting victims. Don't forget that their master \"Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light\" (2 Corinthians 11:14).\n\nThankfully, there is a way to effectively counter and overcome every type of demonic deception. Repent of your sins, receive Jesus as your Savior, (see John 1:12) and then walk closely with Him. \"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved\" (Romans 10:13).\n\nUFOs, aliens, demons and the devil himself have no power over Jesus Christ. You see, if you are a follower of Christ, \"Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world\" (1 John 4:4)."

UAP sightings at airports have also been part of a broader trend of increasing reports of UAPs in and around aviation facilities.\n\nRegarding the first, the Pentagon's latest report reveals 757 UAP cases documented between May 2023 and June 2024, including a notable \"near miss\" incident involving a commercial aircraft near New York. Other findings from the reports include:\n\nA commercial airline crew reported a near-collision with a \"cylindrical object\" over the Atlantic Ocean, just off New York's coast. Most UAP sightings occur over U.S. airspace and littoral waters, and commercial pilots are reporting a growing number of sightings. While many cases can be attributed to misidentified objects like balloons, birds, or satellites, others remain unexplained. Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system has been identified as a frequent source of mistaken UFO reports.\n\nThe increasing number of UAP sightings has raised concerns about potential flight safety issues. Some reports from military witnesses present potential safety of flight concerns, including high-speed travel or unusual maneuverability. However, no reported UAPs have directly threatened flight safety by maneuvering to unsafe proximity or positioning themselves in flight paths.\n\nPhoto: Michael Rodeback/Airways\n\nGovernment Response\n\nThe All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) leads the Defense Department's efforts in tracking and investigating UAP sightings. The office is one of many Federal initiatives that prioritizes assessing potential risks to national security and aviation safety rather than exploring speculative theories about extraterrestrial origins.\n\nOn the regulation side, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) emphasizes that operating drones around airplanes, helicopters, and airports is dangerous and illegal, subject to stiff fines and criminal charges.\n\nFinally, while there is growing concern about the potential impact of UAP sightings on aviation safety, officials emphasize that no credible evidence of alien beings or objects defying known laws of physics have been found.\n\nThe data behind UAPs in the U.S. in numbers is as follows:\n\nThe FAA receives over 100 monthly reports of unmanned aircraft sightings near airports, airplanes, and helicopters. Most UAP sightings occur over U.S. airspace and coastal waters, including areas near airports. The AARO received 291 UAP reports during a recent reporting period, bringing the total number of cited UAPs to 801.\n\nWhile UAPs pose no real threat to commercial aviation operations, the FAA and other agencies continue investigating these sightings and encourage the public to report unauthorized drone operations to local law enforcement."

Alongside Sinistea and Polteageist\u2019s arrival, you can encounter a range of themed Pok\u00e9mon in the wild and during raids throughout the event.\n\nTwo of the best gen 8 Pok\u00e9mon are finally joining Pok\u00e9mon Go in the Just My Cup of Tea event \u2013 the spooky Sinistea and paranormal Polteageist. Of course, in a region themed around the British Isles, The Pok\u00e9mon Company had to introduce a tea-themed \u2018mon for us to collect, and we all fell in love with it. Unlike in the Switch game, you don\u2019t have to worry about whether your Sinistea is genuine or not, as you can evolve any teacup you find into a haunted teapot with just 50 Sinistea candies.\n\nWhile you\u2019re out hunting for Sinistea in the wild, you\u2019ll also be more likely to find a range of themed Pok\u00e9mon on your travels, like Oddish, Duskull, and Gothita, so make sure you stock up on Pok\u00e9balls before heading out. You\u2019ll also get 50% more stardust and double the friendship bonus damage in raids during the event, so take the opportunity to challenge Genesect (Chill Drive) in five-star raids and Mega Banette in mega raids. You could even catch a shiny one!\n\nWhen is the Pok\u00e9mon Go Just My Cup of Tea event?\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s Just My Cup of Tea event runs from 10am local time on Tuesday, December 3, to 8pm local time on Saturday, December 7, 2024. Make sure to take part in field research, timed research, collection challenges, and Pok\u00e9Stop showcases during this event to claim the many rewards on offer.\n\nThat\u2019s everything you need to know about the Pok\u00e9mon Go Just My Cup of Tea event. Stay up to date with all the latest goings-on in Niantic\u2019s free mobile game by checking out our Pok\u00e9mon Go events, Pok\u00e9mon Go Spotlight Hour, and Pok\u00e9mon go codes guides next."

            "article_content": "Every Friday night in the early months of 1994, Channel 4 took British viewers on a trip into The Unpleasant World of Penn & Teller. Each week, the American duo \u2013 Teller, the mononymous mag\u00ad\u00adi\u00adcian, and Penn Jillette, with his ironic patter and pony-tail \u2013 would fill the screen with their irreverent take on the traditional stage \u00admagic show, including a notoriously blood-spattered skit in which Teller was power-sawed in half. They are a little older now (Penn is 69, Teller, 76), but here we are, a stone\u2019s throw from the Houses of Parliament, talking about the 50th anniversary of their partnership, which they\u2019ll celebrate next year with 11 nights at the London Palladium.\n\nFor many years, both men have lived and worked in Las Vegas, where they have the longest-\u00adrunning residency in the casino city. So far, they\u2019ve shown no desire to join the celebrities planning to quit the US when Donald Trump takes power, although Penn claims to have been on Trump\u2019s \u201chate list\u201d for more than a decade, after describing the future president as a \u201cwhack job\u201d with \u201ccotton candy p--s hair\u201d, in 2012, when he appeared alongside him on The Celebrity Apprentice.\n\n\u201cI know Trump,\u201d Penn tells me. \u201cI know him very well. And I have a great deal of tolerance for people who are off the bell curve: I have very close friends who are neuro\u00addiverse in some pretty intense ways. When I worked on The Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trump Jr said to me, \u2018You seem like the only person who actually likes my father.\u2019 And I want to cop to that. But what Trump cannot understand is how I could be comfortable with him working at a TV show, and not comfortable with him as president of the United States.\u201d Trump, he continues, \u201cis bordering on stupid\u201d.\n\nAnd yet Penn\u2019s compatriots have voted overwhelmingly to put him back in the White House. \u201cIt was [Apprentice network] NBC that did it, and also it was the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you have people who are brimming with hate and you tell them that that\u2019s OK, I think it really explodes.\u201d His anxiety about \u201ctrolls and robots\u201d runs deep, but he notes, wryly, that \u201cthe internet, although it may have destroyed America and will be destroying the world, I think, is nothing but good for magic\u201d. It has, he suggests, taken what was an off-puttingly closed world and democratised it.\n\nPenn & Teller have been criticised for revealing the closely guarded secrets of the trade, by, for instance, performing the \u201ccups and balls\u201d trick with clear plastic cups. They\u2019ve been refused membership of the Magic Circle, the famous society of magicians, because of such routines. \u201cThe whole idea of keeping secrets is so offensive,\u201d Penn says. \u201cI love the fact that you can go on the internet and find out how a magic trick is done; pretending that all we have is secrets is an insult. It\u2019s like, if I were to come to you and say, \u2018Here\u2019s the words of the Dylan song, here\u2019s the sheet music, here\u2019s the tuning of his guitar, that\u2019s all you need.\u2019 Well, no, it\u2019s not.\u201d"

This success story illustrates the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum thrived, owing to its groundbreaking technology, turning its early adopters into millionaires.\n\nToday, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention with its state-of-the-art low-code/no-code platform and DAG architecture. With BDAG coin's presale drawing significant interest, experts are forecasting a potential 30,000x (ROI).\n\nIs BlockDAG on the same trajectory as Ethereum and going to change the game in financial landscapes? Let's dive into why this project is making waves in the crypto space."

            "article_content": "Fabric\u2019s Real-Time Intelligence features are, for me, the most interesting things to learn about in the platform. I\u2019m not going to pretend to be an expert in them \u2013 far from it \u2013 but they are quite easy to use and they open up some interesting possibilities for low-code/no-code people like me. The other day I was wondering if it was possible to send events and data from Power Automate to Fabric using Eventstreams and it turns out it is quite easy to do.\n\nHere\u2019s a really simple illustration. I created a new Eventstream in a Fabric workspace, then clicked the \u201cUse custom endpoint\u201d option and published the Eventstream so it was ready to send data to:\n\nThen, in Power Automate, I built a super-simple flow with a \u201cManually trigger a flow\u201d trigger and then the \u201cSend event\u201d action from the Event Hubs connector:\n\nThis works because you can send data from Power Automate to the Eventstream custom endpoint using the Event Hub protocol. To set up the connection to the Eventstream in Power Automate I entered a name for the connection, chose the \u201cAccess Key\u201d authentication type and then copied the \u201cConnection string-primary key\u201d value from the Eventstream custom endpoint, shown in the first screenshot above (you need to click the eye icon next to it in order to copy it to the clipboard) and pasted it into the \u201cConnection String\u201d property in the Power Automate connector:\n\nThen I configured the \u201cSend event\u201d action like so:\n\nI had to manually paste the Event Hub Name, shown in the first screenshot above, as a custom value because I got an error when I tried to use Power Automate\u2019s dropdown box to find the name. I put the Timestamp from the \u201cManually trigger a flow\u201d trigger into the Content property.\n\nAfter saving the flow I was then able to trigger it from my browser or the Power Automate mobile app, and every time the flow ran it sent the time of the run to my Eventstream:\n\nVery basic but it proves the point. What could you use this for? Power Automate has a huge number of connectors for Microsoft and third party services: for example you can trigger a flow when a file stored in OneDrive for Business is modified or when new content is published to an RSS feed. Sending these events and their related data on to a Fabric Eventstream not only means you can capture them for analysis in OneLake or an EventHouse but also send the events on to Fabric Activator, which can apply sophisticated rules so you can be alerted when something happens and specific conditions are met in Teams or via email, run Fabric items such as notebooks or even trigger Power Automate flows. I\u2019ll explore some of these scenarios in more detail in future blog posts.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFacebook\n\n"

That transition became official back in June when VW announced a joint venture with Rivian.\n\nMeanwhile, the automaker also announced last summer it would delay the launch of a new flagship electric vehicle (EV) called Trinity, initially planned for 2026. German press reports at the time suggested the delay was to make room for none other than the next-gen electric Golf.\n\nAnd now that VW\u2019s venture with Rivian has officially kicked off earlier this month, all the pieces are coming together.\n\n\u201cWe decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle,\u201d VW CEO Thomas Schafer said during a media roundtable. \u201cIt will happen with the joint venture, where we put the new electric-electronics architecture together. But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So we\u2019ll start with the Golf.\u201d\n\nThe next-gen electric Golf is now expected for 2029, followed by Trinity in the following years.\n\nThe Volkswagen-Rivian venture first plans to use Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture and software technology stack to enable the launch of Rivian\u2019s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 and support the launch of Volkswagen models by 2027."
