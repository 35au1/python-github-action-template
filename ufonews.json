            "article_content": "The recent congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly known as UFOs, has ignited a call for transparency from lawmakers across the political spectrum.\n\nDuring the hearing, Chairwoman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Nancy Mace, said:\n\n\u201cI obviously would like to know how much taxpayers are spending on this. You have the right to know. And if we are spending money on something that doesn\u2019t exist, why are we spending the money? And if it does exist, why are we hiding it from the public? Of course, national security is a big issue and if there is technology that could harm us or our allies that are in the hands of our adversaries, we obviously want to stay ahead of that to the best of our abilities.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense, which oversees UAP research, is set to receive a proposed budget of $850 billion in 2025. However, the exact amount spent on UAP research remains unclear, contributing to congressional frustration over the perceived secrecy surrounding the issue. The Department of Defense\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022, is tasked with investigating these phenomena.\n\nA group of bipartisan lawmakers in Congress introduced the UAP Transparency Act, which would require the declassification of all federal documents related to UAPs. The bill mandates that the president instruct federal agencies to release UAP research documents to the public within 270 days and provide Congress with quarterly progress reports. The UAP Transparency Act was referred to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in May, but no further action has been taken.\n\nAARO reviewed 757 new UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024, identifying 21 cases that \u201cmerit further analysis\u201d due to their \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors.\u201d Despite these findings, AARO\u2019s report stated there is no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial life is responsible for these sightings.\n\n\u201cThere are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the intelligence community, do not understand. And I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either,\u201d said Jon Kosloski, the director of AARO.\n\nHave a news tip? Contact Emma Withrow at ewithrow@sbgtv.com or at x.com/emma_withrow.

            "article_content": "(Stacker) - When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Wisconsin using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

One expert explained that the lights were only a phenomenon that shows nothing but a reflection in the night sky.\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.

Alongside Sinistea and Polteageist\u2019s arrival, you can encounter a range of themed Pok\u00e9mon in the wild and during raids throughout the event.\n\nTwo of the best gen 8 Pok\u00e9mon are finally joining Pok\u00e9mon Go in the Just My Cup of Tea event \u2013 the spooky Sinistea and paranormal Polteageist. Of course, in a region themed around the British Isles, The Pok\u00e9mon Company had to introduce a tea-themed \u2018mon for us to collect, and we all fell in love with it. Unlike in the Switch game, you don\u2019t have to worry about whether your Sinistea is genuine or not, as you can evolve any teacup you find into a haunted teapot with just 50 Sinistea candies.\n\nWhile you\u2019re out hunting for Sinistea in the wild, you\u2019ll also be more likely to find a range of themed Pok\u00e9mon on your travels, like Oddish, Duskull, and Gothita, so make sure you stock up on Pok\u00e9balls before heading out. You\u2019ll also get 50% more stardust and double the friendship bonus damage in raids during the event, so take the opportunity to challenge Genesect (Chill Drive) in five-star raids and Mega Banette in mega raids. You could even catch a shiny one!\n\nWhen is the Pok\u00e9mon Go Just My Cup of Tea event?\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s Just My Cup of Tea event runs from 10am local time on Tuesday, December 3, to 8pm local time on Saturday, December 7, 2024. Make sure to take part in field research, timed research, collection challenges, and Pok\u00e9Stop showcases during this event to claim the many rewards on offer.\n\nThat\u2019s everything you need to know about the Pok\u00e9mon Go Just My Cup of Tea event. Stay up to date with all the latest goings-on in Niantic\u2019s free mobile game by checking out our Pok\u00e9mon Go events, Pok\u00e9mon Go Spotlight Hour, and Pok\u00e9mon go codes guides next."

            "article_content": "The Fort Worth Star-Telegram\u2019s Crossroads Lab stands as a testament to the power of local journalism to make our community a better place.\n\nFor more than three years, the community-funded Lab has informed and engaged citizens about under-covered issues and helped drive change.\n\nFor instance, education reporter Silas Allen wrote a story last year about a disconnect between how parents think their kids are doing in school and how they are really doing. This year, the Fort Worth Independent School District began to shift its grading systems and improved its online portal to make it easier for parents to understand how their kids are doing in school.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lab\u2019s five reporters fill coverage gaps that have developed due to stresses on the traditional model for local news in recent years. They cover topics such as education, early childhood development, health care, racial equity, economic development and more.\n\nYou may be familiar with other fully philanthropic news organizations in Fort Worth and around our state. Those organizations do good work. But the Star-Telegram\u2019s Crossroads Lab has some distinct advantages in terms of the potential for impact \u2014 in terms of how donations are used, and the likelihood of the reporters\u2019 work bringing change.\n\nDonations to the Crossroads Lab go almost exclusively to fund the work of reporters, rather than the institutional structure and salaries of support staff around them. McClatchy, our parent company, provides editing support and unlimited services through its audience growth, human resources, information technology and legal departments.\n\nAnd the Crossroads Lab has far more audience than that of a startup news organization. It taps into the already established readership of the Star-Telegram, bringing a greater opportunity for impact.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat do I mean by impact? Since the Lab\u2019s inception, its work has driven policy changes in the Fort Worth school system regarding library expenses and the use of restraints in dealing with problematic student behavior. Crossroads Lab stories have prompted people to donate to worthy causes and to help fight for positive change. One organization even credited a Crossroads Lab story with saving a man\u2019s life by connecting him with critical medical care.\n\nIn this past year, the Lab has impacted our community with work such as this:\n\nMuch of the Lab\u2019s funding comes from prominent local philanthropic foundations. But we need your help, too. Please consider making a tax-deductible contribution \u2014 gifts of any size make a difference \u2014 to the Crossroads Lab and its five reporters.\n\nYou can donate through star-telegram.com/donate. Or, if you prefer to send a check, please put \u201cFort Worth Star-Telegram\u201d in the memo line and mail it to 1601 Alhambra Blvd., Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95816. Please include your email address.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Crossroads Lab\u2019s mission is to inform and engage citizens about issues critical to the future of our community, ultimately making Fort Worth a better place. Thank you for being an essential part of that mission with your readership and your support of the Crossroads Lab.\n\nSteve Coffman is the president and editor of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram."

            "source": "The Daily Telegraph",
            "article_content": "Every Friday night in the early months of 1994, Channel 4 took British viewers on a trip into The Unpleasant World of Penn & Teller. Each week, the American duo \u2013 Teller, the mononymous mag\u00ad\u00adi\u00adcian, and Penn Jillette, with his ironic patter and pony-tail \u2013 would fill the screen with their irreverent take on the traditional stage \u00admagic show, including a notoriously blood-spattered skit in which Teller was power-sawed in half. They are a little older now (Penn is 69, Teller, 76), but here we are, a stone\u2019s throw from the Houses of Parliament, talking about the 50th anniversary of their partnership, which they\u2019ll celebrate next year with 11 nights at the London Palladium.\n\nFor many years, both men have lived and worked in Las Vegas, where they have the longest-\u00adrunning residency in the casino city. So far, they\u2019ve shown no desire to join the celebrities planning to quit the US when Donald Trump takes power, although Penn claims to have been on Trump\u2019s \u201chate list\u201d for more than a decade, after describing the future president as a \u201cwhack job\u201d with \u201ccotton candy p--s hair\u201d, in 2012, when he appeared alongside him on The Celebrity Apprentice.\n\n\u201cI know Trump,\u201d Penn tells me. \u201cI know him very well. And I have a great deal of tolerance for people who are off the bell curve: I have very close friends who are neuro\u00addiverse in some pretty intense ways. When I worked on The Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trump Jr said to me, \u2018You seem like the only person who actually likes my father.\u2019 And I want to cop to that. But what Trump cannot understand is how I could be comfortable with him working at a TV show, and not comfortable with him as president of the United States.\u201d Trump, he continues, \u201cis bordering on stupid\u201d.\n\nAnd yet Penn\u2019s compatriots have voted overwhelmingly to put him back in the White House. \u201cIt was [Apprentice network] NBC that did it, and also it was the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you have people who are brimming with hate and you tell them that that\u2019s OK, I think it really explodes.\u201d His anxiety about \u201ctrolls and robots\u201d runs deep, but he notes, wryly, that \u201cthe internet, although it may have destroyed America and will be destroying the world, I think, is nothing but good for magic\u201d. It has, he suggests, taken what was an off-puttingly closed world and democratised it.\n\nPenn & Teller have been criticised for revealing the closely guarded secrets of the trade, by, for instance, performing the \u201ccups and balls\u201d trick with clear plastic cups. They\u2019ve been refused membership of the Magic Circle, the famous society of magicians, because of such routines. \u201cThe whole idea of keeping secrets is so offensive,\u201d Penn says. \u201cI love the fact that you can go on the internet and find out how a magic trick is done; pretending that all we have is secrets is an insult. It\u2019s like, if I were to come to you and say, \u2018Here\u2019s the words of the Dylan song, here\u2019s the sheet music, here\u2019s the tuning of his guitar, that\u2019s all you need.\u2019 Well, no, it\u2019s not.\u201d"

While it is still developing, quantum technologies are ready to tackle very complex problems that cannot be solved or are not easily solved by any classical supercomputer.\n\nWith their inherent properties, fully realized quantum computers can process highly complex calculations that are far beyond the abilities of current machines. Quantum systems may well be able to complete jobs that would take thousands of years for a classical computer to finish in just minutes."

Bonus bets can be split into multiple wagers. \u2696\ufe0f FanDuel legal states AZ, CO, CT, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, MS (retail), NC, NJ, NY, NV, OH, PA, TN, VA, VT, WA, WV, WY and Washington, D.C. \u2705 Last verified Dec. 1, 2024\n\nFanDuel promo code: How to claim the two-part bonus\n\nThis two-part bonus from FanDuel Sportsbook is easy to claim. Follow these steps to get started:\n\nClick our FanDuel promo code to reach the appropriate registration page. Tap \u201cJoin Now.\u201d Choose your state and fill in the required fields. Establish a banking method and make your first deposit. Place your first wager of at least $5 on Eagles vs. Ravens or any other sporting event.\n\nFor your first wager, choose a betting market you are confident in. Your first bet must win to receive the $150 sportsbook bonus. The three-month free trial of NBA League Pass is yours no matter the outcome of that first wager. A promotional code will be emailed to you.\n\nIf you receive the $150 bonus, it will be distributed as a lump sum. You can use all $150 at once or divide it into increments. To edit the amount you use, check your betslip before placing a wager.\n\nYou have seven days to use the bonus before it expires.\n\nFanDuel promos for existing users\n\nToday\u2019s FanDuel welcome bonus provides a nice start for your sports betting journey, but that\u2019s not where it ends. There are nice daily promotions for all users. These and more are available now:\n\nProfit boosts : Get enhanced odds on select betting markets.\n\nNo sweat bets : If your bet loses, receive a bonus bet to try again with house money.\n\nReferral bonus: Invite your friend and you\u2019ll each get a $75 bonus ($50 sportsbook + $25 casino).\n\nHow to use your FanDuel promo for Eagles vs. Ravens\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook wants you to work for your welcome bonus, but if you\u2019re savvy, you don\u2019t have to work as hard as it seems on the surface.\n\nYou must win your first wager to claim the bonus, but there are no odds restrictions on your wager.\n\nThe Ravens are favored Sunday by 2.5 points over the Eagles, but why lay the points when you can bet the Ravens on the moneyline? The payout on your $5 wager will not be as good, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re trying to maximize.\n\nEven the Baltimore moneyline can be a toss-up in a game between these two strong teams, so I have another suggestion.\n\nHow about betting on the alternate total? The over/under offered by most online sportsbooks is 49.5 points, but on FanDuel, you can wager on an alternate total. You can go as low as 23.5 points and bet the over.\n\nYour winnings with a $5 bet would be negligible, but you would give yourself an awesome chance of winning the $150 bonus. That\u2019s what matters most."

That transition became official back in June when VW announced a joint venture with Rivian.\n\nMeanwhile, the automaker also announced last summer it would delay the launch of a new flagship electric vehicle (EV) called Trinity, initially planned for 2026. German press reports at the time suggested the delay was to make room for none other than the next-gen electric Golf.\n\nAnd now that VW\u2019s venture with Rivian has officially kicked off earlier this month, all the pieces are coming together.\n\n\u201cWe decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle,\u201d VW CEO Thomas Schafer said during a media roundtable. \u201cIt will happen with the joint venture, where we put the new electric-electronics architecture together. But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So we\u2019ll start with the Golf.\u201d\n\nThe next-gen electric Golf is now expected for 2029, followed by Trinity in the following years.\n\nThe Volkswagen-Rivian venture first plans to use Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture and software technology stack to enable the launch of Rivian\u2019s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 and support the launch of Volkswagen models by 2027."
