        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: AARO/DOD\n\nIt's never aliens.\n\nAt least, it hasn't been yet. The United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities heard testimony on Tuesday (Nov. 19) from Jon T. Kosloski, director of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). The U.S. Department of Defense created the office in July 2022 in order to have a single place for military and government personnel to report UFO sightings, or UAP, as they're now known. The new term, short for unidentified anomalous phenomena, encompasses not only unidentified objects or events in the sky, but also those in water, in space or those that appear to travel between these domains.\n\nDuring today's hearing, Kosloski came in strong, stating that \"it is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.\" Still, despite having resolved hundreds of cases with prosaic explanations, Kosloski noted that his office does not believe that every UAP is a bird, balloon or drone. \"We do have some very anomalous objects,\" he said.\n\na blurry black dot flying above a snow-covered volcano in grainy black-and-white footage\n\nKosloski also reported on the office's latest analysis of UFO/UAP cases, stressing that his office will \"continue to follow the science and data wherever they lead\" and keep both Congress and the public as informed as possible \u2014 at the unclassified level, he clarified.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to testimony presented to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee last week, in which a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer told lawmakers that the American government is part of a decades-long coverup to conceal the fact that \"we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Kosloski gave an overview of his office's activities since it issued a report to Congress and testified in a similar setting last year. \"Many reports resolve to commonplace objects like birds, balloons and unmanned systems, while others lack sufficient data for comprehensive analysis,\" Kosloski said, adding that \"only a small percentage of reports received by AARO are potentially anomalous.\"\n\nKosloski referred to a UAP incident that occurred in 2013 near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The infrared video, shot in 2013 by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol helicopter, appears to show an object flying just above the ocean before disappearing into it, or perhaps splitting in two.\n\n\"We assessed that it was actually flying over the airport the entire time,\" Kosloski said. When the object appears to disappear in the infrared video that accompanies the case, it is actually the camera sensing that the object is the same temperature as the water behind it. Instead of splitting in two, it was simply two objects \u2014 balloons or sky lanterns \u2014 in close proximity that came in and out of view.\n\nKosloski also offered how his office was able to close the case on the infamous GOFAST video, shot by a U.S. Navy fighter jet in 2016 off the coast of Florida. In that case, the object's apparent speed in the video was actually due to the parallax effect, or the camera's perspective, Kosloski explained.\n\nFurthermore, the AARO director showed a 2018 video captured by a drone flying over Mt. Etna that he stated is not widely known among the public. \"This was a rather difficult case to solve,\" Kosloski said. \"The object was actually 170 meters away from the plume \u2014 not flying through it.\"\n\nDuring questioning, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) asked Kosloski about whether or not some individuals who have encountered UAP might be reluctant to engage with his office, referring to accusations some UAP disclosure advocates frequently level against AARO. These critics attest that the office is part of an alleged decades-long U.S. government-led campaign of \"excessive secrecy\" that aims to keep the public in the dark about UFOs.\n\nIn response to Gillibrand's questioning, Kosloski defended his office. \"Congress has gone out of its way to create the organization AARO specifically to conduct these sorts of investigations, and has uniquely empowered them to have access to all UAP related information, whether that's historic or current, and we take that responsibility and those authorities very seriously,\" he said.\n\nGillibrand also asked about a report released by AARO in March 2024, noting that she has been told \"it doesn't show any any evidence of secret programs that have aliens.\"\n\nBut Gillibrand pushed back on that assertion. \"That's not how I read the report,\" the senator said. \"What I read in the report is the US government took sightings extremely seriously over the last 75 years, and put some of the greatest minds together to analyze these cases, because they assessed them as some deeply unknown phenomena that may or may not cause threats \u2014 that may or may not be related to adversaries.\"\n\na grainy black orb above the ocean in a black-and-white video\n\nAARO released a report to accompany today's hearing earlier this week. The report, titled, \"All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office\u2019s Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena,\" examines UAP cases dated between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as historical incidents that were not included in previous reports.\n\nBut, like in its other reports, AARO found no smoking gun for alien visitation this year. \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report notes. Out of the 485 cases that are well within the report's timeframe, 118 were solved and another 174 were slated to be closed, pending a final review.\n\nStill, AARO's 2024 report says that many cases remain unsolved, and that the office continues to study them. However, AARO\u2019s ability to resolve cases \"remains constrained by a lack of timely and actionable sensor data,\" according to the report, meaning there just isn't enough data to conclusively solve cases that lack detailed or multi-sensor observations. In some cases, all there might be to analyze is a single photograph, a few seconds of grainy video or an aviator's written report. Many UAP sightings happen in the blink of an eye as an unknown object zooms past a moving aircraft, for example, so there often isn't enough time to gather photographic or video evidence.\n\nIn other cases, the capabilities of the sensors or platforms involved in the UAP sightings are themselves classified (sometimes, even their existence isn't publicly known), so AARO is unable to discuss them in unclassified reports.\n\nThough overall, according to the 2024 report, there is enough data for AARO to state that it has has \"no indication or confirmation that these activities are attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Pentagon UFO office finds 'no empirical evidence' for alien technology in new report\n\n\u2014 Pentagon has 'no credible evidence' of aliens or UFOs that defy physics\n\n\u2014 UFO whistleblowers tell Congress 'we are not alone in the cosmos' (video)\n\nToday's hearing echoed a previous hearing held last year on April 19, 2023. During that hearing, AARO's previous director Sean Kirkpatrick told the Senate Armed Services Committee that his office has seen \"no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology or objects that defy the known laws of physics.\"\n\nSimilarly, the report released by AARO in March 2024 that examined historical UFO cases found \"no evidence that any USG [U.S. government] investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.\"\n\nAARO's previous report, released in 2022, examined 510 contemporary UAP reports gathered from government agencies and branches of the United States military. The report found that, while most cases were able to be resolved, 171 remained a mystery.\n\n\"Some of these uncharacterized UAP appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis,\" AARO's 2022 report states.\n\nToday's hearing concluded with a discussion of recent incidents in which unidentified drones, or uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), were seen over U.S. military bases and other sensitive installations. Those incidents, Kosloski notes, underscore the need for the United States to have \"more persistent monitoring and understand that, whether it is a UAP or a counter-UAS issue, that we need to have that complete domain awareness around our national security facilities.\""

He made his mark on Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show, but before his break, he was part of the U.S. Marines in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n\nDuring a recent chat with Pete Holmes on the You Made It Weird podcast, Riggle detailed his encounter seeing an apparent UFO in the sky from Macedonia to Kosovo. The comedian was in charge of taking care of the media with the troops, spending the first night of the travel in a field. Then the sky lit up.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just shooting the s\u2014t, and all of a sudden, the whole ridgeline lights up but in blue and red and white lights, like I\u2019ve never seen before. And I\u2019m talking about an entire ridgeline,\u201d he tells Holmes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sitting there looking and I go, \u2018What the eff is that?\n\n\u201cThe guy with me was a cameraman. Old crusty cameraman, beard and everything. He goes, \u2018It\u2019s a UFO man,\u2019\u201d he continued. Riggle then doubts it, while the camera guy doubles down, noting how it is spanning miles in the sky. Then poof, gone.\n\nWas it otherworldly happenings in the sky near an impending war zone or could it have been a flimsy trick by the enemy to keep people confused and worried? The answers won\u2019t be come easy.\n\nThis is only the latest dive from military veterans about UFOs and encounters with unidentified intelligence. This podcast appearance from Riggle coincides with the most recently Congressional testimony on the UAP phenomenon.\n\nWe\u2019re still not any closer to finding out if these are aliens from another planet, future humans, underwater mutates or something unknown at this point. In the end, the real discovery was the journey and those we met along the way. Which would still be rife with disappointment.\n\nIf you want to check out more of Riggle and UFOs, his series Rob Riggle Global Investigator has an episode devoted UFOs and Area 51 in Nevada."

We\u2019ll continue to use them to deliver basic, natural language, self-service applications. But the future belongs to multimodal applications, built on large language models (LLMs) and other AI models, that act as self-organizing software agents. These more complex AI applications will require more thought, more code, more testing, and more safeguards.\n\nAn AI evolution requires a similar evolution in our development tools. Although we\u2019ve seen Power Platform\u2019s Copilot Studio begin to deliver tools for building task-focused agents, more complex AI applications will require a lot more work, even with support from frameworks like Semantic Kernel.\n\nMuch of Azure\u2019s current AI tools, beyond its Cognitive Services APIs, are focused on building grounded chatbots, using Microsoft\u2019s Prompt Flow framework to add external vector indexes to LLMs for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), along with wrapping calls and outputs in its own AI safety tools. It\u2019s a proven approach to building and running Microsoft\u2019s own Copilot services, but if enterprises are to get the next generation of AI services, they need new tools that can help deliver custom agents."

        "article_content": "H, the Paris startup founded by Google alums, made a big splash last summer when, out of the blue, it announced a seed round of $220 million before releasing a single product. Three months later, still without a product, that splash started to look like a catastrophic flood when three of the company\u2019s five co-founders left over \u201coperational and business disagreements.\u201d\n\nBut the company has kept swimming, and today it\u2019s announcing its first product: Runner H, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI aimed at businesses and developers across tasks like quality assurance and process automation. It\u2019s built atop the startup\u2019s own, proprietary \u201ccompact\u201d LLM based on just 2 billion parameters.\n\nH has set up a waitlist for Runner H on its site. CEO Charles Kantor said that it will be releasing APIs to those on the list over the coming days to use agents \u201coff the shelf\u201d that have been pre-built by H, as well as for developers to create their own. Access to the API will also come along with access to something called H-Studio to test and manage how these services work.\n\nInitially, using those APIs will be free, and later there will be a payment model introduced.\n\nEven using compact LLMs, building and running AI is not cheap, especially as competition continues to raise money to develop their own products. TechCrunch has also confirmed that H is raising a Series A to build what Kantor describes as part of the second era of AI \u2014 with LLM companies like OpenAI being part of the first era.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to be in the position of building our own models,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cBut this second era will be as capital intensive as the first one.\u201d\n\n(Recall the $230 million H has already raised \u2014 it appears to have added another $10 million since announcing it earlier this year \u2014 was a mixture of equity and convertible debt. The long list of investors in that round included individuals like Eric Schmidt, Yuri Milner, and Xavier Niel; VCs such as Accel and Creandum; and strategic backers like Amazon, Samsung, and UiPath.)\n\nKantor told TechCrunch that H has quietly been working with a handful of customers in areas like e-commerce, banking, insurance, and outsourcing, who have been helping it hone the product.\n\n\u201cEverything [in H] is not based on our creativity but customer feedback,\u201d he said.\n\nRunner H will initially focus on three specific use cases: robotic process automation (RPA), quality assurance, and business process outsourcing.\n\nRPA is an area that has existed for years, using basic scripts to automate the most repetitive tasks that humans have had to perform \u2014 such as reading forms, checking boxes, and sending files from one place to another. In fact, a lot of RPA has never been built with AI baked in, even after AI started to develop advanced skills. The idea with Runner H is that it will be able to run RPA across forms, sites, and other templates even when they have been modified (something that might have broken previous scripts), and across a much wider range of sources.\n\nQuality assurance can cover a wide range of applications, but Kantor said that one of the most popular so far has been reducing the \u201cmaintenance burdens\u201d around website testing \u2014 validating page availability, simulating real user actions, or ensuring compatibility across payment methods \u2014 in particular when modifications have been made.\n\nBPO is a catch-all area that will cover not just fixing and improving billing processes, but also speeding up how an agent can use and access data from different sources, and more.\n\nThere has been a race among foundational AI companies around how many parameters are going into LLMs. (GPT 4 for example has 175 billion parameters.) But Runner H is taking a very different approach with just 2 billion parameters, both for its LLM and for its computer-vision-based \u201cVLM.\u201d Kantor\u2019s argument is that this makes them significantly more efficient in terms of cost and operations, key when working on winning and keeping business deals, and H\u2019s own operational costs.\n\n\u201cWe are specialists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building for the agentic era.\u201d\n\nThe company also claims that it works: It says that its compact model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s \u201cComputer Use\u201d by 29% (based on WebVoyager benchmarks) as well as models from Mistral and Meta.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Some of these apps are hosted on the Apple App and Google Play Stores. Our investigation shows that what was once a niche problem on the platform has industrialized in scale, and it shows what social media may become in the near future: a space where AI-generated content eclipses that of humans.\n\nElaina St James, an adult content creator who promotes her work on Instagram, said she and other adult content creators are now directly competing with these AI rip-off accounts, many of which use photographs and videos stolen from adult content creators and Instagram models. She said that while there may be other changes to Instagram\u2019s algorithm that could have contributed to this, since the explosion of AI-generated influencer accounts on Instagram her \u201creach went down tremendously,\u201d from a typical 1 million to 5 million views a month to not cracking a million in the last 10 months, and sometimes coming in under 500,000 views.\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the reasons my views are going down,\u201d St James told us in an interview. \u201cIt's because I'm competing with something that's unnatural.\u201d\n\nThis article was created in partnership with 404\n\nMedia, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans.

Mantzarlis, who stumbled on one of these accounts while casually using Instagram, said he started researching the AI-generated influencer accounts because it might show us where AI-generated content is taking social media and the internet more broadly, where he sees a \u201ca rising blended unreality.\u201d Mantzarlis believes he could have easily found 900 more accounts and that the only reason he didn\u2019t get more is that Instagram restricted the account he used to scrape the platform.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a possible sign of what social media is going to look like in five years,\u201d Mantzarlis said in an interview. \u201cBecause this may be coming to other parts of the internet, not just the attractive-people niche on Instagram. This is probably a sign that it's going to be pretty bad.\u201d\n\nThe Accounts\n\nOut of more than 1,000 AI-generated Instagram influencer accounts we reviewed, 100 included at least some deepfake content which took existing videos, usually from models and adult entertainment performers, and replaced their face with an AI-generated face to make those videos seem like new, original content consistent with the other AI-generated images and videos shared by the AI-generated influencer. The other 900 accounts shared images that in some cases were trained on real photographs and in some cases made to look like celebrities, but were entirely AI-generated, not edited photographs or videos.\n\nOut of those 100 accounts that shared deepfake or face-swapped videos, 60 self-identify as being AI-generated, writing in their bios that they are a \u201cvirtual model & influencer\u201d or stating \u201call photos crafted with AI and apps.\u201d The other 40 do not include any disclaimer stating that they are AI-generated.\n\nOne of the bigger accounts in the latter category is \u201cChloe Johnson,\u201d who has a verified account on Instagram and 171,000 followers. This account was deleted by Meta within the past few weeks."

However, the veteran actor also has a hidden connection to the paranormal drama series Supernatural. In the latter series, actor Jim Beaver appeared as Bobby Singer, an important supporting character.\n\nJim Beaver played Bobby Singer in Supernatural (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nDuring an interview, Beaver revealed how Harmon played a major role in his casting on Supernatural. At the same time, Beaver revealed that his character was a last-minute addition to the series but ended up becoming one of his most popular roles. Here is what Beaver had to say about his casting as Bobby Singer on Supernatural.\n\nNCIS Star Mark Harmon Was Linked to Jim Beaver\u2019s Supernatural Casting\n\nActor Mark Harmon is best known for playing Leroy Jethro Gibbs in NCIS. However, before his time on the long-running series, Harmon had the leading role in another short-lived procedural Reasonable Doubts. The series lasted only two seasons and starred Jim Beaver in a supporting role.\n\nNCIS star Mark Harmon worked with Jim Beaver (Credit: CBS).\n\nDuring an interview conducted by Lucy (@SpnUK) for the Supernatural Wiki, Beaver opened up about how Harmon and his short-lived series played an important role in his casting on Supernatural. Beaver revealed that he had known producer Bobby Singer since his time on Reasonable Doubts, which the latter had created.\n\nI had worked for Bob Singer a decade earlier, playing Mark Harmon\u2019s cop partner Earl Gaddis on Bob\u2019s show Reasonable Doubts, so he knew me.\n\nBeaver made the above statement, crediting his earlier role and working relationship with Singer for his casting on Supernatural.\n\nBeaver explained that he had learned about the character of Bobby Singer from casting director Robert Ulrich and submitted an audition tape. However, when Singer asked Ulrich about the actors who had submitted the tapes, he learned about Beaver\u2019s submission and instantly decided to cast him.\n\nJim Beaver Revealed that Bobby Singer Was a Last-Minute Addition to Supernatural\n\nDuring the same interview, Beaver also revealed an alternate story about his casting on Supernatural. Beaver explained that while he was unsure about which version of the story was true, he found both of them interesting.\n\nJim Beaver\u2019s Bobby Singer was created as a replacement hunter in Supernatural (Credit: Warner Bros).\n\nThe actor made his debut as Bobby Singer, an ally of the Winchester brothers in the first season finale, titled Devil\u2019s Trap. However, the character originally wasn\u2019t supposed to be introduced in that episode. Instead, actress Loretta Devine was expected to reprise her role as Missouri from a previous episode.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t available, so they decided to create a new character of another veteran hunter.\n\nBeaver made the above statement, revealing that his character was later created to fill the void left by Devine\u2019s unavailability.\n\nWhen the producers came up with another veteran hunter character, Singer decided to cast Beaver because of their past work together. Therefore, Beaver implied that his character was a last-minute addition. Beaver appeared in 69 episodes, becoming one of the most popular recurring characters in the series.\n\nSupernatural is streaming on Netflix."

Pic: AP\n\nHe was popular, though his promotion of alternative medicine, faith healing and various paranormal beliefs earned him criticism from a number of medical publications and physicians.\n\nThe critics accused him of blurring the lines between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 11:20 Who will be in Trump's White House?\n\nDespite the controversy, Dr Oz's show was a hit and his net worth sat between $100m (\u00a379m) and $315m (\u00a3249m) in 2022, according to a federal financial disclosure he filed that year.\n\nBeyond being an Emmy-winning TV show host, he is also an author of New York Times bestsellers, radio talk show host, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.\n\nHe was also a regular Fox News commentator, and a champion of unproven treatments for COVID including hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug whose use against the disease was also backed by Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Dr Oz holding his Emmy for outstanding talk show host in 2016. Pic: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nHe became a fierce critic of Joe Biden's government during the COVID pandemic, challenging its policies on social media.\n\nMoving into politics\n\nDr Oz played a lesser part in the first Trump administration from 2016, when he was appointed to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition.\n\nBut it was in 2022, after his show concluded, when Dr Oz really transitioned into politics by running for US Senate as a Republican in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe campaign leaned heavily into his celebrity status, with his campaign logo almost identical to his TV show logo.\n\nImage: Mehmet Oz campaigning for Senate in 2022. Pic: AP\n\nDuring his campaign rallies, he would talk up his \"number one health show in the world,\" give the odd piece of medical advice to supporters and spend a lengthy amount of time signing autographs and posing for photos.\n\nFollowing a court battle that went all the way to the US Supreme Court, Dr Oz narrowly won the primary over Dave McCormick by 951 votes, becoming the Republican candidate, but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.\n\nHis relationship with Trump\n\nImage: Donald Trump stands behind Dr Oz during rally in 2022. Pic: Reuters\n\nThe surgeon has had a long, personal relationship with the president-elect spanning back to the early 2000s.\n\nHe said in an interview during his Senate campaign that the pair first met in 2004 or 2005, when Dr Oz asked Mr Trump to use his golf course for an event for his children's charity.\n\nMr Trump agreed and, after that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Dr Oz interviewed him about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMr Trump appeared on his show, where he also said his wife Melania was \"a big fan\" of the doctor.\n\nThe pair then worked together when Mr Trump won the election and put Dr Oz on the President's Council.\n\nThen in 2022, Mr Trump was integral to Dr Oz's push for Senate, giving him his eagerly sought-after endorsement.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho does Trump want in his top team?\n\nTrump and Musk watch shaky rocket launch\n\n\"Women, in particular, are drawn to Dr Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him,\" Mr Trump said when he first backed him.\n\n\"You know when you're in television for 18 years, that's like a poll,\" added the billionaire, who himself starred on 14 seasons of The Apprentice US.\n\n\"That means people like you.\"\n\nWhat will his role be?\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate to take the role, Dr Oz would oversee Medicare, Medicaid, children's health insurance and the Affordable Care Act, better known as \"Obamacare\".\n\nThe programmes cover more than 160 million people, from new-borns to nursing home residents.\n\nCMS also plays a central role in the nation's $4.5trn health care economy, setting payment rates for hospitals, doctors, labs and other service providers.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\n\"Dr Oz will be a leader in incentivising disease prevention, so we get the best results in the world for every dollar we spend on healthcare in our great country,\" the president-elect said in a statement.\n\n\"He will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"\n\nDr Oz said he was \"honoured\" to be nominated for the role and looked forward to \"serving my country to Make America Healthy Again\".\n\nHe, like all of Mr Trump's picks, must be questioned by members of the Senate before it votes on his appointment. Even with the Republicans in control, some of the picks could be blocked."

        "article_content": "This story was originally published in the 2024 edition of Discovery magazine, the College of Science's publication. This edition of Discovery celebrated the 20th anniversary of the College of Science.\n\n\"Ours is a world of sights and sounds. We live by our eyes and ears and tend generally to be oblivious to the chemical happenings in our surrounds. Such happenings are ubiquitous. All organisms engender chemical signals, and all, in their respective ways, respond to the chemical emissions of others. \u2026 And it is a discipline in which discovery is still very much in order, for the interactions themselves remain in large measure to be uncovered.\" \u2013 Jerrold Meinwald and Thomas Eisner, 1995\n\nThe last part of the first paragraph of Meinwald and Eisner\u2019s abstract in their review article \"Chemical Ecology\" is just as true today as it was when it was published 30 years ago. There are a growing number of chemical ecologists, and many of them are being trained at the University\u2019s Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology.\n\nThe Hitchcock Center is named for its founding donor, Mick Hitchcock. Hitchcock is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and worked in the pharmaceutical industry for many years, helping to develop antiviral drugs, including the first once-daily three-drug combination pill to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hitchcock moved to Reno in 2009 (largely due to its proximity to good snowboarding) and has been involved at the University since.\n\nChristopher Jeffrey, a professor in the Department of Chemistry, started at the University the same day Hitchcock was giving a talk. Jeffrey attended the talk and later, the two had dinner together. Following this initial interaction, Jeffrey and Hitchcock began to talk about chemistry on a regular basis over dinners and started snowboarding together.\n\n\"[Mick] got to learn about what our research was, and it fell in line with exactly how he felt the future of science is going,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nHitchcock worked with Jeffrey to develop a multi-year program that would provide both research and teaching opportunities for students and faculty at the University.\n\n\"The idea was that, by funding the start up of the center over a period of years, it would allow time for the group to become independent by obtaining funding and grants from other sources, especially funding sources that are not usually available to researchers in single, independent laboratories,\" Hitchcock said.\n\nIn 2018, the Hitchcock Center officially opened as an interdisciplinary research unit, where graduate students could be trained to think in more disciplines than the normal higher education model allows for. The Hitchcock Center has developed a space where the lines are blurred between chemistry, biology and ecology.\n\nResearchers study systems in Nevada\u2019s dry, harsh deserts and the Amazon\u2019s lush, tropical rainforests. One major project studies Piper kelleyi, a wild relative of black pepper. The plant, found in the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Andes, is widespread and supports many species, particularly caterpillars. The project involves collaboration with the Indigenous Kichwa and Waorani communities in Ecuador. These communities have used Piper as medicine for generations. The research project includes Lora Richards (Principal Investigator), Deena Schmidt, Thomas Parchman, Lee Dyer, Christopher Jeffrey, Craig Dodson and Casey Philbin (all faculty from the University), and scientists from the Kichwa and Waorani communities.\n\nA recent National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Traineeship (NRT) grant was awarded to the Hitchcock Center after seven previous applications for the incredibly competitive grant.\n\nThe $3 million grant will support at least 25 fellowships for students working in chemical ecology. Jeffrey credits the success of the proposal to Marjorie Matoq, the director of the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology graduate program, whose experience with monitoring program success, a critical part of any grant, was the last piece of the puzzle to secure this achievement.\n\n\"Those missing elements pushed us right over the top,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nThe proposal featured several areas of research, including evolution of chemically mediated interactions, chemistry of community interactions, chemistry of biological interactions: engines of biodiversity, and ecoimmunology and pest management. The NRT funding also includes support for the development of a new course: Chemistry of Biological Interactions.\n\nThe center promotes success for graduate students by providing a workshop series that will discuss topics like interdisciplinary communication, conflict resolutions, DEI/Ally training, team science and reproducible science. The NSF has emphasized the importance of making science reproducible and developing good data management practices.\n\n\"That grant, I would say, reflects the broader goals of our center,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nTo promote interdisciplinary research partnerships, the Hitchcock Center pairs two students on a single project who are participating in distinct areas of research. Zach Ledvina and Haley Dole are partnering up to teach each other the chemical and ecological characteristics of Piper kelleyi. Ledvina, a chemistry student pursuing his doctoral degree, and Dole, a doctoral student in the Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology graduate program, each have unique skillsets and knowledge about the system that they can share with one another to elucidate the underlying \"chemical happenings\" in the system.\n\nThe center also provides stipends and research support for undergraduate students, and summer or semester internships with the biotechnology industry, natural resource management agencies, outreach education (including at the University\u2019s Museum of Natural History) and conservation organizations.\n\nSpeakers at the Hitchcock Center for Chemical Ecology Symposium gather for a photo before Paul Cox's keynote lecture.\n\nThe Hitchcock Center just hosted its second Hitchcock Symposium at the University of Nevada, Reno at Lake Tahoe, which brought a long-time supporter and advisory member of the center, Paul Alan Cox, back to campus. Cox is an ethnobotanist who searches for cures or treatments for diseases in the natural world, particularly in so-called \"blue zones\" where much of the population lives longer than the average human lifespan. Cox previously spoke at the University for a Discover Science lecture in 2016 and continues to advocate for the center through support on grants and as an adviser to the programs.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got the right people, the right science, the right questions,\" Cox said about the Hitchcock Center during his talk.\n\nThe center received funding from multiple companies to support the symposium, including Untamed Wine Estates, where alumna McKenzie Shipman-Sanvido '15 (biology, analytical chemistry) serves as vice president, which provided raffle prizes for public attendees; Agilent, a company that develops cutting edge instrumentation, which provided academic and speaker grants; and Alcami, which provided award sponsorship for student presentations.\n\nThree Ph.D. candidates were presented with student awards at the end of the conference: Tanzil Mahmud (left) won the oral presentation award, Yingshi Feng (middle) won the poster presentation award and Ari Grele won the Scott Chadwick Outstanding Chemical Ecology Graduate Award.\n\nIn addition to the Hitchcock Center, Jeffrey said there are several other chemical ecology centers around the world, including at the Pennsylvania State University, Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\n\n\n\"What makes our program unique is that it is chemistry-forward,\" Jeffrey said.\n\n\n\nThe Hitchcock Center was recently elected to a multi-state consortium of chemical ecology centers led by Penn State and Cornell focused on using chemical ecology to solve agricultural challenges. This election has elevated the center\u2019s status as an internationally recognized contributor to the discipline and paved the way for the center to apply for new agriculture grants. Jeffrey recently attended the International Chemical Ecology short course, which rotates between most of the major centers for chemical ecology. Jeffrey is working out dates with his colleagues for the Hitchcock Center to host this short course in the future. The Hitchcock Center has also been developing partnerships with other universities to work toward applied research in agriculture and medicine.\n\nOne part of the many projects Jeffrey is excited about is the synthetic chemistry being used to understand the relationships between caterpillars and Piper kelleyi. As a synthetic chemist, Jeffrey, who had just finished his postdoctoral work, read an article published in 2007 that said the field was facing the slow death of natural products chemistry. Today, Jeffrey is excited that natural products and synthetic chemistry are going hand-in-hand, playing an important role in chemical ecology research, and are able to directly address some of the biggest questions in science, such as explaining the biodiversity of our planet.\n\nSince the Hitchcock Center was formally recognized on campus, faculty and the center itself have received $30 million in grants, comprised of four NSF grants (including the NRT and Piper kelleyi research), a NASA astrobiology research grant (in partnership with scientists at the Desert Research Institute) and others.\n\nScott Chadwick of Alcami has also supported the center by endowing a scholarship for an outstanding graduate student in chemical ecology.\n\n\"My goal for the center is that it will eventually take on a life of its own,\" Hitchcock said. \"Much like seed funding for an entrepreneurial business venture, the strategy is to start the ball rolling with enough energy to allow it to continue independently in due course.\""

But a closer look would have revealed a strange, in-between creature \u2014 a big-eyed imp with a small head and an apelike face who walked upright like a human.\n\nShe may have looked warily over her shoulder as she walked, on alert for saber-toothed cats or hyenas. She may have used her strong arms to climb the shrubby trees nearby, searching for fruit, eggs, or insects to eat. Or perhaps she simply rested on the shores of the croc-infested waters, gulping down water on a hot day.\n\nShe likely had no idea it was her last day on Earth.\n\nRoughly 3.2 million years later, her skeleton was unearthed by paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson and his team on the International Afar Research Expedition .\n\nThe stunningly complete fossil was nicknamed \"Lucy.\" And her remarkable species, Australopithecus afarensis, may have been our direct ancestor. Our discoveries about Lucy have transformed our understanding of humanity's tangled family tree.\n\nFifty years later, we know so much more about her species. In fact, anthropologists have learned so much about Lucy and her kind that we can now paint a picture of how she lived and died.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

And it was likely dominated by the ever-present fear of predators.\n\n\"I suspect that the last day in her life was filled with danger,\" Johanson told Live Science.\n\nDonald Johanson excavating a fossil in 1975. (Image credit: David Brill)\n\nFinding Lucy\n\nThe modern story of Lucy began on Nov. 24, 1974, in Hadar, Ethiopia. Johanson and then-graduate student Tom Gray stumbled upon a bone poking out of a gully. Following two weeks of careful excavation, their team recovered dozens of fossilized bones. Together, these bones made up 40% of the skeleton of a human ancestor, making it the most complete skeleton of an archaic human species that had ever been found.\n\nPamela Alderman, another member of the expedition, suggested the team nickname the skeleton Lucy, after the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\"\n\n\"And it just became iconic,\" Johanson said, \"a moniker that everybody knew.\"\n\nLucy\u2019s discovery transformed the study of ancient human relatives.\n\n\"I was in high school when she was found,\" John Kappelman , a paleoanthropologist at the University of Texas at Austin, told Live Science. \"It really did reset the way paleoanthropology worked.\"\n\nLucy's skeleton, along with subsequent discoveries of other fossils of her species, have given anthropologists a wealth of information about what is essentially the halfway point in human evolution. At 3.2 million years old, Lucy and her kind lived equidistant in time from our ape ancestors and contemporary humans.\n\n\"She's our touchstone,\" Jeremy DeSilva , a paleoanthropologist at Dartmouth College, told Live Science. \"Everything sort of comes back to her as the reference point, and she deserves it.\"\n\nDonald Johanson with the \u201cLucy\u201d skeleton in 1975. (Image credit: Image courtesy of the Institute of Human Origins, Arizona State University.)\n\n\"A lot like us\"\n\nOne thing is fairly certain: Though there were some obvious differences, Lucy looked and acted a lot like us.\n\n\"If we saw her coming out of a grocery store today, we would recognize her as upright walking and some kind of human,\" Johanson said.\n\nAlthough her strong arms and the shape of her finger bones suggest Lucy could climb trees, her pelvis and knees were clearly adapted to walking on two feet.\n\nThe size of Lucy's thigh bone also revealed that she was only about 42 inches (1.1 meters) tall and 60 to 65 pounds (27 to 30 kilograms) \u2014 about the size of a 6- or 7-year-old child today. And the eruption of her wisdom teeth showed that, although she was in her early teens when she died, she was a fully mature young adult.\n\n\"Australopithecus in general was maturing fast,\" DeSilva said, \"and it makes sense if you're on a landscape full of predators.\" In species that are frequently prey, individuals that mature faster are more likely to pass on their genes. But australopithecines were unique\u2014while their teeth and bodies matured quickly, their brains grew more slowly, telling us that they relied quite a bit on learning for survival, DeSilva said.\n\nHer discovery also settled a debate that was raging in the early 1970s: Did our big brains evolve before we learned to walk upright? Lucy's head, which was not much bigger than a chimp's, showed the answer was no. Our ancestors became bipedal long before they evolved large brains.\n\nA comparison of the skeletons of Lucy (left), a chimpanzee (center) and a modern human (right). (Image credit: eLucy.org, CC BY-SA 3.0 US\n\nLucy's clan\n\nBecause her skeleton was found on its own, Lucy's \"social life\" is a little murkier than other parts of her daily life. But many researchers think she lived in a mixed-sex group of about 15 to 20 males and females, not unlike modern-day chimpanzees do .\n\nAnd although there's no direct evidence, Lucy's skeletal maturity suggests she could have had a baby . Bringing that relatively large-headed newborn through her relatively narrow pelvis would have been challenging, which means she may have had the help of a primitive \"midwife .\"\n\nIf Lucy had a baby, she also likely had a partner. Other A. afarensis fossils, such as those of Kadanuumuu , show male australopithecines were only slightly larger than females , which, in primates, usually corresponds to more monogamous pairings .\n\nLucy and her kind would have spent a significant amount of their time avoiding becoming another animals' lunch. \"These small creatures would have been nice hors d'oeuvres for a sabertooth or a large cat or hyena,\" Johanson said.\n\nPerhaps because of that omnipresent danger, the group likely relied on each other.\n\n\"I think they had each other's backs and helped each other out,\" DeSilva said, \"especially when they were in dangerous situations.\"\n\nA healed bone fracture seen in Kadanuumuu provides evidence that these primates cared for one another. Around 3.6 million years ago, this male australopithecine broke his lower leg. By the time he died, though, the break was fully healed.\n\n\"On that landscape with that many predators, no doctors, no hospitals, no casts, no crutches, how in the world do you survive if not for social assistance?\" DeSilva said. \"It's really strong evidence that they didn't leave each other for dead.\"\n\nLucy's last day\n\nLucy probably started her last day much like any other, waking up from the treetop nest made of branches and leaves where she slept, along with her group, before setting off to find food.\n\nIt's not clear whether she would have been alone or in a group when she left to forage; if she did have a baby, she may have carried it.\n\nBut there's no doubt that she would have spent a significant part of her day looking for food. She most likely ate a few staples, such as grasses, roots and insects , chemical elements in her tooth enamel showed. She may have happened upon the eggs of birds or turtles and promptly gobbled them up as tasty, protein-rich treats. And if she was lucky enough to come across a carcass of a large mammal, such as an antelope, that hadn't been picked clean, she and her troop mates may have pulled the flesh from the bone, using large rocks .\n\n\"They can't afford to be picky eaters as these slow bipeds in a dangerous environment,\" DeSilva said. \"They're eating everything they can get their hands on.\"\n\nHowever, there's no evidence that Lucy\u2019s species used fire to cook any of their food.\n\nA view of Hadar, Ethiopia, near where Lucy was found. (Image credit: Image courtesy of the Institute of Human Origins, Arizona State University.)\n\nDeath at the water's edge\n\nIn the past 50 years, we've created a picture of Lucy's last moments. It's not clear exactly why she was by the lake; maybe she was thirsty, or perhaps it was a great spot to look for food.\n\nBut there are two main theories for how she died.\n\n\"Perhaps she was down there at the water and \u2014 bam! \u2014 a crocodile comes out,\" Johanson said. \"Crocodiles are incredibly fast, and it's a dangerous place if you're a little creature\" like Lucy.\n\nJohanson found one carnivore tooth mark on Lucy's pelvis, and it had not healed, meaning it occurred around the time of her death. Although the animal that made the mark has not been conclusively identified, \"we know that australopithecines were preyed upon because there are a number of examples,\" Johanson said.\n\nIn 2016, Kappelman and his colleagues put forward an alternate ending for Lucy: a catastrophic fall from a tree.\n\nBased on high-resolution CT scans and 3D reconstructions of Lucy's skeleton, Kappelman identified fractures in her right shoulder, ribs and knees that were unlike the typical fracturing that occurs in fossils crushed under the weight of dirt and rocks for millions of years.\n\n\"Something traumatic happened here during life,\" Kappelman said.\n\nThe kinds of fractures Lucy suffered are consistent with a fall from a considerable height, perhaps from a tall tree in which she was foraging for food.\n\nI like to think all fossils are pretty special, but there's nothing like Lucy. Jeremy DeSilva\n\n\"She hit on her feet and then her hands, which meant she was conscious when she hit the ground,\" Kappelman said. \"I don't think she survived very long.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether she was alone when she died. But even if she was with others of her kind, they likely wouldn't have done much with her body.\n\nThere's no evidence that A. afarensis \"bodies were treated any differently than any other animal,\" DeSilva said. \"Maybe there was some curiosity around it, and then they carried on.\"\n\nPrimate researchers have documented other species' curiosity about inanimate bodies. For example, chimpanzees often care for the body for a few hours or days after death, sometimes guarding the body.\n\nLucy's group may have done the same for her until her body was naturally buried, which would have happened quite rapidly, perhaps by a flood or mudslide .\n\nIn the end, though, \"we know very little about how any of these creatures died,\" Johanson said.\n\nAn illustration of australopithecines walking in wet ash at Laetoli in Tanzania. (Image credit: Illustration by Michael Hagelberg, courtesy Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University.)\n\nLucy lives on\n\nThanks to Johanson's 1974 discovery of Lucy \u2014 as well as other important findings, like the \"First Family\" and the footprints at Laetoli in Tanzania \u2014 we now know quite a lot about A. afarensis.\n\n\"It was a highly successful species that was comfortable in lots of different habitats,\" Johanson said; A. afarensis fossils have been found in Kenya in addition to Ethiopia and Tanzania. \"From an evolutionary perspective, her species was highly adaptable,\" he said.\n\nLucy has had a broad impact on the field of anthropology.\n\n\"The discovery of Lucy really hit the start button for looking in older and older sediments in Africa,\" Kappelman said. As a result, we have found numerous ancient hominin species and now have 50 years' worth of fossil evidence that human evolution was messy and complex.\n\nLucy was the only human ancestor discovered at Hadar. But a couple dozen miles away at Woranso-Mille, a paleontological site in Ethiopia, Yohannes Haile-Selassie , director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University, and his colleagues have found evidence of a strange land inhabited by multiple humanlike species between 3.8 million and 3.3 million years ago. For instance, Lucy's kind coexisted alongside another ancient relative, A. anamensis.\n\nWould they have been friends, enemies, competitors or something in between? Right now, anthropologists still have little idea what this landscape teeming with ancient hominins would have looked like.\n\nBut perhaps 50 years from now, we'll have a better picture of how Lucy's kind interacted with these other ancient hominins. Even then, Lucy will likely remain one of the most famous fossils of all time.\n\n\"I like to think all fossils are pretty special,\" DeSilva said, \"but there's nothing like Lucy.\""

Responding to this demand, Invincible Ocean has launched a groundbreaking AI-powered no-code onboarding platform that reduces fintech product deployment to just 10 minutes, potentially transforming the customer onboarding landscape.\n\nAs governments globally tighten Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, the demand for efficient, compliant eKYC solutions has become a priority across industries. Invincible Ocean\u2019s solution is designed to help businesses, particularly in finance, navigate this requirement effortlessly while keeping fraud risks at bay.\n\n\"As onboarding journeys across different sectors are largely similar, our solution allows the same product to be used across various industries and use cases,\" states Ajay Setia, CEO, Invincible Ocean. \"Additionally, our Invincible Intelligence ecosystem helps design customised risk engines using alternate data.\"\n\nSimplifying onboarding with no-code efficiency\n\nAt the core of Invincible Ocean\u2019s platform is a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that requires no specialised coding knowledge. This no-code design allows users from various departments\u2014not just tech teams\u2014to customise their onboarding workflows easily. By enabling a microservices-based architecture, companies can modularise each part of the onboarding process, breaking it down into reusable components that simplify configuration. This approach allows businesses to create a personalised onboarding journey tailored to their brand's look and feel, integrating domain names, logos, and colours, for a seamless user experience.\n\n\"Our no-code platform is accessible to a wide range of users within an organisation,\" Setia says. \"It allows companies to build onboarding solutions without the need for deep technical expertise, democratising access to a crucial area of customer experience and compliance.\"\n\nA standout feature of the platform is its ability to adapt across industries. While the platform is flexible enough to meet general onboarding needs, it also offers pre-designed, industry-specific solutions tailored to sectors like Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), insurance, and banking. These customised workflows are already aligned with the unique compliance and operational requirements of each industry, making it easier for businesses to deploy without the need for extensive adjustments.\n\nSpeed is the hallmark of this offering, with a record delivery time of 10 minutes for product deployment. In contrast to traditional onboarding processes that may take days or even weeks, Invincible Ocean\u2019s rapid deployment ensures that businesses can quickly react to changing regulatory needs and roll out solutions for onboarding customers and vendors seamlessly.\n\n\"Invincible, with its DIY platform and 250+ verification APIs, provides eKYC solutions for 150+ countries and includes a comprehensive vehicle intelligence ecosystem,\" says Setia, highlighting the platform\u2019s vast reach and capability to support businesses on a global scale.\n\nTackling onboarding challenges\n\nIn developing this no-code solution, the company identified three critical challenges in the current onboarding landscape: inefficiency, high costs, and fraud risks. Traditional onboarding typically involves manual paperwork, time-consuming verifications, and disconnected systems, leading to bottlenecks and elevated costs. For many businesses, these processes also increase the likelihood of errors and fraud.\n\nTo address these challenges, the platform leverages AI-driven risk engines and real-time data processing, which enhance fraud detection capabilities. By allowing users to configure risk engines according to industry-specific needs, the platform also helps minimise exposure to fraudulent activities. For instance, financial institutions that prioritise security can leverage the Invincible Intelligence ecosystem, which uses alternate data to make real-time, risk-informed decisions.\n\nIt\u2019s built as a white-label solution, enabling organisations to integrate onboarding seamlessly within their existing brand environment, while ensuring compliance and security. This adaptability ensures that clients can scale their onboarding solutions to meet evolving business demands without compromising security or user experience.\n\nOngoing support for changing regulatory needs\n\nDespite the platform's simplicity, Invincible Ocean provides robust client support. \"We designed a straightforward DIY platform that emphasises ease of use,\" Setia says. To facilitate smooth onboarding for users, it has incorporated AI-enabled tips throughout the platform and offers resources like tutorials, user guides, and access to a dedicated support team.\n\nKeeping pace with the fast-changing fintech sector, Invincible Ocean actively gathers client feedback to continuously improve its platform. With a clientele of over 300 companies and 10 banks, the platform\u2019s adaptability is a response to emerging trends and regulatory changes. The Invincible Intelligence Ecosystem was specifically designed to meet the demand for comprehensive insights from real-time data, enabling businesses to make quick, informed adjustments.\n\n\u201cBy harnessing real-time data and advanced analytics, the platform can adapt to regulatory shifts and evolving market demands, ensuring that clients remain compliant and competitive,\u201d explains Setia.\n\nData security and privacy at the forefront\n\nIn a world where data breaches are a constant threat, the company prioritises data security and privacy. The platform incorporates secure microservices and encryption to protect data at every stage of onboarding. Compliance with industry regulations is a key component of the platform\u2019s architecture, which employs robust access controls and regular security audits to detect and prevent potential threats. For companies handling sensitive KYC information, this adherence to high-security standards is a reassurance that customer data is well-protected.\n\nBy focusing on ease of use, data security, and regulatory compliance, Invincible Ocean has effectively addressed key pain points in the onboarding process, making it a go-to solution for fintech companies worldwide. As Setia aptly concludes, \"In today\u2019s market, onboarding needs to be not only fast but also secure and adaptable.

        "article_content": "Starting a business is exciting, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014it\u2019s also expensive. From hiring developers to setting up systems, costs can quickly add up, leaving little room for experimentation. But here\u2019s the good news: no-code tools are rewriting the rules of entrepreneurship. They allow you to build apps, automate processes, and test ideas without breaking the bank.\n\nYou no longer need to rely on expensive developers or wait months to bring your vision to life. No-code strategies empower you to create and grow your business while keeping costs low. In this article, I\u2019ll share how you can leverage no-code tools to cut startup costs, streamline operations, and make every dollar count.\n\nWhy Cutting Costs Matters for Startups\n\nEvery startup faces the challenge of doing more with less. When you\u2019re just starting out, funds are often limited, and you need to allocate them wisely. Cutting costs isn\u2019t just about saving money\u2014it\u2019s about giving your business room to grow without unnecessary financial stress.\n\nWith no-code tools, you can avoid hiring full development teams, reduce software expenses, and speed up your go-to-market strategy. Imagine being able to build a functioning product or automate a workflow in days rather than months, all at a fraction of the cost.\n\n1. Use No-Code Tools to Build Your MVP\n\nYour Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first version of your product, designed to test your idea with real users. Traditionally, building an MVP required a team of developers and thousands of dollars. No-code tools have changed the game.\n\nPlatforms like Bubble, Webflow, and Glide let you build fully functional apps and websites without any coding knowledge. You can design, test, and launch your product in weeks instead of months, saving significant development costs.\n\nExample:\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to launch an ecommerce store. Using Webflow, you can create a visually stunning and functional website without hiring a web developer. Need a mobile app for your store? Tools like Glide or Adalo make it possible.\n\nCheck out this no code tools directory to explore platforms that fit your needs.\n\n2. Automate Repetitive Tasks to Save Time and Money\n\nRepetitive tasks like sending follow-up emails, updating spreadsheets, or managing customer support can eat up your time. Hiring people to handle these tasks can also strain your budget. No-code automation tools like Zapier and Make (formerly Integromat) help you streamline these processes.\n\nFor instance, you can automate:\n\nSending a welcome email to new subscribers.\n\nAdding leads from forms to your CRM.\n\nUpdating inventory levels across platforms.\n\nAutomation not only saves money but also frees up your time to focus on scaling your business. You don\u2019t have to manage everything manually when these tools work in the background.\n\n3. Create Marketing Assets Without Hiring Designers\n\nProfessional design services can be expensive, especially for startups on a budget. No-code tools like Canva and Visme let you create stunning graphics, social media posts, and presentations without needing a designer. These platforms offer templates and drag-and-drop interfaces that make designing simple.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you\u2019re promoting your business on Instagram, Canva allows you to create eye-catching posts and stories that stand out. With no additional cost, you can maintain a professional online presence and attract more customers.\n\nFor entrepreneurs exploring best side business ideas for entrepreneurs, using design tools like Canva can also help build your brand with minimal investment.\n\n4. Streamline Customer Management with No-Code CRM Tools\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) is crucial for any business, but traditional CRM software can be expensive. No-code CRMs like Airtable and Notion allow you to manage your customer data, track interactions, and even automate follow-ups\u2014all on a budget.\n\nHow to Use No-Code CRMs:\n\nTrack sales leads and conversations in Airtable.\n\nUse Notion to create a centralized hub for client details and project updates.\n\nAutomate lead assignment and notifications with Zapier integrations.\n\nThese tools give you the functionality of big-name CRMs without the hefty price tag.\n\n5. Test and Scale Business Ideas Without High Costs\n\nOne of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs face is testing business ideas quickly without wasting money. With no-code tools, you can experiment with different ideas and pivot when needed, all without draining your budget.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild a prototype of your app using Bubble.\n\nSet up a landing page to validate your idea with Webflow.\n\nUse Glide to create a mobile app for testing a new service.\n\nNo-code tools give you the flexibility to adapt your business strategy based on feedback. This agility can save you from costly mistakes and help you focus on what works.\n\n6. Reduce Software Expenses with Free and Low-Cost No-Code Tools\n\nInstead of investing in multiple expensive tools, you can use no-code platforms that offer free or low-cost plans. Many tools provide all the functionality you need at an affordable price, especially when you\u2019re just starting out.\n\nTool Purpose Starting Price Bubble App development $25/month Zapier Workflow automation Free (limited) Canva Graphic design Free (with pro options) Airtable CRM and databases Free\n\nBy choosing the right tools, you can reduce overhead while maintaining the quality and efficiency of your operations.\n\n7. Work with No-Code Agencies for Complex Projects\n\nWhile no-code tools empower you to build on your own, there are times when you might need expert guidance, especially for more complex projects. A Zeroqode is top No code Agency that can help you bring your ideas to life faster and more efficiently than traditional development teams.\n\nFor instance, if you want to create a custom app with advanced functionality, a no-code agency can save you time and money by delivering a professional solution tailored to your needs.\n\n8. Leverage Free Online Resources and Communities\n\nOne of the hidden benefits of no-code tools is the thriving communities that surround them. Platforms like Bubble and Webflow have active forums where users share tips, templates, and solutions. These resources can help you learn faster and troubleshoot without spending extra money.\n\nPro Tip: Many no-code tools also offer free tutorials and courses to help you get started. Use these resources to build your skills and avoid costly mistakes.\n\nConclusion\n\nStarting a business doesn\u2019t have to drain your savings. By using no-code tools, you can build, automate, and grow your startup while keeping costs low. From creating an MVP to managing customers and streamlining workflows, no-code strategies let you focus on expanding your business without financial stress.\n\nWith no-code tools, you can turn your entrepreneurial dreams into reality without spending a fortune."

        "article_content": "H, the Paris startup founded by Google alums, made a big splash last summer when, out of the blue, it announced a seed round of $220 million before releasing a single product. Three months later, still without a product, that splash started to look like a catastrophic flood when three of the company\u2019s five co-founders left over \u201coperational and business disagreements.\u201d\n\nBut the company has kept swimming, and today it\u2019s announcing its first product: Runner H, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI aimed at businesses and developers across tasks like quality assurance and process automation. It\u2019s built atop the startup\u2019s own, proprietary \u201ccompact\u201d LLM based on just 2 billion parameters.\n\nH has set up a waitlist for Runner H on its site. CEO Charles Kantor said that it will be releasing APIs to those on the list over the coming days to use agents \u201coff the shelf\u201d that have been pre-built by H, as well as for developers to create their own. Access to the API will also come along with access to something called H-Studio to test and manage how these services work.\n\nInitially, using those APIs will be free, and later there will be a payment model introduced.\n\nEven using compact LLMs, building and running AI is not cheap, especially as competition continues to raise money to develop their own products. TechCrunch has also confirmed that H is raising a Series A to build what Kantor describes as part of the second era of AI \u2014 with LLM companies like OpenAI being part of the first era.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to be in the position of building our own models,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cBut this second era will be as capital intensive as the first one.\u201d\n\n(Recall the $230 million H has already raised \u2014 it appears to have added another $10 million since announcing it earlier this year \u2014 was a mixture of equity and convertible debt. The long list of investors in that round included individuals like Eric Schmidt, Yuri Milner, and Xavier Niel; VCs such as Accel and Creandum; and strategic backers like Amazon, Samsung, and UiPath.)\n\nKantor told TechCrunch that H has quietly been working with a handful of customers in areas like e-commerce, banking, insurance, and outsourcing, who have been helping it hone the product.\n\n\u201cEverything [in H] is not based on our creativity but customer feedback,\u201d he said.\n\nRunner H will initially focus on three specific use cases: robotic process automation (RPA), quality assurance, and business process outsourcing.\n\nRPA is an area that has existed for years, using basic scripts to automate the most repetitive tasks that humans have had to perform \u2014 such as reading forms, checking boxes, and sending files from one place to another. In fact, a lot of RPA has never been built with AI baked in, even after AI started to develop advanced skills. The idea with Runner H is that it will be able to run RPA across forms, sites, and other templates even when they have been modified (something that might have broken previous scripts), and across a much wider range of sources.\n\nQuality assurance can cover a wide range of applications, but Kantor said that one of the most popular so far has been reducing the \u201cmaintenance burdens\u201d around website testing \u2014 validating page availability, simulating real user actions, or ensuring compatibility across payment methods \u2014 in particular when modifications have been made.\n\nBPO is a catch-all area that will cover not just fixing and improving billing processes, but also speeding up how an agent can use and access data from different sources, and more.\n\nThere has been a race among foundational AI companies around how many parameters are going into LLMs. (GPT 4 for example has 175 billion parameters.) But Runner H is taking a very different approach with just 2 billion parameters, both for its LLM and for its computer-vision-based \u201cVLM.\u201d Kantor\u2019s argument is that this makes them significantly more efficient in terms of cost and operations, key when working on winning and keeping business deals, and H\u2019s own operational costs.\n\n\u201cWe are specialists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are building for the agentic era.\u201d\n\nThe company also claims that it works: It says that its compact model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s \u201cComputer Use\u201d by 29% (based on WebVoyager benchmarks) as well as models from Mistral and Meta.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

        "article_content": "Apple does not assist third parties in unlocking iPhones, which has led many law enforcement agencies to rely on the Graykey forensics tool. A recent report from 404 Media indicates that this controversial product can now access the newest iPhone 16 models.\n\nShould this be a concern for you? Almost certainly not, but it\u2019s still good to stay informed about how these things work. Here\u2019s a quick overview.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA new report states that Graykey can access \u201cpartial\u201d information from iPhones running iOS 18 or iOS 18.0.1, including the iPhone 16 lineup. What \u201cpartial\u201d information means is unknown. Leaked documents also suggest that iPhones with the iOS 18.1 beta are inaccessible to Graykey. The same restriction is believed to apply to the official release of iOS 18.1, which became available to the public in late October.\n\nGraykey, like another law enforcement-used unlocking product, Cellebrite, is very secretive about how its products help unlock iPhones. What we do know, however, is that these companies look for new iPhone vulnerabilities to do their job. As Apple patches security flaws, companies have to find new ways to access data, and so on.\n\nSince at least iOS 12 in 2018, Apple has continually identified vulnerabilities that make iPhones susceptible to unlocking and subsequently released software patches that address the issue. Eventually, third parties find new vulnerabilities, and so on.\n\nAs 404 Media indicates, Magnet Forensics, which owns Graykey, could eventually find ways to unlock iOS 18, iOS 18.1, and subsequent versions. Apple developers are currently testing iOS 18.2, which should be released to everyone before the end of the year. The leaked documents don\u2019t mention this version.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that products like Graykey and Cellebrite need physical access to a device to function \u2014 if they can at all. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll run into in the wild and cannot be done remotely.\n\nUser privacy has always been one of Apple\u2019s core principles. As a result, its products, such as the iPhone and iPad, are protected by strong encryption. The company has consistently resisted government requests to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d for data access.\n\nFor individuals concerned about unauthorized access to their phones, ensuring they have installed the latest software updates is the best course of action. For iPhones, this means updating to iOS 18.1.1; for iPads, the update is iPadOS 18.1.1."
