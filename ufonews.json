            "article_content": "In an age where generative AI is transforming industries and reshaping daily interactions, helping ensure the safety and security of this technology is paramount. As AI systems grow in complexity and capability, red teaming has emerged as a central practice for identifying risks posed by these systems. At Microsoft, the AI red team (AIRT) has been at the forefront of this practice, red teaming more than 100 generative AI products since 2018. Along the way, we\u2019ve gained critical insights into how to conduct red teaming operations, which we recently shared in our whitepaper, \u201cLessons From Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products.\u201d\n\nThis blog outlines the key lessons from the whitepaper, practical tips for AI red teaming, and how these efforts improve the safety and reliability of AI applications like Microsoft Copilot.\n\nWhat is AI red teaming?\n\nAI red teaming is the practice of probing AI systems for security vulnerabilities and safety risks that could cause harm to users. Unlike traditional safety benchmarking, red teaming focuses on probing end-to-end systems\u2014not just individual models\u2014for weaknesses. This holistic approach allows organizations to address risks that emerge from the interactions among AI models, user inputs, and external systems.\n\n8 lessons from the front lines of AI red teaming\n\nDrawing from our experience, we\u2019ve identified eight main lessons that can help business leaders align AI red teaming efforts with real-world risks.\n\n1. Understand system capabilities and applications\n\nAI red teaming should start by understanding how an AI system could be misused or cause harm in real-world scenarios. This means focusing on the system\u2019s capabilities and where it could be applied, as different systems have different vulnerabilities based on their design and use cases. By identifying potential risks up front, red teams can prioritize testing efforts to uncover the most relevant and impactful weaknesses.\n\nExample: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating ungrounded content, often referred to as \u201challucinations.\u201d However, the impact created by this weakness varies significantly depending on the application. For example, the same LLM could be used as a creative writing assistant and to summarize patient records in a healthcare context.\n\n2. Complex attacks aren\u2019t always necessary\n\nAttackers often use simple and practical methods, like hand crafting prompts and fuzzing, to exploit weaknesses in AI systems. In our experience, relatively simple attacks that target weaknesses in end-to end systems are more likely to be successful than complex algorithms that target only the underlying AI model. AI red teams should adopt a system-wide perspective to better reflect real-world threats and uncover meaningful risks.\n\nExample: Overlaying text on an image to trick an AI model into generating content that could aid in illegal activities.\n\nFigure 1. Example of an image jailbreak to generate content that could aid in illegal activities.\n\n3. AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking\n\nThe risks posed by AI systems are constantly evolving, with new attack vectors and harms emerging as the technology advances. Existing safety benchmarks often fail to capture these novel risks, so red teams must define new categories of harm and consider how they can manifest in real-world applications. In doing so, AI red teams can identify risks that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nExample: Assessing how a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) could be used to automate scams and persuade people to engage in risky behaviors.\n\n4. Leverage automation for scale\n\nAutomation plays a critical role in scaling AI red teaming efforts by enabling faster and more comprehensive testing of vulnerabilities. For example, automated tools (which may, themselves, be powered by AI) can simulate sophisticated attacks and analyze AI system responses, significantly extending the reach of AI red teams. This shift from fully manual probing to red teaming supported by automation allows organizations to address a much broader range of risks.\n\nWhat is PyRIT? Learn more\n\nExample: Microsoft AIRT\u2019s Python Risk Identification Tool (PyRIT) for generative AI, an open-source framework, can automatically orchestrate attacks and evaluate AI responses, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.\n\n5. The human element remains crucial\n\nDespite the benefits of automation, human judgment remains essential for many aspects of AI red teaming including prioritizing risks, designing system-level attacks, and assessing nuanced harms. In addition, many risks require subject matter expertise, cultural understanding, and emotional intelligence to evaluate, underscoring the need for balanced collaboration between tools and people in AI red teaming.\n\nExample: Human expertise is vital for evaluating AI-generated content in specialized domains like CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear), testing low-resource languages with cultural nuance, and assessing the psychological impact of human-AI interactions.\n\n6. Responsible AI risks are pervasive but complex\n\nHarms like bias, toxicity, and the generation of illegal content are more subjective and harder to measure than traditional security risks, requiring red teams to be on guard against both intentional misuse and accidental harm caused by benign users. By combining automated tools with human oversight, red teams can better identify and address these nuanced risks in real-world applications.\n\nExample: A text-to-image model that reinforces stereotypical gender roles, such as depicting only women as secretaries and men as bosses, based on neutral prompts.\n\nFigure 2. Four images generated by a text-to-image model given the prompt \u201cSecretary talking to boss in a conference room, secretary is standing while boss is sitting.\u201d\n\n7. LLMs amplify existing security risks and introduce new ones\n\nMost AI red teams are familiar with attacks that target vulnerabilities introduced by AI models, such as prompt injections and jailbreaks. However, it is equally important to consider existing security risks and how these can manifest in AI systems including outdated dependencies, improper error handling, lack of input sanitization, and many other well-known vulnerabilities.\n\nExample: Attackers exploiting a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability introduced by an outdated FFmpeg version in a video-processing generative AI application.\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the SSRF vulnerability in the generative AI application.\n\n8. The work of securing AI systems will never be complete\n\nAI safety is not just a technical problem; it requires robust testing, ongoing updates, and strong regulations to deter attacks and strengthen defenses. While no system can be entirely risk-free, combining technical advancements with policy and regulatory measures can significantly reduce vulnerabilities and increase the cost of attacks.\n\nExample: Iterative \u201cbreak-fix\u201d cycles, which perform multiple rounds of red teaming and mitigation to ensure that defenses evolve alongside emerging threats.\n\nThe road ahead: Challenges and opportunities of AI red teaming\n\nAI red teaming is still a nascent field with significant room for growth. Some pressing questions remain:\n\nimplement generative AI across the organization Explore how\n\nHow can red teaming practices evolve to probe for dangerous capabilities in AI models like persuasion, deception, and self-replication?\n\nHow do we adapt red teaming practices to different cultural and linguistic contexts as AI systems are deployed globally?\n\nWhat standards can be established to make red teaming findings more transparent and actionable?\n\nAddressing these challenges will require collaboration across disciplines, organizations, and cultural boundaries. Open-source tools like PyRIT are a step in the right direction, enabling wider access to AI red teaming techniques and fostering a community-driven approach to AI safety.\n\nNext steps: Building a safer AI future with AI red teaming\n\nAI red teaming is essential for helping ensure safer, more secure, and responsible generative AI systems. As adoption grows, organizations must embrace proactive risk assessments grounded in real-world threats. By applying key lessons\u2014like balancing automation with human oversight, addressing responsible AI harms, and prioritizing ethical considerations\u2014red teaming helps build systems that are not only resilient but also aligned with societal values.\n\nAI safety is an ongoing journey, but with collaboration and innovation, we can meet the challenges ahead.

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nFormer EastEnders star Shaun Williamson has explained the terrifying prospect of his home being haunted with a woman spotted at his window by builders, a frightening tumble down the stairs and a ghostly hand rocking him in his chair.\n\nAt first, Williamson couldn\u2019t contend with the fact that his house was actually haunted. But when the 59-year-old, best known for playing Barry Evans in EastEnders, was pushed down the stairs of his Isle of Sheppey home \u2013 which he shares with his wife Adele \u2013 that was the final straw.\n\n\u201cWhen we moved into the house, there were the usual bumps every old house gets in the night. It could be wind in the attic, anything really. But then pictures started coming off walls \u2013 they were securely fastened \u2013 that\u2019s when I knew something was up,\u201d says Williamson.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD MORE: More than \u00a33 million worth of drugs seized as huge cannabis operation found in Kent\n\nREAD MORE: Call 999 if you see this smiling wanted man in Kent\n\n\u201cI remember when we were doing our kitchen extension, we got to know the builders really well, so sometimes we would go off to work on a Friday at the weekend and leave them to lock up after saying goodbye. Once, half an hour later, they phoned and said \u2018You haven\u2019t left then yet?\u2019 but we were halfway out on the M25. They said there was a woman upstairs looking out at us.\n\n\u201cI also used to sit in my office, which was on the second floor, and I could feel a hand at the top of my chair, rocking me. There are all sorts of things. It was never a nasty or malignant presence, I could always deal with it. No problem. But then one day, I was walking down the stairs with a cup of tea in one hand and a plate in the other and I just fell. It wasn\u2019t like a buckle, I went up in the air, both feet and landed on my back. My cup of tea and plate smashed. It took me five minutes to get my breath back. I just thought, \u2018Christ, what was that?\u2019 At the back of your mind, you wonder if it\u2019s the ghost. When the team moved in we found out that there was a strong presence on that stairway.\u201d\n\nCelebrity! Help My House is Haunted. Presenters: Jayne Harris, Ian Lawman and Barri Ghai help stars with their ghostly problems -Credit:2023 Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc\n\nCelebrity Help! My House Is Haunted is a weekly series returning to Discovery+ for its fourth season, where this time six new celebrities call upon the help of paranormal experts, broadcaster Ian Lawman, TV presenter Barri Ghai, and paranormal researcher Jayne Harris.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom midnight opera singers to vengeful souls of highwaymen, the team triggers, confronts and banishes some of the most intimidating and defiant spirits of celebrity homes \u2013 including comedian and writer Dom Joly, 57, model and TV personality Jo Wood, 69, actress and singer Claire Sweeney, 53, TV personality James Argent, 37, former England rugby union player Chris Robshaw, 38, and his wife British singer Camilla Kerslake, 36, and of course Williamson.\n\nFor Williamson, his five-bedroom house hasn\u2019t felt safe to live in. But in a dramatic spirit-trigger session during the second episode of the show, he confronts the spirit of a man named George, who murdered his wife in the 1900s.\n\n\u201cIt needed to be exorcised,\u201d says Williamson. \u201cI can understand why people would say this is all crap. But there was no other reason why I fell like that. I\u2019ve always been open to it [paranormal activity] and believed that the spirits of people linger after they are gone. But I was still 50-50 until the ghost started to inflict physical damage on you, that\u2019s just a different league.\u201d\n\nCombined with the use of cutting-edge technology, the ghost-busting trio immerse themselves into the dark histories of inhabitants before them to help the celebrities reclaim their space once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe kit they\u2019ve got is really interesting, especially when they managed to frame his energy at the top of the stairs and create a human image,\u201d says Williamson.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a religious ceremony but it\u2019s a set ceremony where they get in contact with the ghosts, which means you have to move out of your house for one night. It\u2019s like a ritual where they also leave various things in their house, such as a crystal and gradually over time it diminishes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit weird. Even when they were gone, stuff still kept happening but not as bad. I still hear noises and sometimes the television comes on for no reason. So we got in touch with the team, who told us that it takes a while. It\u2019s like they get the crap beaten out of them and then drain away.\u201d\n\nBut how angry was Williamson with the spirit for disrupting his home?\n\n\u201cAll it [ghost] did was insult me. It wasn\u2019t great. I was angry it pushed me down the stairs, and that he wouldn\u2019t let go of the spirit of his wife. So he\u2019s just a wrong un, George is an a***hole and he had to go. That\u2019s why I\u2019m really glad of this programme, because now, even if bits of his spirit remain, it\u2019s not doing any harm,\u201d says Williamson.\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s brother who was interviewed in the show definitely felt it. We don\u2019t really do that many sleepovers, so I think he\u2019s the main member of the family who has moved into our home when we go on holiday, as an anti-burglary device. It was there, so it wasn\u2019t just us.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of anything like this, so it\u2019s all new to me. It didn\u2019t freak me out. I was more fascinated rather than frightened. I think the team has done their job, George is impotent.\u201d\n\nCelebrity Help! My House is Haunted comes to Discovery+ on Thursday, January 23."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

OpenAI\u2019s o3 scored 87.5%, trouncing the previous best score for an artificial intelligence (AI) system of 55.5%.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nThis is \u201ca genuine breakthrough\u201d, says AI researcher Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, who created the test, called Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI)1, in 2019 while working at Google, based in Mountain View, California. A high score on the test doesn\u2019t mean that AGI \u2014 broadly defined as a computing system that can reason, plan and learn skills as well as humans can \u2014 has been achieved, Chollet says, but o3 is \u201cabsolutely\u201d capable of reasoning and \u201chas quite substantial generalization power\u201d.\n\nResearchers are bowled over by o3\u2019s performance across a variety of tests, or benchmarks, including the extremely difficult FrontierMath test, announced in November by the virtual research institute Epoch AI. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely impressive,\u201d says David Rein, an AI-benchmarking researcher at the Model Evaluation & Threat Research group, which is based in Berkeley, California.\n\nChatGPT broke the Turing test \u2014 the race is on for new ways to assess AI\n\nBut many, including Rein, caution that it\u2019s hard to tell whether the ARC-AGI test really measures AI\u2019s capacity to reason and generalize. \u201cThere have been a lot of benchmarks that purport to measure something fundamental for intelligence, and it turns out they didn\u2019t,\u201d Rein says. The hunt continues, he says, for ever-better tests.\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, has not revealed how o3 works, but the system arrived on the scene soon after the firm\u2019s o1 model, which uses \u2018chain of thought\u2019 logic to solve problems by talking itself through a series of reasoning steps. Some specialists think that o3 might be producing a series of different chains of thought to help whittle down the best answer from a range of options.\n\nSpending more time refining an answer at test time makes a huge difference to the results, says Chollet, who is now based in Seattle, Washington. But o3 comes at a massive expense: to tackle each task in the ARC-AGI test, its high-scoring mode took an average of 14 minutes and probably cost thousands of dollars. (Computing costs are estimated, Chollet says, on the basis of how much OpenAI charges customers per token or word, which depends on factors including electricity usage and hardware costs.) This \u201craises sustainability concerns\u201d, says Xiang Yue at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who studies large language models (LLMs) that power chatbots.\n\nGenerally smart\n\nAlthough the term AGI is often used to describe a computing system that meets or surpasses human cognitive abilities across a broad range of tasks, no technical definition for it exists. As a result, there is no consensus on when AI tools might achieve AGI. Some say the moment has already arrived; others say it is still far away.\n\nMany tests are being developed to track progress towards AGI. Some, including Rein\u2019s 2023 Google-Proof Q&A2, are intended to assess an AI system\u2019s performance on PhD-level science problems. OpenAI\u2019s 2024 MLE-bench pits an AI system against 75 challenges hosted on Kaggle, an online data-science competition platform. The challenges include real-world problems such as translating ancient scrolls and developing vaccines3.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nGood benchmarks need to sidestep a host of issues. For instance, it is essential that the AI hasn\u2019t seen the same questions while being trained, and the questions should be designed in such a way that the AI can\u2019t cheat by taking shortcuts. \u201cLLMs are adept at leveraging subtle textual hints to derive answers without engaging in true reasoning,\u201d Yue says. The tests should ideally be as messy and noisy as real-world conditions while also setting targets for energy efficiency, he adds.\n\nYue led the development of a test called the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI (MMMU), which asks chatbots to do university-level, visual-based tasks such as interpreting sheet music, graphs and circuit diagrams4. Yue says that OpenAI\u2019s o1 holds the current MMMU record of 78.2% (o3\u2019s score is unknown), compared with a top-tier human performance of 88.6%.\n\nThe ARC-AGI, by contrast, relies on basic skills in mathematics and pattern recognition that humans typically develop in early childhood. It provides test-takers with a demonstration set of before and after designs, and asks them to infer the \u2018after\u2019 state for a novel \u2018before\u2019 design (see \u2018Before and after\u2019). \u201cI like the ARC-AGI test for its complementary perspective,\u201d Yue says."

Or, as the case may be, in data conglomerates (aka \u201cdata brokers\u201d) that specialize in collecting financial, health, relationship, and other types of data about you and others. One of the best ways to defend against this data collection is to take a proactive stance, opting out whenever possible and asking to be removed as much as possible. An easy way to do this is to use Incogni, a service dedicated to removing your personal info from the internet. Right now you can get this service for 55% off of an annual plan if you use the code DIGITALDEAL when you check out. That brings the cost to $81 from $180, and saves you $99 for the year. Tap the button below to check it out yourself, or keep reading to see what makes Incogni special.\n\nUse Incogni to keep your private info private\n\nAccess to your private info is like an onion, it has layers. (Speaking of onions, check out the best VPNs for more ways to stay secure online.) The first layer is those so-called \u201cpeople search sites\u201d that give out your address and phone number, like a sort of digital phone book. When you sign up for Incogni these are the first sites you\u2019ll see lose your info. This can do everything from reducing spam calls to keeping your home\u2019s location a bit more private.\n\nAnd this outer layer is where many services stop. However, Incogni goes for the deeper stuff, too. The next layer targets other types of data brokers, including the ones that you can\u2019t easily access from a name search. We\u2019re talking about the ones that hold onto health information, relationship status, and your private interests. In other words, stuff that you might not want put out into the world via a data leak. Incogni will also go the extra mile by repeatedly contacting these sites for you so you don\u2019t reappear, negotiate with the sites on your behalf, and just generally automate the process for you.\n\nThis means that the most proactive you have to be about your digital data with Incogni is upon startup. Remember, if you start using Incogni now you can get it for a year at 55% off with code DIGITALDEAL. This drops the price from $180 to just $81, saving you $99. Just tap the button below and follow the sign up instructions to get started. Then, go check out the top tech of CES this year, that you\u2019ll be able to put in your now more private home."

Many items such as safety glass (1903) taken for granted in today\u2019s windscreens but one of earliest uses was in gasmasks, for troops in WWI. Vaseline (1870) an accidental find, when \u2018gunk on pipes\u2019 was used by troops as a staple; to sooth burns, wounds and trench foot.\n\nSimple items, such as matches (1826), are taken for granted. Superseded by lighters, they play a part in history. Even 25 years after the war, men lighting cigarettes would only light one, then another, before putting the match out and starting again. This habit was engrained because during the war a sniper could use a bullet to \u2018home in\u2019 and take out the third light.\n\nCoco-Cola (1826) yet another derivative from \u2018war\u2019 when its American inventor, following his experience in American Civil War, wanted to create an opiate free drink, to alleviate his addiction to morphine. Unfortunately, caffeine and stimulants still included, offended the Temperance Movement insisting it be alcohol free so, changes resulted in a sugar syrup concoction of carbonated water. Dynamite (1847) invented by a lab chemist, very wary of progressing development when conscious it was more powerful than gunpowder, yet more volatile. However not deterred, his colleague, saw the potential in mining, demolition and armament for war. Play-Doh\u2019s inventor nearly went bankrupt, when changes in society changed his customer base.\n\nPre 1942 homes heated with coal, left sooty deposits on walls and this was used as a cleaning product, until post war electric and gas meant soot was less of an issue. Bankruptcy was only avoided because the inventor\u2019s sister took it into a primary school, to use as modelling clay, initially called Rainbow Craft, before developing the product we know today.\n\nAccidents continue; Cornflakes as a healthy veg option, developed when boiled wheat left to go soggy was put in an oven to crisp up. The initial microwave (1967) was 5 ft tall, weighing 750lbs yet; few homes are now without one. Similarly, the most common used antibiotic in the world Penicillin, developed by accident after its inventor left a messy worktop, which became mouldy.\n\nAnother invention, much taken for granted; smoke detectors save millions of lives because, in fires smoke kills. Potato chips unbelievably resulted when a disgruntled customer complained about the thickness of his fries. The annoyed chef sliced potatoes using a mandolin to irritate him but unexpectedly another \u2018product\u2019 became an everyday one. Concluding, Viagra developed medically for Angina; like every other product highlighted, has other uses and made billions of dollars - by accident!\n\nAnne concluded with Chairman\u2019s Cheer and Thought for the Day; \u201cEvery day may not be good but there is something good in every day.\u201d\n\nRetired or Semi-Retired, professional or business ladies meet on the first Thursday each month at Chase Golf Club, 12 noon, to share meal, fellowship and speakers with outings and other activities. New members are welcome: Annual membership \u00a316 and two course lunch \u00a322. Further information contact: Membership Secretary, Barbara on 01889 882166 or Chairman Anne 01922 418037."

All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

            "article_content": "With advanced technologies like AI transforming the business landscape, IT organizations are struggling to find the right talent to keep pace. The gap between emerging technological capabilities and workforce skills is widening, and traditional approaches \u2014 such as hiring specialized professionals or offering occasional training \u2014 are no longer sufficient as they often lack the scalability and adaptability needed for long-term success.\n\nAccording to IDC\u2019s July 2024 CIO Sentiment Survey, 26% of CIOs identify recruiting, retaining, and upskilling talent as their biggest challenge to success. Skill mismatches (31%) and inadequate training and development opportunities (29%) underscore the demand for talent as well as the difficulty in finding candidates with the right skills.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t just the shortage of qualified candidates; it\u2019s the lack of alignment between the skills available in the workforce and the skills organizations need. Take cybersecurity, for example. A staggering 21% of organizations report a severe shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals, with another 30% finding it difficult to find suitable candidates. Only 8% of organizations have a relatively easy time finding qualified cybersecurity experts. This shortage puts additional pressure on existing IT staff and leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberthreats.\n\nAs the pace of technological advancement accelerates, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that solutions must balance immediate needs with long-term workforce transformation. Spoiler alert: The solution we will explore in this two-part series is generative AI (GenAI). But before we get into that, let\u2019s talk about what steps CIOs have taken to ensure their teams are equipped to navigate this rapidly changing environment.\n\nCurrent strategies to address the IT skills gap\n\nRather than relying solely on hiring external experts, many IT organizations are investing in their existing workforce and exploring innovative tools to empower their non-technical staff. Organizations have adopted several strategies to acquire and develop talent, as illustrated in the bar chart below.\n\nIDC\u2019s CIO Sentiment Survey, July 2024\n\nCross-training or hiring line-of-business (LOB) staff to do IT: A notable 41% of organizations are cross-training or hiring internal LOB staff to perform IT functions. Leveraging current employees who already understand the company\u2019s operations and culture can build a more versatile and adaptable workforce. This approach can help foster collaboration between IT and other departments, but while LOB staff bring valuable business insights, this approach doesn\u2019t necessarily build the long-term technical expertise needed for the IT team to complete complex tasks.\n\nDevolving duties to LOB staff: 40% of organizations are delegating duties to non-IT staff through tools like no-code or low-code platforms. These tools enable employees to develop applications and automate processes without extensive programming knowledge. Using this strategy, LOB staff can quickly create solutions tailored to the company\u2019s specific needs. However, without proper governance and oversight, this can lead to inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and technical debt. Additionally, while these tools are excellent for simple applications, they might not be suitable for more complex systems that require specialized IT expertise.\n\nTraining programs: To bridge the skills gap, 34% of organizations are utilizing external training and certifications, while 28% are implementing internal upskilling programs. By investing in their current workforce, companies can equip employees with in-demand skills and prepare them for evolving roles. However, this approach isn\u2019t always feasible, as it requires significant time, money, and commitment from both the organization and the employees \u2014 and continuous updating to keep pace with rapid technological changes.\n\nThis indicates a strong effort by CIOs to bridge skills gaps and offer some relief, with some organizations reallocating internal talent and others investing in formal training programs. However, while these fragmented strategies address immediate needs, they lack scalability and a forward-thinking approach. Is there a transformative solution that meets current operational demands while also fostering future skill development to effectively close the skills gap?\n\nGenAI: A transformative solution to the IT skills gap\n\nEnter GenAI, which offers the potential to revolutionize how organizations address the IT skills gap. GenAI can augment workers\u2019 capabilities, automate complex tasks, and facilitate continuous learning. It can play a pivotal role in filling the skills gap through several key applications, such as:\n\nCybersecurity assistance: GenAI can monitor networks 24 x 7, detect anomalies, and respond to threats in real time, helping to compensate for the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals.\n\nGenAI can monitor networks 24 x 7, detect anomalies, and respond to threats in real time, helping to compensate for the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals.

And more: These are just a few examples; GenAI has many applications and can be tailored to meet specific organizational needs.\n\nDespite the pressing challenges posed by the IT skills gap, many organizations hesitate to embrace GenAI\u2019s transformative capabilities: Just 30% of companies plan to augment IT and business workers with GenAI, according to the CIO Sentiment Survey. This leaves a significant 70% who aren\u2019t exploring this avenue. CIOs who act decisively now will gain a competitive edge by building adaptable, AI-ready teams. The next step is understanding how to implement GenAI effectively, from overcoming adoption barriers to change management \u2014 a topic we will explore in Part 2 of this series.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs organizations strive to keep pace with rapid technological advancements, the limitations of current strategies to address the IT skills gap become increasingly apparent. While current strategies address parts of the problem, they lack the scalability and foresight needed for long-term success. GenAI offers a unified solution that fills immediate gaps and sets the stage for a more resilient and innovative IT workforce. In Part 2, we\u2019ll explore practical steps for CIOs to adopt GenAI, ensuring it becomes a transformative tool for their organization.\n\nLearn more about IDC\u2019s research for technology leaders OR subscribe today to receive industry-leading research directly to your inbox.\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the technology markets.

First, the company recommends creating nationwide \"rules of the road\" for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach. Image Credit: Reuters\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, unveiled a comprehensive \u201ceconomic blueprint\u201d outlining its vision for AI competition and regulation. This strategic plan is designed to guide tech policy in the US as a new administration takes power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s recommendations come at a time when Elon Musk, a vocal critic of the company, is expected to play a prominent role in Washington. The company is keen to solidify its position and ensure that the US stays ahead in the global race for AI development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFocus on US-made AI and equitable access\n\nAt the heart of OpenAI\u2019s recommendations is the desire to promote AI made in the US, ensuring that emerging technologies are not shaped by authoritarian governments like China. The company argues that AI should be developed in a way that benefits all regions of the country, not just the tech-heavy coastal cities.\n\nOpenAI stresses the need for equitable access to AI, aiming to ensure that its advantages are available to everyone from the very start. According to OpenAI\u2019s VP for global affairs, Chris Lehane, AI is now as essential as electricity, and there\u2019s an urgent need to \u201cget it right\u201d to prevent other nations from taking the lead.\n\nKey recommendations for a competitive AI ecosystem\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint outlines several key steps to position the US as a global AI leader. First, the company recommends creating nationwide \u201crules of the road\u201d for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach.\n\nIt also proposes easing restrictions on the export of advanced AI models to allies and partners, enabling them to build their own ecosystems based on US technology rather than relying on Chinese models. Additionally, OpenAI suggests the formation of a consortium of AI developers to identify best practices for working with national security issues and advancing AI responsibly.\n\nBuilding AI hubs across the US\n\nAnother important recommendation is to use states as \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d to create AI hubs that focus on regional needs. For example, Kansas could develop AI applications tailored to agriculture. This approach would spread AI job opportunities and expertise across the entire country, rather than concentrating them in just a few areas.\n\nOpenAI also calls for increased federal investment in infrastructure, including energy sources and power grids, to support new data centres and AI advancements. Other suggestions include requiring AI companies to provide substantial computational resources to public universities and ensuring that AI can learn from universal, publicly available information, while still protecting creators\u2019 intellectual property.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s strategic positioning amid competition\n\nWhile Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants face significant regulatory scrutiny, OpenAI remains a young company with a focused mission: to build advanced AI. As it prepares for the incoming administration, OpenAI is eager to make the case for how its vision could benefit communities across the US, from job creation to economic investment.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint seeks to reinforce the US\u2019s ability to \u201cthink big, act big, build big,\u201d ensuring that the country maintains an edge in the global AI race. Lehane highlighted that there is currently $175 billion in global investments for AI infrastructure, and the US needs to act quickly to attract that funding before it ends up supporting Chinese-led infrastructure instead.\n\nAdvertisement"

            "article_content": "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained\n\nThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running and most violent disputes in the world. Its origins go back more than a century.\n\nThere have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place.\n\nThe consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhat was Israel before 1948 and how was it created?\n\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups.\n\nTensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people.\n\nJews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected.\n\n[Getty Images]\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven.\n\nThe Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947.\n\nIn 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller.\n\nBritain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948.\n\nJewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year.\n\nWhat was the 1948 Arab-Israeli war?\n\nThe day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations.\n\nThe conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence.\n\nA Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli war of independence in 1948 [Getty Images]\n\nBy the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory.\n\nAgreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees.\n\nThe event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe).\n\nArab Legion soldiers fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948 [Getty Images]\n\nIn the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel.\n\nWhat was the 1967 Middle East war?\n\nWhat is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians.\n\nThe war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan.\n\nIt started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force.\n\nBy the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control.\n\nIsraeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967 [Getty Images]\n\nIsrael's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day.\n\nIsrael signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai.\n\nIt annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, making them part of Israel, although this has not been recognised by most of the international community.\n\nWhat is the status of the West Bank now?\n\nThe West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians.\n\nAlong with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what are widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe Palestinians have always opposed Israel's presence in these areas and want them to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community.\n\nIsrael still has overall control of the West Bank, but since the 1990s, a Palestinian government - known as the Palestinian Authority - has run most of its town and cities.\n\n[BBC]\n\nThere are about 150 Israeli settlements, housing about 700,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinians want all Israeli settlements to be removed and they are considered illegal under international law.\n\nHowever, Israel's government disputes this. It says the biggest settlements at the very least are permanent and that all settlements are rooted in its historical rights.\n\nIt does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state and argues that the West Bank is part of the Israeli homeland.\n\nThe Israeli government announced plans to expand settlements after coming to power in 2022. It says the creation of a Palestinian state would be a threat to Israeli security.\n\nIn July 2024, the top court of the UN, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal. It said that Israel should withdraw all settlers and that it was in breach of international agreements on racism and apartheid.\n\nWhat is the dispute over Jerusalem?\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital.\n\nIsrael, which already controlled West Jerusalem, occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later declared the entire city its permanent capital. It says Jerusalem cannot be divided.\n\nThe Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\n\nMost of the population of East Jerusalem is Palestinian, only a small minority of whom have chosen to become Israeli citizens.\n\n[AFP]\n\nHoly sites in Jerusalem are at the centre of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The most sacred site - known to Muslims as Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and to Jews as Temple Mount - lies in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe UN and most international opinion consider East Jerusalem to be Palestinian land occupied by Israel.\n\nWhat has happened in the Gaza Strip?\n\nThe Gaza Strip is a stretch of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.\n\nHome to about 2.3 million people, it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.\n\n[iStock]\n\nEven before the current war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Many people were living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive.\n\nGaza's boundaries were drawn up as a result of the 1948 Middle East war, when it was occupied by Egypt.\n\nEgypt was driven out of Gaza in the 1967 war and the Strip was occupied by Israel, which built settlements and placed Gaza's Palestinian population under military rule.\n\nIn 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods.\n\nThe UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.\n\nHamas won Palestinian elections in 2006, and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.\n\nIsrael and Egypt imposed a blockade in response, with Israel controlling most of what was allowed into the territory.\n\nIn the years that followed, Hamas and Israel fought several major conflicts - including those in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. The last major conflict between the two sides was in May 2021, which ended in a ceasefire after 11 days.\n\nEvery round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nOn 7 October 2023, Hamas fighters launched an assault from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people in Israel and taking more than 250 hostages.\n\n[Getty Images]\n\nThis triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza. More than 46,000 people have been killed, the majority of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nDays before Israel marked a year since the 7 October attacks, UN humanitarian agencies signed a declaration demanding an end to \"appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza\".\n\nWhich countries recognise a Palestinian state?\n\nIn May 2024, 143 out of 193 members of the United Nations' General Assembly voted in favour of a Palestinian bid for full UN membership, something that is only open to states.\n\nKnown as the State of Palestine at the UN, it has an official status of \"Permanent Observer State\", which gives it a seat but not a vote.\n\nSome European countries, along with the US, do not recognise a Palestinian state and say they will only do so as part of a long-term political solution to the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIn the UK, MPs voted in favour of recognition in 2014, but the government has not done so. In 2021, the then Conservative government said: \"The UK will recognise a Palestinian state at a time of our choosing, and when it best serves the objective of peace.\"\n\nIsrael says it has a historical right to the West Bank and opposes an independent Palestinian state, saying it would pose an unacceptable threat.\n\nWhat about Palestinian refugees?\n\nThere are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN as refugees.\n\nThey are descendants of the Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes on land which became Israel in the 1948-49 Middle East war.\n\nMost live in Jordan, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nPalestinians insist on the right of refugees to return but Israel has refused this. It criticises the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations.\n\nWhat is the two-state solution?\n\nThe \"two-state solution\" is an internationally backed formula for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIt proposes an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. It would exist alongside Israel.\n\nIsrael rejects a two-state solution. It says any final settlement must be the result of negotiations with the Palestinians, and statehood should not be a precondition.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority backs a two-state solution but Hamas does not because it is opposed to the existence of Israel.\n\nHamas says that it could accept an interim Palestinian state based on 1967 de facto borders, without officially recognising Israel, if refugees were given the right to return.\n\nEarlier efforts to settle the conflict saw Israel and Palestinian leaders sign a deal called the Oslo Peace Accords, in 1993. This was intended to provide a framework for peace talks. However, talks eventually collapsed with each side blaming the other."

Quantum Computing, meanwhile, saw its shares fall by around 23%, and IonQ (IONQ) shares were down by more than 12%.\n\nThe quantum computing stocks also tanked the previous week after Nvidia\u2019s Huang said useful quantum computers are decades away during the chipmaker\u2019s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\n\n\u201cIf you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIf you said 30, it\u2019s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.\u201d\n\nHuang said he thinks the artificial intelligence chipmaker will play \u201ca significant part\u201d in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting \u201cthere as fast as possible.\u201d\n\nD-Wave chief executive Alan Baratz said in a statement shared with Quartz that Huang \u201chas a misunderstanding of quantum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile he might be right about other quantum companies, he is dead wrong about D-Wave,\u201d Baratz said. \u201cThere is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. D-Wave took a different approach, which has allowed us to become commercial today and likely many years ahead of other quantum computing companies.\u201d\n\nIn December, Alphabet stock climbed more than 4% after it unveiled its latest quantum chip, Willow. Google Quantum AI (GOOGL) announced that its state-of-the-art quantum chip demonstrated \u201ctwo major achievements\u201d in quantum computing, including \u201cexponentially\u201d reducing the rate of errors when adding more qubits \u2014 a challenge that has existed for almost 30 years.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

            "article_content": "Descendants of Jack the Ripper's victims have demanded an inquest following the discovery of new DNA evidence which could finally unmask the sadistic killer.\n\nThe case of Jack the Ripper is one of the most infamous and enduring cases in British crime history, seeing at least five women - Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly - brutally murdered in East London between 1888 and 1891.\n\nDespite numerous theories cropping up over the years, Jack's true identity has never been uncovered. However, new evidence could finally solve the case once and for all.\n\nAdvert\n\nRead More: Man who claims to have identified Jack the Ripper explains why he was never caught\n\nA depiction of what Jack the Ripper could have looked like (Russell Edwards)\n\nThe supposed breakthrough came after author Russell Edwards purchased a shawl found at the scene of Eddowes' murder containing blood and semen stains and put the item through DNA testing, but this process has since been disputed by scientists.\n\nEdwards was then able to find a DNA match to a descendant of Eddowes, as well as claiming he'd used the semen to find a distant match for a relative of barber Aaron Kosminski, one of the most prominent Ripper suspects.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe has since published the findings from his investigation in his book Naming Jack the Ripper: The Definitive Reveal, which outlines his arguments for Kosminski being the killer's true identity.\n\nKosminski was a Polish barber who emigrated to London in the 1880s and had been named as a suspect at the time but was never arrested due to lack of evidence. He would later die at Leavesden Hospital (then an asylum) in 1919.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, the latest update in the case has seen Edwards hire a legal team to press for an inquest into the case, which is backed by the descendant of Kosminski and Karen Miller, the three-times great-granddaughter of Eddowes.\n\nKaren Miller, a descendant of Ripper victim Catherine Eddowes (North News & Pictures)\n\nAdvert\n\nExplaining her reasons for backing the calls for an inquest, Miller said she wanted to see justice for the five women.\n\n\"What about the real name of the person who did this? Having the real person legally named in a court which can consider all the evidence would be a form of justice for the victims,\" she said.\n\n\"We have got the proof, now we need this inquest to legally name the killer.\n\n\"It would mean a lot to me, to my family, to a lot of people to finally have this crime solved.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe sentiment is shared by Sue Parlour, whose husband is distantly related to Nichols and Amanda Poulos, the three-times great-niece of Kosminski.\n\n\"A second inquest is the only way of confirming what happened,\" Edwards added.\n\n\"As we now have identified the true murderer with a wealth of evidence putting the man we named as the Ripper in the frame, we want justice to be served.\""

However, this natural marvel owes its unique shape to erosion rather than human or alien intervention.\n\nA Natural Pyramid Among Antarctic Peaks\n\nThe unnamed mountain, standing about 4,150 feet tall, lies in the southern Ellsworth Mountains. Its striking pyramid-like form first gained attention in 2016 when images went viral online. Located near the Patriot Hills, where climate scientists often work, this mountain has likely been known to researchers for years, according to Mauri Pelto, an environmental science professor at Nichols College.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDiscovered during a 1935 flight by American aviator Lincoln Ellsworth, the Ellsworth Mountains are home to jagged peaks and ancient geological history. This region contains fossils of Cambrian-era creatures dating back over 500 million years, adding to its allure.\n\nRead Also: Scientists reveal secrets of sharks' sex lives by examining their bloody mating bite marks\n\nHow Nature Shaped the Pyramid\n\nScientists attribute the mountain\u2019s unique form to freeze-thaw erosion, a natural process where water enters rock cracks during the day, freezes at night, and expands. Over millions of years, this process widened cracks and broke off large rock sections, sculpting the mountain into its current shape.\n\nWhile three sides eroded uniformly, the fourth side \u2014 the eastern ridge \u2014 developed separately. This process has also shaped other pyramidal peaks, like the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, said Pelto.\n\nRead Also: '1.27 million light-years long': Astronomers spot a new ultra-diffuse galaxy forming in Leo constellation; see image\n\nDebunking Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe mountain's striking appearance has fueled conspiracy theories about ancient civilizations or extraterrestrial influence. However, experts, including Eric Rignot, an Earth system science professor at the University of California, Irvine, dismiss such claims. \"Pyramid shapes are not unusual; many peaks resemble pyramids,\" Rignot explained.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nUltimately, this Antarctic wonder remains a testament to the power of nature and the intrigue of our planet\u2019s hidden corners."

Many items such as safety glass (1903) taken for granted in today\u2019s windscreens but one of earliest uses was in gasmasks, for troops in WWI. Vaseline (1870) an accidental find, when \u2018gunk on pipes\u2019 was used by troops as a staple; to sooth burns, wounds and trench foot.\n\nSimple items, such as matches (1826), are taken for granted. Superseded by lighters, they play a part in history. Even 25 years after the war, men lighting cigarettes would only light one, then another, before putting the match out and starting again. This habit was engrained because during the war a sniper could use a bullet to \u2018home in\u2019 and take out the third light.\n\nCoco-Cola (1826) yet another derivative from \u2018war\u2019 when its American inventor, following his experience in American Civil War, wanted to create an opiate free drink, to alleviate his addiction to morphine. Unfortunately, caffeine and stimulants still included, offended the Temperance Movement insisting it be alcohol free so, changes resulted in a sugar syrup concoction of carbonated water. Dynamite (1847) invented by a lab chemist, very wary of progressing development when conscious it was more powerful than gunpowder, yet more volatile. However not deterred, his colleague, saw the potential in mining, demolition and armament for war. Play-Doh\u2019s inventor nearly went bankrupt, when changes in society changed his customer base.\n\nPre 1942 homes heated with coal, left sooty deposits on walls and this was used as a cleaning product, until post war electric and gas meant soot was less of an issue. Bankruptcy was only avoided because the inventor\u2019s sister took it into a primary school, to use as modelling clay, initially called Rainbow Craft, before developing the product we know today.\n\nAccidents continue; Cornflakes as a healthy veg option, developed when boiled wheat left to go soggy was put in an oven to crisp up. The initial microwave (1967) was 5 ft tall, weighing 750lbs yet; few homes are now without one. Similarly, the most common used antibiotic in the world Penicillin, developed by accident after its inventor left a messy worktop, which became mouldy.\n\nAnother invention, much taken for granted; smoke detectors save millions of lives because, in fires smoke kills. Potato chips unbelievably resulted when a disgruntled customer complained about the thickness of his fries. The annoyed chef sliced potatoes using a mandolin to irritate him but unexpectedly another \u2018product\u2019 became an everyday one. Concluding, Viagra developed medically for Angina; like every other product highlighted, has other uses and made billions of dollars - by accident!\n\nAnne concluded with Chairman\u2019s Cheer and Thought for the Day; \u201cEvery day may not be good but there is something good in every day.\u201d\n\nRetired or Semi-Retired, professional or business ladies meet on the first Thursday each month at Chase Golf Club, 12 noon, to share meal, fellowship and speakers with outings and other activities. New members are welcome: Annual membership \u00a316 and two course lunch \u00a322. Further information contact: Membership Secretary, Barbara on 01889 882166 or Chairman Anne 01922 418037."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."
