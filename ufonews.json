        "article_content": "Watch live! Pentagon UFO office testifies to Senate emerging threats committee - YouTube Watch On\n\nA U.S. Senate subcommittee will hear from the Pentagon's UFO office tomorrow, and you can watch live.\n\nDirector Jon T. Kosloski of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, will testify before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities on Tuesday (Nov. 19) starting at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT). A closed-door session off-limits to the public will be held prior to the open session, beginning at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT).\n\nYou can watch the hearing live at Space.com, courtesy of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nAARO's logo in front of the Pentagon. AARO's Latin motto translates roughly as \"the universe is changing/our life is what our thoughts make of it.\" (Image credit: AARO/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Department of Defense created AARO in July 2022 in order to serve as a \"focal point for all UAP and UAP-related activities and may represent the Department for such activities,\" the Pentagon said at the time, in a statement.\n\nAARO has already released its 2024 report, which covers sightings of UFOs (or UAP, as they're now known) between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as \"all UAP reports from any previous time periods that were not included in an earlier report.\"\n\nThe document states that AARO received 757 total case reports during the period, 485 of which fell within the reporting timeframe. Of these cases, 118 were solved and another 174 are slated for closure pending a final review.\n\nStill, many cases remain unsolved, and AARO continues to study them. However, the report notes that \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe office's previous report, released in January 2023, came to similar conclusions.\n\nAARO also concluded in the report that it has \"no indication or confirmation\" that UFO reports are \"attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nAARO's latest findings might not sit well with some in the UFO/UAP community.\n\nThat's because, just last week, a quartet of high-profile witnesses \u2014 including a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, a former NASA associate administrator and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer \u2014 told the U.S. House of Representatives that a wide-ranging and long-running government conspiracy has, for decades, served to \"hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos\" from the American public.\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" one of the witnesses stated during the hearing.\n\nAARO was specifically named as being complicit in the cover-up during this hearing. \"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\""

        "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nTwinMind, founded by former Google X employees, is building an AI assistant to better understand you.\n\nThe founders believe memory is key and something that rival products like OpenAI's ChatGPT lack.\n\nThe startup said it has raised over $2.5 million and was most recently valued at $30 million.\n\nA startup formed by a handful of former Googlers \u2014 specifically Google X, the skunkworks lab that explores sci-fi moonshot ideas \u2014 is coming out of stealth.\n\nNamed TwinMind, its app would function as an AI assistant that lives in your smartphone and always listens. Its founders like to compare it to Jarvis, the AI designed by Marvel's Tony Stark: It's constantly learning what you're doing and talking about and then uses that information to better understand you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwinMind founder and CEO Daniel George said the company raised over $2.5 million this year in two rounds, the latest giving TwinMind a $30 million post-money valuation. Notable investors to date include Oracle's chief AI scientist, Dan Roth; a Rocketship VC founding partner, Anand Rajaraman; and Michael Liou, an early investor in Robinhood and Zapier.\n\nTwinMind is emerging into a competitive market filled with chatbots galore. George told Business Insider he believes the idea of an AI assistant that learns and retains information about users could help set TwinMind apart.\n\nWhile other AI assistants and chatbots, such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are improving at memory, they're still not very good at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you had your own Jarvis, why would you Google? Why would you ask ChatGPT?\" George told BI. \"None of these other tools capture you. None of them understand you. They don't understand what's happening in your life.\"\n\nTwinMind would run in the background of your phone, store audio in the short term, and transcribe it to text, which would go into TwinMind's memory bank. Then, users could open the app and see a readout of their day broken down into key moments.\n\nYou could also ask it questions. Because TwinMind is learning about you, what you've done, and the people you've spent your day with, it aims to pull all that information in, allowing you to talk to TwinMind in a way that feels more natural and without having to add heaps of context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup is also rolling out a web browser extension, which (with permission) could see what users are browsing online and capture it in memory. By integrating calendars and Gmail, users could also ask TwinMind to draft emails. That's something you can already do with other chatbots, of course, but TwinMind's edge here would be drawing on all that memory it holds of the user, George said.\n\n\"You just go in there and, say, write your marketing email. And it knows everything about me, who my cofounders are, what my company is, what we have done before,\" said George. \"Imagine Grammarly, but instead of correcting grammar, it actually writes it based on all the memories and context.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWolverine origins\n\nAt Google X, George was the first machine-learning scientist working on Wolverine, a hearing-wearable project first reported on by Business Insider in 2021. That project has since spun out into a startup named Iyo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, George was working at JPMorgan with TwinMind cofounder and chief technology officer Sunny Tang, a Google X alum.\n\nHe said the two watched as colleagues started using AI chatbots in meetings. The pair hacked together a crude chatbot of their own that could transcribe meetings and answer questions about what was being said. The idea evolved into the startup ThirdEar, but they changed the name to TwinMind because someone else owned the ThirdEar domain name. George said the team also felt the name didn't reflect the visual elements they were building, such as the Chrome extension.\n\nTwinMind does most of its processing locally on the phone but could connect to the cloud if it needed to answer a question or if the user wanted an improved AI experience, George said. TwinMind plans to offer a free app version with a $20-a-month tier for users who want access to more advanced large language models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, it raises some questions about privacy. George said that because TwinMind does not capture images and only transcribes the audio, it falls under the same category of assistants as Siri or Alexa.\n\nPerhaps the more impressive feat here will be on the hardware side.\n\n\"The main innovation is figuring out how to get this thing running all day, in your pocket, without draining your battery, [and with] all the Apple walled garden stuff,\" George said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the team figured it out, and the TwinMind app could run for 12 hours nonstop in the background before running out the battery.\n\nThe team has just opened its seed round, and George said they're looking to raise at least $5 million. The company is also telling potential investors about its future plans, which include making the switch between phone and desktop more seamless so that TwinMind feels more embedded in users' lives.\n\nGeorge said more than 2,000 early testers have already provided feedback, and the team plans to launch the app this week on Product Hunt. It will be available first on the iPhone and as a Chrome extension, with Android and Mac apps to follow next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are sure that in a couple of years, everyone is going to have a personalized AI companion that knows their whole life and has access to all of the world's knowledge on the internet,\" George told BI. \"And that would be the way people access information. Not through Google.\""

        "article_content": "\u2018Advent\u2019 FrightFest Halloween 2024 Review: A Gripping Found Footage Christmas Horror\n\nAfter thrilling viewers with Werewolf Santa at FrightFest last year, writer and director Airell Anthony Hayles returned to FrightFest Halloween 2024 his latest film, Advent. Rasina Alexander stars in the film as Hayley, a paranormal podcaster who becomes obsessed with an object known as a Krampus Calendar, which she believes it holds supernatural powers. Hayley is slowly driven insane as she finds herself being controlled by the sinister calendar, and her friend and co-host Charlie (Cian Lorcan), is unnerved by the dark forces which seem to be manipulating Hayley.\n\nAdvent is presented almost entirely through the perspective of Hayley\u2019s podcast. That means most of the film consists of podcast clips, making this a found footage film of sorts. If you[re tired of found footage films by this point, you\u2019ll no doubt find this frustrating, especially since many sequences were far too dark to even be able to see what was going on. Advent is certainly not a visually impressive film, which will frustrate some viewers.\n\nHowever, the found footage style does mean we\u2019re treated to long, uninterrupted shots of the actors performing. So, at least these shots are worthy of praise. And anyone expecting a gorefest will be sorely disappointed, as the occasional violent sequences are completely bloodless. But with the brisk runtime of just 77 minutes also means that you don\u2019t have too long to be frustrated by the found footage style.\n\nRasina Alexander convincingly depicts Hayley\u2019s downward spiral into madness after discovering the Krampus Calendar, especially as she becomes more unhinged as the film progresses. Hayley is initially presented as a pleasant young woman fascinated by the macabre. But she gradually becomes more withdrawn and solemn, to the point where she even starts to seem like someone experiencing a mental health crisis. Alexander perfectly manages to capture Hayley\u2019s transformation from a curious podcaster into someone who is overwhelmed by a sinister force. Towards the end, Hayley seems like an entirely different person, with Alexander\u2019s performance being one of the highlights of the film.\n\nAt some points, you also have to wonder if the supernatural elements in Advent were indeed real, or if they were simply in Hayley\u2019s imagination. Despite being mentioned regularly, the actual Krampus doesn\u2019t explicitly appear except for in brief illustrations that serve as bridging segments between scenes. This lack of explicitly supernatural elements on-screen leaves you questioning if Hayley really was overwhelmed by a supernatural force, or if she was simply struggling with her mental health. It\u2019s up to the viewer to work this out.\n\nCian Lorcan is also impressive as Charlie, Hayley\u2019s socially awkward friend with no real interest in the paranormal. But he still appears on her podcast because he presumably has no other friends. Charlie is clearly unnerved by the effect the calendar has on Hayley while also doubting its supernatural origins. Lorcan captures both the skeptical and concerned aspects of Charlie\u2019s personality in a way which helped to make the character seem like a worthwhile friend to have. Especially since Charlie refuses to leave Hayley\u2019s side as her state continues to worsen.\n\nIt goes without saying that Nicholas Vince completely stole the show as Richard Hill, a professor of the paranormal. Horror fans know that Vince played the Chatterer Cenobite in the first two Hellraiser films, and he delivers a spectacular performance as a charismatic academic in Advent. Delivering his lines with an abundance of flair and vigor, Vince completely draws viewers in as he recounts the tale of Hayley and the history behind the Krampus Calendar.\n\nHill\u2019s unyielding passion for the paranormal is present in almost every line he delivered, and his fascination seems to border on the realm of obsession at times. Clearly relishing his character\u2019s love for that which cannot be explained, Vince makes Hill an oddly compelling story narrator. The actor\u2019s performance is so engaging that you completely forget that almost all of his scenes were shot in a single location from one angle. Instead of relying on fancy camera tricks, Hayles simply allows Vince to act to the best of his abilities.\n\nCory Peterson also delivers a strong performance as Joe, Hayley\u2019s perpetually drunk father, and Teen Wolf star Mark Arnold makes a memorable appearance as the original owner of the Krampus Calendar. The actors involved all played their roles to the best of their abilities, helping to elevate Advent beyond its crude visual presentation.\n\nAlthough it will certainly not earn any awards for its cinematography, the central performances in Advent will keep viewers captivated until the end credits roll. If you\u2019re fine with watching something which presents itself as a vlog instead of utilizing a more traditional cinematic approach, then Advent will prove to be satisfying for what it is."

        "source": "Her Campus",
        "article_content": "This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at UC Irvine chapter.\n\nSpooky season is over, but this conversation is just beginning. Why is it that movies like the Smile series, overdone with graphic gore scenes and predictable jump scares, just don\u2019t invoke the same fear as films more simply recorded on a mobile device? Allow me to explain.\n\n1) I don\u2019t relate to you.\n\nOutrageous plot lines, such as the drug-ridden pop-star protagonist in Smile 2, force the viewer to deviate from the narrative. In stark contrast, the six main characters featured in the Skype-call-turned-scary movie Unfriended, encounter issues regarding bullying, suicide, social hierarchy, and infidelity. Despite the running time of Smile 2 dwarfing that of Unfriended, I learned and empathized more with each of the six characters than I did with the one.\n\n2) What else is coming?\n\nOnce you see it, you can\u2019t unsee it. Something or someone in the corner\u2014it was probably just nothing. Or was it? We mustn\u2019t underestimate the value of gradual jump scares, discrete to disastrous. No franchise executes this concept better than Paranormal Activity. With an almost voyeuristic quality, the discrete introduction of jump scares excels at keeping momentum and engineering the fright to feel like it is happening right next to the viewer. This creeping terror, amplified by the homemade style of mobile-recording footage, keeps the viewer on edge, not knowing exactly when or where the next scare will come, dreading this continuous and uncomfortable experience. What begins as a minor inconvenience, a lamp knocked over, a dog barking too loud, quickly snowballs into your worst nightmare: chandelier collapses on the floor, total demonic possession, and more!\n\nThis kind of unpredictable jump-scare will forever surpass the jarring rather than genuinely unsettling attempt of films like the Smile series. Designed to deliver an adrenaline rush, the coupled abruptness forces me to undermine the build-up of suspense. It feels more mechanical and about delivering a reaction than creating a lingering sense of dread.\n\n3) We\u2019re all just one big happy family!\n\nThere\u2019s one subconscious thing we don\u2019t notice, but it completely alters how we absorb that 90-minute fear fest. That thing is the focus on a small, consistent group of characters\u2014typically a couple or a family\u2014creating intimacy and isolation. Best executed in the Paranormal Activity franchise, this intensifies the horror because, unlike in films with rotating characters, the viewer can\u2019t escape the anxiety or unease growing in the house or apartment. Stakes skyrocket because the emotional bond with the characters grows over time; we feel their distress as if we\u2019re a part of their big happy family. Viewers don\u2019t just see a sequence of scary events\u2014they live through the psychological unraveling of the family, making it more personal.\n\nConversely, Smile shifts the focus to new characters and various settings more frequently, diluting the emotional investment. Constantly introducing new faces makes it harder for the viewer to form that lasting emotional connection. Because these characters are fleeting, the sense of isolation and shared experience with them isn\u2019t as strong. You\u2019re often left with a sense that you\u2019re simply passing through the lives of the people being targeted, rather than witnessing a gradual unraveling of their lives. As a result, the horror feels less intimate and more external\u2014it\u2019s a spectacle, but one that we\u2019re not truly living through alongside the characters.\n\nAbove all, there is a definite need for an increased release of films with a structure similar to Unfriended and Paranormal Activity. I demand more of this raw, unpolished feel, and this authenticity that comes with it. The shakiness, the low-quality visuals, and the sense of witnessing something secret resonates so deeply today that the line between reality and fiction continues to blur. The least you could do is take a look and tap into the unknown and the unexplainable."

Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and the late Harold Ramis starred as Manhattan-based paranormal investigators in the 1984 action-horror comedy movie.\n\nThey came back for Ghostbusters II in 1989, and they delighted fans in the 2021 reboot, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, where Aykroyd, Murray and Hudson reunited to honor their friend Harold Ramis. They came back once again this year for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and though it was a welcome return, it could be the last time they return.\n\nAykroyd was asked by the New York Post, while promoting his History Channel series The UnBelievable With Dan Aykroyd, if he saw himself returning to Ghostbusters films in the future. He responded:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that coming. I don\u2019t see where they would need us to carry it on. They\u2019ve got a whole new cast, and they\u2019ve got whole new ideas.\u201d\n\nThe latest installments in the franchise took place in Oklahoma and New York City, and they starred Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace and Carrie Coon.\n\nAykroyd went on to say about the franchise\u2019s direction, \u201cI think probably they\u2019re going to move on to advancing it beyond the originals, which they should.\u201d\n\nWhile Frozen Empire wasn\u2019t a strong critical nor commercial hit, director Gil Kenan expressed plans for additional films alongside writer-producer Jason Reitman, though nothing concrete has been announced.\n\nvia: Deadline"

Lead researcher Mengyuan Xiao believes that this discovery could significantly reshape our understanding of how the early universe developed, particularly in its first few hundred million years.\n\nJWST sheds new light on galaxy evolution with red monsters challenging traditional models\n\nRole of JWST in cosmic discovery\n\nNew insights to the early universe\n\nAlso Read |\n\nIn an astonishing new revelation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered the existence of three enormous \"red monster\" galaxies, each with a mass approximately 100 billion times that of our Sun. These galaxies, which formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, are forcing astronomers to rethink everything they know about early galaxy formation and cosmic evolution.The newly discovered galaxies are truly ancient, over 12.8 billion years old, dating back to a time when the universe was only 1 billion years old. This period, known as the \"cosmic dawn,\" marks the early stages of galaxy formation and the first generations of stars.These massive galaxies challenge the current models of how galaxies should form in the early universe. According to the prevailing theories, galaxies should take much longer to grow to such enormous sizes, with star formation occurring at a more gradual pace. But the \"red monsters\" defy these predictions, suggesting that our understanding of galactic evolution might be fundamentally flawed.The three galaxies discovered by JWST are not only massive but also exhibit some highly unusual properties. The term \"red monsters\" refers to their distinctive red glow, which is visible in the infrared spectrum captured by JWST\u2019s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). This red glow occurs because the galaxies are so distant that their light has been stretched (or \"redshifted\") due to the expansion of the universe. This stretching causes the light from these galaxies to shift into the infrared part of the spectrum.The red colour of these galaxies is also indicative of their age and the nature of their star formation. In the early universe, cosmic dust was far more abundant, which often obscured the light from forming stars. The JWST\u2019s ability to peer through this dust and capture the infrared light offers us an unprecedented view of galaxies that existed when the universe was still in its infancy.One of the most surprising aspects of these \"red monster\" galaxies is the sheer speed and efficiency with which they formed stars. Around 80% of their gas has been converted into stars\u2014a rate of star formation that vastly exceeds that of typical galaxies today, which convert only about 20% of their gas into stellar matter.This high conversion rate implies that these early galaxies were extraordinarily efficient star factories. They appear to have bypassed some of the natural limits on star formation that we currently understand. Normally, factors like gas availability, temperature, and the dynamics of interstellar matter constrain how quickly stars can form in a galaxy. But these galaxies, known for their dense and rapid star formation, seem to have shattered those limitations.Stijn Wuyts, an astronomer at the University of Bath, described these galaxies as a \"tantalising puzzle.\" Their rapid formation challenges the conventional wisdom about the time and conditions required for such massive growth. These findings suggest that there might be unknown factors at play in early galaxy evolution that we have yet to discover.At the core of this discovery is the question: how did these galaxies form so quickly and grow to such massive sizes in the early universe? These \"red monster\" galaxies, formed within just one billion years of the Big Bang, provide a stark contrast to the more gradual process of galaxy formation that was previously believed to be the norm.This rapid growth raises several important implications for our understanding of the universe's infancy:The discovery of these galaxies is part of a larger trend where JWST is revealing previously unknown aspects of the early universe. By studying galaxies that formed just after the Big Bang, astronomers hope to piece together a clearer picture of how galaxies evolved over time.The red monsters\u2019 rapid growth and massive size offer a unique opportunity to explore how the first galaxies might have differed from those in later cosmic epochs. Theories on galaxy formation must now account for the possibility of faster-than-expected growth, which could change the way scientists approach everything from star formation rates to the conditions of the early universe.JWST is providing astronomers with an unparalleled tool to study the deep universe. Its advanced infrared capabilities are able to detect light from the earliest galaxies, offering a view into a time when the universe was still in its infancy. This unprecedented observational power allows scientists to study cosmic phenomena that were previously unreachable, opening up new frontiers in astrophysics.As Wuyts puts it, \"JWST is launching a new era of cosmic exploration.\" The telescope\u2019s ability to peer into the farthest reaches of space\u2014and time\u2014has already led to a revolution in our understanding of the universe\u2019s early stages. The discovery of the \"red monster\" galaxies is just the beginning, and astronomers are eager to learn more about the mysteries these galaxies hold.With these discoveries, the next phase of investigation will involve deeper studies into the structure and formation of these galaxies. JWST, in combination with other instruments like the ALMA telescope in Chile, will continue to probe these galaxies, focusing on their internal dynamics and the processes that allowed them to grow so quickly.The findings from the James Webb Space Telescope are not just about discovering distant galaxies\u2014they are changing the very way we think about the universe. As astronomers continue to analyse these discoveries, they may unlock new insights into the nature of the early universe, the formation of galaxies, and the processes that shaped the cosmos as we know it.These \"red monster\" galaxies are forcing astronomers to rewrite the rules of cosmic evolution, and JWST is at the forefront of this exciting new chapter in the story of the universe."

While the Siberian region has given us many ice age mummies, including woolly rhinos and mammoths, mummified sabre-toothed cats are extremely rare. Prior to this find, only two other cat mummies, both cave lion cubs, were known.\n\nThe cub was discovered in 2020 by Yakutian diggers searching for mammoth tusks near the Badyarikha River in Siberia. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the cub lived at least 35,000 years ago, during the later part of the Pleistocene epoch. Paleontologists are now focused on extracting DNA from the mummy to learn even more about this species.\n\nPaleontologist Jack Tseng, who was not involved in the discovery, was left \"at a loss for words\" by the find. The discovery of soft tissue from this ancient lineage is incredibly rare, and Tseng believes this could change our understanding of prehistoric life. With detailed studies of the mummy's skeleton, muscles, and fur on the horizon, scientists are eager to uncover more secrets of this ancient predator."

        "article_content": "As college tuition increases and the student loan debt crisis continues, three former executives from language learning app Duolingo are building a new startup aimed at making college education more affordable and accessible.\n\nThe company, tentatively named Outsmart Education (the name is not final yet), is headed by co-founders Daniel Falabella (CPO), former senior director of product for learning at Duolingo; Gina Gotthilf (CMO), former vice president of growth and marketing at Duolingo; and Jorge Mazal (CEO), ex-chief product officer at Duolingo.\n\nOutsmart announced its $13 million seed funding round on Monday, led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Karman Ventures, Latitud Ventures, and Lightspeed Ventures, as well as angel investors, including Lenny Ratchinsky (ex-product lead at Airbnb) and 20Growth, among others. The capital will be used for hiring and product development.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe idea for Outsmart came out of Mazal\u2019s own frustration with the current system, he says. When Mazal moved to the U.S. to pursue his undergraduate degree, he didn\u2019t have the resources to pay for it and had to find a way to finance his education through a combination of jobs, scholarships, and other means. When he went on to complete two master's programs at Harvard and Wharton, he didn\u2019t realize how much debt he would end up with.\n\n\u201cI was like a quarter million dollars in debt,\u201d Mazal told TechCrunch. \u201cI had to take a part-time job where I was picking up trash in my apartment complex every morning just to make ends meet, and, to me, that was just so representative of what's broken in higher ed.\u201d\n\n(L-R) Gina Gotthilf, Daniel Falabella, and Jorge Mazal. Image Credits:Outsmart Education\n\nBecause the company is currently operating in stealth mode, it's not yet able to share its specific plans. Despite this, the venture shows promise given the caliber of its backers.\n\n\u201cCollege-level education is a basic, universal human right,\u201d Ethan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cI'm actually a first-generation college student myself. Education has completely transformed my life and will impact my family for generations\u2026I just think what [Outsmart is] doing will be world-changing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOutsmart arrives at a time when many families find it hard to pay for a college degree. For the 2024-2025 school year, the average tuition and fees at private ranked colleges rose by around 5.5% over the last year, whereas public schools saw a rise of over 2%. Overall, Americans owe approximately $1.6 trillion in student loans.\n\nMazal told us, \u201cThe mission that we're trying to achieve is to dramatically increase access to higher education in a way that's been unprecedented and that we believe can change the world.\u201d\n\nMany companies aim to help college students get access to affordable education, including platforms that compare college tuition fees, such as Tuition Tracker, as well as companies that offer inexpensive online schooling. There are also matchmaking platforms, like College Rover and College Simply, that help students determine which college is the best fit for them.\n\nSince Outsmart is keeping the details of its offering under wraps, it remains unclear how, or if, it fits into these existing categories. Regardless, the founders themselves appear to be well-equipped to forge a path in the space. The trio worked at Duolingo for five years and have previously held positions at various other notable companies. Falabella has experience at Dropbox and Lucid Software, while Gotthilf previously worked at Tumblr. Mazal has worked at Lucid, MyFitnessPal, and Zynga.\n\nMazal believes Outsmart will be \u201cbetter than the higher ed options out there in basically every dimension, in terms of access, affordability, and personalization,\" he said."

        "article_content": "Google may be working to merge Chrome OS into its Android operating system to strengthen the value proposition of the software for its best Android tablets. While rumors circulate about Google\u2019s Pixel Tablet 2, experts speculate on how the brand can use future devices to compete with Apple\u2019s stronghold in the tablet market with its iPad line.\n\nSources told Android Authority that Google may be closer to unifying its Android and ChromeOS operating systems for the benefit of bridging this gap. Not only would Android gain highlight features from ChromeOS but in the future, some of the best Chromebooks may also run under a reimagined Android OS, that is more attuned for entertainment as well as productivity. The source added this could be a project that takes several years to unfold.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIf the project came to fruition, a blend of Android tablets and Chromebooks running Android could potentially push the software market share in Google\u2019s favor. There is also a Pixel Laptop rumored to be released running an Android operating system.\n\nDespite being a software and services titan in many different arenas, Google has been unable to truly challenge Apple when it comes to tablet market share. Many hardware brands, including Samsung, Amazon, Lenovo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi partner with Google to use the Android operating system on their tablets. Additionally, Google introduced its own Pixel Tablet in 2023. Even so, Apple still dominates the tablet market with a single tablet line, which takes up 55% of the global market share with iOS, 45% of the market goes to Android devices, and 0.11% goes to Linux in October 2024, according to StatCounter.\n\nPixel Tablet 2 rumors suggest the device could be released in 2025, which could make it ineligible for the long-standing project. However, subsequent Pixel Tablet models could potentially be released with the fused Android and ChromeOS system, according to Android Headlines.\n\nThough Google has not shared any official details about plans to merge Chrome OS and Android, the brand did discuss in June, how it would implement parts of Android\u2019s tech stack into ChromeOS. The publication noted that the stack included \u201cAndroid Linux kernel and Android frameworks,\u201d with apps, features, and extensions that could be a part of the project.\n\nAndroid Headlines noted that Google isn\u2019t the only brand that has blended operating systems on a single device. The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid notably works as an Android tablet but morphs into a Windows laptop when connected to a keyboard. Brands including HP and Dell have also previously released similar products to the market."

        "article_content": "Customer relationship management systems can provide extensive analytics and reporting capabilities for businesses to better understand their sales processes on a more comprehensive level. Secure data mining, data recording, and report generation translate this information into visual representations of KPIs.\n\nPopular metrics businesses generate and track include their sales cycle length, marketing ROI, sales rep performance, and deal forecasting.\n\nWhat is CRM analytics?\n\nCRM analytics is internal programming that collects, organizes, and analyzes data around customers, sales, and revenue. Generating detailed reports like this is a top CRM feature that businesses of any size and market can benefit from.\n\nThis data provides actionable insights for leaders, managers, and individual users that assists in making timely and data-based decisions. CRM analytics has also recently been integrated with AI functionality, allowing for more niche reports and suggestions to be generated on command.\n\n5 key CRM metrics\n\nSales cycle length\n\nA sales cycle length is the average time it takes a deal to be closed from beginning to end. This starts with a prospect converting to a lead, and that lead becoming a confirmed customer. The goal is to have the sales cycle length be as short as possible, so that leads aren\u2019t lost to competitors, or their need for your solution dissipates. Measuring this metric will help identify opportunities where the sales cycle could be condensed.\n\nCustomer churn rate\n\nA churn rate is a percentage metric that shows how many customers leave your sales pipeline or stop doing business with your company entirely. A high churn rate is something businesses try to avoid, and typically it can also identify where in your sales process the churn is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s always good to know where you\u2019re succeeding, but equally important to understand where you are losing business in order to make immediate adjustments.\n\nMarketing ROI\n\nMarketing ROI directly tracks how resources that are allocated to marketing contribute to overall revenue growth. While CRM solutions are sales-oriented, marketing features are included in that. That includes social media communications, email marketing campaigns, and even web and landing page building. This is especially important for small to mid-sized businesses looking to invest more into marketing campaigns, because you need concrete data that supports such an investment.\n\nRep performance\n\nRep performance is tracked by monitoring their overall sales activities and close rates. Common activities that are monitored are sales calls, email performance, referral rates, and lead conversion rates. This tracking can be done on an individual scale, by team, according to location, or for an entire department\u2014and can help with quarterly reviews. This transparency is important especially in a commission-driven environment.\n\nBusiness forecasting\n\nThe best CRM solutions offer business and revenue forecasting as an advanced CRM metric. These reports take into account customer activity, sales length, churn rate, sales history, and more to come up with predictive analytics around projected revenue wins. While this information is always subject to change depending on any number of factors, having a projected idea of revenue QoQ or YoY helps immensely when planning bigger initiatives for a company.\n\nTop 3 benefits of CRM data analysis\n\nIncreased productivity\n\nI recommend using a CRM software as a way to increase productivity around customer interactions, and data analysis helps do exactly that. Since there isn\u2019t time being wasted on manually pulling and sorting data, users can focus on nurturing client relationships and closing deals. Trusted analytics make sure efforts are being put into the right place at the right time and optimize resource allocation. This way, reps, agents, or administrators are spending time doing tasks that are proven to be beneficial to the business.\n\nImproved customer satisfaction\n\nWhen you have detailed data analysis built around successful\u2014and less successful\u2014marketing and lead nurturing campaigns, it\u2019s easier to understand what customers consider as positive interaction. With the help of personalized engagement and detailed analysis of metrics like email click rates, conversions, and more, businesses won\u2019t need to guess which strategies actually move customers through their pipeline. This will build customer satisfaction with your business and improve customer retention.\n\nCompetitive advantage\n\nHaving strong analytics in a CRM software allows for businesses to keep a constant eye on market changes or trends. This way, they can anticipate those changes and plan accordingly. For example, these trackable trends help make informed decisions about where to invest more or invest less. If a company anticipates a seasonal increase in business, they should invest in marketing campaigns in advance to get ahead of their competitors. It also helps increase overall efficiency and allows for a flexible and agile business plan.\n\nCRM analytics use cases\n\nWhen choosing a CRM solution, opting for an analytical CRM tool means there\u2019s an emphasis on data warehousing and mining, plus advanced forecasting. These are great for medium to large teams or businesses that need detailed, secure, and constant data monitoring.\n\nIdentifying consumer trends\n\nIn industries that are completely driven by consumer trends, having analytical CRM helps businesses stay ahead and anticipate major changes. Whether it\u2019s financial forecasting, product and service trends, or mapping seasonal spikes, an analytical CRM will take complex data and turn it into understandable insights.\n\nFor example, a retail business might use purchase history and trends from their consumers to help identify when in the fiscal year their products are in demand. They can then plan to invest in more marketing campaigns leading up to that timeframe in the new year.\n\nScalability\n\nWhen your goal is to grow your business quickly, you need an analytical CRM that can grow and scale alongside you. This way, the key metrics you track over time can be consistent no matter how much more data is being saved. Some key metrics that CRM software can track that help with scalability include team, location, and individual rep performance, profit and revenue growth, product or service demand, and more.\n\nThis can be especially helpful for companies planning to expand physically with more locations, service more geographical markets, or determine the feasibility of allocating funds for hiring more employees to accommodate growth.\n\nCompetitor analysis\n\nWhile CRMs are meant to manage and track the metrics of companies and individual users who utilize them, they can still help with competitor analysis. Some metrics that can help managers understand exactly where their customer service and solution ranks against competitors are; lead and customer surveys, split testing results, lost deals versus won deals, and average deal closing time for your business versus industry standard. All of this will help companies not only understand their own internal operations but also lead to more sustainability in their markets.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is an analytical CRM?\n\nAn analytical CRM is a CRM solution that offers advanced data analysis features. These help businesses track and understand their customer and market behaviors. They are best for taking this raw data and insights and turning it into comprehensive reports and files that show trends or projections.\n\nExamples of CRM with advanced analytical capabilities are:\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365: Receive AI-generated summaries that include a detailed analysis on sales KPIs and suggested tasks and strategies.
