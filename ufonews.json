        "article_content": "A secretive Pentagon UFO data retrieval program has been hidden from Congressional oversight since 2017, a new report claims.\n\nWhistleblowers assert the program \u2014 codenamed 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 was established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis trove of high quality, multi-sensor UFO data is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone,' according to a US official who confirmed the leak.\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson denied the existence of the program Tuesday evening, telling reporters: 'The Department of Defense has no record, present or historical, of any type of SAP [Special Access Program] called 'IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION.''\n\nA new, allegedly leaked classified report describes an incident in which a swarm of 'orb' UFOs surrounded an F-22 stealth Raptor and forced it off course. Above, a weather balloon careens through the air following its release from the Cape Canaveral weather station in Florida\n\n'Orb' UFOs are said to be the most commonly reported by the US military. Above, a 'metallic orb' UFO - dubbed the 'Mosul orb' - as leaked to documentary filmmaker Jeremy Corbell\n\nBy law, classified programs like SAPs must be disclosed to the so-called 'Gang of Eight,' which includes the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and other key lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the source of the leaked report, who supplied the document to the independent news site Public, described the program as an 'Unacknowledged Special Access Program' or USAP with unique secrecy privileges.\n\nReporting in defense publication Jane's Defense first revealed the existence of USAPs decades ago, showing that government officials were authorized to lie publicly to deny their existence.\n\nPublic's anonymous source alleged that such deceptions were now occurring on the issues of non-human intelligence (NHI) and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).\n\n'The Executive Branch has been managing UAP/NHI issues without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization for some time, quite possibly decades,' this anonymous whistleblower wrote in their report to Congress.\n\nAbove, an excerpt from the January 2000 issue of national security magazine Jane's International Defense Review, in which reporter Bill Sweetman first made public the existence of 'Unacknowledged Special Access Programs' - which officials are told to lie to protect\n\nAbove, another 'metallic orb' UFO - said to be recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Mid East - first presented to Congress by Pentagon physicist Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick last year\n\nThe whistleblower who claims to have authored the report to Congress described the 'Immaculate Constellation' USAP as a 'strategic intelligence program' and only one part of how the US military currently deals with its UAP 'problem.'\n\nIf proven to be legitimate, the program would show those now infamous Navy UFO videos \u2014 known as the Tic Tac, GOFAST, and Gimbal \u2014 to be just the tip of the US government's UFO data iceberg.\n\n'The multitude of wavelengths collected by these sensors [...] have captured UAP characteristics that are difficult or impossible to observe with the human eye alone,' according to the leaked report, allegedly intended for cleared members of Congress.\n\n'Subtle atmospheric effects associated with UAPs are also visible through the sensors employed by the US military and intelligence agencies,' the leaked report added.\n\n'The verifiable chain of custody for UAP IMINT [meaning high-quality 'Imagery Intelligence'] collected by US military assets,' the report continues, 'ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered.'\n\nThis alleged, leaked classified report to Congress also described an incident in which a swarm of 'orb' UFOs surrounded an F-22 stealth Raptor, forcing it off course.\n\n'The F-22 broke trajectory and attempted to evade,' according to the alleged report, 'but was intercepted and boxed in by approximately 3-6 UAPs.'\n\n'One UAP maneuvered in proximity (>12 meters) to the area directly starboard of the cockpit,' as this whistleblower's report described the pilot testimony.\n\n'There the UAP established a rigid spatial relationship with the F-22, maintaining its exact position and orientation parallel with the F-22's cockpit despite multiple evasive rolls and maneuvers.'\n\nThe new whistleblower report is said to have originated as a document delivered to select members of Congress. Congressman Tim Burchett steps into a 'Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility' or SCIF (above) for a prior classified UFO briefing held on Capitol Hill\n\nThe whistleblower's report is said to make reference not just to UFOs but to 'ARVs' short for 'Alien Reproduction Vehicle' - meaning successfully reverse engineered alien spacecraft. Above, a page from the US Air Force's Project 1794, which was declassified in 2012\n\nThe whistleblower, whose identity is being tightly held for his own safety, according to Public, believes the purpose of the USAP was to hide such amazing encounters.\n\nIn his report to Congress, the source described 'Immaculate Constellation' as 'a means of enforcing internal information security' \u2014 capturing new UFO reports 'before they are observed and circulated within the Military Intelligence Enterprise.'\n\nA second source, a former US intelligence community official, confirmed the authenticity and existence of Immaculate Constellation to Public, stating: 'That program is run out of SEC DEF [Office of the Secretary of Defense].'\n\n'They don't want to acknowledge it's real,' this intelligence source opined. 'They won't comment on it.'\n\nExplosive charges, made by former high-ranking US intelligence official David Grusch (center) in the press and to Congress, have accused both the US military and its defense contractors of stonewalling on evidence of crashed UFOs, recovered 'beings,' and even UFO-related deaths\n\nThis source also noted that the simple public utterance of the name 'Immaculate Constellation' would be sufficient to trigger government surveillance of those who publish it, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\n'They enforce the secrecy with a lot of vigor,' this second source asserted.\n\nWhile still unproven, the explosive claims surrounding the alleged 'Immaculate Constellation' UFO collection program echo comments made publicly by very senior former US intelligence officials.\n\n'I think some of the phenomena we may be seeing,' ex-CIA head John Brennan told reporters in 2021, 'results from something that we don't yet understand and could involve some type of activity that some might say constitutes a different form of life.'"

Where are the aliens?\u201d\n\n5 Elon Musk sat down for an interview with Tucker Carlson on Monday and weighed in on what he believes is the true reason behind the UFO sightings across the US. @TuckerCarlson/X\n\nThe billionaire said there are over \u201c6,000 satellites\u201d in orbit and yet they have \u201cnot once had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.\u201d\n\nSpaceX has over 6,300 active Starlink satellites in low-Earth orbit as of September 2024, according to the nonprofit satellite tracker CelesTrak.\n\nCarlson, 55, asked why there are reports on Earth about the US military having to do \u201ca lot of maneuvering around objects they can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, unidentified flying objects are one thing, but there are always a bunch of classified programs that are underway,\u201d Musk shared.\n\nThe tech mogul claims the government is likely regularly testing \u201cnew aircraft, new missiles, and things\u201d that are classified at such a high level that even those high up in the chain of command in the US military may not be aware they are being tested.\n\n5 The billionaire said there are over \u201c6,000 satellites\u201d in orbit and yet they have \u201cnot once had to maneuver around an alien spacecraft.\u201d @TuckerCarlson/X\n\n\u201cSome pilot sees something moving fast and says, \u2018Hey, I saw a UFO!'\u201d but it could be a new weapons program that is being experimented with on a need-to-know basis.\n\nMusk, however, \u201cguaranteed\u201d that he would not keep that information from the public if he found any evidence of aliens.\n\n\u201cThe split second I see any evidence of aliens, I will immediately post that on the X platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will probably be our number one post of all time.\u201d\n\n5 Carlson, 55, then asked why there are reports on Earth about the US military having to do \u201ca lot of maneuvering around objects they can\u2019t explain.\u201d @TuckerCarlson/X\n\nIn 2023, Musk said he hoped the little green men were real and, more importantly, friendly, but he didn\u2019t believe the government was hiding the existence of extraterrestrial beings from the public.\n\nHe argued that the government would villainize aliens if it knew of their existence to easily green-light military spending.\n\nWhile no recent alien sightings by service members were confirmed to be extraterrestrial life in the government report from 2023, Congress is requiring the Pentagon to look into its UFO files dating back to the end of World War II.\n\n5 An unidentified flying object was spotted off the East Coast of the United States in 2015, photographed by the US Navy and released by the Department of Defense. US Navy\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence reviewed 366 newly identified military sightings of \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d \u2014 Pentagon jargon for UFOs.\n\nOf those, 26 were found to be drones, 163 were \u201cballoon or balloon-like entities,\u201d and six were \u201cattributed to clutter\u201d in the air.\n\nLast fall, the Pentagon launched a new portal where current and former service members, government employees and contractors can report UFO sightings.\n\nThe Pentagon investigated nearly 300 UFO sightings between April 30, 2022, and April 30, 2023.\n\nSome of these flying objects exhibited \u201cconcerning performance characteristics,\u201d including high-speed travel and \u201cunusual maneuverability,\u201d according to the report.\n\nHowever, the report stated that \u201cnone of these UAP reports have been positively attributed to foreign activities.\u201d\n\nLast month, US Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said Congress will soon receive an update from the Pentagon on UFOs.\n\n5 US Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray testifies before a House Intelligence Committee subcommittee about unidentified aerial phenomena, at the Capitol on May 17, 2022. Getty Images\n\nGillibrand, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, said the session is \u201ca priority for me.\u201d\n\nThe New York senator wants a \u201cprogress report on how many unidentified aerial phenomena we assessed and analyzed.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office investigates UFOs and recently appointed Jon Kosloski, a national security official with a background in quantum optics and crypto-mathematics, to head it.\n\nGillibrand indicated she expected Kosloski to testify at the hearing, likely after the Nov. 5 election."

        "article_content": "Last weekend, the Lagos State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria instructed the leadership of the Lord\u2019s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries to review how its members present testimonies at gatherings. According to a PUNCH newspaper report, the CAN had condemned one of the viral testimonies shared by a church member during the penultimate week. In the said testimony, the unnamed member claimed that an old man appeared to her in the examination hall and gave her answers to some questions. The Lagos CAN Chairman, Bishop Stephen Adegbite, described the testimony as \u2018utter fabrication\u2019.\n\nIn recent times, the Lord\u2019s Chosen church has attracted widespread media attention because of some strange-sounding testimonies emanating from its members. The purported miraculous encounters have become the butt of social media jokes, and skit makers have cashed in on them to create sundry digital content. The phrase \u201cI\u2019m a Chosen\u201d, which is an affirmation of denominational faith and loyalty for the church members, has now become a meme for all sorts of situational comedies.\n\nHowever, I have an entirely different view of the Chosen controversy. I do not believe we should use one large brush to paint all Chosen testimonies as mere imagination. Equally, we are not doing our society any good if the only thing we can make out of a seemingly new phenomenon is farce and parody. A sophisticated society should have various prisms for scrutinizing events and social outbursts.\n\nThere is a high probability that some of these miracles are Unidentified Flying Objects encounters. A UFO is any perceived airborne, submerged, or transmedium phenomenon that cannot be immediately identified or explained. Ufology is the investigation of UFOs by people who believe that they may be of extraordinary origins. In ufology, a close encounter is when a person witnesses a UFO \u2013 or its occupants \u2013 at relatively close range, where the possibility of misidentification is presumably greatly reduced. Some of the Chosen testimonies are apt examples of a close encounter or contact.\n\nFor instance, the testimony that an old man appeared, and gave answers in an exam hall, sounds very much like the \u2018saviour UFO alien\u2019 encounter, whereby supposed angelic beings intervene in the affairs of humans. It is reminiscent of the presently trending UFO encounter story of the American man, Chris Bledsoe, which was published in the best-selling book entitled, \u201cUFO of God: The Extraordinary True Story of Chris Bledsoe\u201d. Bledsoe testified that initially, few people believed his UFO encounter, but the US national intelligence community showed strong interest, followed by emerging pieces of evidence confirming the authenticity of his experience.\n\nFurthermore, there is an ongoing eschatological exegesis around UFOs in the Bible. In fact, there is a theological book, The Bible and Flying Saucers, by a Christian minister, Barry Downing, dedicated to this subject. As Frank Stranges, another minister who is the president of International Evangelism Crusades, puts it, \u201cSome UFOs are gifts from God, angelic visitations sent to improve the lot of humankind.\u201d\n\nIn the Book of Ezekiel, the prophet described a flying disc that came from the north (\u201ca wheel in the middle of a wheel\u201d) and hovered over the land. The color was metallic. Although some translations of the Bible describe the \u2018eyes\u2019 of the apparition, a correct interpretation shows that Ezekiel likened these openings to \u2018windows.\u2019 This wheel was no mere vision, Stranges said in a Los Angeles Times interview.\n\nIt was real. It was God\u2019s work. It was a spaceship. Ezekiel saw something. The children of Israel saw something. When the Jews fleeing Egypt roamed the desert for 40 years, a UFO described as a pillar of fire warmed the multitudes at night with its glow. \u201cAbove them was this giant pillar of fire,\u201d Stranges said. \u201cThis was not a natural phenomenon, this huge spaceship God provided in the wilderness.\u201d\n\nGoing by this analogy, one would hazard the assumption that some of the Lord\u2019s Chosen church testifiers may have seen something in the realms of the paranormal. However because Nigeria is not yet exposed to this arcane knowledge, they do not possess the frame of reference to grasp their experiences or accurately describe them. For example, the testimony where a church member narrated how a flying lion carried him to safety, resonates with the UFO encounter in the Biblical book of Ezekiel, where animal imagery was used to depict apparent machines \u2013 eyes on a wheel for windows on a curved spaceship.\n\nThe testimony goes like this, \u201cBefore you know it, something entered my back, lifted me like an aeroplane. When it reached (my destination), it dropped me\u2026 I tried to look, and I discovered it was a lion. When the lion dropped me, it raised its hand and showed me direction, after that, it waved me, bye bye.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, even in the developed countries of the Western hemisphere, with all their sophistication, there are still many sceptics and unbelievers of the paranormal, UFO encounters to be specific. In fact, the American government kept denying UFO reality while gas-lighting close encounter experiencers, until recently when it declassified its UFO files, and admitted that indeed there are UFOs out there.\n\nThe point is, just the same way Chosen members are being trolled, many Americans were mocked and ridiculed when they came public with their close encounter stories. The difference is that the Nigerian experience is dressed in a religious cloak, while the American experience is more scientific and secular.\n\nI feel compelled to share a YouTube comment by one of such Americans on a broadcast made by popular UFO abductee, Travis Walton, who under the username @shotbyabaldwin1409 wrote \u201cI was abducted at the beginning of the year (2022). There is nothing worse than talking to people and needing someone to understand and having everyone think you\u2019re crazy. It\u2019s such a traumatising event that your entire perception of time is changed and you feel truly crazy. I ended up getting amnesia and losing my ability to talk for almost a month. It changed me for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria is just one country in Africa with such testimonies. Two years ago, a Ugandan Christian minister, Prophet William Ssozi gave an incredible account of how he was physically sucked up into \u2018heaven\u2019 in his car while driving on the expressway in Kampala. He insisted it was not a dream. While driving, his car was lifted in midair. He found himself in a place full of light and abundance and was told it was heaven. Then he met Jesus, who had surgery on his head. Within an instant, he was dropped back to earth but discovered he had spent more than three hours in the UFO in the sky.\n\nInterestingly, this Ugandan testimony sounds like the 1988 UFO encounter in Nullarbor, Australia, involving a family of four. The traumatised mother and three grownup sons narrated how a UFO plucked their car from the road on the Nullabor Plain. The Australian police said they were taking the report seriously after investigating damage to the car, which was covered in an ash-type substance. A truck driver and a car driver also witnessed the bizarre event after being chased by the UFO along the Eyre Highway just inside the Western Australia border.\n\nIt is high time we began a serious inquiry into the UFO phenomenon. Now that the subject has become mainstream, it is sad that we lack the intellectual sophistication to profile our citizens\u2019 paranormal experiences. I ask myself, what if there is a real UFO disturbance here, the way it happened in China in 2010, would we allow panic and mass hysteria to take us hostage, or would we engage calmly and surely like the Chinese?"

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nHugging Face, the fast-growing AI startup valued at about $4.5 billion, has launched Gradio 5, a major update to its popular open-source tool for creating machine learning applications. The new version aims to make AI development more accessible, potentially speeding up enterprise adoption of machine learning technologies.\n\nGradio, which Hugging Face acquired in 2021, has quickly become a cornerstone of the company\u2019s offerings. With over 2 million monthly users and more than 470,000 applications built on the platform, Gradio has emerged as a key player in the AI development ecosystem.\n\nBridging the gap: Python proficiency meets web development ease\n\nThe latest version aims to bridge the gap between machine learning expertise and web development skills. \u201cMachine learning developers are very comfortable programming in Python, and oftentimes, less so with the nuts and bolts of web development,\u201d explained Abubakar Abid, Founder of Gradio, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \u201cGradio lets developers build performant, scalable apps that follow best practices in security and accessibility, all in just a few lines of Python.\u201d\n\nOne of the most notable features of Gradio 5 is its focus on enterprise-grade security. Abid highlighted this aspect, telling VentureBeat, \u201cWe hired Trail of Bits, a well-known cybersecurity company, to do an independent audit of Gradio, and included fixes for all the issues that they found in Gradio 5\u2026 For Gradio developers, the key benefit is that your Gradio 5 apps will, out-of-the-box, follow best practices in web security, even if you are not an expert in web security yourself.\u201d\n\nAI-assisted app creation: Enhancing development with natural language prompts\n\nThe release also introduces an experimental AI Playground, allowing developers to generate and preview Gradio apps using natural language prompts. Ahsen Khaliq, ML Growth Lead at Gradio, emphasized the importance of this feature, saying, \u201cSimilar to other AI coding environments, you can enter a text prompt explaining what kind of app you want to build and an LLM will turn it into Gradio code. But unlike other coding environments, you can also see an instant preview of your Gradio app and run it in the browser.\u201d\n\nThis innovation could dramatically reduce the time and expertise needed to create functional AI applications, potentially making AI development more accessible to a wider range of businesses and developers.\n\nGradio\u2019s position in the AI ecosystem is becoming increasingly central. \u201cOnce a model is available on a hub like the Hugging Face Hub or downloaded locally, developers can wrap it into a web app using Gradio in a few lines of code,\u201d Khaliq explained. This flexibility has led to Gradio being used in notable projects like Chatbot Arena, Open NotebookLM, and Stable Diffusion.\n\nFuture-proofing enterprise AI: Gradio\u2019s roadmap for innovation\n\nThe launch of Gradio 5 comes at a time when enterprise adoption of AI is accelerating. By simplifying the process of creating production-ready AI applications, Hugging Face is positioning itself to capture a significant share of this growing market.\n\nLooking ahead, Abid hinted at ambitious plans for Gradio: \u201cMany of the changes we\u2019ve made in Gradio 5 are designed to enable new functionality that we will be shipping in the coming weeks\u2026 Stay tuned for: multi-page Gradio apps, navbars and sidebars, support for running Gradio apps on mobile using PWA and potentially native app support, more built-in components to support new modalities that are emerging around images and video, and much more.\u201d\n\nAs AI continues to impact various industries, tools like Gradio 5 that connect advanced technology with practical business applications are likely to play a vital role. With this release, Hugging Face is not just updating a product \u2014 it\u2019s potentially altering the landscape of enterprise AI development."

Self-correction: The ability of a system to learn from its mistakes and adjust its processes to improve accuracy and performance over time.\n\nIn its current state, AI is still an evolving concept, primarily based on machine learning models; its continual application is on the rise, and we have yet to see the extent of its power.\n\nIs artificial intelligence (AI) essential to app marketing?\n\nAI has long been a subject of anticipation in both popular and scientific culture.\n\nIt can potentially transform businesses and make a huge impact across various industries, including app marketing.\n\nFor example, by utilising tools such as Google Natural Language (GNL) analysis, app marketers can gain insight into how the App Store search algorithms will \u2018read\u2019 your metadata.\n\nThe GNL algorithm analyses the textual content of app descriptions and other related metadata to understand the app\u2019s context, sentiment, and relevance, which can influence app store visibility and rankings.\n\nEntity analysis\n\nSource: Yodel Mobile\n\nEntity analysis shows us which keywords the algorithm prioritises for indexing the app metadata. The words highlighted in colour represent the most relevant terms.\n\nThis helps app marketers to better envision what kind of impact they can gain from their metadata optimisation.\n\nAI\u2019s ability to analyse vast amounts of data, predict user behaviour, and automate complex tasks offers unique opportunities for optimising app visibility and engagement.\n\nGenerally speaking, some AI tools, like Google Gemini or ChatGPT, can improve data analysis, keyword optimisation, sentiment analysis, and more.\n\nAlongside its undeniable benefits, it\u2019s crucial to consider the potential cons of AI where ASO is concerned.\n\nThese may include:\n\nThe need for ongoing refinement to ensure optimal performance\n\nThe risk of errors and inaccuracies\n\nThe risk of homogenised data.\n\nBy carefully weighing these factors, marketers can harness AI\u2019s power effectively while mitigating potential challenges, ultimately driving sustained growth and success in the competitive app market.\n\nLet\u2019s look closer at the pros and cons of using AI for App Store Optimization.\n\nExamples of popular AI apps and tools are in the iOS app store\n\nSource: Yodel Mobile\n\nThe pros and cons of AI in ASO\n\nPro: AI can improve your ASO metadata processing\n\nOne of the standout advantages of incorporating AI into your ASO efforts is the significant time savings it offers in analysis and decision-making processes.\n\nWe all know that ASO requires a lot of manual labour, all the way from data analysis and pulling, through to research and writing. That\u2019s where the biggest benefit of AI becomes apparent.\n\nIt is estimated that 40% of working hours will be augmented or automated by generative AI. This indicates that AI can hugely increase time efficiency within your teams.\n\nFor example, traditional ASO methods often involve manual data collection, overly drawn-out analyses, and iterative adjustments, which can be time-consuming and labour-intensive, especially when dealing with large volumes of data and complex user behaviour patterns.\n\nAI-powered ASO leverages machine learning algorithms to automate and expedite these tasks. AI can swiftly analyse extensive datasets from various sources, including user interactions, app store metrics, competitor performance, and market trends.\n\nFor example, AI-based tools like AppTweak\u2019s Atlas AI and AppDNA can analyse large amounts of data, including user comments and reviews to identify language that users are associating with your app.\n\nBy understanding user sentiment, AI can help you identify changes to make to your app description, keyword lists and even your screenshots.\n\nBy processing this information in real-time, AI generates actionable insights promptly, allowing marketers to make data-driven decisions quickly.\n\nThis also means that AI algorithms can detect patterns and correlations that may not be apparent through traditional methods of analysis, enabling marketers to optimise app store listings, refine keyword strategies, and test different creative elements more effectively.\n\nYou can read some detailed insights into these processes here.\n\nThe visual above demonstrates an AI application generating metadata for a new Custom Product Page (CPP).\n\nCon: The limitations of AI\u2019s analyses\n\nOne of the cons of AI is reduced analysis quality. AI systems, despite their advanced capabilities, can sometimes produce insights that lack the nuanced understanding human analysts bring to the table.\n\nAn example of this is an AI tool that might suggest ads, metadata or visuals that perform well in one market based on data. However, it might not account for cultural differences that could make the same content ineffective or even offensive in another region.\n\nHuman analysts can recognise these subtleties and adjust campaigns accordingly.\n\nAI tools and systems like ChatGPT, Bing and Gemini have also been found to provide users with fabricated data that appears authentic (as shown in the image below). These inaccuracies are so frequent that they have been coined \u2018AI hallucinations\u2018. It is important to remain vigilant towards these types of occurrences as they can cause costly damage.\n\nIn the context of ASO, this can be damaging if AI tools were to generate false insights into user behaviour\u2014such as incorrectly identifying popular app features or user preferences.\n\nBased on that you might optimise your metadata in ways that do not resonate with real users, leading to lower conversion rates and visibility.\n\nMake every effort not to blindly rely on the data obtained through AI.\n\nChatGPT user review analysis\n\nSource: Yodel Mobile\n\nThe image above displays a data hallucination from ChatGPT, where ChatGPT has analysed data incorrectly, deducing negative sentiment where there is none.\n\nHow can AI harm your ASO efforts?\n\nPoor analysis quality can be one of the cons of AI that is particularly concerning.\n\nAn AI platform might flag a set of keywords as high-performing based on manual data input.\n\nThe same AI platform may not recognise that these keywords attract low-quality traffic or don\u2019t convert well.\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate this using the example of a piano learning app.\n\nWhen generating keywords to optimise an app store listing, AI tools might identify the keyword \u201cguitar\u201d as high-performing, not recognising that this keyword suggestion is irrelevant to the user.\n\nThis error in the analysis is likely the product of AI deciding that as \u2018piano\u2019 and \u2018guitar\u2019 are both musical instruments, users will be looking for both within this app.\n\nIn this instance, AI did not grasp the concept of your app.\n\nSo, while the keyword \u201cguitar\u201d could draw high traffic volume, it might not lead to high user retention or meaningful engagement with the app\u2019s primary features.\n\nPro: AI can enhance your keyword research\n\nOf course, it is not all bad. Another compelling advantage of integrating AI into your ASO strategy is the enhancement of your keyword research and metadata processes.\n\nApp metadata, including titles, descriptions, and keywords, significantly influence app discoverability and user perception.\n\nTraditionally, auditing this metadata to ensure it aligns with current best practices and market trends can be a painstaking and resource-intensive task.\n\nAI tools can be used to optimise the app\u2019s metadata by analysing and evaluating these elements against a backdrop of real-time data from the app stores.\n\nA practical example of how to carry this out is as follows:\n\nLeverage cross-referenced data for precision : Utilise data from platforms like AppTweak to cross-reference user behaviour between app stores (iOS or Google Play) and traditional internet search engines like Google. This differentiation is crucial because app store behaviour differs significantly from web search patterns, requiring app-specific keyword strategies.\n\n: Utilise data from platforms like AppTweak to cross-reference user behaviour between app stores (iOS or Google Play) and traditional internet search engines like Google. This differentiation is crucial because app store behaviour differs significantly from web search patterns, requiring app-specific keyword strategies. Optimise for AI-driven presentation : Use AI-powered systems to generate keyword suggestions and metadata. These systems are optimised to present data in a format that aligns with how AI interprets and ranks content. As app stores increasingly adopt AI features, ensuring your app\u2019s metadata is crafted in \u2018AI\u2019s language\u2019 can boost visibility and relevance as it is already presented in a manner that is appealing to AI algorithms, meaning your app is more likely to be pushed to rank higher.\n\n: Use AI-powered systems to generate keyword suggestions and metadata.

Maintain human oversight to mitigate the cons of AI: While AI enhances efficiency, human intervention remains essential to fine-tune the output. Review and optimise AI-generated keywords and metadata to ensure they align with your brand\u2019s voice and strategy. This step addresses potential cons of AI, such as lack of context or over-reliance on algorithms, ensuring a balanced and effective approach.\n\nCon: The risk of homogenised metadata\n\nWhile AI can positively impact your metadata processes, we can\u2019t ignore one of the biggest drawbacks it poses in the same vein.\n\nUsing AI to create and optimise your app metadata puts you at risk of using homogenised content. This is one of the more prevalent cons of AI use. If your and your competitors\u2019 apps are optimised by the same AI systems, their algorithms can create uniformity across your vertical.\n\nThis is because AI struggles with transformational creativity, which requires generating ideas beyond existing frameworks to create something entirely new.\n\nSee the image below, which depicts the product of using AI to create eCommerce app icons.\n\nAI-generated eCommerce app icons\n\nSource: Microsoft Copilot\n\nUsing AI to create app store creatives can lead to a lack of visual differentiation, making it harder for your app to stand out in a crowded marketplace.\n\nThis reduced visibility can negatively impact app store conversion rates, as potential users may struggle to find and choose your app amidst a sea of indistinguishable options.\n\nMoreover, this homogenisation effect can stifle innovation in app marketing. If everyone relies on the same AI platforms to generate metadata, the opportunity for creative and unique approaches is diminished.\n\nGoogle has shared some observations about these concerns.\n\nIt is worth taking these thoughts into consideration when deciding whether or not to implement AI into your ASO strategy.\n\nPros and cons of AI: Making your decision\n\nWhile AI systems present a number of opportunities for enhancing App Store Optimisation (ASO), it is essential to remain aware of its limitations when deciding whether or not to include them as part of your ASO strategy. The cons of AI, such as the potential for homogenised store listing elements or reduced quality of nuanced analyses, highlight the need for a balanced approach.\n\nApp marketers can maximise their ASO efforts by integrating AI\u2019s powerful data-processing capabilities with human creativity and strategic insight.\n\nThis hybrid approach ensures that apps not only benefit from the efficiencies and precision of AI tools but also maintain their unique identity and competitive edge in an increasingly crowded ecosystem.\n\nRead through our app marketing blog for more innovative and cutting-edge insights like these."

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nIf scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.\n\nThe work by Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun is \u201cproving to be fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function,\u201d according to a panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun were initially interested in genes that control the timing of different genetic developments, ensuring that cell types develop at the right time.\n\nTheir discovery ultimately \u201crevealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\u201d the panel said.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Prize for?\n\nRNA is best known for carrying instructions for how to make proteins from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to tiny cellular factories that actually build the proteins. MicroRNA does not make proteins, but helps to control what cells are doing, including switching on and off critical genes that make proteins.\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel for medicine went to scientists who discovered how to manipulate one of those types of RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA, now used to make vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nAmbros\u2019 and Ruvkun\u2019s revolutionary discovery was initially made in worms; they set out to identify why some kinds of cells didn\u2019t develop in two mutant strains of worms commonly used as a research model in science.\n\n\u201cTheir groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\u201d according to the citation explaining the importance of their work.\n\nThat mechanism has been at work for hundreds of millions of years and has enabled evolution of complex organisms, it said.\n\nAmbros, currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, performed the research at Harvard University. Ruvkun\u2019s research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he\u2019s a professor of genetics.\n\nWhy does microRNA matter?\n\nThe study of microRNA has opened up approaches to treating diseases like cancer because it helps regulate how genes work in our cells, said Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London.\n\nFletcher said there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as possible indicators of diseases, by tracking microRNA levels in the body.\n\n\u201cIf we take the example of cancer, we\u2019ll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,\u201d said Fletcher. She said scientists might one day be able to use microRNA to stop such effects.\n\nEric Miska, a geneticist at Cambridge University, said the discovery by Ambros and Ruvkun came as a complete surprise, overturning what scientists had long understood about how cells work.\n\nTheir discovery of microRNA shocked many scientists, Miska said, explaining that such small bits of genetic material had never been seen before. The tiny fragments of RNA \u2014 the human genome has at least 800 \u2014 were later found to play critical roles in how our bodies develop.\n\nMiska said there is ongoing work on the role of microRNA in infectious diseases like hepatitis and that it might also be helpful in treating neurological diseases.\n\nFletcher said the most advanced studies to date are reviewing how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but no drugs have yet been approved. She predicted that might happen in the coming years, adding that most treatments at the moment target cell proteins.\n\n\u201cIf we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nHow did Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros react?\n\nThe phone call from the Nobel panel is often a surprise, but there are certain signs that recipients and their families pick up on.\n\n\u201cWell, when a phone rings at 4:30 in the morning. \u2026 It never happens here,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\n\u201cNatasha actually answered it,\u201d Ruvkun added, referring to his wife. \u201cAnd she goes: \u2018He has a Swedish accent.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt took a little longer to rouse Ambros.\n\n\u201cSomebody called my son, who called my wife as my phone was downstairs,\u201d he said.\n\nRuvkun knew immediately the impact the award would have on his life.\n\n\u201cWell, I just kept repeating in my mind, this changes everything because you know, the Nobel is just mythic in how it transforms the life of people who are selected,\u201d Ruvkun said. \u201cThe Nobel Prize is a recognition that\u2019s sort of 100 times as much press and celebration as any other award. So, it\u2019s not part of a continuum. It\u2019s a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nGoing to pick up his award in December will be the third time he has been to a Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm after attending to watch his mentor Robert Horvitz receive the 2002 award and then his buddy Jack Szostak, who won in 2009.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trip coming up. It will be the third, possibly the best,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAmbros said he didn\u2019t expect the award as he felt that the Nobel committee has already singled out RNA in the 2006 prize that went to his friends Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.\n\n\u201cIt represents the recognition of how wonderful and unexpected discoveries come from a curiosity in basic science financed by taxpayer money. It\u2019s a vitally important, probably the most important message, that this investment really pays off,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that microRNA helps regulate gene activity, rather than carrying instructions for making proteins.\n\n___\n\nCorder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, Cheng reported from London.

        "article_content": "At the dawn of the 1900s, science remained a domain largely inaccessible to women. Despite societal constraints, a select group of pioneering women found a path to contribute to science through illustration. Drawing was a decidedly \u201cwomanly\u201d pastime in the early 1900s, so illustration became an acceptable avenue for scientifically inclined women to document and interpret the natural world despite the gender bias in traditional scientific roles.\n\nThese are the stories of four women in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Department of Invertebrate Zoology who broke through the gendered barriers of science and made significant contributions to scientific discovery through art.\n\nViolet Dandridge (1878\u20131956)\n\nViolet Dandridge was one of the earliest women employed as an illustrator by the Smithsonian. In 1903, she embarked on expeditions to document invertebrates alongside renowned female scientists Mary Jane Rathbun and Harriet Richardson. Dandridge surveyed the east coast with Rathbun and Richardson to collect and document over 1,000 invertebrate specimens. She meticulously captured their likeness in colored paintings.\n\nDandridge captured the delicate features of a wide variety of animals in crisp detail. These illustrations provided crucial insight for scientists to determine the unique features of each animal. Beyond her pioneering work in science, Dandridge was also an active participant in the woman's suffrage movement.\n\nAime Motter Awl (1887\u20131973)\n\nAime Awl defied societal norms by pursuing a career in medical illustration and later transitioning to the natural sciences. At Johns Hopkins Medical School, Awl studied alongside medical students, observed surgeries, and took advanced anatomy courses. She kept her work secret from friends who she feared would disapprove of such \u201cimproper\u201d work for a woman. Her talent and dedication earned her international recognition, leading to commissions to illustrate rare surgical procedures.\n\nAwl was hired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1929 and not only supported mollusk and crustacean research but also provided illustrations for almost every department in the museum. Her invertebrate work focused on many of the tiniest of animals\u2014such as copepods and ostracods\u2014and was even published in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nIn 1944, she joined the Soroptimist Club in Washington, DC, an organization still active today whose volunteers help women and girls gain access to the education and training needed to achieve economic empowerment.\n\nCarolyn Bartlett Gast (1929\u20132015)\n\nCarolyn Gast worked as a scientific illustrator with the Department of Invertebrate Zoology from 1954 to 1985. She used various techniques to capture the essence of invertebrate life. Her illustration of a microscopic loriciferan (featured at the beginning of the article), a new phylum discovered in 1983 by Reinhardt M\u00f8bjerg Kristensen in the microscopic ecosystem between grains of sand, is perhaps her most famous and often reproduced illustration.\n\nHer innovative approach to illustration, including experiments with creating 3D images through stereography, aimed to modernize the field. While stereography never got off the ground for scientific illustration, she worked on it as a personal project and even created a 3D alphabet series in the style of Middle Age Illumination. This artistic style comes from Medieval manuscripts which were decorated with intricate \u201cminiatures\u201d lining the boarders of pages, ornate lettering, and gold leaf.\n\nAs a founding member of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators in 1968, Gast played a pivotal role in fostering a community of aspiring illustrators. She was also an avid proponent of using art to increase public science literacy.\n\nMarilyn Schotte (1947\u20132020)\n\nMarilyn Schotte dedicated over three decades to the Department of Invertebrate Zoology as both a researcher and illustrator. In addition to supporting the research of Drs. Brian Kensley and Ellen Strong, she published 40 scientific papers and a book of her own on crustaceans.\n\nA dedicated worker, Schotte once spent 24 hours straight drawing larval squid to meet a deadline. Her contributions to science inspired Kensley to name a species of isopod after Schotte (Malacanthura schotteae). Known for her meticulous attention to detail, Schotte's illustrations were praised for their accuracy and depth. She also supported other scientific illustrators by serving as the president of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators from 1984 to 1988. Her work was featured as part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian Ripley Center in 1996.\n\nIn an era when women faced significant barriers in scientific pursuits, these remarkable individuals contributed to research at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History through meticulously documenting every scale, antenna, spine, and intricate feature of a dizzying array of earth\u2019s animals to help describe life on Earth. Their legacy endures as a testament to the transformative power of art in advancing scientific knowledge and challenging societal norms."

        "article_content": "Jesse Anderson, managing director of the Big Data Institute and author of Data Teams, recently published the latest findings from his annual Data Teams Survey of 81 data leaders and engineers across a range of enterprise types. The 2024 survey shows a slow adoption of LLMs by data teams, a neutral impact from remote work, and an overall decline in the perception of delivered value. The survey also calls out that data-operations capabilities are missing from half of the respondents.\n\nThe Data Teams Survey\u2019s analysis emphasised the importance of spreading skills and cognitive load in the data domain across teams with data science, engineering, and operations capabilities. Anderson wrote that while data science and engineering teams are well-represented, \"operations teams are lacking in half of the respondents.\" Further, he also highlighted inconsistencies in how data teams tend to define the role of operations engineers, with only 20% aligning on a definition which covers systems engineering skills. He wrote:\n\nThe individual contributors must meet the criteria and definitions to represent the job title. We see well-represented responses for data scientists and data engineers with operations lagging.\n\nAnderson also published another article looking at the evolution of results from Data Teams Surveys between 2020 and 2024, in which he commented on the methodologies and practices used by data teams. Anderson wrote that over time he\u2019s seen a \"decline in DataOps and an increase in teams not using a methodology\" of any kind. Anderson wrote that \"choosing a methodology is still essential\" for successful teams.\n\nCommenting on differentiators between high and low-value teams, Anderson wrote that high performers followed \"more best practices.\" The survey showed that these practices include engineering norms such as unit testing, close business collaboration, picking the right technologies, and having appropriate cross-functional skills.\n\nA recent episode of the Data Engineering Podcast discussed the need for increased engineering and operational rigour in data teams with Petr Janda, founder of Synq.io. He started Synq, a data operations reliability and observability platform, following his experience with data teams that measured incident recovery times in weeks, compared to hours for other engineering teams. Janda talked about the need for incident resolution processes which factor in a granular, data specific, impact on stakeholders and downstream systems. Calling out missing processes, he said:\n\nEveryone was focusing on the problem of detecting issues \u2026 So once we detect that a certain table is missing data or that a certain test is now failing because some business validation is not met, what happens afterwards? What is the workflow from the perspective of finding the right team to deal with that issue, and assessing the impact on the company? Is this even an issue we have to deal with right now, or is that something that can wait and be dealt with later?\n\nAnderson also reviewed participants' responses to questions about their teams' delivery of value to the business. Looking back over previous surveys, he observed a downward trend that he said, \"should give everyone in the industry pause.\" Anderson noted that many respondents \"highlighted a disconnect between data teams and business needs.\" This was attributed to insufficient \"domain knowledge\" and issues with \"communicating data value to stakeholders.\" Anderson wrote:\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing this lower value creation trend anecdotally, and now we see it in the data. For a nascent industry like data teams, we should gradually increase the amount of value created or, at a minimum, stay the same. This downward trend has been troubling me for some time \u2026 It is concerning to me that there wasn\u2019t an increase in value creation over three years.\"\n\nOn the subject of remote work, the survey shows that the majority of respondents indicate that remote work has not impacted their team\u2019s productivity. The survey also showed a slow and shallow adoption of LLMs, with only 12% of surveyed teams using LLMs for data processing, which he described as their \"ideal\" use case. After accounting for 24% of teams not using LLMs at all, Anderson explained that the remainder primarily use them \"for code generation, ideation or copy creation, and code debugging.\"\n\nJanda concluded by reflecting on his hope that data teams would become more embedded into organisations\u2019 operational radar, rather than \"seeing data as this thing on the side.\" He also called out the need for more cross-functional skills on data teams, saying:\n\nI hope to see a lot more teams being cross-functional in the way I remember we removed boundaries between frontend and backend and infra teams, by creating cross-functional units."

First Name Last Name Your Email Address (Required)\n\nAs broadcast technology evolves, the debate over software versus hardware-based tools intensifies. This is especially clear in the world of production switchers, where smaller productions and secondary locations are perfect for a move to the cloud.\n\nProduction switchers, essential for live video mixing and effects, are at the forefront of this technological shift. Traditional hardware switchers, long the workhorses of broadcast control rooms, now face competition from software-based alternatives that promise greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nIP-based workflows and remote production have accelerated this trend, making software switchers increasingly attractive for certain applications. However, hardware solutions continue to offer reliability and low latency advantages, particularly for large-scale, high-stakes live productions.\n\nFlexibility and upgradeability\n\nSoftware-based switchers offer significant advantages in flexibility and adaptability to new technologies.\n\n\u201cBecause technology is rapidly changing, the essential difference is that hardware solutions lock you in with the capabilities of today, while software-based solutions provide you with much easier deployment when new advancements are made,\u201d said Ryan Hansberger, head of product development for video mixing at Vizrt.\n\nThis flexibility extends to remote productions, with Hansberger noting that software solutions enable productions to \u201chappen essentially anywhere, while maintaining reliability and performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the software-based switchers, extension of functionalities is possible at any time without changing specific hardware and is always therefore future-proof,\u201d said Greg Huttie, VP of production switchers at Grass Valley, on upgradeability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerformance and reliability\n\nWhile software solutions offer flexibility, hardware switchers maintain advantages in certain performance metrics.\n\n\u201cWhile these software-based offerings can complement a hardware-based production switcher for producing alternative feeds or sub-shows, they still lack the horsepower of today\u2019s purpose-built production switchers,\u201d said Deon LeCointe, director of networked solutions at Sony Electronics.\n\n\u201cA hardware switcher\u2019s latency for processing and operation is minimal, and there are no potential network security issues,\u201d said Satoshi Kanemura, president of For-A.\n\nHowever, Huttie suggests that the gap between software and hardware performance is narrowing.\n\n\u201cBoth software-based and hardware-based production switchers can be optimized for reliability and performance across various applications. Key features such as redundant IP networks, handling multiple formats, and power supplies can enhance the reliability and performance of both types of switchers,\u201d said Huttie.\n\nRemote production capabilities\n\nThe ability to support remote production workflows has become increasingly important. Software-based switchers often have an edge in this area.\n\n\u201cSoftware-based solutions also provide greater flexibility for remote productions, enabling them to happen essentially anywhere, while maintaining reliability and performance,\u201d said Hansberger.\n\n\u201cThe advent of advanced Media over IP technologies including SMPTE ST 2110, SRT, and NDI have ushered in a new age of connectivity for production switchers which has enabled new remote workflows,\u201d said LeCointe.\n\n\u201cOperation of an on-prem switcher can happen remotely as well, if the switcher supports streaming of its multi-viewer outputs and can connect control panels to the switcher via the internet,\u201d said Keith Vidger, principal technical consultant at Panasonic Connect.\n\nFuture-proofing strategies\n\nManufacturers are implementing various strategies to ensure their products remain relevant as technology advances. For hardware switchers, this often involves modular designs.\n\n\u201cThe overall modular structure of the hardware-based K-Frame\u2019s I/O and processing boards affords either introduction of new boards or adding functionality (some examples: introducing onboard JPEG XS signals processing, color mapping of HDR and SDR, and adding additional clean-feeds),\u201d said Huttie on Grass Valley\u2019s approach.\n\nSoftware-based solutions, by nature, offer more straightforward upgrade paths.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re implementing software-based architecture that easily supports any future requirements, all formats, and all compression standards,\u201d noted Kanemura.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shift towards cloud-based production environments is also influencing switcher development.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen the introduction of software-based production switcher platforms, like Sony\u2019s M2L-X, which can be deployed on premises in COTS hardware and on the Cloud,\u201d said LeCointe on Sony\u2019s approach.\n\nHuttie notes that for Grass Valley\u2019s software-based switchers, \u201cThe location of the processing does not limit the functionality or performance of the production switcher and can therefore be freely selected as required.\u201d\n\nChoosing between software and hardware\n\nThe choice between software and hardware switchers depends on specific production needs.\n\n\u201cThe choice between software and hardware solutions often depends on specific production needs rather than inherent limitations in reliability or performance,\u201d said Huttie.\n\nFactors to consider include the scale of production, required features, budget and the importance of remote operation capabilities.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, the lines between software and hardware switchers may blur further.\n\n\u201cIt is just a matter of time until we see software-based solutions that provide the same specs as their hardware-based predecessors,\u201d said LeCointe.\n\nFor broadcasters, the decision between software and hardware switchers involves carefully weighing flexibility, performance and future scalability against current production requirements."
