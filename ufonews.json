            "article_content": "Strange footage captured over the US appeared to show a hovering UFO with an odd glow over a military base.\n\nAn anonymous user posted the footage from Tennessee to Reddit, showing the \u201cbright orange light\u201d over Fort Campbell, a base on the border with the state of Kentucky. The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Another mysterious 'orange UFO orb' was spotted flying over the US, however, this time the inexplicable glow was seen conspicuously hovering over a military base in Tennessee.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border - on New Year's Day.\n\nThe user, who witnessed the perplexing 'celestial' event alongside their father, who is a seasoned Army veteran, said that they 'couldn't explain' what they were seeing in the skies above.\n\n'My dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before,' the post reads.\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the Redditor, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb.\n\n'Just after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,' the user claimed.\n\nThe curious onlookers were mystified at the unidentified flying object as it did not appear to have any additional lights as they suspect most drones do.\n\n'My friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone,' the post adds.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border, on New Year's Day\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the user, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, then tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb\n\n'Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.'\n\nBright high-flying 'orange UFO orbs' have been spotted across the US in recent weeks with the most recent sighting surfacing over New York City.\n\nOn December 27, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video of the inexplicable luminous object to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "You\u2019ve no doubt noticed artificial intelligence finding its way into every app, service, and hardware device. It\u2019s now unusual to see a tech product launch where AI isn\u2019t the main talking point. Meta is one of the companies pushing AI the hardest, with its own set of AI models, and a selection of AI bots and tools inside its own apps. (Experts and critics also say Meta may be taking their AI too far, which Meta responded to by removing multiple AI profile accounts.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram recently, then you may have spotted a new Meta AI bot, ready and waiting to be of assistance. Here\u2019s how you can make use of it\u2014and what your options are in terms of security and privacy.\n\nHow to find Meta AI\n\nYou\u2019ll find Meta AI front and center in Meta\u2019s apps: In the Facebook Messenger app, for example, tap Chats and you\u2019ll see a Meta AI input box right at the top, above your real life friends and family members. Tap inside that box, and you can start chatting about whatever topic you like. You can also tap Meta AI on the tab bar at the bottom.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the WhatsApp app (you\u2019ll see the Meta AI logo on the Chats tab), and in the Instagram app (tap the message button, in the top right corner of the home tab, and Meta AI is at the top). The Meta AI logo is a glowing blue and purple circle, and it\u2019s hard to miss as you use the apps.\n\nMeta AI is prominently displayed in your chats. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get Meta AI up, inside one-to-one or group chats with real people: Tag @MetaAI in your conversation, type out a prompt, and you\u2019ll get the same response as you would if you were chatting to the AI bot directly\u2014except, of course, the other chat participants will be able to see the message and response.\n\nThe AI bot chats all use the same underlying model (called Llama), but your chats aren\u2019t synced between the three apps. Unfortunately for AI skeptics, there\u2019s no way to hide or turn off Meta AI: You just have to ignore it if you don\u2019t want to use it. However, you can delete, mute, and archive Meta AI chats just like any other conversation\u2014just long press on the AI chat in the main conversation list.\n\nHow to use Meta AI\n\nIf you\u2019ve used an AI chatbot like Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the way these tools work: You can ask Meta AI to look up facts from the web, write poetry, or suggest ideas for something. You can get recommendations for podcasts, inspiration for a birthday party, or suggestions about how to fix a faucet leak.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can ask Meta AI for advice and instruction on just about any topic\u2014though as usual with generative AI, be careful of putting too much trust in the answers. These AI bots are built to imagine new text, and that can lead to hallucinations. Sometimes Meta AI will reference the web (when looking up facts, for example)\u2014and when this happens you\u2019ll see web links within the response. Tap on these links to check the facts.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions about just about anything. Screenshot: Meta\n\nImage generation is included here: Just ask Meta AI to create or draw an image of whatever you like. It could be a cat sat on a wall, a cabin in the woods, or a person exploring the surface of Mars. The more detail you can add, the more closely the result is going to match your original vision\u2014and you can specify the style of the image too, whether it\u2019s a photo, a painting, or something else.\n\nThere are some interesting image-related tricks you can try: For example, you can use it to create a new profile picture for yourself. Two suggestions from Meta are \u201cimagine me as royalty\u201d or \u201cimagine me in a surrealist painting\u201d, so you can see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019re also able to edit an AI-generated image by tapping and holding on it, then typing in your additional prompt.\n\nMeta AI can generate images for you as well. Screenshot: Meta\n\nMeta itself splits what you can do into three main sections: learn (\u201csummarize the history of the Universe\u201d), create (\u201cimagine dogs playing chess\u201d), and connect (\u201cplan a game night with friends\u201d). That gives you some idea of what\u2019s possible, and you can now interact with Meta AI with your voice if you want\u2014just tap the sound button to the right of the input box.\n\nOne of the features recently added to Meta AI is the ability to use photos in your chats\u2014either picked from your phone\u2019s gallery or taken through the camera. You can identify objects and landmarks, create AI images based on existing photos, and more: Try snapping a picture of a cake and asking how to make it, for example."

The weather gets colder, the holiday treats show up, and the drive to stick to my usual workout routine falls off a cliff. The winter months are hard for the home-gym-goer, with no one but yourself to offer encouragement and accountability. And while I do okay at keeping myself on track for most of the year, once the snow hits the ground, I need to call in reinforcements.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve used this time to shake things up\u2014trying new workout apps or finding fresh ways to inject novelty into my regimen. One app I experimented with is Zombies, Run!, which immerses users in a post-apocalyptic narrative where they run from zombies rather than just calories. With its engaging writing, voice acting, and sound design, it offers a unique running experience and even features a Marvel superhero expansion.\n\nBut here's the thing: Zombies never did much for me. And I also want to be able to customize my workouts in pretty specific ways, adapting to the equipment I have, the goals I'm pursuing, and the narratives I'm interested in. What if I want to add in some dumbbell exercises, or some jump rope? What if I need to focus on my core as much as my arms or work around an injury?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a long time, I just assumed that level of customization was too much for any app to deliver. The knowledge of a professional trainer, the creativity of a writer weaving workouts into stories, and the immersive voice acting seemed unattainable for my niche Monday workout.\n\nTo some extent, I was right. I can't replicate the movement tracking, the professional sound design, or the slick app to run it all. But I can get a heck of a lot closer than I ever imagined by using the latest AI tools.\n\nWith a combination of AI-powered research, generative writing, and AI narration, I'm creating customized workouts that double as thrilling adventures, set in any narrative I can imagine! Let me show you how I'm using AI to put myself in the story and get fitter while I do.\n\nThe Tools: Perplexity, ChatGPT and ElevenLabs Reader\n\nTo create these AI-powered workouts, I use three different tools. They're all free, though jumping between them takes a bit of effort. Why this combination? Because I wanted a workout that was accurate, engaging, and completely personalized. These tools make that possible.\n\nFor putting my workout together, I'm using , a search-focused tool that's sort of like a mashup of Google search and ChatGPT, where it summarizes real-world search results to offer informed answers to your questions. It's not perfect, but I find that it's a better tool for getting fact-based answers with fewer hallucinations than ChatGPT. There are several different out there, but Perplexity has found its way to the top of my preferred tool list.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm also using ChatGPT to take that workout plan and turn it into an immersive narrative. The brainstorming and creative writing uses of ChatGPT make it a great fit for this, turning a simple 8-exercise routine into an extensive step-by-step guide, and then weaving those exercises into a customized story.\n\nFinally, I'm using to give voice to my new workout adventures. ElevenLabs specializes in AI text-to-speech, using AI voices to provide computer-generated narration that sounds surprisingly lifelike, with natural cadence and inflection. And the Reader app (available for and ) lets me do that for free on my phone, making it perfect for this workout project.\n\nSpeaking of tools, there's one more essential item for this AI workout adventure: a good old-fashioned note-taking document. Why? Because juggling information between different AI tools can get messy. A central document lets you easily copy, paste, edit, and refine your workout plan and story without losing track of anything.\n\nThis will be helpful as you pull together research, draft workout guides and stories, and prepare the final text for audio narration. For this project I actually recommend using two documents: One for the workout and instructions and another for drafting the final narrative text.\n\nThe Walkthrough: From Research to Audio Workout\n\nOpen your notes document and jot down any specific thoughts you have before planning anything. Getting your own thoughts clear about your exercise goals, your equipment and resources, and any unique needs or concerns that you have will help you know what you need to discuss before you do any research at all. When in doubt, start with notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my most important advice about doing bigger projects with AI: Tackle things in bite-sized pieces. That means generating outlines before you ask it to write full stories, and do your brainstorming before you're in the thick of a long narrative script. LLM tools are great at small, discrete tasks (even complex ones!), but throwing multi-step projects at them can lead to frustrating results due to small miscommunications or problems you don't catch when trying to focus on the bigger picture.\n\n1. Research and Design Your Workout With Perplexity\n\nWhen putting together a workout routine, I worry a lot about having accurate information. So, while there are plenty of guides out there for using ChatGPT to build a custom workout plan, I actually prefer to use a different tool: . Because Perplexity combines LLM capabilities with online search, it pulls from high-quality information sources, and then answers the question, resulting in higher-quality information, drastically fewer hallucinations, and a better overall result.\n\nPerplexity's basic user interface is also very easy to use: Ask a question, and you'll get a nuanced answer, complete with cited sources. But many people don't realize that you can also enter more information in each prompt, letting you specify things like what exercise equipment you have, what parts of the body you want to target, and any additional information, like injuries or conditions that might require you to adjust your workout plans.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can also ask for information in different formats, and when dealing with lists and detail-rich data, I often ask for the response in table format. In this case, I can ask for a list of recommended exercises, but also add columns for the muscle groups worked, the equipment used, and more.\n\nFinally, you don't need to settle for whatever the first answer says. You can engage Perplexity in a back-and-forth conversation, tweaking and refining answers to your needs, or expanding on things if you need more information. A little back and forth goes a long way when the AI can also pull in research materials, making it really easy to zero in on exactly what you need. I spent some time tweaking things to my liking, but the end result is a simple but effective workout, tailored to my equipment and needs.\n\nOnce I'm happy with the workout plan, I copy it into my notes for future reference. There's no need to reinvent that wheel once it's done. And as I go from one tool to another, I can pull that info from my notes and feed it to whatever other tool I'm using.\n\nI will also ask for instructions on how to perform each exercise properly. This information is especially helpful for moves I might not be familiar with, but even the moves you know well should get some attention paid to correct form, and the information will come in handy shortly. This is also another instance where Perplexity's search-based AI is best, since you don't want a hallucination about exercise technique leading to an easily avoidable injury down the line.\n\nI paste the workout, the individual exercises, and the exercise-specific instructions into a document and save them for use in our next step, which uses ChatGPT.\n\n2. Script Your Guided Routine With ChatGPT\n\nNext, I'll switch to , since I'm more comfortable using it to generate content in different styles. For this, I'll attack the workout piece by piece, focusing on one exercise at a time. The first exercise will get the most time and attention, because it will be where I define what I want in terms of tone and format.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere's the prompt I used, with information pasted in about each specific exercise:\n\nAfter which I simply pasted in the relevant workout instructions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt took some revising and refining to get the cadence right for an exercise that's done fairly quickly, but it wasn't hard to make those tweaks.\n\nMaking corrections to either the first or second part of the text also makes it easier to iteratively adjust the phrasing and flow to something you think will work during your workout.\n\nHere's the script section I got after just a few tweaks:\n\nNow, all that you need to do is paste in the information about the next exercise, and ask ChatGPT to follow the same format. Doing all of this in the same conversation makes it very simple to get consistent formatting across each exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPaste these sections together into a document, and you'll quickly have your workout written out, with guidance and counted reps. If a guided workout is all you wanted, you can skip step 3 and jump right to step 4, where we'll use AI to narrate your workout. But don't skip it, because this is the fun part.\n\n3. Craft Your Immersive Experience With ChatGPT\n\nSo far we've researched a workout and generated a script to walk you through your routine. That's cool, but it's pretty basic in terms of generative AI. Here's where things get a little more interesting.\n\nInstead of doing a standard workout, with nothing but boring instructions and monotonous reps, I wanted my workout to be a little more fun. That's where the fiction-writing capability of ChatGPT really shines. With your workout already mapped out, with instructions and rep counts, it's simply a matter of adapting that information to fit into a larger narrative.\n\nTo do this, I used a two-step prompt, first to prime the concept of the exercise-within-a-story idea, and then followed up with the rough idea, asking ChatGPT to outline a story for the setting I imagined, which in this case is a secret agent mission to sneak in and out of an enemy compound.\n\nThe second prompt is story-specific, and can be adjusted to whatever setting or adventure you want. And ChatGPT, once it understands what you're asking for, will easily generate that story outline as many times as you want, with as many variations as you want. And changing a detail here or there is pretty simple in the outline stage, when the content is short and easy to digest.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith a rough outline in hand, I have the foundation for a story-driven workout that can be adapted to whatever exercises I want to do. Using a mix of my own creativity and ChatGPT, it wasn't hard to come up with in-story actions that matched each exercise. My planks became the action to crawl under some barbed wire. My offset overhead march with dumbbells? Carrying surveillance equipment. In short order, I had transformed my exercise list into a series of actions that fit within the frame an espionage mission.\n\nSince I already have a basic workout script written, all I need to do now is ask it to adapt each set of instructions into the story outline and in-story explanations that we've already discussed.\n\nGiving ChatGPT the scenario, the exercise descriptions, and the explanation of how each movement would fit into the story made it easy for ChatGPT to craft a story around this sequence of moves. But if you aren't feeling like doing the work of coming up with these specifics, you can always ask ChatGPT to do so \u2013 it's great at brainstorming!\n\nFinally, for an added bit of polish, I added the idea that all of this was being said to me through an earpiece, instructions from a handler that was observing me actions through satellite footage and hacked surveillance cameras. With their guidance and encouragement, I made my way through the mission.\n\nIs it a little goofy? Yeah, but so is exercise. If I'm going to crank through 30 minutes of repetitive motions, I much prefer doing it this way. And there's so many different stories I could insert myself into!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMaybe spies and secret missions aren't your thing. But you could put yourself into pretty much any scenario you can imagine. An astronaut on Mars. A pirate on a ship at sea. A vampire hunter in a monster-infested city. A superhero in battle. A certain Italian plumber that stomps on turtles while saving a princess. If there's a game or movie or other scenario you can imagine, ChatGPT can write it, or even help you brainstorm new settings and adventures you've never seen elsewhere.\n\nAnd since it's building these stories and actions around the workout you already put together, the story can change, but the exercise is still tailored to your workout goals and equipment requirements.\n\nAs you finalize your story workout, just copy and paste into a new document, until you're happy with the overall narrative. Once you're done, save the document as a PDF on your phone.\n\n4. Generate Your AI Workout Audio With ElevenLabs Reader\n\nWe've got one more ingredient needed to take this imaginative exercise routine into the gym with you, and that's audio. Now, I can only speak for myself here, but I don't have the budget to hire voice actors to read stories and workout instructions to me. But AI has a solution to that problem too!\n\nWith an app called Reader by ElevenLabs, we can get audio narration of whatever text we give it, including our guided workouts and crazy ChatGPT-written stories. When using the phone app, you can generate audio for as much text as you want, all for free. (If you opt for a premium membership, you can even customize voices, use multiple voices, and record and save audio.)\n\nTo feed your document to ElevenLabs Reader, you'll need to save the document to your phone. The app supports multiple file formats, but I've had the most success with PDF.\n\nHit the big plus button at the bottom of the main screen, then select \"Import File\" and select the saved document from your Google Drive or your phone's file storage. Once it's uploaded, you'll be able to find the document in the Reader app library.\n\nSelect the voice you want from the app's library of voices (which has options for gender, accent, and general tone), and you're off to the races. Or the recon mission. Or the dragon's lair. Or wherever your immersive audio workout takes you.\n\nNow that all the work is done, you can listen to that same workout anytime you want. And since it's all saved into a document you can edit, you can easily make changes to adjust the flow and pacing of instructions, fix irritating details in the story, or rewrite it in a new story entirely.\n\nWho knew that AI could transform my home gym into a thrilling spy adventure? But this experiment revealed that with a little creativity, today's AI tools can not only help you make an effective workout, they can turn it into an immersive, game-like experience that can be endlessly customized.\n\nCombine AI Tools and Create Amazing Things\n\nAny one of the tools I talked about above opens up all sorts of clever uses. Perplexity, for example, is an incredible tool for research and learning, with applications ranging from homework and study to professional fact-finding and upskilling. The combination of search and an LLM chat interface is surprisingly powerful, and I barely scratched the surface of what it can do. Everything I did in this story uses the free version \u2013 a premium membership unlocks all sorts of advanced capabilities.\n\nChatGPT's text generation is more well known at this point, but OpenAI is adding new functions and capabilities all the time. As of this writing, the company just announced that Canvas, a drafting tool for writing and programming, is now available to all users, including free accounts. With multimodal capabilities that include image generation, machine vision, and conversational voice interactions, ChatGPT is a powerful collection of tools on its own, and growing more powerful at a rapid clip.\n\nFinally, it's worth remembering that AI is a lot more than just text and image generation. ElevenLabs has created some really sophisticated AI narration tools, giving people access to quality spoken language that used to require voice actors and an expensive recording setup. That means that regular users can use it for everything from reading articles and papers, while creators can use the same voices to bring life to game characters, narrate videos and presentations, and more. One new feature in the Reader app lets you generate podcast-style discussions of the text you upload, similar to Google's NotebookLM.\n\nPerplexity, ChatGPT, and ElevenLabs each have unique strengths, but together they can do even more. And all of this was done using the free versions of these apps. No paid premium accounts, no expensive features.\n\nThis same combination of tools could be used for all sorts of applications beyond creative fitness routines.\n\nPersonalized bedtime stories for kids\n\nEngaging study materials and customized review\n\nPersonalized news briefings\n\nCustomized guided meditations\n\nFrom fitness to parenting, academics to personal development, there are myriad uses for AI when you start combining one tool with another.\n\nHow do you use AI to make your life easier?

They have been visiting the local hot spots of haunted encounters in the area. After investigating, which usually consists of staying a night in the so-called \u201chaunted houses\u201d Sanders then posts videos of the experience on to his Youtube channel, which can be found through the social media handle: CLS Paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a friend who lives out here and I came out here to visit him. I actually drove from Arizona and he asked me, because he watches my show, if I wanted to do a couple of ghost hunts out here. I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we\u2019ve done quite a few places,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander\u2019s visited such spots as Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \u201cintrigued\u201d by him than \u201caggressive\u201d Sanders said that was fine with him. He\u2019s still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of these places I\u2019ve done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they\u2019re more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I\u2019ve been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost-hunting places. Here in Lockport, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what\u2019s unknown \u2014 the big questions like, \u201cWhat happens when we die?\u201d \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There are millions of ghost-hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \u201cspirit dice,\u201d as well as white noise boxes and light-up \u201crem pods\u201d that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he\u2019s trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\u201cYou usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cA residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that\u2019s almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\u201cI walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014 but I asked them. I said, \u2018I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?\u2019 They all started laughing,\u201d he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \u201csomething\u201d in the attic.\n\n\u201cWe set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating, have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camerawoman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children who were haunting the second floor.\n\n\u201cShe was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \u201chaunted\u201d in the meantime.\n\n\u201cI will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they\u2019re off (for more ghost hunting trips),\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "When we think of the \u201cflying saucer\u201d film, we typically picture sci-fi terrors from the 1950s like Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, The Day The Earth Stood Still, and even War of the Worlds. It was an extremely popular subgenre at the time, and theaters were chock full of tales of mankind being threatened by spaceships shaped like dinner plates. But what is perhaps the first entry in the \u201cflying saucer\u201d genre is a far cry from what was to come: 1950\u2019s The Flying Saucer isn\u2019t about visitors from outer space \u2014 instead, it aims at replicating real world nightmares, and turning the paranormal into the paranoid.\n\nThe late 1940s had seen the craze over the flying saucer reach a fever pitch. People had reported seeing \u201cunidentified flying objects\u201d for centuries, but after World War II, it bloomed into an outright international obsession. This interest combined a lot of factors, the renewed popularity of science fiction in a post atomic world chiefly among them.\n\nBut also notable was the fear of foreign technology, only heightened by America\u2019s plummet into another \u201cRed Scare.\u201d The Truman Doctrine and other measures had taken aim at not just the Soviet Union from the outside, but what many Americans felt was a communist uprising from within. And nothing represented those anxieties on a mechanical scale quite like the flying saucer \u2014 a sleek, emotionless vehicle that was antithetical to what we knew of flying craft in the United States. Were they aliens from another planet planning for a global takeover? Dirty communists from across the world looking to spy on us? Considering the deranged highs achieved by this shared fascination, it was hard to tell them apart.\n\nThe Flying Saucer sought to comment on these blended fixations. It tells the story of rich playboy Mike Trent (played by Mikel Conrad, also the director) who, teaming with Secret Service agent Vee Langley, is tasked by American Intelligence to investigate reports of a flying saucer in Alaska. They soon discover that the saucer\u2019s creator is actually an American scientist, but his assistant is in connection with the Soviets, thus beginning a series of espionage-fueled encounters that place any science-fiction thrills in the backseat. Instead, The Flying Saucer zooms in on the burgeoning psychological warfare of the Cold War, and its stolen secrets and double agents.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why The Flying Saucer isn\u2019t as well-remembered as the more fantastical films to follow. The writing is scattershot \u2014 the Americans obviously have the moral and intellectual high ground in any situation, but they\u2019re also easily betrayed to a cartoonish extent, only realizing the subterfuge when it\u2019s staring them in the face. There\u2019s also not much spectacle to speak of \u2014 you gain more appreciation for scenic shots of the Alaskan wilderness than any special effects prowess. In the end, the Soviets are killed by an avalanche and the titular flying saucer blows up in midair due to a planted explosive, the result of which only garners a mild gasp from Vee Langley.\n\nA poster for The Flying Saucer. LMPC/LMPC/Getty Images\n\nBut though The Flying Saucer would disappear a few years after its release and its spot in pop culture was replaced by much more crowd-pleasing efforts, it did lay the seeds of a genre. A year later, The Day The Earth Stood Still would capture the rising tension of the feeling that the Earth was a button-push away from destruction, either from its own inhabitants or those from space. Two years after that, War of the Worlds would adjust H.G. Wells\u2019 original novel to fit the times, with an unfeeling enemy that might only be conquered with mutual nuclear destruction (though an atom bomb turns out to be of no use here). 1956\u2019s dual offerings of Earth vs. The Flying Saucers and Japan\u2019s Fearful Attack of the Flying Saucers (the latter directed by original Godzilla writer Shinichi Sekizawa) both reflect Cold War morbidities.\n\nInvaders from Mars, The Thing from Another World, and others joined in, many of which turned The Flying Saucer\u2019s plain-spoken anxious text into a subtext more palatable for the kids munching popcorn in the audience. Such was the path of the sci-fi laden \u201850s. Alongside the \u201cflying saucer\u201d genre was the \u201cgiant monster\u201d genre, and what started with potent odes to nuclear doom like Godzilla quickly devolved into a parade of enormous lizards and bugs trying to devour the countryside.\n\nHowever, one can find hints of something more culturally profound in The Flying Saucer. It is, by no means, an underrated or undiscovered classic, so filled as it is with exhausting dialogue and shots that look like they could\u2019ve come out of a commercial for an Alaskan Airbnb. But in a low-rent way, it stays true to something that had seeped into parts of America\u2019s collective consciousness \u2014 that we were not alone in the world and that something, be it spacecraft or Soviets, was watching us, either from within our midst or far, far up above."

            "article_content": "\n\n\n\nFew places in Hull are more packed with quirky sights and tales than General Cemetery.\n\nThe strange graveyard which runs alongside Spring Bank West is a bizarre place where the largely dilapidated headstones have been reclaimed by nature. There are even a couple of graves which have almost been swallowed up by tree trunks.\n\nThe land was developed as a cemetery in 1847 but the area has been left to become more of a wildlife haven in recent years. That has added to the mystique of the area.\n\nREAD MORE: Bridlington RNLI volunteers battle through thick fog to evacuate ill man miles out at sea\n\nREAD MORE: I try a Hull deli as I embark on a New Year's health kick - but get distracted by cake\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are the Quaker graves, the memorial to cholera victims and many strange tales behind the headstones. There are also plenty of fairy doors and other bizarre items if you look closely. But there is one tree which is truly curious.\n\nDeep in the grounds is the \"Penny Tree\", where hundreds of pennies are stuck to the trunk in long lines. The coins have been placed quite high up in the tree so you would need to be agile or have a ladder to get to them.\n\nThere are hundreds of the coins just below where the branches begin in a spiral form. But many of the coins appear to have been plucked out or have fallen out over time.\n\nThe Penny Tree in Hull General Cemetery\n\nAccording to this legend, anyone who climbs up and removes a penny will suffer bad luck. The story is a hoax, however, created by a local paranormal group and local artist Lee Sendall in the early 2000s who also etched a number of faces on some of the trees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther people have since used the tree to etch their own names and pictures into it. There are a number of faces and figures and even a dancing fairy.\n\nLee was also responsible for \u201cLittle Doug,\u201d a strange artefact put on display in Hull Maritime Museum in 2006. It looked like some alien foetus which was inspired by the mermaid exhibits of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe ''Little Doug'' exhibit by Lee Sendell at the Maritime Museum, Queen Victoria Square in Hull\n\nLee even created a back story to say it was brought over by a soldier from North Africa during the Second World War and was preserved by being buried in an allotment in Hull.\n\nHe is a colourful character who also threatened to sue the organisers of the London Olympics after claiming designs he submitted for an arts competition run by Olympics chiefs were ripped off by director of the opening ceremony Danny Boyle.\n\nHe submitted plans for a spiralled mound and a similar hill was then used in the opening ceremony which was supposedly based on Glastonbury Tor."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence marks a new era, with everyone vying to stay competitive. As the time is passing, the hype of generative AI is growing steadily. People are also investing in generative AI because they know that it is going to bring a lot of opportunities for them. Pitchbook TechCrunch conducted an analysis about the investments in generative AI and it was found that a total of $56 billion have been funded to AI companies from different VCs in 2024. These fundings have been done for various AI powered tools, like AI apps, services, images, videos, texts, speech, audio and much more. It just means that AI is going to be on everything soon and many companies are securing their future for that.A total of 885 deals have been done in 2024 between different AI companies and VCs. In 2023, 691 deals had been done and only $29.1 billion had been invested in AI. Now, the investments have risen 192% from 2023, and it doesn't seem that it will slow down anytime soon. Many AI companies like Anthropic, OpenAI and xAI have been taking billions of funds to make more generative AI based products. In Q4 2024, a total of $31.1 billion deals had been done. Some notable generative AI investments were Anthropic's $4 billion Strategic Investment from Amazon, Databricks\u2019 $10 billion series J, OpenAI\u2019s $6.6 billion round and xAI\u2019s $6 billion Series C.There were only $951 million acquisitions and mergers of generative AI in 2024, with some deals made by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. $2.7 billion were funded by Google on CharacterAI\u2019s staff\u2019s hiring and licensing their technology. On the other hand, $650 million was given by Microsoft to the CEO of Inflection to license their AI models. Startups outside the USA took $6.2 billion of VC investments in 2024, with China based Monoshot AI taking $1 billion, Cologne based company DeepL taking $300 million and French based AI company taking $640 million.In 2025, it seems that AI startups are going to become very saturated, and only some major AI developing coding assistants will be able to get big funds. Investors want to see good revenue growth in the companies they are investing in and there are some technical challenges too that may not let some startups make the cut for funds. Only the AI companies with good fundings will be able to grow as they need advanced technologies and data centers to produce AI products.Read next:"

            "article_content": "Understanding community safety through accurate crime data helps residents make informed decisions about where to live and work. Law enforcement experts and data analysts provide several reliable methods for accessing and interpreting local crime statistics, emphasizing the importance of using official sources for accurate information.\n\nOfficial data sources\n\nLocal police departments serve as primary sources for accurate crime information. Most departments maintain public websites featuring detailed crime reports categorized by neighborhood or zip code. These resources typically include annual reports, current crime statistics, and specific details about homicides and other violent crimes within their jurisdictions.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies often provide sections labeled \u201cCrime Statistics\u201d or \u201cAnnual Reports\u201d on their websites. These comprehensive documents include detailed information about homicides, property crimes, and arrests within specific timeframes, allowing residents to track patterns and trends in their areas.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Crime Data Explorer provides comprehensive nationwide statistics. This federal database allows users to filter information by location and specific crime types, offering valuable insights into local safety patterns and trends over time. The platform\u2019s design enables detailed analysis of murder rates and other violent crimes across different regions.\n\nCity resources\n\nMany metropolitan areas maintain public crime dashboards that display current statistics. These platforms often provide interactive maps and regular updates about criminal activities within specific neighborhoods. City officials emphasize the importance of these tools for maintaining community awareness and safety.\n\nThese dashboards typically offer real-time or near-real-time updates, allowing residents to monitor recent criminal activities in their areas. Many systems include features for comparing crime rates across different neighborhoods or zip codes, providing valuable context for understanding local safety conditions.\n\nThird-party platforms\n\nSeveral independent organizations aggregate crime data into user-friendly formats. NeighborhoodScout compiles information from multiple sources to create detailed safety profiles for specific areas. The platform includes crime rates, risk indexes, and comparative analysis tools that help residents understand their neighborhood\u2019s safety level.\n\nCrimeMapping.com utilizes official police data to generate interactive maps showing recent criminal activities. Users can customize searches to focus specifically on homicides or other violent crimes within their zip codes. The platform provides regular updates and historical data for comprehensive analysis.\n\nSpotCrime offers another valuable resource, featuring interactive maps highlighting recent crimes, including violent offenses. The platform allows users to set up alerts for real-time updates about criminal activities in their areas, helping residents stay informed about potential safety concerns.\n\nUnderstanding statistics\n\nCrime analysts emphasize the importance of proper data interpretation. Population size significantly affects crime rates, particularly in smaller communities where few incidents can dramatically impact statistical representations. Experts recommend examining murder rates calculated per 100,000 residents while considering the community\u2019s total population for context.\n\nLaw enforcement experts recommend examining trends over extended periods, typically five to ten years, rather than focusing on isolated incidents or short-term fluctuations. This longitudinal approach provides more accurate insights into community safety patterns and helps identify meaningful trends in violent crime rates.\n\nContextual analysis\n\nSecurity specialists stress the importance of comparing local statistics with surrounding areas. This broader perspective helps residents better understand their neighborhood\u2019s relative safety within the larger community context. Experts recommend evaluating multiple adjacent zip codes to gain a comprehensive understanding of regional safety patterns.\n\nCrime prevention experts note that not all incidents appear in official records. Understanding these limitations helps residents make more informed decisions about their safety and security measures. They emphasize the importance of using multiple data sources to create a more complete picture of local safety conditions.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nLaw enforcement officials encourage resident participation in safety initiatives. Many police departments host regular community meetings to discuss crime trends and prevention strategies. These gatherings provide opportunities for direct interaction with local law enforcement and often include detailed discussions of recent criminal activities and prevention efforts.\n\nNeighborhood watch programs often maintain additional crime tracking resources. These community-based initiatives frequently offer detailed insights into local safety concerns and prevention efforts, complementing official data sources with ground-level observations and reports.\n\nDigital resources\n\nModern technology provides various tools for staying informed about local crime. Many communities use alert systems like Nixle to share real-time updates about criminal activities and safety concerns. These platforms often allow users to customize notifications based on location and crime type.\n\nSocial media platforms have become increasingly important for tracking local safety information. Law enforcement agencies regularly use these channels to communicate with residents about ongoing investigations, safety concerns, and crime prevention strategies.\n\nPractical applications\n\nUnderstanding local crime statistics supports various decision-making processes:\n\nInformed decision-making becomes crucial when relocating or choosing schools. Property owners can implement appropriate security measures based on specific crime patterns in their areas. Community organizations can develop targeted safety initiatives addressing local concerns.\n\nMoving forward\n\nAccessing and understanding local crime statistics represents an important step toward community safety. Regular monitoring of crime data helps residents stay informed about safety trends while enabling proactive participation in local crime prevention efforts.\n\nThis knowledge empowers residents to make informed choices about their safety while contributing to broader community security initiatives. Through consistent monitoring and engagement with available resources, community members can work together to create safer neighborhoods for everyone.\n\nThis story was created using AI technology."

This will help you decide what's in and what's not based on runway trends seen at Ala\u00efa, Miu Miu, Gucci, Valentino, Fendi and more.\n\nThe good thing with trending colours is that there's something for everyone. For example, if you're trying to step out of your comfort zone, you will be surprised to see how certain shades of pink, orange and yellow will continue to be present in Spring-Summer 2025 fashion. If you're determined to dress in a more practical, comfortable and versatile way, you will surely welcome shades such as champagne beige, black and white.\n\nWhat are the trending colours of 2025?\n\nChocolate Brown (Mocha Mousse)\n\nDeep Black\n\nScarlet Red\n\nButter Yellow\n\nMandarin Orange\n\nChampagne Beige\n\nPink (flamingo to pastel)\n\nMoss Green\n\nWhite\n\nWine (Burgundy)\n\nChocolate Brown (Mocha Mousse)\n\nGucci WWD/Getty Images Max Mara Victor VIRGILE/Getty Images\n\nCoach WWD/Getty Images Dries Van Noten Courtesy Dries Van Noten\n\nPantone declared Mocha Mousse as the colour of the year for 2025, \"a rich brown hue infused with the refinement of the earth\". Chocolate coffee is associated with nature and a feeling of warmth and indulgence.\n\nThis is a common shade in leather and suede fabrics. Although, this year it will be seen in light garments such as chiffon, in dresses as shown by Gucci, but also in skirt designs ideal for the office, as confirmed by Max Mara.\n\nTraditionally, in fashion, chocolate brown has been associated with pants, but in 2025 it will also be worn in asymmetrical dresses, as seen at Ala\u00efa, in miniskirts as at Coach, or in trench coats over dresses, as seen on Dries Van Noten's first runway without the Belgian designer at the helm.\n\nDeep Black\n\nAltuzurra Altuzarra Chanel Victor VIRGILE/Getty Images\n\nVictoria Beckham Valentino Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images\n\nBlack is a classic and elegant colour for all four seasons. Although it is preferred for evening events, it also becomes a wild card for the day, because you can always count on it to avoid any misstep. The protagonist of the little black dress, defines the codes of sophistication and hedonism.\n\nThis year it continues to be worn in tailored suits as well as in long and short dresses. We saw it both at Valentino and Victoria Beckham. And while many people might find it uninteresting, the reality is that it can always be quite the opposite through silhouette and textures."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "Luiz Rocha was scuba diving 460 feet beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean when a flash caught his eye: a small damselfish with big eyes, perched on a colorful reef.\n\nRocha, a scientist and curator at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, thought the fish was so unusual that it might actually be an undiscovered species. Two years later, he was able to confirm his suspicions with a team of researchers, and described his find in a paper published last month.\n\nThe damselfish, officially Chromis abadhah, is one of 138 animals, fungi and plants from around the world that Academy of Sciences researchers confirmed as new discoveries in 2024. They include 31 other fishes, dozens of bugs, an endangered dahlia, two deep-water ghost sharks, and a striped spider from Madagascar. The Academy is just one of many institutions globally that document new species.\n\nThese new-to-science specimens were spotted by scientists like Rocha in their habitats on several continents and in the waters around them and confirmed in a long, scientific process called \u201cdescription.\u201d\n\nScientists who discover new species have the honor of naming them. This year\u2019s list includes a \u201cplant bug\u201d named after outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris: Pseudoloxops kamalaharrisae, a yellow creature with long antennae found in French Polynesia. Another bug was named for actor Harrison Ford. Academy researcher Brad Balukjian, who co-discovered both, said in a news release that he wanted to honor the politician\u2019s and celebrity\u2019s commitments to conservation and climate science.\n\nShannon Bennett, a virologist and chief of science at the Academy, said the discoveries speak to humanity\u2019s responsibility to catalog and conserve Earth\u2019s rich biodiversity. Species are being snuffed out because of human activity at a terrifying rate \u2014 so fast that scientists call this era a \u201cmass extinction,\u201d like the asteroid that took out dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\n\u201cYou cannot care about what you don\u2019t know about,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nScientists estimate that they\u2019ve discovered just one-tenth of the planet\u2019s species, Bennett said. Typically, researchers come across new creatures while examining something else. That\u2019s how Rocha came across the sleek damselfish two years ago.\n\nAn expert in deep-water scuba diving, Rocha trekked to the Maldives, a tiny island country in the Indian Ocean, to survey its deep reefs.\n\nThese colorful bands of coral lie at depths between 100 feet and 500 feet and, like many of the world\u2019s deep reefs, had never been seen by humans, Rocha said.\n\nWater filters enough light at that depth that divers call it the \u201ctwilight zone.\u201d But the distinctive damselfish, white-and-blue hued with elegant fins, caught Rocha\u2019s eye.\n\nRocha snapped a photo and returned the next day. Because the fish were abundant, he collected four specimens for later study. It was a long journey, and the fish did not survive. Rocha could only spend eight minutes at that depth to save enough time for a four-hour ascent to the surface, rising slowly to avoid a dangerous buildup of gases known as \u201cthe bends.\u201d\n\nRocha had a hunch that the species was new to science but needed confirmation. What followed was a lengthy process, in which he and a team of Academy researchers studied the fish\u2019s traits and compared them to others. The results were published in the peer-reviewed journal ZooKeys.\n\nTo name the fish, Rocha collaborated with Maldivian locals and settled on a name in a local tongue: \u201cabadhah,\u201d which translates as \u201cperpetual.\u201d Rocha wants the species and its colorful habitat to be everlasting, he said, and he hopes the name will inspire conservation efforts. Even though humans had never before laid eyes on the deep reef where he found the damselfish, the signs of over-fishing, plastics and pollution were obvious, Rocha said.\n\nOther water-dwelling animals confirmed as new discoveries this year include a goby found in Bali, Indonesia, that resides in giant sponges; a slew of marine worms; eerie ghost sharks that live at deep depths; and a tiny pipehorse the size of a golf tee found in South Africa.\n\nOn land, the discoveries include a brilliantly colored dahlia in the Mexican state of Oaxaca that\u2019s critically endangered \u2014 a rare distinction \u2014 and a 100-million-year-old fossil of a skink \u2014 a kind of lizard \u2014 that was preserved in amber in Myanmar.\n\nBennett said that the rate of confirmations this year is about average. She expects \u201cmany, many more\u201d in 2025."

            "article_content": "It began last June, when a worker at a limestone quarry in southeast England felt \"unusual bumps\" as he was digging up clay.\n\nNow a team of over 100 researchers from the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford have determined that the mysterious bumps found at Dewars Farm Quarry in Oxfordshire were in fact dinosaur tracks dating back to the Middle Jurassic period, around 166 million years ago.\n\nPaleontologists say the some 200 footprints discovered along five different trails offer new insights into certain dinosaurs' size and speed.\n\nUniversity of Birmingham From left: Excavation site researchers Kirsty Edgar, Richard Butler, Duncan Murdock, Alice Roberts and Emma Nicholls\n\n\"All of the dinosaurs, based on our estimates of speed, were probably walking rather than running,\" said Kirsty Edgar, a professor of micropalaeontology at the University of Birmingham who worked on the discovery site.\n\nEdgar told NPR that the environment for the dinosaurs at the time \"was probably lagoonal, probably looked something like the Florida Keys today.\"\n\nResearchers uncovered five trackways buried in the mud, the longest one measuring nearly 500 feet in length. Four of the trackways were made by long-necked herbivorous sauropods, suspected to be the giant 60-foot, two-ton Cetiosaurus, while a fifth set was made by a carnivorous Megalosaurus.\n\nThe Megalosaurus, a ferocious 30-foot-long predator, is famous for its distinctive large three-toed feet with claws. It is also the first dinosaur to ever be scientifically named, in 1824, by Oxford geologist William Buckland. Buckland's unusual fossil discovery kicked off what is now more than 200 years of dinosaur research.\n\nCaroline Wood / University of Oxford The footprint of what is believed to be a Megalosaurus, a carnivorous 30-foot dinosaur known for its distinctive large three-toed feet with claws.\n\nOne area of the excavation site showed the Megalosaurus and sauropod tracks crossing over, raising additional questions about how and if the two species interacted.\n\n\"Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist at Oxford Museum of Natural History.\n\nEach Megalosaurus track was around 25 inches long, with a stride of about 8.8 feet. Based on those measurements, scientists estimate the dinosaur walked at a pace of around 3 miles per hour, similar to an average adult human walking speed. They believe the sauropods walked at a similar pace.\n\nTracks were first discovered in the area in 1997, when limestone quarry workers stumbled upon more than 40 sets of dinosaur footprints, with some trackways reaching up to nearly 600 feet in length. The British government named the Oxfordshire site as one of the most important dinosaur track sites in the world, with the discovery providing major pieces of evidence about the species of dinosaurs that roamed the U.K. during the Middle Jurassic Period.\n\nDuring the latest excavation, researchers captured more than 20,000 images of the 200 footprints.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR"

            "article_content": "Researchers have discovered that a machine learning (ML) model, using dynamic ensemble selection (DES), outperforms experienced pulmonologists in cancer lung diagnosis. Lung cancer is the cause of cancer deaths in the world, mainly due to late detection. Improving survival rates is dependent on the early detection approach. A recent study was conducted by Ricco N. and colleagues which was published in the journal of Scientific Reports .\n\nThis was a retrospective analysis of data from 38,944 patients suspected to have LC within the Region of Southern Denmark from 2009 to 2018. The study included 9,940 patients with complete data, with 2,505 (25%) diagnosed with LC. The DES model involved smoking history and key blood biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, total calcium, sodium levels, leukocyte and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein. It was compared against the performance of five pulmonologists in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and others.\n\nKey Findings:\n\nModel Performance:\n\nThe DES model resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77\u00b10.01.\n\nSensitivity: 76.2%\u00b12.04%, 6.5% better than the average pulmonologist.\n\nSpecificity: 63.8%\u00b12.3%.\n\nPositive predictive value (PPV): 41.6%\u00b11.2%.\n\nF1-score: 53.8%\u00b11.0%.\n\nComparison with Pulmonologists:\n\nDEs model outperformed all the five pulmonologists, while sensitivity was exceptionally high, particularly for early-stage detection.\n\nSignificant Biomarkers:\n\nSmoking status, LDH, serum calcium levels, low sodium levels, leucocytes, neutrophil count and CRP values were the strongest predictors of LC.\n\nThe DES ML model clearly outperformed pulmonologists in detecting lung cancer with higher sensitivity and identification of critical biomarkers for risk stratification. These findings show the ability of ML in changing the current landscape of early detection strategies for improving outcomes for patients at risk of LC. ML-driven models integrated into health care could provide decision-making support to clinicians and may decrease the rate of late-stage cancer diagnosis.\n\nReference:"

Trump tell it, he is about to take over a nation ravaged by crisis, a desolate hellscape of crime, chaos and economic hardship. \u201cOur Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World!\u201d he declared on social media last week.\n\nBut by many traditional metrics, the America that Mr. Trump will inherit from President Biden when he takes the oath for a second time, two weeks from Monday, is actually in better shape than that bequeathed to any newly elected president since George W. Bush came into office in 2001.\n\nFor the first time since that transition 24 years ago, there will be no American troops at war overseas on Inauguration Day. New data reported in the past few days indicate that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Mr. Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been."

            "article_content": "Despite some episodic spikes here and there, the economy of Bangladesh is still struggling, and the government isn't sure what the top priority should be. Businesses are under pressure as inflation rises beyond 9 percent and GDP growth slows to 5.2 percent in FY24 with further downward trend.\n\nAs we know, family-run and promoter-led firms dominate the Bangladesh economy, especially in the textile, export and manufacturing industries. Nearly 4 million people work in the readymade garment industry alone. Many company leaders/owners have been put behind bars or are absconding due to recent upheavals, which have interrupted operations and made decision-making more time-consuming. Further degradation will cause closures, pay reductions, and rapid layoffs.\n\nIn response to similar problems, nations like Vietnam and India offered financial aid and tax breaks to save domestic companies. But Bangladesh rather eliminated incentives and reportedly raising taxes, which may make recovery far more challenging.\n\nWhat's at stake if large companies fail?\n\nThe collapse of large companies would shock Bangladesh's job market. Over 80 percent of formal occupations are directly or indirectly related to these companies. Layoffs will cause families to experience immediate financial instability and income loss.\n\nNot only the manufacturing industry but also transporters, raw material suppliers, port personnel, and logistics providers would all see a sharp drop in business, which would result in a large number of job losses. The loss of jobs in the unorganised sector, which is heavily reliant on the spending power of those in corporate occupations, would make poverty worse.\n\nThe economy as a whole will suffer from a deteriorating labour market. As incomes decline, consumer spending will also decline, which will force more businesses to shut down or scale back operations. There will be more protests and strikes, which will lead to higher unemployment rates and more instability in society. Similar periods of political and economic instability have been experienced by nations like Pakistan and Sri Lanka as a result of delayed interventions. Bangladesh is unable to afford to take the same path.\n\nWhat the government must do now\n\nLarge companies and promoters need immediate breathing space to survive. The government must step in with low-interest loans, deferred taxes, and grace periods for repayments. Vietnam saved thousands of businesses this way. Bangladesh must act similarly to prevent layoffs and closures. Investment incentives must also be restored to attract capital and revive confidence in economic zones that are now stagnant.\n\nThe workforce needs skill development badly. Mismatched skills keep 40 percent of graduates unemployed. The 'Skill India' mission trained millions and increased employment. Bangladesh must duplicate such initiatives to prepare its workers.\n\nReviving clothing export orders necessitates careful attention. Simplifying trade regulations, offering export incentives, and lowering transportation costs can all help. Vietnam invested $1.2 billion in textiles to compete; Bangladesh must do the same or risk falling behind.\n\nEqually important is simplifying regulations. Endless red tape slows corporate growth and hiring. To grow and stabilise employment, the government must streamline processes.\n\nA last chance to act\n\nBangladesh's large companies don't just create jobs -- they sustain entire ecosystems. If these companies collapse, millions of jobs will vanish, poverty rates will spike, and social unrest will escalate. Countries like Vietnam and India acted fast to prevent such outcomes with bold interventions. Bangladesh, however, risks falling further behind if it continues to delay action.\n\nThe time for hesitation is over. The government must step up with financial support, regulatory reforms, and investment incentives to protect jobs and stabilise corporations. Employment must be prioritised to prevent economic disaster and ensure Bangladesh's long-term recovery. Reconstituting boards or temporarily releasing funds to ailing banks would not help. Business continuity, including corporate and large loan restructuring for distressed companies, is key here. Policy makers need to think beyond and act sensibly.\n\nThe author is chairman of Financial Excellence Ltd"

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nSomething to look forward to: Since AMD introduced its Ryzen 9000 series and Strix Point Ryzen AI processors, users have been eagerly anticipating other members of the Zen 5 family, such as Ryzen AI Max and Fire Range. Now, ECS has become the first manufacturer to confirm plans to unveil a product featuring AMD's mainstream-focused Krackan Point chips at CES 2025.\n\nECS is set to showcase the first laptop featuring AMD's upcoming Krackan Point APUs at CES 2025. AMD has already confirmed that Krackan Point is designed to offer a low-cost entry point into Microsoft's Copilot+ PC standard, positioning it to compete with Intel's Lunar Lake Core Ultra 200V series.\n\nThe processor powering the ECS UP42KP laptop is likely the Ryzen AI 7 350. The manufacturer's description matches the rumored specifications of this chip, which include four Zen 5 cores, four Zen 5c cores, an integrated GPU with eight RDNA 3.5 compute units, and an XDNA 2 NPU capable of 40 TOPs \u2013 meeting the threshold required for Copilot.\n\nWith a TDP ranging from 15W to 54W, the 14-inch 1080p laptop supports DDR5-5600 RAM, 16 PCIe lanes, Wi-Fi 6, HDMI 2.1, and USB 4. It also supports Windows Hello via an IR camera with a privacy shutter. While the release date and pricing details remain unclear, AMD aims for Krackan Point devices to retail for under $800.\n\nThe Ryzen AI 7 350 is the most powerful Krackan Point APU announced so far, but a lower-tier version \u2013 the AI 5 340 \u2013 was spotted on Geekbench last November. This cheaper variant will maintain the AI 7 350's NPU performance but feature three Zen 5 cores, three Zen 5c cores, and a Radeon 840M iGPU with four RDNA 3.5 CUs.\n\nKrackan Point sits just below Strix Point in AMD's Zen 5 lineup. Since its debut late last year, Strix Point APUs, such as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375, have started appearing in the latest handheld gaming PCs. Lenovo is expected to unveil a device featuring the Z2 Extreme variant at CES.\n\nRyzen AI Max, featuring up to 16 Zen 5 cores and 40 RDNA 3.5 CUs, is the next step up. A benchmark of an engineering sample was recently spotted running on an upcoming high-end 2-in-1 notebook from Asus.\n\nUsers are also eagerly awaiting the launch of AMD's Fire Range, the company's most powerful Zen 5 laptop processors. A recent Geekbench AI test suggests they will debut in Asus' 2025 ROG Strix G-series laptops.\n\nIn the desktop sector, AMD is also set to unveil new Ryzen 9000 X3D CPUs this month. TechSpot recently named last year's 9800X3D the best gaming CPU, and it has outpaced all of its non-X3D counterparts in sales at Mindfactory.\n\nThe new ECS Krackan Point laptop will be accompanied by a new Snapdragon X Plus notebook, a mini PC, and new Intel motherboards."

            "article_content": "As Oman positions itself as the Middle East's digital gateway, connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, the nation is witnessing an unprecedented transformation in its business landscape. This strategic evolution, backed by substantial infrastructure investments and clear government vision, is creating remarkable opportunities for businesses and professionals alike.\n\nOur nation's geographical advantage, with its extensive coastline outside the Strait of Hormuz, has become a powerful asset in the digital age. The network of 21 submarine telecom cables and five landing stations provides direct access to over 46 countries, creating a robust digital highway that's attracting global technology companies and empowering local businesses.\n\nThis digital infrastructure is revolutionizing how Omani businesses operate. With 13 state-of-the-art data centers and a growing cloud services market, companies of all sizes are finding new ways to digitalize their operations cost-effectively. The impact is particularly significant for our small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which can now access world-class digital services without massive capital investments.\n\nThis strategic evolution is creating remarkable opportunities for businesses and professionals alike. Image for illustration only.\n\nThe numbers tell a compelling story. Our ICT market is projected to grow from US$5.02 billion in 2023 to US$8.33 billion by 2028, while the e-commerce sector is expected to expand at an impressive 13.54% through 2028. These figures represent more than just market growth \u2013 they signify thousands of new opportunities for Omani entrepreneurs and businesses.\n\nHigh-speed internet penetration, reaching 74.39%, is enabling our SMEs to compete globally. Local businesses are launching e-commerce platforms, implementing digital payment solutions, and leveraging cloud-based tools to streamline their operations. This digital accessibility is leveling the playing field, allowing smaller enterprises to compete effectively with larger organizations.\n\nThe employment landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation. New career opportunities are emerging across various technology domains, from digital infrastructure management to cloud solutions architecture, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Young Omanis are increasingly gravitating toward these technology-related careers, meeting the growing demand for digital expertise.\n\nOur government's Vision 2040 digital initiatives are providing crucial support for this transformation. With the Digital Transformation Program already achieving a 53% completion rate, we're seeing tangible progress in creating a comprehensive framework for digital growth. This includes streamlined business registration processes, enhanced e-government services, and robust support for technology startups.\n\nThe ripple effects of this digital revolution extend across traditional sectors. Manufacturing companies are implementing smart factory solutions, logistics firms are digitalizing their supply chains, and healthcare providers are embracing telemedicine. The retail sector is adopting omnichannel platforms, while educational institutions are developing e-learning solutions.\n\nFor entrepreneurs and investors, specific opportunities are emerging in digital payment solutions, cloud computing services, cybersecurity, data analytics, and IoT applications. The digital infrastructure is also attracting foreign direct investment, contributing significantly to our GDP growth and economic diversification efforts.\n\nLooking ahead, Oman's digital ecosystem will drive economic diversification through technology sector growth, digital service exports to the MENA region, and the development of digital entrepreneurship. The establishment of technology parks and innovation centers is fostering a startup culture and attracting international talent, creating a vibrant environment for innovation and growth.\n\nWhile Oman's digital transformation presents exciting opportunities, it's important to recognize the accompanying challenges. Businesses must proactively address cybersecurity risks, bridge skills gaps through training and development, and ensure compliance with evolving digital regulations. The government's proactive initiatives in establishing comprehensive frameworks and support programs are instrumental in helping businesses navigate these challenges and thrive in this new digital era.\n\nTo further enhance this progress, it's essential to leverage the potential of academic institutions and research centers in fostering innovation and driving technological advancements. These institutions play a crucial role in nurturing groundbreaking ideas and solutions. By increasing their focus on research and development (R&D), they can empower Omani students and youth to actively contribute to the nation's digital landscape. This includes providing them with opportunities to commercialize their research findings and develop homegrown technologies that address local challenges.\n\nThis approach not only reduces reliance on foreign technologies but also fosters a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship within the country. Academic institutions must prioritize R&D, allocate sufficient budgets, and collaborate with industry partners to translate research outcomes into market-ready solutions. This will accelerate Oman's digital transformation and create a sustainable ecosystem for technological innovation and economic growth.\n\nThe message for Omani businesses and professionals is clear: the time to capitalize on our digital transformation is now. The combination of world-class infrastructure, government support, and growing market demand creates an ideal environment for digital business success. As we progress toward becoming a leading digital economy in the region, the opportunities for growth, innovation, and success will only expand.\n\nThis digital revolution represents more than technological advancement \u2013 it's a comprehensive economic transformation that's reshaping our future. For businesses, investors, and job seekers, Oman's digital landscape offers a wealth of opportunities. Our digital future isn't just a vision \u2013 it's a reality unfolding today, creating new pathways for sustainable growth and prosperity in the global digital economy."

I called his father and said ''you need to get over here right now'.'\"\n\nAdvert\n\nIt was later found that Cohee dismembered, decapitated, and mutilated the 69-year-old's body before keeping his head and hands in separate plastic bags in his wardrobe.\n\nA further investigation discovered that he had attempted to get rid of Barnes' body by putting it into the trunk of his car and drinking it into the Colorado River.\n\nAfter being called to the residence, police had a chat with Cohee, who admitted that he'd murdered Barnes 'with a knife'.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe police say in the video: \"Your parents have concerns over some stuff they may have found in your room? What would that be?\"\n\nTo which Cohee replied: \"Yeah, I believe so, a human head and hands. From that fella that went missing. I murdered him with a knife.\u201d\n\nWhen asked 'why would you have done that', he replied: \"I always wondered what murder would feel like.\u201d\n\nHowever, the extent of his planning would soon come to light.\n\nAdvert\n\nCohee admitted on tape to decapitating Warren Barnes (YouTube/EXPLORE WITH US)\n\nCohee revealed that it was six months in the making, as he said: \"I was driving around and I see a shape and I am like 'oh interesting'. I'm like that's a homeless person, so I grabbed my knife, I put on three layers of gloves because plastic gloves can betray their users because they're so thin, I took the knife I pulled back the canvas and I stabbed his neck.\n\n\"He was panicking at first in, he was saying what are you doing, what are you doing why, why, and I just kept on stabbing his neck.\u201d\n\nHe later claimed he'd killed Barnes because he \u2018wanted to\u2019 and also decapitated him for \u2018the hell of it\u2019."

I was covered with blood and dust. Bodie\u2019s busy population was pushing and plodding, and its great mines and mills have a glorious future. After being fixed up in liniment and splints, the doctor and myself went into a saloon. As I entered the sidewalk, I met a jubilant man from Bodie who yelled as he grasped my hand, \u201cWhoa, old son, shake; put \u2018er here; \u2026 this is a bully town, 10 funerals today and a man just fell down the Bulwer shaft for a starter. I started a \u201chash mill,\u201d but worked too hard, caught cold, got pneumonia and a French cook both at once.\n\nPant then lit out for green fields and pastures new and a country with more of Treadway\u2019s nutriment and less of undertaker\u2019s amusement.\n\n130 Years Ago\n\nSocial gossip: The Phonograph Ball on New Year\u2019s Eve drew a large crowd for novel entertainment.

It was under the auspices of Mrs. Bowers and her lady friends. It was a very elegant affair and a greater part of the elite of Washoe County were there. The admission fee of $5 was charged to the invited guests and gentlemen. All the administration of the affairs of the ball was in the hands of the ladies. This was a great ball, and as high-toned as it was peculiar.\n\n140 Years Ago\n\nHank Monk astonished: Charley Parkhurst, a well-known stage driver on the coast and one of the acknowledged crack whips, died near Watsonville. When the remains were being laid out the astounding discovery was made that Parkhurst was a woman. She had been known on the coast for 25 years, and the most astonishing part of the business is that she could have kept the secret so long. Parkhurst used to be with Hank Monk a good deal in the early days and when Hank heard the report, he gasped for breath and drawled out: \u201cJe-hosiphat. I camped out with Parkie once for over a week, and we slept on the same buffalo robe right along. Wonder if Curley Bill\u2019s been playin\u2019 me the same way.\u201d\n\n130 Years Ago\n\nSocial gossip: A party of 15 people drove down the prison road in a mysterious manner to catch the Culloughs napping; it was a surprise party. The sleighs drew up in front of the prison and a broad sheet of light from the doors and windows shown out across the glistening snow. Mr. and Mrs. Cullough stood waiting on the steps to receive their guests. A moment of truth flashed upon the sleigh riders \u2014 that they were the only ones surprised. This little party are convinced that Mr. McCullough and wife are the pleasantest people in town to visit, but they are also the most difficult to catch napping.\n\n70 Years Ago\n\nAdvertisement: \u201cCarson Theater \u2014 \u2018Sabrina\u2019 with William Holden, Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart.

The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings.

They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "A new breakthrough may help scientists solve some of the mysteries of the quantum realm.\n\nFor the first time, physicists have been able to measure the geometrical 'shape' a lone electron adopts as it moves through a solid. It's an achievement that will unlock a whole new way of studying how crystalline solids behave on a quantum level.\n\n\"We've essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn't be obtained before,\" says physicist Riccardo Comin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThe research was led by physicists Mingu Kang \u2013 formerly of MIT and now at Cornell University \u2013 and Sunjie Kim of Seoul National University.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWithin the physical Universe, matter behaves in ways that are well described by classical physics.\n\nHowever, on a more fundamental level of particle interactions and methods of measurement, things can get a little weird. On the finest of scales, precision must give way to a more fuzzy description represented by waves of possibility known as quantum mechanics.\n\nWe refer to objects like electrons as particles, and that conveys the impression that they are like teeny tiny little balls. Given their size, the properties and behaviors of electrons are far more accurately described by their wave-like quantum nature.\n\nTo describe the wave aspect of electrons, physicists use wave functions: mathematical models that describe the properties of the wave as evolving possibilities of finding the particle in a specific place with specific features.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome of these features we can think of as a kind of geometry, often not unlike a curve or sphere that rotates in an infinite number of directions. Other forms of quantum geometry, like those of electrons in a lattice of atoms, are as complicated as a Klein bottle or a M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nDetermining some aspects of the messy quantum geometry of an electron in a solid has previously involved a lot of guesswork based on properties that physicists can measure.\n\nTo measure the quantum geometry of electrons, Kang, Jie, and their colleagues sought the measurement of a property known as the quantum geometric tensor, or QGT. This is a physical quantity that encodes the entire geometric information of a quantum state, similar to the way a two-dimensional hologram encodes information about a three-dimensional space.\n\nThe technique they used is called angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in which photons are fired at a material to dislodge electrons and measure their properties, such as polarization, spin, and angle.\n\nTheoretical (j, m) and real (k, l) measurements of quantum geometry. (Kang et al., Nat. Phys., 2024)\n\nThis was directed at single crystals of a cobalt-tin alloy, a material known as a kagome metal \u2013 a quantum material whose properties the team had previously investigated using the same technique.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe results provided the researchers with the first measurement of the QGT in a solid, and from this, they were able to infer the rest of the quantum geometry of the electrons in the metal.\n\nThe team compared this to theoretically derived quantum geometry for the same material, allowing them to determine the usefulness of estimating the geometry compared to measuring it directly.\n\nAnd, they say, their technique will be applicable to a broad range of materials, not just the cobalt-tin alloy used for this study. It's a result that will have some interesting implications. For example, quantum geometry could be leveraged to discover superconductivity in materials where it is not usually found.\n\n\"The geometric interpretation of quantum mechanics underpins many recent advances in condensed-matter physics,\" an anonymous expert told Nature Physics.\n\n\"These authors have pioneered a methodology to experimentally access the quantum geometric tensor, which fundamentally characterizes the geometric properties of quantum states. The developed methodology is straightforward, applicable to various solid-state materials, and has great potential for boosting experimental activity in pursuit of geometric understanding of novel quantum phenomena.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe team's research has been published in Nature Physics.\n\nRelated News"

            "article_content": "Swami Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna |\n\nHaridwar, January 5: In the presence of Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj, the President of Patanjali Yogpeeth, and Acharya Balkrishna, the General Secretary, the 30th foundation day of the Patanjali institution was celebrated at the Yog Bhavan Auditorium, located at Patanjali Wellness, Haridwar. In the program, with the presence of more than 6,000 officials from the Patanjali Yogpeeth organization across the country, Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj gave an introduction to the 30 years of service, struggle, and dedication and shed light on the future plans of Patanjali Yogpeeth. While announcing the five revolutions after the success of the Yoga Revolution, he said that Patanjali will initiate significant work for freedom in education, healthcare, economy, intellectual-cultural freedom, and liberation from diseases, indulgences, shame, and frustrations.\n\nFirst Revolution: Freedom in Education\n\nHe said that today, 50 to 90, and in some places, 99 percent educated individuals are unemployed, addicted, characterless, and dull children, whose childhood, youth, and our lineage are in danger. We have decided that first in India and then in the entire world, a new education system will be introduced, and its leadership will be done by India. Patanjali Gurukul, Acharyakulam, Patanjali University, and the Indian Education Board will now establish new benchmarks. Our resolution is that in the next five years, we will connect 500,000 schools with the Indian Education Board. This will be an innovative revolution in education.\n\nWe want to give children not only literacy but also subject knowledge, self-awareness, truth-oriented patriotism, and awareness of their pride and glory. We will include knowledge from across the world in Hindi, English, and Sanskrit, keeping up-to-date with the world, but 80% of the content will be from Vedas, philosophy, Upanishads, Puranas, and the pride of India. It will include spiritual sciences, Sanatan awareness, and Indian pride. This will not be Macaulay\u2019s education system. When the Indian Education Board affiliates first 100,000 schools and then 500,000 schools, India's childhood and youth will be secure. This is the resolution for freedom in education. Through the Indian Education Board, we will not teach the false greatness of foreign invaders, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or the British, but rather the true history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, and revolutionaries.\n\nSecond Revolution: Freedom in Healthcare\n\n\"Disease is not our nature; Yoga is our nature.\" Today, around the world, due to the consumption of synthetic medicines, steroids, and painkillers, people\u2019s bodies are deteriorating. For healthcare freedom, through Patanjali Wellness, Yoggram, Niramayam, hospitals, and health centers, and modern research, we are advancing the legacy of sages and science. We have published more than 5,000 research protocols and 500 research papers in world-class international journals, presenting solutions to incurable diseases before the world. Our resolution is to prevent people from becoming diseased and to liberate them from diseases through Yoga and Ayurveda.\n\nThird Revolution: Economic Freedom\n\nToday, the entire economy is trapped in the cruel claws of a handful of people. Our goal is prosperity for service and wealth for welfare. So far, Patanjali has done charity worth \u20b91 lakh crore in education, healthcare, research, character-building, and nation-building. With over 10,000 centers, 2.5 million trained Yoga instructors, and 1 crore workers selflessly serving, this is the service work of nation-building and character-building. Our resolution is to make the Swadeshi movement so powerful that India can emerge from economic exploitation, slavery, and poverty, and become supremely prosperous. By eliminating diseases like BP, diabetes, thyroid, asthma, arthritis, stress, and depression and saving on medicines, we save \u20b9700 to \u20b92,000 lakh crore annually for the country.\n\nFourth Revolution: Intellectual and Cultural Freedom\n\nIndia, which first gave the message of spiritual world knowledge to the world, cannot afford to endure intellectual and cultural slavery. Today, India depends on impoverished countries for everything, which have nothing but paper money, dollars, or pounds. True wealth is not just money but also good health, a happy family, character, spiritual wealth, and divine virtues. We must liberate India from intellectual and cultural slavery. Hence, we aim to elevate Sanatan Dharma, Vedic Dharma, Sage Dharma, and Yoga Dharma as the new religion of the era. More than 500 crore people worldwide have faith in Yoga Dharma and Sanatan Dharma. If we walk together, we will end religious terrorism, political terrorism, and the terror being perpetuated in the name of education and healthcare.\n\nFifth Revolution: Freedom from Addictions, Diseases, and Indulgences\n\nA dangerous game of addiction is spreading worldwide. In India, addiction has destroyed lives through diseases, intoxication, and obscenity. Our resolution is freedom from diseases, addictions, and obscenity. On completing 30 years, Patanjali resolves to make the world Yoga-oriented and create ideal global citizens through character-building.\n\nRemarks by Acharya Balkrishna Ji Maharaj\n\nAcharya Balkrishna remarked that with Swami Ji's unrelenting and extraordinary efforts, Patanjali's contribution is inspiring the world. Patanjali runs campaigns for charity using profits from its business. Patanjali is not a market but a family for India. With a team of over 500 world-class scientists, Patanjali is making evidence-based Ayurvedic medicines like juices, herbs, and tablets accessible worldwide. By integrating India\u2019s ancient knowledge with modern science, Patanjali has brought Yoga from caves to the masses, reaching millions in over 200 countries."
