            "article_content": "My cats are not usually picky about much, but they hate one thing: a traditional water bowl.\n\nThey\u2019d rather not drink water at all if it\u2019s not moving. So much so, that my one cat wound up developing crystals and had to have emergency surgery to remove a blockage. How dramatic!\n\nBut thankfully they both love water fountains. They liked the Petlibro fountain I originally got, but it pales in comparison to how much they like this BUETEKA water fountain from Chewy. I\u2019d like to think it is because it is shaped like a UFO and they are just two tiny aliens who live in my home.\n\nMy cats, Luna and Sirius, have expensive tastes. They\u2019re on a wet-food exclusive prescription diet, have two different Litter Robots to do their business, and they liked the $50 water fountain significantly more than the $30 one I originally bought.\n\nThey must get their expensive taste from me, their mother, because I liked this fountain more, as well.\n\nMy initial reason for liking the BUETEKA water fountain more was simply aesthetics. I bought this because it is a cute little UFO. It also has near-excellent reviews: 4.5 stars and nearly 500 ratings on Chewy. Over 80% of the people who own this love it so much, they gave it 5 stars, and I am also someone who\u2019d rate it 5 stars.\n\nBUETEKA Cat Water Fountain Features\n\nThis Chewy cat water fountain has a number of features that stand out, including:\n\nA unique catnip ball dispenser\n\nA 1.6L water tank\n\n2 water flow modes and an adjustable water outlet pipe\n\nA visible water-level indicator\n\nAn ultra-quiet smart pump\n\nMultiple filters that help to sterilize the water and remove hair, debris, and impurities\n\nA small footprint: 7.87 inches L x 7.87 inches W x 8.27 inches H\n\nWe don\u2019t use the catnip ball in the dispenser, because Luna and Sirius get rowdy enough in the middle of the night, the last thing I need is catnip hyping them up for 3 AM zoomies.\n\nThe water level indicator makes it very easy to spot how much water is in the fountain, so you know when it is low and needs to be refilled. Between my two cats, I typically only need to refill it twice a week.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a cat water fountain?\n\nIf you own a cat, you\u2019ve probably spotted them trying to drink water from the faucet once or twice. Sirius used to love doing this. Cats like moving water, thanks to their ancestors preferring to drink from moving streams over puddles in the wild.\n\nThere are some health benefits to buying a cat water fountain though, outside of letting your cat feel like they\u2019re the lion of the house.\n\nFountains encourage more drinking\n\nDrinking from a water fountain can help prevent health issues, like cystitis, urinary crystals, kidney issues, and more\n\nFountain designs can lessen whisker fatigue\n\nThe first two go hand in hand. The more water your cat drinks, the less likely they are to develop urinary crystals or have kidney issues. Increasing water intake is often a key strategy your veterinarian will implement if your pet is experiencing any of these issues. I know it firsthand, as Sirius developed crystals in 2023 due to previously having a diet that consisted of mainly dry food and he used to only have an old-school water bowl. After his surgery, we switched him to a water fountain and a wet food diet, and then the crystals pretty much vanished. He\u2019s now gone 13 months without issue.\n\nHis sister Luna has also reaped the benefits, not needing the water fountain like her brother, but she is still drinking water more now and making far less of a mess at her food and water station.\n\nWhy this cat water fountain?\n\nI have my theories on why my cats prefer the BUETEKA fountain over the original fountain I initially bought. They still use the other one, but I find them drinking from the BUETEKA fountain significantly more.\n\nThere is a little more space between the water dish and the spout on the BUETEKA fountain. I\u2019d assume that this allows them more space to catch the moving water before it hits the bowl. This is also a circle design, instead of an oval, so again, there is a little more space for them to stick their head over the bowl to get to the fountain\u2019s spout.\n\nThe BUETEKA water fountain also has a light blue light that is easy for cats to see, even in the dark. But it is not so bright that it will keep a human awake at night. Whereas the other fountain they have does not have a light for them to find the fountain at night.\n\nThe #1 feature about this water fountain that makes it infinitely better than the other fountain we own is that I never have to unplug it from the wall to clean it. The power cord connects in the middle, not the end that plugs into the wall, which makes this very easy to unplug without having to crawl around to get to the wall plug. This makes cleaning the water fountain substantially easier. It comes apart in seconds and I can wash each part in under a minute. I can either let it air dry or I can wipe it down and replace the water all in under five minutes.\n\nIt is simple to use, easy to clean, and only $50, which really is not that expensive for a product that my cats love and use every single day.\n\nGet the Bueteka Spaceship Ultra-Quiet Dog & Cat Water Fountain from Chewy for $50."

            "article_content": "An upcoming documentary about the UFO/UAP phenomenon promises to be the most well-sourced and credible film every made about the buzzy topic and its first trailer has just been released (below).\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. As announced earlier Wednesday, The Age of the Disclosure has earned first-time director Farah a coveted premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival, where it will screen at the historic Paramount Theatre in March.\n\nSome of the officials interviewed include newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to this subject, \u201ceven presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis\u201d), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama).\n\nFrom the official description: \u201cThe film was granted unprecedented access and support from senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of UAP as a result of their work for the U.S. Government. The film exposes the profound impact the situation has on the future of humanity, while providing a look behind the scenes with those at the forefront of the bipartisan disclosure effort.\u201d\n\nJim Semivan, who spent 25 years as a senior official with the CIA, says in the trailer: \u201cUAPs are here, they are real and they are not human.\u201d Adds Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force: \u201cThe first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\u201d\n\nFormer Department of Defense official and longtime UAP disclosure advocate Christopher Mellon declares, \u201cThis is the biggest discovery in human history,\u201d while former Department of Defense official and member of the government\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program Luis Elizondo says, \u201cYou have information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species.\u201d\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure was made in secret over the past two years and filmmakers are currently in talks for commercial distribution plans; Cinetic is handling domestic sales.\n\nThe film follows a surge of public interest in the subject and two bipartisan congressional hearings over the past year where former officials and whistleblowers gave testimony claiming non-human intelligent life has visited Earth and that the U.S. has been engaged in a decades-long cover-up in an effort to reverse-engineer alien technology.\n\nFarah\u2019s producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018. The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films production, in association with Born Ready Films. Produced and directed by Farah, executive producers are Colin Frederick, Andrew Farah and Shara Senderoff."

LAPRESSE\n\nIn a series of perplexing events, multiple UFO sightings have been reported and recorded over several days across California, particularly in the Fresno area. These sightings have sparked a wave of curiosity and concern, as both residents and authorities are left pondering the origins of these unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe string of sightings began with a mysterious light hovering over downtown Fresno in the early hours, just past 4 a.m. Local news station Fox 26 captured the first sighting on camera, showing a light that appeared to move swiftly before coming to a stationary hover. Earl Grey Anderson, a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), reviewed the footage and classified it as an unidentified flying object.\n\nTaylor Swift's Heartfelt Message to Swifties\n\nThe following day, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara documented another UFO sighting, this time in the daylight. The footage added to the mounting intrigue surrounding these mysterious occurrences. A few days later, a private pilot reported seeing a white object trailing his aircraft at an altitude of 3,500 feet over downtown Fresno. Despite radioing the local airport tower for assistance, the pilot lost sight of the object shortly after.\n\nStill concern over what happened\n\nSeveral Fresno residents have also come forward with similar reports, describing their encounters with the unidentified objects. The recent sightings have reignited public fascination with UFOs, particularly as the Pentagon continues to release declassified information about aerial phenomena.\n\nWhile some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, others consider the possibility of advanced human-made technology or natural phenomena. Authorities are urging residents to remain calm as investigations continue.\n\nDespite the ongoing mystery, the sightings have undoubtedly captured the imaginations of those who witness these unexplained objects in the California skies. As the story develops, residents and authorities alike remain vigilant, hoping to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic appearances."

            "article_content": "Credit: Rainer Fuhrmann/Shutterstock\n\nAccording to a 2022 poll from YouGov, 39% of Americans believe they have some form of paranormal ability. About a quarter of that group think they can sense other people's auras or emotion; 15% say they can hear voices or sounds from ghosts; and about 13% think they can see events from the past or future.\n\nThis is a public service announcement to the nearly 13 million Americans who believe they have supernatural powers: You are leaving a lot of money on the table. Various groups of skeptics worldwide have put a total of $1,408,424 (and one goat) on the table, and all that filthy lucre is just waiting to be collected by anyone who can manifest paranormal power.\n\nThe specific kinds of powers you need to demonstrate to win the prizes run the gamut. Dutch organization Stichting Skepsis will shell out 12 grand to practitioners of some forms of alternative medicine who can demonstrate its effectiveness (so if you're into applied kinesiology, give 'em a shot), and you can get a free goat from Fayetteville Freethinkers for proving a \"fulfilled Biblical prophecy.\" But whether you're able to see the future, move objects with your mind, or talk to spirits, there's a prize out there for you.\n\nThe history of paranormal prizes\n\nThe first monetary prize for proof of paranormal activity was offered by Scientific American in 1922. In the midst of the spiritualism movement, the publication offered $2,500 for anyone who could produce a \"spirit photograph\" (a photo that captures an image of a ghost) under controlled conditions, and $2,500 for anyone able to produce a \"visible psychic manifestation.\"\n\nFamous (at the time) medium George Valiantine gave it a shot and was able to create the illusion of a trumpet floating in the air in a dark room, but the test committee (which included Harry Houdini) had connected his chair to a light in an adjoining room, which lit up whenever Valiantine left his chair, which was also every time the trumpet appeared. Valiantine was proven a fraud, and Scientific American kept their cash.\n\nThe most famous bounty for psychic ability is the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi, a magician turned professional skeptic, first offered a prize of $1,000 back in 1964, but the cash grew to a million by 1996. Between 1964 and 2015 when the prize was discontinued, over 1,000 people applied, but none were successful at demonstrating their supernatural power under controlled conditions. No remote viewers were able to remote view. No dowsers were able to find hidden objects. No mind reader was able to read minds.\n\nHow paranormal prizes can backfire\n\nYou'd think that a 100% failure rate might make people question the reality of psychic abilities, but for a lot of people, public failure can make psychic abilities seem more plausible. At least that's how it worked for Uri Geller. Geller, who's still around and still claiming supernatural power, began gaining attention in the early 1970s for his supposed ability to bend spoons with his mind.\n\nWhile he never tried for James Randi's prize, the two had a famous run-in on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show that demonstrated the problems with disproving paranormal activity. Carson, who had been magician, was skeptical of Geller's claims, and brought him on his show and presented him with some tests that Randi helped develop.\n\nIf you want to see some uncomfortable TV, check it out:\n\nIf you don't have the 20 minutes to spare, Carson lets Geller take his time and try any of a series of test of his ability, but Geller can't. With Carson watching carefully and not allowing Geller control of any of the props, Geller can't bend a spoon with his mind; he can't determine whether a container holds water. He can't do anything.\n\nYou'd think a public failure this complete would have ended Geller's career, but it had the opposite effect. Geller blamed his failure on \"not feeling strongly\" and claimed he might have been \"blocking himself\" that night. Many apparently saw Geller's failure as proof that he was the real thing; after all, if he was a magician, the tricks would have worked. Geller then became a popular guest on other talk shows where he was able to perform his tricks successfully under less controlled conditions, and a star was born.\n\nWhy disproving anything is difficult\n\nWhile Uri Geller and other high-profile psychics are performers and are no doubt aware of how they're achieving their results, the 13 million or so Americans who believe they possess special powers aren't being deceitful\u2014it's just easy to believe in the supernatural. When something unusual happens, when a one-in-a-million occurrence occurs, it's easy to see that as proof of a mysterious, unexplainable something. If you're thinking about a friend and they text you that very minute, how can you not see that as evidence of some weird connection? But one-in-a-million events happen to over 300 people in America every single day, and there's no James Randi or Johnny Carson around to provide a controlled experiment to prove it's just a coincidence, to explain that you probably think of people all the time who don't text you that minute.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong. If I am, there's over a million dollars and a goat out there waiting for the right person to come along and claim them."

Bremigen said Kurtz spoke with Wolfe who told him he drove with White to a friend's house on Court Street and smoked what he thought was marijuana.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWolfe will appear before Sunbury District Judge Rachel Wiest-Benner at 1 p.m. Feb. 4 for a preliminary hearing, according to court documents.\n\nWolfe told Kurtz he was unsure what he smoked was marijuana, according to court documents. He also told police that he used a paranormal meter to check a statue for energy and received a high reading of paranormal activity, which made him feel scared, police said.\n\nWolfe then told Bremigen that \"in that moment\" he believed his friend was trying to put a white rag with something on it over his mouth with the intent to harm him, police said.\n\nWolfe told police he thought his friend and White were all trying to kill him so he panicked and ran out of the house to retrieve his handgun from his vehicle, according to court documents. Police reported Wolfe said he grabbed a gun and put a live round into the chamber, police said.\n\nWolfe told officers that's when White opened the front passenger door of the vehicle and Wolfe fired one shot in what he said was self-defense, police said. White was struck in the chest. By the time medical personnel arrived she could not be saved, Bremigen said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBremigen first arrived at the scene with other officers and attempted to save the victim, he said.\n\nWolfe said that after the shooting he drove to his relative's house on N. 5th Street. The relative called police immediately, Bremigen said.\n\nWolfe was interviewed a second time at the Sunbury Police Department and Bremigen said Wolfe gave the same statements. Wolfe added he did not see any weapons on White when she approached him at the vehicle, police said.\n\nWolfe told police he concealed a loaded 9 mm handgun in his vehicle without having a concealed weapon permit, police said.\n\nWolfe is being held in the Northumberland County Jail without bail."

But according to her, she doesn\u2019t mind one bit.\n\n\u201cI actually have a ghost that lives in my house right now,\u201d the actor, 34, told host Seth Meyers on Tuesday\u2019s episode of \u201cLate Night.\u201d \u201cI feel like I talk about her a lot, and I feel so bad. I\u2019m, like, putting her on blast. Like, I don\u2019t know if she wants me to talk about her.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cUncut Gems\u201d actor, who is ironically set to star in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s upcoming psychological thriller \u201cPresence\u201d about a haunted house, claimed the apparition is a good-natured one.\n\n\u201cHer name is Beauty, and she came with the house; she didn\u2019t follow me there,\u201d she explained.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFox went on to share that she didn\u2019t realize the house was haunted until she and her 4-year-old son went down to the basement after she had already purchased the home.\n\n\u201cIt was funny: It begins like any ghost story. I felt a pull toward this house, and it was a full moon, and then I was like, \u2018That\u2019s it. I\u2019m getting the house,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd then when we went down to the basement after we\u2019d already moved all our stuff in, there was a little letter from the previous owners basically saying, like, \u2018This is Beauty.\u2019 And it had all her things: her hairbrush, her mirror...\u201d\n\nWhile Fox didn\u2019t specify which home she was speaking of, she recently purchased a 19th century Harlem townhouse for $2.9 million with her friend and model, Richie Shazam Khan, in May 2023.\n\nVisibly flabbergasted, Meyers then questioned, \u201cWait, the owners waited until you moved in and then left a note in the basement?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is some really dirty \u2014 I\u2019ve heard some bad New York real estate stuff\u2026,\u201d he added, prompting Fox to respond with a laugh, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile most would likely be freaked out by a paranormal roomie, Fox doubled down on her love for \u201cBeauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s wonderful. She\u2019s like the matriarch of the house,\u201d she told Meyers. \u201cShe watches over us, and we love her. My son actually sees her. I don\u2019t see her, but my son will say, \u2018I saw her, I saw her.\u2019\u201d\n\nFox previously spilled about her haunted abode in a video interview with Vulture in January 2024.\n\n\u201cWhen I bought it, I went downstairs and there was a whole shrine set up to the ghost that lives there,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nFox added, \u201cAnd before I saw the shrine I knew that there was a ghost drawing me to the house because every time I would go, it\u2019d be like on a full moon or it was just all very magical, mystical, supernatural.\u201d\n\nWatch a clip from Fox\u2019s interview on the \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers\u201d below.\n\nRelated..."

During a Jan. 21 episode of Late Night, Fox recalled how she was introduced to the paranormal spirit after moving into her house.

Apparently, Beauty only brings good energy, and Fox now considers the ghost to be the \u201cmatriarch of the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually have a ghost that lives in my house right now,\u201d Fox told Seth Meyers on the show. \u201cI feel like I talk about her a lot, and I feel so bad.

In January 2024, she gave a similar update during a red carpet interview, shared on Instagram by Sundance. (At the time, Fox was promoting her horror film Presence, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film \u2014 a ghost story \u2014 comes out in theaters on Jan. 24. She was also promoting the project on Late Night.) \u201cShe lived in the house for pretty much her whole life, and we have a whole shrine to her in our basement,\u201d Fox said of Beauty at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice ghost, so we\u2019re not worried.\u201d"

In November, he amended it to include Microsoft as a defendant, and his lawyers accused the two companies of engaging in monopolistic behavior. Microsoft is an investor in OpenAI.\n\nTwo weeks later, Musk's lawyers filed a motion requesting a judge to bring an injunction against OpenAI that would block it from dropping its nonprofit status.

            "article_content": "The UK retail industry is at a pivotal juncture, driven by technological advancements, evolving consumer expectations, and a heightened focus on sustainability. With 2025 on the horizon, retailers are keenly adapting to key trends that promise to redefine the shopping experience. From artificial intelligence-enhanced operations to the rise of ethical retailing, along with innovative financial solutions, these developments are all playing a crucial role in shaping the future of retail.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and machine learning power personalised retail\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the retail industry, driving significant transformations across businesses of all sizes. While large multinational retailers are at the forefront of adopting these technologies, other sectors, including healthcare and iGaming platforms like crypto casinos UK players can sign up to are also finding innovative ways to harness AI-driven insights.\n\nAcross sectors, AI is being used to provide highly customized client experiences. In the casino sector, personalised promos and game suggestions based on user history are just two uses of AI. Elsewhere, machine learning algorithms are enhancing operational efficiency by optimising inventory levels, predicting demand, and improving supply chain management.\n\nAI chatbots and virtual assistants are becoming indispensable in customer service, offering instant support and resolving queries in real time. Studies indicate that retailers using AI and ML have witnessed an increase in sales and a boost in profitability.\n\nOmnichannel retail becomes the new norm\n\nConsumers increasingly expect a seamless shopping journey across multiple channels, whether they\u2019re browsing online, visiting a physical store, or using a mobile app. As a result, retailers are doubling down on their omnichannel strategies to create a unified experience.\n\nKey initiatives include the implementation of Click and Collect services, real-time inventory visibility across platforms, and streamlined return processes. Retailers are also investing in mobile-friendly shopping platforms, ensuring customers can switch between devices without losing progress in their shopping journeys.\n\n\n\nA notable example is the integration of social media with e-commerce platforms. Through social commerce, brands are allowing consumers to shop directly through platforms like Instagram and TikTok, blurring the line between social engagement and online retail.\n\nSustainability takes centre stage\n\nEnvironmental consciousness has become a deciding factor for today\u2019s consumers, prompting retailers to prioritise sustainability. From product sourcing to packaging, every aspect of retail operations is being scrutinised for its environmental impact.\n\nMajor players in the UK market, including grocery giants and fashion retailers, are stepping up their efforts to reduce carbon footprints. Initiatives such as switching to biodegradable packaging, committing to zero waste, and promoting circular fashion through resale or rental services are becoming increasingly common.\n\nRetailers that emphasise transparency in their supply chains and communicate their sustainability goals effectively are finding favour with environmentally conscious shoppers. This trend is not only shaping buying behaviour but also fostering brand loyalty among a growing segment of eco-minded consumers.\n\nAdvanced technologies streamline operations\n\nTechnological innovation continues to drive efficiencies in the retail sector. A prominent development in this regard is the gradual replacement of traditional barcodes with QR codes. Unlike barcodes, QR codes can store more information and offer consumers additional product details, enhancing the overall shopping experience.\n\nLeading UK supermarkets, including Tesco and Ocado, have already begun rolling out QR codes on select products, such as milk cartons. This move is part of a broader trend towards digitisation aimed at improving both back-end operations and front-end customer interaction.\n\nIn addition to QR codes, retailers are adopting in-store technologies such as smart shelves and automated checkout systems to enhance convenience. The ultimate goal is to reduce friction at various touchpoints, making shopping faster and more enjoyable for consumers.\n\nRising trend: responsible consumerism and the decline of \u2018haul culture\u2019\n\nThe introduction of \u2018haul culture,\u2019 popularised by social media, has led to increased consumption and, consequently, higher return rates. This phenomenon, driven by younger consumers eager to showcase their shopping hauls online, poses significant challenges for retailers in terms of logistics and sustainability.\n\nIn response, many brands are adopting strategies to curb excessive returns, including improved product descriptions, enhanced sizing tools, and augmented reality (AR) fitting solutions. Retailers are also working to educate consumers on the environmental impact of returns and promote thoughtful purchasing habits.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing emphasis on responsible consumerism. Retailers are encouraging shoppers to make more sustainable choices by highlighting the longevity and ethical sourcing of products. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards mindful consumption and away from fast fashion and impulsive buying.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe retail landscape in 2025 is set for significant transformation as businesses adapt to technological advancements, sustainability pressures, and changing consumer behaviours. Retailers that successfully navigate these trends stand to benefit from increased customer loyalty, operational efficiencies, and long-term profitability.\n\nAs AI-driven personalisation, omnichannel experiences, and ethical practices become standard, the future of retail promises to be both exciting and dynamic. Brands that remain agile and responsive to these developments will not only survive but thrive in this evolving marketplace."

            "article_content": "At this past week\u2019s ICR Conference in Orlando, cautious optimism floated beneath the current of two, inflation-strapped years of challenges. Traffic remains soft. Operators are competing for fewer visits among weary consumers. But solutions around \u201cvalue\u201d are starting to emerge, whether it\u2019s $5 deals pulsed into the marketplace at the top of QSR, or working on loyalty, engagement, and service for those clarifying the \u201cworth\u201d of higher prices.\n\nAccording to Revenue Management Solutions, the quick-service industry ended the year with a traffic increase of 0.8 percent in Q4, year-over-year, namely thanks to October and November. December traffic (weather, holiday trends) came in at negative 1.3 percent compared to 2023, which was also in the red.\n\nThe lead point, though, is net sales stayed positive at 4 percent, with price hikes stabilizing. Average check rose 3.4 percent, down from double-digits in year\u2019s past.\n\nAs was noted throughout ICR presentations, many QSRs recognize today they\u2019ve just about tapped the price ceiling. So they\u2019ve started to turn to other options to satisfy a cautious consumer. RMS advised operators focus on digital, where average checks can be 25 percent higher, consider the \u201cin-crowd\u201d (one case being the popularity of specialty beverages and other Gen Z trends, like KFC\u2019s Saucy Concept), and shift focus to quality/quantity for the price.\n\nNCR Voyix Corporation found, through survey data, 36 percent of consumers in the past six months dined at a fast-casual restaurant more than five times. Comparatively, 26 percent did so at in full service. Fifty-five percent added they cut back on delivery due to inflation, either ordering less in general (38 percent) or trying less expensive restaurants (17 percent).\n\nPrice impacted tipping as well\u201452 percent of guests said they now tip less or only at sit-down meals. What tech would those same diners like to see more of from restaurants? Self-service kiosks (39 percent), table-top ordering (37 percent), and digital payments (32 percent) rounded out the top three.\n\nWilliam Blair, in its ninth edition of The Dining Download, which quarterly examines restaurant trends through polls, found respondents spent, on average, $195 at restaurants monthly, down 10 percent, year-over-year. There was a decline for those with annual incomes less than $150,000 partly offset by growth among more affluent people. By age, restaurant spending slid across all cohorts\u2014albeit more resilient for those under 30, with only a 1 percent drop.\n\nThe percent of polled consumers spending less than last year climbed to 42 percent, up 6 points sequentially. That mark was a new survey high after being largely range-bound over the past two years. William Blair credited increased trade down to less expensive menu items.\n\nThat said, though, there were some encouraging signs in this latest iteration for frequency and larger check management behavior, with \u201cvisiting less often\u201d and \u201cordering fewer items\u201d both decreasing sequentially as reasons cited by those spending less.\n\nPut in plain terms, customers could be considering a ramp up as 2025 gets underway (past the Southern weather challenges). But how will they find the restaurants they return to?\n\nThe answer to that question has become the new definition of \u201cvalue\u201d in a quick-service sector where segment lines have narrowed. Some casual dining (Chili\u2019s) chains have gone as far as building campaigns around the similarity in price to brands like McDonald\u2019s, but with service models that give them an edge.\n\nMORE: Check out October\u2019s survey results\n\nThe percent of respondents \u201ceating less than last year\u201d in William Blair\u2019s report outpaced those eating \u201cmore often\u201d for nearly two-thirds of brands in its coverage area. The most unfavorable gap came at The Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Dave & Buster\u2019s, and Starbucks (this was the case last survey as well).\n\nStill, every brand William Blair tracked experienced a sequential increase in \u201ceating more often,\u201d led by improvement at Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Shake Shack, CAVA, and Chipotle. That aforementioned \u201ccautious optimism\u201d appears to be cracking through, although there\u2019s still plenty of ground to make up after multiple years of deteriorating guest counts.\n\nStarbucks posting 8.3 percent on the line (as well as being the only negative result in \u201ceating less often\u201d) was a notable shift, even if it also reflected just how deep the value hole had become.\n\nStarbucks in the last survey, back in October, was on the opposite side\u2014the very bottom at negative 2.5 percent for \u201ceating more often.\u201d The brand, of course, has made several changes in CEO Brian Niccol\u2019s tenure thus far\u2014new algorithms that enable on-time mobile-order handoffs and order tracking/timing to store decor to the launch of Cortados, removing upcharges for non-dairy milk, and refocusing messaging on coffee-centric campaigns. But much of Starbucks\u2019 reroute lies ahead, especially when it comes to Siren upgrades and other operational improvements (more on that here).\n\nWhen asked why they were eating less at specific restaurant brands, \u201cinconvenient\u201d topped the list (cited for more than 70 percent of brands) followed by \u201ctoo expensive\u201d (Starbucks, Chipotle, and BJ\u2019s Restaurants). Sweetgreen was the only concept where \u201clack of interesting new menu items\u201d clocked as the top reason for visiting less often.\n\nAgain, focusing on Starbucks, this list is pretty similar to October, when it broke down as follows:\n\nToo expensive: 52 percent\n\nInconvenient: 17 percent\n\nSpending on other things/restaurants: 12 percent\n\nLack of interesting new menu items: 7 percent\n\nHealth/diet: 5 percent\n\nSlow speed of service: zero percent\n\nGoing by this data, Starbucks\u2019 greatest whitespace seems to center on making its experience and product feel worthy of its cost. Naturally, it\u2019s an easier-said-than-done point and one Niccol addressed right from the jump of his appointment. Atop that task list is getting throughput times under four minutes; making the customization process more transparent from a pricing perspective; properly staffing units to create calmer and more efficient restaurants; bring condiment bars back; and fostering a more enjoyable caf\u00e9 experience. \u201cOur customers find worth through quality, consistency, and a sense of value,\u201d Niccol said earlier. For a brand that\u2019s never been \u201ccheap,\u201d getting back to being an \u201caffordable luxury\u201d will be a holistic effort that\u2019s the furthest thing from discounting or a race to the bottom. There\u2019s a reason Niccol has called the effort \u201cBack to Starbucks.\u201d\n\nCustomers in William Blair\u2019s survey continued to rank the value proposition of restaurants as modestly above average at 3.4 (5 being the highest). It\u2019s a factor on the rise. Portillo\u2019s, Kura Sushi, The Cheesecake Factory, and BJ\u2019s provided this survey\u2019s largest gains. On an absolute basis, Portillo\u2019s topped in value perception.\n\nThat reality, in of itself, is intriguing when you consider the Chicago-born cult-favorite has elected to avoid discounting during this stretch. CEO Michael Osanloo said in Q3 Portillo\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be \u201cgoing on sale\u201d to counter competitors\u2019 promotions. Portillo\u2019s stayed relatively cautious on price and has held on quality and operational efforts. The chain took zero action in Q3. Its price benefit was about 4 percent in Q4\n\nBut from a wider sentiment angle, Osanloo said, Portillo\u2019s elected to absorb traffic blows rather than chase short-term wins over the past two years. \u201cPortillo\u2019s does not play the discount game,\u201d he said in Q3. \u201cWe compete on great everyday pricing for our craveable food and abundant portions, and we know this approach will benefit us in the medium and long term.\u201d\n\nPortillo\u2019s at ICR had one of the buzzier presentations, thanks in large part to its decision to load digital wallets onto customer\u2019s loyalty plates instead of an app. Yet the brand also presented a blueprint to regaining traffic and growing long-term through efforts such as smaller store designs, kiosks, and improved speed of service in the drive-thru instead of value-focused menu launches. It\u2019s clear there will be more than one approach for quick service to win back traffic in 2025.\n\nOther trends in behavior\n\nDespite all the hurdles, engagement remains healthy. William Blair\u2019s survey showed 87 percent of respondents ate at restaurants \u201cat least a few\u201d times a month in December (9 percent said they do so daily). Those figures were 80 and 79 percent in September and June, respectively. Yet, to an earlier observation, consumers estimated their monthly spending was down 10 percent, year-over-year, and 42 percent added they were spending less relative to the prior year.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s the ICR-revealed cocktail of hesitant traffic patterns and hints of improving trends.\n\nGiven U.S. Census Bureau data had shown stable consumer spending through December, William Blair said, part of this step-down could be explained by a shift in its demographic poll this past quarter. In that, there are some learnings, too. More younger guests responded this survey, showing, perhaps, that group of diners has proven more apt to return to restaurants, even if they\u2019re managing checks when they do so.\n\nThe percentage of guests ordering food either a few times a week or daily was 54 percent for respondents under 60, compared with only 42 percent over 60. There was also visible correlation to income level\u201456 percent of people earning north of $100,000 said they ordered food a few times a week or daily versus those earnings less than $50,000, where only 45 percent claimed the same.\n\nReported restaurant interactions held up as well. William Blair data found an estimated 11 interactions per month this quarter, 13 percent higher than December 2023. Off-premises dining accounted for 73 percent of those (compared to 68 percent last year), as opposed to 27 percent interactions for dine-in. That continues, the company said, to support the headline the pandemic structurally changed consumer behavior\u201448 percent of respondents said ordering for delivery and/or takeout increased since 2019. Only 18 percent said it slid backward.\n\nBefore the pandemic, roughly 48 percent of respondents said their frequency of ordering delivery and takeout increased.\n\nThis quarter, the reported frequency of drive-thru interactions exceeded all other forms of dining, including takeout, in-person, and delivery. It\u2019s an observation that pulsed last survey as well. The why behind it, William Blair suggested, could be customers are headed to the lane to save on added costs. Pricing pressures, through delivery fees and otherwise, are leading diners to the drive-thru.\n\nPortillo\u2019s has realigned its GMs to focus on factors that matter when driving transactions and sales.\n\nPeople said they go to the drive-thru 3.3 days per month, surpassing in-person (2.9 days), takeout (2.7), and delivery (1.8).\n\nTracking another development, 70 percent of respondents said they were comfortable using in-store kiosks to order/pay for food in a restaurant. It signaled a notable rise from 53 percent who said the same in William Blair\u2019s previous survey (you could potentially thank the demographic shift for that as well). Nonetheless, the company said, it continues to believe kiosks could serve as a meaningful lever to drive more digital interactions over time\u2014and toward that higher check. One example: Yum! noted in Q3 that kiosk usage supported a 3-point climb in digital sales mix, which now totals more than 55 percent of the group\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cThat said,\u201d William Blair added, \u201copen-ended respondent commentary continues to convey mixed sentiment among consumers; even of those respondents who are comfortable with kiosk usage, some still prefer human interaction. Regardless, results continue to indicate changing consumer behaviors, with increased comfort with digital channels like self-service kiosks and QR codes.\u201d\n\nWhile at a restaurant, 43 percent said they were not comfortable using QR codes over a mobile device in a restaurant, and when analyzing the data by age, only 33 percent under the age of 60 were not comfortable deploying QR codes in a restaurant setting, as opposed to 74 percent of respondents over the age of 60 who were not comfortable with QR codes.\n\n\u201cWhile some individuals continue to express preference for physical menus since the rapid proliferation of QR codes post-pandemic, respondents seem to be increasingly comfortable with the prevalence and functionality of these ordering channels,\u201d William Blair continued.\n\nThis quarter, the company also asked a new question around acceptance of service and credit charge surcharges\u2014an approach that\u2019s gained adoption for restaurants trying not to take additional price but needing to balance rising costs. Roughly 75 percent of respondents said they find these fees unreasonable. However, only 31 percent said they would avoid restaurants that administer them. Another 13 percent said fees were small/reasonable and 12 percent hadn\u2019t noticed them.\n\nThe most prevalent ordering method overall was directly through a restaurant\u2019s website or digital app\u201439 percent of respondents for takeout and 34 percent for delivery. This was the first quarter in William Blair\u2019s reports where these digital options overtook in-person and over-the-phone orders as the most popular method (used by about 37 percent of respondents for takeout and 21 percent for delivery). Third-party marketplaces followed, where usage was materially higher for delivery (33 percent of December orders) than takeout (12 percent). That, however, was an expected result.\n\nExcluding respondents over the age of 60, the percentage ordering in person or over the phone was 33 percent for takeout (down from 37 percent last quarter) and 15 percent for delivery (a decrease from 26 percent). When ordering for delivery, respondents under the age of 60 were more likely to order directly through a third-party marketplace (38 percent) or a restaurant\u2019s website/app (34 percent). \u201cWe continue to observe demographic shifts and expect growing comfort with digital channels will drive an ongoing mix-shift toward digital ordering by consumers,\u201d William Blair said.\n\nFor those going the takeout and delivery route, convenience and time constraints remained the top considerations, at 71 percent, followed by preference not to cook (28 percent).\n\nUsage of loyalty programs also surfaced as a vital trigger to traffic growth. It jumped notably from the last survey, with 63 percent of December respondents saying they actively participate in one\u2014a sizable lift from 55, 52, and 47 percent in September, June, and March, respectively.\n\nNearly 70 percent (69) of respondents under 60 reported using them. Additionally, 63 percent said loyalty platforms were either somewhat or highly influential in their decision of where to eat. That was a major hike from past surveys, too.\n\nThe proportion of consumers who said loyalty programs did not influence their decision on where to dine showed a continued and clear downward trend."

            "article_content": "Looking ahead: As we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology this year, Keith Burnett says it can be a reminder of how the benefits of physics span over decades (courtesy: Schmidt Science Fellows)\n\nLast year was the year of elections and 2025 is going to be the year of decisions.\n\nAfter many countries, including the UK, Ireland and the US, went to the polls in 2024, the start of 2025 will see governments at the beginning of new terms, forced to respond swiftly to mounting economic, social, security, environmental and technological challenges.\n\nThese issues would be difficult to address at any given time, but today they come amid a turbulent geopolitical context. Governments are often judged against short milestones \u2013 the first 100 days or a first budget \u2013 but urgency should not come at the cost of thinking long-term, because the decisions over the next few months will shape outcomes for years, perhaps decades, to come. This is no less true for science than it is for health and social care, education or international relations.\n\nIn the UK, the first half of the year will be dominated by the government\u2019s spending review. Due in late spring, it could be one of the toughest political tests for UK science, as the implications of the tight spending plans announced in the October budget become clear. Decisions about departmental spending will have important implications for physics funding, from research to infrastructure, facilities and teaching.\n\nOne of the UK government\u2019s commitments is to establish 10-year funding cycles for key R&D activities \u2013 a policy that could be a positive improvement. Physics discoveries often take time to realise in full, but their transformational nature is indisputable. From fibre-optic communications to magnetic resonance imaging, physics has been indispensable to many of the world\u2019s most impactful and successful innovations.\n\nEmerging technologies, enabled by physicists\u2019 breakthroughs in fields such as materials science and quantum physics, promise to transform the way we live and work, and create new business opportunities and open up new markets. A clear, comprehensive and long-term vision for R&D would instil confidence among researchers and innovators, and long-term and sustainable R&D funding would enable people and disruptive ideas to flourish and drive tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs.\n\nAlongside the spending review, we are also expecting the publication of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The focus of the green paper published last year was an indication of how the strategy will place significance on science and technology in positioning the UK for economic growth.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognise the need to fund more physicists, we will miss so many of the opportunities that lie ahead\n\nPhysics-based industries are a foundation stone for the UK economy and are highly productive, as highlighted by research commissioned by the Institute of Physics, which publishes Physics World. Across the UK, the physics sector generates \u00a3229bn gross value added, or 11% of total UK gross domestic product. It creates a collective turnover of \u00a3643bn, or \u00a31380bn when indirect and induced turnover is included.\n\nLabour productivity in physics-based businesses is also strong at \u00a384 300 per worker, per year. So, if physics is not at the heart of this effort, then the government\u2019s mission of economic revival is in danger of failing to get off the launch pad.\n\nA pivotal year\n\nAnother of the new government\u2019s policy priorities is the strategic defence review, which is expected to be published later this year. It could have huge implications for physics given its core role in many of the technologies that contribute to the UK\u2019s defence capabilities. The changing geopolitical landscape, and potential for strained relations between global powers, may well bring research security to the front of the national mind.\n\nIntellectual property, and scientific innovation, are some of the UK\u2019s greatest strengths and it is right to secure them. But physics discoveries in particular can be hampered by overzealous security measures. So much of the important work in our discipline comes from years of collaboration between researchers across the globe. Decisions about research security need to protect, not hamper, the future of UK physics research.\n\nThis year could also be pivotal for UK universities, as securing their financial stability and future will be one of the major challenges. Last year, the pressures faced by higher education institutions became apparent, with announcements of course closures, redundancies and restructures as a way of saving money. The rise in tuition fees has far from solved the problem, so we need to be prepared for more turbulence coming for the higher education sector. Read more Keith Burnett: IOP president says it is our duty to make physics more inclusive\n\nThese things matter enormously. We have heard that universities are facing a tough situation, and it\u2019s getting harder for physics departments to exist. But if we don\u2019t recognise the need to fund more physicists, we will miss so many of the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nAs we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology that marks the centenary of the initial development of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg, 2025 is a reminder of how the benefits of physics span over decades.\n\nWe need to enhance all the vital and exciting developments that are happening in physics departments. The country wants and needs a stronger scientific workforce \u2013 just think about all those individuals who studied physics and now work in industries that are defending the country \u2013 and that workforce will be strongly dependent on physics skills. So our priority is to make sure that physics departments keep doing world-leading research and preparing the next generation of physicists that they do so well."

            "article_content": "In the moments before the Big Bang, our universe was a hot, dense, and extremely high-energy place. That all changed when the universe exploded 13.8 billion years ago. Rapid inflation divided a single \u201csuper\u201d force into the four fundamental forces we know today: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear interaction (responsible for radioactive decay), and strong nuclear interaction (which holds atomic nuclei together). Elementary particles were created. And, eventually, the cosmic flash dance left behind scars in the fabric of space-time. Physicists call them cosmic strings.\n\nLike stretch marks left on skin that expanded too quickly or cracks embedded in freezing ice, cosmic strings are artifacts of what the universe looked like in the moments before it rapidly changed from a high-energy to low-energy environment, scientists believe. These strings are roughly as thick as a proton, extremely dense, and light-years long.\n\nScientists believe cosmic strings are passively floating through the universe, minding their own business. But actively studying them could unlock the mysteries of our early universe and may even be key to a form of time travel, some physicists suggest. Traveling back in time through relics of the early universe might sound like pseudoscience, but it\u2019s an idea supported by cosmic string theory. At least, theoretically.\n\nKen Olum, Ph.D., a research professor of physics and astronomy at Tufts University, says that two infinite, parallel cosmic strings passing each other would create a time machine by warping space-time. As a result, if you traveled in a path around these strings, you would return to your starting point at an earlier time than you left it.\n\nBut while the math explaining this cosmic string-enabled time travel checks out, Olum says not to get too excited. In addition to practical concerns regarding a cosmic string-powered time machine, there\u2019s also the small issue that scientists have never actually observed cosmic strings yet.\n\nIn 1991, Princeton physicist J. Richard Gott proposed the most popular idea for cosmic-string time travel. In his model, Gott explores how two infinite, parallel cosmic strings passing each other\u2014much like two cars driving along an endless two-lane highway\u2014could warp space-time to create a path in time called a closed time-like curve. Essentially, this is a loop in time that returns a time traveler to their point of origin before the moment they left it.\n\nWhat is particularly intriguing about Gott\u2019s theory is that this kind of time loop is an accepted solution to Einstein\u2019s theories of general relativity. In a nutshell, these theories tell us that massive objects can distort space-time, which allows for the possibility that one could take a shortcut through time by condensing space. Closed time-like curves also explain how wormholes theoretically work.\n\nThe math behind a theoretical cosmic-string superhighway is sound, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re any closer to realizing this model of time travel. For one thing, the near-light-speed travel required to pull it off is incredibly difficult (and maybe even impossible). According to Einstein\u2019s relativity, the faster an object goes, the more energy it requires to continue accelerating. Simply put, there\u2019s no method yet that can produce the massive amounts of energy necessary to propel a spacecraft to such incredible speeds.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only issue, Olum says. Assuming that scientists of the future would plan to build a time machine based on this idea\u2014rather than wrangling existing cosmic strings\u2014the infinite nature of Gott\u2019s strings is a non-starter. \u201cNobody can make this situation because nobody can make something which is infinitely long,\u201d he says. \u201cSo this exact idea is not useful.\u201d\n\nHowever, compared to other theoretical modes of time travel, like wormholes, Henry Tye, Ph.D., an emeritus professor of physics at Cornell University, says he is more convinced by the possibilities of cosmic strings. In fact, Tye and a student have explored their own model using cosmic strings, as well.\n\n\u201cTime travel is unlikely, but I would not say impossible,\u201d Tye explains. \u201cIn science fiction, when people travel faster than the speed of light, I find that hard to accept, but when people travel backward in time, I feel that it\u2019s unlikely\u2014but not totally ruled out yet.\u201d\n\nBut before we can start daydreaming of real-life time machines, there\u2019s a big task scientists need to check off their to-do list: actually discovering cosmic strings.\n\nLuckily, their discovery may be closer than ever before thanks to the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), a collaboration of astronomers that detect low-frequency gravitational waves by measuring signals produced by a type of star called a pulsar. By measuring time variations in millisecond pulsar pulses, NANOGrav can detect the subtle stretch and compression of spacetime. So far, scientists have observed gravitational waves with experiments like NANOGrav and LIGO that originate from the behavior of black holes, but in 2020, the group observed a signal that diverged from this pattern.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look all that much like the signal we\u2019d expect from black holes, which is the intriguing thing about all this,\u201d Olum says. \u201cBut the signal looks perfectly fine to be from cosmic superstrings.\u201d\n\nUnlike cosmic strings, which were leftover by the early universe, cosmic superstrings instead have origins in string theory, which proposes the universe is made up of ten (or sometimes more) dimensions\u2014only four of which make up space and time as we know it. The remaining dimensions are a type of unseen scaffolding. In this multi-dimensional model, very small objects, called strings, replace particles. These strings resonate like plucked guitar strings at different frequencies, in accordance with different fundamental particles.\n\n\u201cThe strings of string theory could be stretched large by some mechanism early in the universe to become cosmic strings, which we would call cosmic superstrings,\u201d Olum says. \u201cCosmic superstrings are less likely to exist, but relatively easier to detect.\u201d\n\nTo confirm whether or not these signals really were from cosmic strings, scientists will need more data, which should hopefully arrive from NANOGrav in the next few years with potentially more to come from a space-based gravitational wave telescope called LISA, slated to launch in 2034.\n\nEven if scientists determine these signals were not from cosmic strings, Olum says it will still be important information to help constrain the boundaries of what cosmic-string signals could look like in the future. And if new data does confirm cosmic strings, especially cosmic superstrings, Tye says this would change everything we know about physics.\n\n\u201cSeeing cosmic superstrings would confirm that string theory is the fundamental [physics] theory and would conceptually and foundationally change our thinking about physics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe impact would be huge.\u201d\n\nAnd if cosmic strings do one day change physics as we know it, this extra attention may just be the right incentive for physicists to iron out the kinks in Gott\u2019s time-travel theory after all."

Its latest release, which came on Trump's inauguration day, has left much of America's top industry researchers stunned.\n\nIn a paper released Monday, DeepSeek unveiled a new flagship AI model called R1 that shows off a new level of \"reasoning.\" Why it has left such a huge impression on AI experts in the US matters.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 DeepSeek-R1 is here!\n\n\n\n\u26a1 Performance on par with OpenAI-o1\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Fully open-source model & technical report\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 MIT licensed: Distill & commercialize freely!\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Website & API are live now! Try DeepThink at https://t.co/v1TFy7LHNy today!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc0b 1/n pic.twitter.com/7BlpWAPu6y \u2014 DeepSeek (@deepseek_ai) January 20, 2025\n\nSome of Silicon Valley's most well-resourced AI labs have increasingly turned to \"reasoning\" as a frontier of research that can evolve their technology from a student-like level of intelligence to something that eclipses human intelligence entirely.\n\nTo accomplish this, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and others have focused on ensuring models spend more time thinking before responding to a user query. It's an expensive, intensive process that demands a lot from the computing power buzzing underneath.\n\nAs a reminder, OpenAI fully released o1 \u2014 \"models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond\" \u2014 to a glowing reception in December after an initial release in September. DeepSeek's R1 shows just how quickly it can close the gap.\n\nDeepSeek narrows the gap\n\nWhat exactly does R1 do? For one, DeepSeek says R1 achieves \"performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.\"\n\nIts research paper says this is possible thanks to \"pure reinforcement learning,\" a technique that Jim Fan, a senior research manager at Nvidia, said was reminiscent of the secret behind making Google DeepMind's AlphaZero a master at games such as go and chess from scratch, \"without imitating human grandmaster moves first.\" He wrote on X that this was \"the most significant takeaway from the paper.\"\n\nWe are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive - truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense. The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-R1 not only open-sources a barrage of models but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/M7eZnEmCOY \u2014 Jim Fan (@DrJimFan) January 20, 2025\n\nDeepSeek, which launched in 2023, said in its paper that it did this because its goal was to explore the potential of AI to \"develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data.\" This is a common technique used by AI researchers. The company also said that an earlier version of R1 called R1-Zero gave them an \"aha moment\" in which the AI \"learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach.\"\n\nThe end result offers what the Wharton professor Ethan Mollick described as responses from R1 that read \"like a human thinking out loud.\"\n\nNotably, this level of transparency into the development of AI has been hard to come by in the notes published by companies such as OpenAI when releasing models of a similar aptitude.\n\nNathan Lambert, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, said on Substack that R1's paper \"is a major transition point in the uncertainty in reasoning model research\" as \"until now, reasoning models have been a major area of industrial research without a clear seminal paper.\"\n\nStaying true to the open spirit, DeepSeek's R1 model, critically, has been fully open-sourced, having obtained an MIT license \u2014 the industry standard for software licensing.\n\nTogether, these elements of R1 provide complications to US players caught up in an AI arms race with China \u2014 Trump's main geopolitical rival \u2014 for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, it shows that China can rival some of the top AI models in the industry and keep pace with cutting-edge developments coming out of Silicon Valley.\n\nSecond, open-sourcing highly advanced AI could also challenge companies that are seeking to make huge profits by selling their technology.\n\nOpenAI, for instance, introduced a ChatGPT Pro plan in December that costs $200 a month. Its selling point was that it included \"unlimited access\" to its smartest model at the time, o1. If an open-source model offers similar capabilities for free, the incentive to buy a costly paid subscription could, in theory, diminish.\n\nNvidia's Fan described the situation like this on X: \"We are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive \u2014 truly open, frontier research that empowers all.\"\n\nDeepSeek has shown off reasoning know-how before. In November, the company released an \"R1-lite-preview\" that showed its \"transparent thought process in real time.\" In December, it released a model called V3 to serve as a new, bigger foundation for future reasoning in models.\n\nIt's a big reason American researchers see a meaningful improvement in the latest model, R1.\n\nTheo Browne, a software developer behind a popular YouTube channel for the tech community, said that \"the new DeepSeek R1 model is incredible.\" Tanay Jaipuria, a partner investing in AI at Silicon Valley's Wing VC, also described it as \"incredible.\"\n\nDeepSeek R-1 is incredible.\n\n\n\n- OpenAI o-1 level reasoning at 1/25th the cost\n\n- Fully open source with MIT license\n\n- API outputs can be used for distillation pic.twitter.com/YjHbylNuH8 \u2014 Tanay Jaipuria (@tanayj) January 20, 2025\n\nAwni Hannun, a machine-learning researcher at Apple, said a key advantage of R1 was that it was less intensive, showing that the industry was \"getting close to open-source o1, at home, on consumer hardware,\" referring to OpenAI's reasoning model introduced last year.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe model can be \"distilled,\" meaning smaller but also powerful versions can run on hardware that's far less intensive than the computing power loaded into servers in data centers many tech companies depend on to run their AI models.\n\nHannun demonstrated this by sharing a clip on X of a 671 billion-parameter version of R1 running on two Apple M2 Ultra chips, responding with reason to a prompt asking whether a straight or a flush is better in a game of Texas Hold'em. Hannun said its response came \"faster than reading speed.\"\n\nAI censorship\n\nR1 does appear to have one key problem. The former OpenAI board member Helen Toner pointed out on X that there were demos of R1 \"shutting itself down when asked about topics the CCP doesn't like.\"\n\nToner did suggest, however, that \"the censorship is obviously being done by a layer on top, not the model itself.\" DeepSeek didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is worth noting, of course, that OpenAI has introduced a new model called o3 that's meant to be a successor to the o1 model DeepSeek is rivaling. Lambert said in his blog post that OpenAI was \"likely technically ahead,\" but he added the key caveat that the o3 model was \"not generally available,\" nor would basic information such as its \"weights\" be available anytime soon.\n\nGiven DeepSeek's track record so far, don't be surprised if its next model shows parity to o3. America's tech leaders may have met their match in China."

In the past few months, China undertook the largest military exercises in the waters around Taiwan in almost three decades, and Americans learned about major recent hacks of the Treasury Department and several of the country\u2019s largest telecommunications companies. President Trump announced the nominations of China hawks for secretary of state, ambassador to Beijing and under secretary of defense for policy, among other positions in the new government, having made an escalating tariff war with China as central to his third campaign as a border wall had been to his first. This month in Foreign Affairs, the conservative historian Niall Ferguson suggested America\u2019s second Cold War was already at least five years old.\n\nBut if we are working through a strict comparison with the first Cold War, one big echo is conspicuously missing. For decades, part of how Americans made sense of their rivalry with the Soviet Union was through popular culture \u2014 movies and television and novels that dramatized and personalized the conflict, typically simplifying and mythologizing it as well. This time, there has been essentially none of that \u2014 no real effort in Hollywood to make use of high-stakes global conflict even as a narrative crutch, or by more auteurish creators to explore the layered human complexity of such conflicts.\n\nNot only is there no \u201cHunt for Red October; there is also no \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d or real heir to John le Carr\u00e9. That the United States is now engaged in some form of conflict with China has become a kind of commonplace among policy analysts and one of the few areas of consensus between the two political parties. But if there is a Cold War on, you wouldn\u2019t know it from simply streaming movies or television, even if you left your favorite platform on auto-play forever. It\u2019s not just that you can\u2019t yet find a good movie about American rivalry with China on Netflix or Apple TV+. Outside of \u201c3 Body Problem\u201d and some historical documentaries, it\u2019s hard to find anything new about China at all.\n\nJust as striking is that we all know the reason \u2014 and know how craven it is. Simply put, the stuff we watch these days is overwhelmingly produced by large corporations far too dependent on China, in one form or another, to risk offending its audiences or its leaders by even broaching the subject."

            "article_content": "PC makers are of the view that quick commerce players with strong execution will be able to drive sales, as demand for high-value electronics on quick commerce continues to rise.\n\nAfter delivering groceries, daily essentials, medicines, and smartphones in ten minutes, quick commerce platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart are now adding laptops to their offerings.\n\nOver the last month, several of the largest personal computer (PC) makers in India\u2014including HP, Lenovo, Acer, and Asus\u2014have listed their products on at least one of the major quick commerce platforms.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nMarket leader HP recently announced a partnership with Blinkit to sell laptops, monitors, printers, and other accessories on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe initial response has been promising\u2026We are also gradually diversifying our presence by introducing laptops on quick commerce platforms, adopting a phased approach to better understand consumer behaviour and preferences,\u201d Vineet Gehani, Senior Director, Personal Systems, HP India, told Moneycontrol.\n\nSimilarly, Acer has listed a limited range of its offerings, including laptops, on platforms like Flipkart Minutes and Zepto in select locations. It is also in \u201cactive talks\u201d with Blinkit and others to bring a complete range of Acer products \u2013 including laptops, monitors, tablets and accessories \u2013 to quick commerce.\n\n\u201cWe are confident of this channel for long-term growth. Quick commerce players are actively solving challenges related to inventory management and last-mile delivery for high valued Items like laptops, tablets, and other electronic items,\u201d said Sudhir Goel, Chief Business Officer Acer India.\n\nLaptops are the latest development in the ongoing strategy of quick commerce firms to deliver big-ticket products. Electronic gadgets like smartphones and laptops drive up average order values (AOVs), which in turn fuels margin improvements for quick commerce platforms. In fact, Blinkit, on January 22, announced a partnership with Xiaomi and Nokia to expand its smartphone category beyond iPhones.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhile firms like HP and Acer have started selling laptops, other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are testing the waters by listing accessories like keyboards, mice, and printers, to gauge initial demand.\n\nTaiwanese PC manufacturer Asus, for instance, announced a partnership with Zepto last week to list a range of accessories, including keyboards and mice, on the platform, made available in major cities like Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru.\n\n\u201cWe also plan to expand its presence on other quick commerce platforms such as Blinkit and Instamart further broadening our reach and ensuring greater accessibility for consumers across India,\u201d said Arnold Su, Vice President, Consumer and Gaming PC, System Business Group, Asus.\n\nLenovo, India\u2019s second-largest PC marker, is adopting a similar approach of listing smaller tech accessories. It is, however, seeing sales gradually pick up for larger ticket items. Its products are currently available on Blinkit.\n\n\u201cCurrently, on Zepto, our Lenovo Tab M11 is the most purchased tablet and we\u2019re optimistic about scaling this channel further to enhance accessibility and convenience for our customers,\u201d said Dinesh Nair, Director of Consumer Business, Lenovo India.\n\nNew growth channel\n\nIndia\u2019s traditional PC market (inclusive of desktops, notebooks, and workstations) shipped an all-time high of 4.49 million units in the third quarter of calendar year 2024, up 0.1 percent year-over-year (YoY), amid the festival season last year, according to a report by the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\nHP led the market with a share of 29 percent, followed by Lenovo and Dell Technologies with a market share of 17.3 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively. The Acer Group occupied the fourth spot at 14.6 percent again, with Asus rounding out the top five at 9.7 percent, the report showed.\n\nAs the country\u2019s PC market continues to grow, India's $5.5 billion quick commerce market is emerging as the next phase of online growth for many PC manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe believe quick commerce is the future of e-commerce and offers us a new avenue to expand our reach and serve more customers,\u201d said Su.\n\nAccording to the Asus executive, traditional e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon have not been able to meet the growing need for faster deliveries, and quick commerce has emerged as a channel that can complement existing online platforms.\n\n\u201cWhile some may perceive quick commerce as a threat to established online players, we view it as an opportunity to reach a niche customer base in need of products beyond just daily groceries or FMCG items,\u201d he said.\n\nFor other OEMs, it is still early days and quick commerce is currently just another channel that they want to expand their presence to.\n\n\u201cAs a brand, our focus remains on serving our customers across all platforms\u2014whether it\u2019s through offline retail stores, online and e-commerce channels, or emerging quick commerce solutions. By embracing innovative distribution models, we are ensuring that our customers can access HP products wherever and whenever they need them,\u201d said HP\u2019s Gehani.\n\nEarly days for laptops on quick commerce\n\nWhether laptops take off in a big way via quick commerce remains to be seen. Analysts tracking the sector expect the category to make up a small share of quick commerce sales for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cIt will require considerable effort to scale the laptop and PC category on quick commerce. Sales in this category are expected to remain between 2-3 percent in the medium term,\u201d said an internet sector analyst.\n\nRegardless, PC makers are of the view that quick commerce players with strong execution will be able to drive sales, as demand for high-value electronics on quick commerce continues to rise.\n\n\u201cThis depends on how quick commerce players are going to solve the need for a larger selection for buyers along with the convenience of delivery in 10-30 minutes,\u201d said Goel."

            "article_content": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are needed for businesses to have good control over key processes such as accounting, supply chain, manufacturing, HR and many more. In recent years, however, with the advent of cloud computing, businesses now have a choice to deploy ERP solutions on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nCloud and on-premise ERPs have vastly different integration capabilities and methods. In order to decide which integration approach would be better for a business, you need to consider factors like cost, scalability, data security and customizability.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive comparison between cloud and on-premise ERP integrations across critical factors that technology decision-makers must consider before selecting an integration approach. It also offers advice on determining if your business is better suited for the cloud or on-premise ERP ecosystem based on your operating model, growth objectives and enterprise architecture.\n\nCloud ERP Integration Overview\n\nERP solutions for the cloud from ERP software development services can be hosted on vendor or third-party servers and accessed through the Internet. With this deployment model, businesses don\u2019t have to invest in on-premise hardware and ERP infrastructure.\n\nCloud ERP systems such as Oracle NetSuite, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and Infor CloudSuite are more commonly built using modern API-led connectivity protocols rather than traditional on-premise approaches like batch data transfers or point-to-point integration.\n\nKey integration capabilities with cloud ERP deployments include:\n\nReal-time data sync between cloud ERP and other SaaS apps via APIs\n\nSimple app integration through cloud ERP marketplaces\n\nPrebuilt connectors to popular SaaS platforms like ecommerce, payments, marketing automation etc\n\nEDI and supply chain integration through cloud B2B networks\n\nIntegration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) for interfacing legacy on-premise systems\n\nAgility and Speed\n\nThe API-led architecture of cloud ERP systems integration accelerates the implementation of new apps and workflows to keep pace with business priorities. IT can build integrations in days/weeks rather than months with on-premise ERPs.\n\nLower TCO\n\nWith cloud ERP system integration, there is no need for upfront capital expenditure on integration software, hardware and middleware. Businesses only pay for used capacity as an operating expense.\n\nScalability\n\nYou can easily scale prebuilt and custom integrations to handle higher transaction loads as your ERP data integration volume grows without disruption. Usage-based pricing allows paying for only additional capacity.\n\nEnhanced Data Security\n\nCloud ERP vendors spend a lot of money on advanced security controls like encryption, tokenization, role-based access etc., and the integrations built using these systems also come with the same security capabilities.\n\nInnovation Velocity\n\nCloud ERP platforms are often updated, so their integration capabilities utilize the latest technologies, such as AI/ML, blockchain, advanced analytics, etc. On-premise systems do not provide these latest integration features.\n\nKey Challenges with Cloud ERP Integration\n\nWhile cloud ERP integrations accelerate digitization, some downsides need consideration:\n\nVendor dependence risk\n\nBusinesses become technologically wedded to the cloud ERP vendor. Migrating large data volumes across systems is challenging if the provider relationship turns sour later.\n\nCustomization constraints\n\nAlthough configuration is possible, custom-coding cloud ERPs like SAP S/4HANA Cloud are restricted. It limits bespoke modification of prebuilt integrations.\n\nIntegration costs add up\n\nWhile cloud ERP software integration needs lower initial investment, custom development and licensing connector apps in the marketplace incur ongoing costs.\n\nIntegration testing limitations\n\nCloud ERP vendors don\u2019t always fully simulate live production scenarios during integration ERP system testing, which can hinder the anticipation of post-go-live issues.\n\nCloud vendor technical support\n\nWhile some cloud ERP vendors provide prompt, expert technical support for complex integration issues and niche troubleshooting that requires troubleshooting skills, others don\u2019t.\n\nOn-Premise ERP Integration Overview\n\nSAP ECC, Oracle E-Business Suite, and Infor LN are ERP software installed on on-premises servers in the company system. The administration of the ERP platform and databases and the management of upgrades, security patches, and fixes are all the responsibilities of the IT team.\n\nLegacy B2B protocols like EDI and point-to-point middleware have historically dominated integration architectures for on-premise ERP deployments. However, modern integration tools like Boomi, MuleSoft and Microsoft BizTalk now empower API-based connectivity even with on-premise ERPs.\n\nHere are some of the prominent ERP integration methods with on-premise ERP platforms:\n\nEDI for B2B data interchange with supply chain partners\n\nPoint-to-point integration using middleware\n\nAPI connectivity to/from ERP using an integration platform (iPaaS)\n\nBatch data integration for periodic large data transfers\n\nOn-premise or hosted integration platform installations\n\nChange data capture for detecting and propagating updates\n\nEnterprise service buses (ESB) for routing integration traffic\n\nProcess integration with business process management (BPM) tools\n\nWhile cloud integration delivers agility, on-premise ERP integration brings other strategic advantages:\n\nCustomization Freedom\n\nOn-premise ERPs allow modifications to source code to enhance and tailor prebuilt integrations. They offer greater flexibility than cloud ERPs.\n\nBetter Legacy Connectivity\n\nOn-premise ERP software integration tools have well-established legacy protocol adapters that seamlessly interface with outdated systems. Thus, it is easier to retain legacy compatibility while upgrading an integrated ERP system.\n\nContinuity During Outages\n\nIntegration processes are minimally disrupted when the internet goes down as servers are inside the corporate firewall. The problem is that if externally hosted systems become unavailable, cloud integration workflows stop.\n\nStricter Data Security\n\nDirect control over servers without surrendering them to cloud vendors for stringent compliance and security reasons are some highly regulated industries such as defense and banking, etc.\n\nSuperior Support Mechanisms\n\nOn-premise ERP platforms allow easier leveraging of internal IT talent and external system integrators for technical support during complex integration issues. Resolution times are faster.\n\nKey Challenges with On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nHowever, businesses pay a steep price for the wide-ranging control and customizability delivered by on-premise ERP integration in certain areas:\n\nInflexible and slow\n\nDiplomatic protocols and point-to-point links between on-premise ERP and surrounding systems make agile integration challenging. Responding to changing needs involves prolonged development and testing cycles.\n\nSubstantial hardware demands\n\nMaintaining high-performance infrastructure for integration middleware, databases, backup systems etc., drives up capital expenditure costs with on-premise ERP integration.\n\nScaling limitations\n\nPhysical capacity in the on-premise data center constricts the addition of integration infrastructure to handle higher transaction volumes during business growth.\n\nVendor dependence\n\nWhile customization is possible, skilled resources for legacy ERP platforms like SAP ECC are dwindling. This compels businesses to pay premiums for vendor consulting.\n\nWaning innovation\n\nVendors are focused on developing their cloud ERP offerings. As a result, fewer cutting-edge features reach on-premise product versions through upgrades, causing integration capabilities to lag.\n\nMaking the Right Choice: Cloud vs On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nWhile both cloud and on-premise ERP integration models have trade-offs, the right choice depends on your business priorities and IT landscape:\n\nTransaction volume \u2013 High-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance\n\nHigh-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance Budget \u2013 Cloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment\n\nCloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment Agility needs \u2013 Frequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration\n\nFrequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration Compliance needs \u2013 Heavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control\n\nHeavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control Legacy landscape \u2013 Lots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges\n\nLots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges Innovation culture \u2013 Businesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features\n\nBusinesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features Application landscape \u2013 A predominantly cloud-based application portfolio suits cloud ERP integration, while on-premise apps align with on-premise ERP integrations\n\nIn addition, if an organization has a long-term hybrid enterprise architecture strategy, it can use both cloud and on-premise integration models at the same time.\n\nFor example, you can keep legacy on-premise ERP integration and cloud ERP integration with new SaaS capabilities. It allows you to pivot from existing systems to becoming cloud native at a sensible pace, keeping the critical operations running.\n\nThe bimodal integration architecture will align business IT objectives in terms of agility, innovation and risk mitigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nCloud ERP integration addresses serious challenges like inflexibility, upgrade headaches, and high total cost of ownership of legacy on-premise ERP platforms, albeit with its limitations: vendor dependency and customization constraints.\n\nWhile cloud ERP integration has compelling advantages for most modernizing enterprises, it deserves a careful analysis of your integration needs, IT ecosystem, business priorities and target operating model before you leap.\n\nAs cloud ERP adoption picks up sharply through 2025, the selection of integration technology now represents a watershed moment for the right digital transformation and innovation cadence.\n\nAfter methodically weighing the pros and cons of available integration approaches, choose wisely when to go with one, and then avoid modernization journeys that are completely misaligned and can seriously impede what you are trying to achieve with modernization."

            "article_content": "Theology is the study of our Triune God, His character, His actions in the universe, and His activities related to humankind. Reformed Theology stems from the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation, which served to counter the then-dominant Roman Catholic view of Theology.\n\nWhat are the Core Beliefs of Reformed Theology?\n\nReformed Theology is at the core of the Protestant Reformation. In its most basic and central structure, Reformed Theology is a picture of unity in diversity, with the Five Solas laying the foundation for the five points of Calvinism.\n\nThe core beliefs of Reformed Theology center on the aforementioned Five Solas of salvation\u2014Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone), Sola Gratia (Grace alone), Solus Christus (Christ alone), Sola Fide (Faith alone), and Soli Deo Gloria (the glory of God alone). Salvation comes by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone for the glory of God alone. Important distinctions of Reformed Theology state Scripture is our ultimate authority in all things pertaining to life and godliness and God\u2019s absolute sovereignty over all things.\n\nTo get even more specific, Reformed Theology has the following core beliefs which stem from the five solas. In these core beliefs, those who hold to reformed theology differ from adherents of Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Arminianism, and show the lasting legacy of Protestant reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin.\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in Predestination\n\nReformed Theology believes our final end, whether heaven or hell, is determined solely and sovereignly by the Lord God, and not only before we get there, but before we are born. Other faiths believe man has a role in where he ends up after his time on earth is done. Predestination holds the firm belief that God is all the Bible declares Him to be, which is merciful, holy, gracious, and just, etc. Whether He decrees a person saved or not, God is glorified wherever that person ends up.\n\nScripture: Proverbs 16:4; John 13:18; Romans 8:30; Ephesians 1:3-14\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in the Atonement\n\nReformed Theology believes Christ\u2019s death on the cross is the atonement necessary to save people from God\u2019s wrath. Sinful man cannot save himself; he needs a perfect, sinless Savior to save him. Through Adam, sin came to all humanity, Jesus, as the Last Adam, brought spiritual life to all who come to Him in repentance and faith and surrender to Him as Savior and Lord. Because God is sovereign and because of His plan of predestination, the salvation of the elect is sure (hence their assurance of salvation).\n\nScripture: Romans 3:21-28; Romans 5:17-19; 1 Corinthians 15:45; Matthew 1:21; John 3:16; John 17:9-12; Romans 8:30\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about the Role of Free Will in Salvation\n\nDr. R.C. Sproul said the \u201cvery essence of free will [is] to choose according to our desires.\u201d But as regards salvation, because we are fallen beings, we would choose our own way apart from God. That is the question: what causes man to choose to follow Christ? The great eighteenth-century pastor, Jonathan Edwards, said, \u201cas fallen human beings we retain our natural freedom (to act on our own wishes) but lose moral freedom (our inclination toward righteousness). God must change our hearts for us to choose Him. God draws the elect to Himself through the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n\nScripture: Deuteronomy 30:19-20; John 6:44; John 15:5; Romans 8:5-8\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about Baptism\n\nReformed theology holds that baptism is an ordinance mandated by Christ as a symbol of our alliance with Him, His death, burial, and resurrection/ Baptism is not what saves us, but rather a picture of what Christ has already done in our lives and hearts.\n\nScripture: Romans 4:11-12; 1 Corinthians 12:12-14; Titus 3:3-7\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about Communion\n\nReformed theology believes communion is the second ordinance Christ directed the church to observe regularly. Communion is what we call the Lord\u2019s Supper, where we proclaim His death and life in remembrance of what He did for us \u201cuntil He comes again.\u201d\n\nScripture: Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in the Triunity of God\n\nGod is One and he is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, according to Reformed belief. The Godhead is comprised of three persons with one essence. This triune nature of God will remain a mystery to our finite minds, yet it is true according to God\u2019s Word.\n\nScripture: Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 3:16-17; 1 Peter 1:2\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in the Deity of Christ\n\nJesus Christ is God, and He is fully God and fully man, according to Reformed belief.\n\nScripture: Mark 2:28; John 1;1-14; Philippians 2:9-11; Colossians 1:19\n\nReformed Theology's View on Faith\n\nOur faith is rooted in the truth of the infallible Scriptures and salvation is through faith in Christ's atoning work.\n\nScripture: Romans 1:16-32; Romans 5:1-11; Galatians 3:1-14; Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about the Church\n\nThe church is all the people who belong to the Lord\u2014the Bride of Christ\u2014God\u2019s elect, according to this theology.\n\nScripture: Matthew 13:24-43; 1 Corinthians 12: 12-14; Revelation 7:9-10\n\nReformed Theology's Views about the End Times\n\nReformed theology believes in the \u201cit-can-happen-at-any-moment\u201d rapture of the church, when believers will join Christ as he returns and be part of His triumphal procession. The invisible kingdom of God is here on earth in Christ's Body, the church; it will be physically revealed at Christ\u2019s return when He will reign as the true king.\n\nScriptures: Psalm 10:16-18; Daniel 2:44; John 18:36; Hebrews 1:8-14; Matthew 24: 1-25:46; Luke 21: 5-36; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:11\n\nIs Calvinism Part of Reformed Theology?\n\nIn short, yes. An important arm of Reformed Theology is Calvinism, named after its developer, John Calvin, a Swiss Reformer. Its basic tenets are comprised of five points, commonly known through the acronym, TULIP which is explained below.\n\nTotal depravity: because of the Fall (Genesis 3), humanity cannot save themselves and are blind, deaf, and dead to the Lord God. Man has no free will.\n\nUnconditional election: God chooses people based on His will alone, and not on any person\u2019s worth.\n\nLimited atonement: Jesus died only for the people God has chosen (the elect).\n\nIrresistible grace: God will sovereignly give His elect the gift of faith (salvation).\n\nPerseverance of the saints: No one saved by Jesus will ever lose their salvation (Once saved, always saved).\n\nHow Does Covenant Theology Relate to Reformed Theology?\n\nReformed Theology argues that covenant is central to Scripture\u2019s organization, and God\u2019s redemptive plan is organized around His covenants with humanity with Christ central to all. Reformed Theology is, in effect, Covenant Theology, and all covenants are culminated and encompassed in Christ. The biblical covenants are:\n\nThe Adamic Covenant (works) \u2013 Genesis 3 : This covenant established the terms of obedience for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where their disobedience brought sin and death into the world, initiating humanity's need for redemption.\n\n: This covenant established the terms of obedience for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where their disobedience brought sin and death into the world, initiating humanity's need for redemption. The Covenant of Grace (Genesis 3:15) : The overarching promise of salvation through a Redeemer, first introduced after the Fall, in which God pledged to defeat evil through the offspring of the woman, ultimately fulfilled in Christ.\n\n: The overarching promise of salvation through a Redeemer, first introduced after the Fall, in which God pledged to defeat evil through the offspring of the woman, ultimately fulfilled in Christ. The Noahic Covenant (Genesis 6:18) : God's promise to Noah after the flood, where He vowed never to destroy the earth by flood again, symbolized by the rainbow, ensuring the continuation of life and the stability of creation.\n\n: God's promise to Noah after the flood, where He vowed never to destroy the earth by flood again, symbolized by the rainbow, ensuring the continuation of life and the stability of creation. The Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12:1-3; 15) : God's promise to Abraham that He would make him the father of many nations, bless his descendants, and give them the land of Canaan, ultimately pointing toward the coming of the Messiah.\n\n: God's promise to Abraham that He would make him the father of many nations, bless his descendants, and give them the land of Canaan, ultimately pointing toward the coming of the Messiah. The Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19:4-6; 20:2) : The covenant in which God gave the Law to Israel through Moses, establishing a special relationship with them as His chosen people and setting the moral, civil, and ceremonial laws for their conduct.\n\n: The covenant in which God gave the Law to Israel through Moses, establishing a special relationship with them as His chosen people and setting the moral, civil, and ceremonial laws for their conduct. The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7; 1 Chronicles 17) : God's promise to David that his lineage would produce an eternal kingdom, ultimately fulfilled in the reign of Jesus Christ, the Messiah.\n\n: God's promise to David that his lineage would produce an eternal kingdom, ultimately fulfilled in the reign of Jesus Christ, the Messiah. The New Covenant in Christ (The New Testament): The culmination of all previous covenants, where Christ's death and resurrection secured eternal redemption for believers, fulfilling the law and providing a new relationship with God through grace.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Historical Background of Reformed Theology?\n\nMartin Luther and John Calvin are the two most famous men of the Protestant Reformation, and we will center our look at the historical background of Reformed Theology on these two, with a mention of the other important figures in furthering Reformation Theology.\n\nGerman monk Martin Luther sparked the Reformation in 1517 when he posted his 95 Theses on the door of the Wittenberg Chapel, wherein he listed his findings from deep biblical study and prayer. His beliefs were based solely on his discoveries from the Bible, and they opposed the Catholic theology which melded the Bible with tradition. His theses also negated the pope\u2019s autonomy.\n\nLuther\u2019s public profession of faith departed from the Catholic doctrines, and of course raised their ire. He defended himself and, at the end, was excommunicated as a heretic by Pope Cajetan at the Diet of Worms (a Diet was a formal assembly with the goal of oratory and making determinations). At this 1521 event, Luther stood his ground against the Catholic church council and made his famous reply to their demand he recant of his public professions, \u201cUnless I am convinced by the testimony of Scripture or by clear reason, for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves, I am bound by the Scriptures that I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. I cannot do otherwise. Here I stand, God help me.\u201d\n\nEven in exile from the Catholic church, Luther continued his work and translated the Bible into the German language (a task he finally completed in 1534). Martin Luther died in 1546, but his Reformation legacy includes bringing forth part of the Five Solas of the Reformation with the other Reformers; he coined the term Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone), which is the bedrock for the Reformation doctrines.\n\nJohn Calvin was a Swiss Reformer and is considered by many to be the greatest of the Protestant theologians. In 1532, Calvin started a Protestant movement in France (where he was born). One year later, the Catholic church labeled Calvin a heretic and he fled Paris. Calvin went on to write his most famous and enduring apologetic for the faith, Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), which explains Protestant beliefs.\n\nCalvin brought prominence to belief in the all-inclusive sovereignty of God and in the doctrine of predestination. His theological approach has been labeled \u201cCalvinism,\u201d a powerful theology embraced by an estimated eighty million Reformed Christians.\n\nWhat are Other Key Figures in Reformation History?\n\nJohn Wycliffe, an English priest who, in the fourteenth century, proposed limits to the pope\u2019s taxation policies and his civil powers. He challenged the Catholic belief of transubstantiation and believed Scripture should be available to the \u201ccommon folk.\u201d Followers of his later published the Wycliffe Bible, the first English Bible translation. Condemned by the Council of Constance of 267 heretical acts, Wycliffe died of complications from strokes; the Catholic church ordered his remains be unearthed, burned, and scattered on the river.\n\nJan Hus of Bohemia spread Wycliffe\u2019s ideas through a published paper. He refused to recant his stated beliefs and was burned at the stake.\n\nIn 1456, Johannes Gutenberg printed the first Bible in Europe (the Latin Vulgate) using moveable metallic type.\n\n\n\nWilliam Tyndale taught Scripture and is labeled a heretic by the Catholic council; his plans to print the New Testament in English, but upon discovery escapes with only a few sections completed, which he later finished in Germany. Tyndale was later imprisoned and then strangled and burned at the stake for heresy.\n\nWhat Influence Has Reformed Theology Had on Modern Christianity?\n\nReformed Theology places its emphasis firmly on Christ and His Word. The reformers stood against tradition, doctrinal errors, and an imposition of man\u2019s authority superseding God\u2019s. Hebrews 12:1 exhorts us to regard those who have gone before, from God\u2019s ancient prophets to the disciples and Apostles, and through the faithful men of the Reformation who exalted Christ, many at the cost of their lives.\n\nMost importantly, Reformed Theology looks to Christ, the Founder and Perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2)\u2014to what Christ has done, what He is doing now, and forward to what He will do. People who adhere to a Reformed Theology see Christ at the center of redemptive history and live accordingly, seeking to love Him and obey Him in all they do.\n\nReformed churches are unified in their stance that Christ and His Word define and govern their teaching and preaching. Worship encompasses all parts of life, not just Sunday praise and fellowship. Reformed churches tend toward more Bible studies, community groups, and evangelism outreaches.\n\nBecause Reformed Theology churches are secure in their salvation, Pastor Edwin Hurley states, \u201cRather than trying to earn our salvation or justify ourselves, we live lives of grateful service because of what Christ has done for us.\u201d Reformed churches come together with open Bibles and hearts, eager to hear what the Lord will teach through the pastor. The congregations are likened to the Bereans noted in Acts 17:11, who, \u201creceived the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\u201d What a noble and worthy endeavor for us to follow after.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhat is TULIP in Calvinism?\n\nWhat are the Five Points of Calvinism?\n\n5 Things All Christians Should Understand about Reformed Theology\n\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain\n\nLisa Loraine Baker is the multiple award-winning author of Someplace to be Somebody.

LAPRESSE\n\nIn a series of perplexing events, multiple UFO sightings have been reported and recorded over several days across California, particularly in the Fresno area. These sightings have sparked a wave of curiosity and concern, as both residents and authorities are left pondering the origins of these unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe string of sightings began with a mysterious light hovering over downtown Fresno in the early hours, just past 4 a.m. Local news station Fox 26 captured the first sighting on camera, showing a light that appeared to move swiftly before coming to a stationary hover. Earl Grey Anderson, a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), reviewed the footage and classified it as an unidentified flying object.\n\nTaylor Swift's Heartfelt Message to Swifties\n\nThe following day, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara documented another UFO sighting, this time in the daylight. The footage added to the mounting intrigue surrounding these mysterious occurrences. A few days later, a private pilot reported seeing a white object trailing his aircraft at an altitude of 3,500 feet over downtown Fresno. Despite radioing the local airport tower for assistance, the pilot lost sight of the object shortly after.\n\nStill concern over what happened\n\nSeveral Fresno residents have also come forward with similar reports, describing their encounters with the unidentified objects. The recent sightings have reignited public fascination with UFOs, particularly as the Pentagon continues to release declassified information about aerial phenomena.\n\nWhile some speculate about extraterrestrial origins, others consider the possibility of advanced human-made technology or natural phenomena. Authorities are urging residents to remain calm as investigations continue.\n\nDespite the ongoing mystery, the sightings have undoubtedly captured the imaginations of those who witness these unexplained objects in the California skies. As the story develops, residents and authorities alike remain vigilant, hoping to uncover the truth behind these enigmatic appearances."

However, certain diseases and medical conditions continue to receive less funding and attention compared to others.\n\nPatients with rare medical conditions and diseases are often part of a traditionally underserved population. However, \u201corphan drugs\u201d provide hope by offering treatment options that improve their quality of life and potentially extend life expectancy.\n\nImage Credit: unoL/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat is an Orphan Drug?\n\n\u201cOrphan\u201d diseases affect small patient populations. In the US, to be considered an orphan disease, it must affect under 200,000 patients. Typically, funding for treatment can be difficult to come by, with only 600 \u201corphan\u201d drugs approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1\n\nThe term\u2019s origin can be found in the 1960s when Dr Harry Shirkey wrote an article called \u201cTherapeutic Orphans.\u201d Changes in legislation and regulation in that decade led to some drugs being \u201corphaned\u201d as they were no longer cost-effective for drug companies due to a lack of market demand. Thus, there has historically been little financial incentive for pharma companies to develop drugs to treat rare diseases.2\n\nMarket Report 2025: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing\n\nUnderstanding Rare Diseases\n\nWhilst a rare disease is defined as affecting under 200,000 patients in the US, the global patient population living with these types of disease is estimated at 3.5-5.9%. This is in the range of 263 to 446 million people worldwide.3\n\nRare diseases include well-known types of diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis, ALS, and hemophilia, as well as rarer types of cancers.\n\nMetabolism disorders, autoimmune diseases, autoinflammatory syndromes, cerebrovascular disorders, degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (a prion disease) all fall under the umbrella of rare diseases.\n\nThere are over 10,000 known medical diseases with a significant cumulative burden. Not only patients are affected, but family members and communities can feel the impact of these rare and hard-to-treat conditions.\n\n5 Myths About Orphan Drugs and the Orphan Drug Act Play\n\nThe Role of Orphan Drug Legislation\n\nAs explained above, the rarer a disease is, the less financial incentive there is for pharma companies to research and develop a drug to treat it. However, whether there is any financial incentive or not, patients still suffer the effects of these diseases.\n\nThe role of legislation has been critical for the development of drugs for these diseases. It would be the drafting of legislation such as the Orphan Drug Act (1983) in the US and the EU Regulation on orphan medicinal products that would make it easier for orphan drugs to come to market.4,5\n\nThe Orphan Drug Act (1983) incentivizes the development of orphan drugs by providing tax incentives, research subsidies, and exclusive marketing rights for companies for 7 years once an orphan drug comes to market. Since the act was introduced, over 880 orphan drugs have been approved for use by the FDA.4 Similarly, in the EU, over 200 orphan drugs have been authorized due to legislation.\n\nWhy are Orphan Drugs Important?\n\nAs can be seen, orphan drugs have been historically critically underfunded, and in some cases, even today, they can face financial pressures that limit their release onto the market. However, at the foundation of orphan drug research can be found the patients themselves and their unmet medical needs.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the inequalities and disparities across different patient populations and demographics, and this has parallels in the rare disease sector.\n\nThe UN has now recognized the importance of addressing these disparities, promoting greater integration of rare and orphan diseases into policies.3 The goals of rare disease research and universal health coverage targets share a commonality.\n\nOrphan drugs do not just improve the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, as mentioned previously in this article. Better funding and improved access to therapies also impact the families and communities of patients.\n\nThese drugs bring social and economic benefits; for example, relieving the symptoms of a rare disease can reduce care needs and burdens on family members.\n\nFurthermore, orphan drugs drive advancements in precision medicine and biotechnology. Innovation in this area can have a positive impact on related biomedical fields.\n\nChallenges in Developing Orphan Drugs\n\nThere are still several challenges with orphan drugs, although bringing them to market has been made easier by legislation.\n\nHigh development costs, limited financial returns, difficulty in conducting trials due to small patient populations, and the high price of orphan drugs are all roadblocks to their market adoption.\n\nHigh costs create access issues for patients and healthcare providers. Moreover, insurance companies may be less willing to cover the costs of orphan drugs due to the high costs and perceived lack of financial return associated with them.\n\nDrug Delivery: An Overview\n\nRecent Advances and Success Stories\n\nSince the introduction of legislation such as the Orphan Drug Act, there have been several success stories in the orphan drug and rare disease sector.\n\nIvalfactor and Kalydeco are drugs that treat Cystic Fibrosis, a debilitating condition that affects nearly 200,000 people worldwide. Spinraza is an orphan drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nCoagulation factor IX has been developed to prevent bleeding in hemophilia B patients. Rucaparib is a drug that was approved for ovarian cancer. Porphyria can be treated using Haem arginate.\n\nInnovations such as targeted therapies and gene therapy are accelerating research into rare diseases and orphan drugs. Personalized medicine is having an impact on areas such as orphan drug designation and pricing strategies.6\n\nThe Future of Orphan Drugs\n\nThe need for orphan drugs and therapeutics options for traditionally underserved patient populations has driven legislation and cooperation between governments, pharma companies, and patient advocacy groups in recent years.\n\nThis is likely to continue over the coming years and will continue to impact health outcomes for millions of patients worldwide.\n\nFurthermore, innovations in areas such as AI-powered drug discovery, machine learning, synthetic biology, and genomics are accelerating orphan drug development.\n\nThe emerging role of AI, for instance, is a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical research, improving the speed of drug target discovery exponentially. Novel molecules can be designed, and patient response markers can be better identified.\n\nSynthetic biology can help target identification. Novel biopharmaceuticals can be designed using these innovations. This can only benefit the development of orphan drugs for rare disease treatment in the future.\n\nIn Summary\n\nMillions of patients worldwide suffer from rare diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cancers, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nOrphan drugs offer hope to these historically underserved patient populations, but a lack of funding and research focus makes releasing them to market problematic.\n\nHowever, legislation, innovation, and increasing collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, have resulted in more orphan drugs being approved in recent years, improving patients' quality of life and health outcomes.\n\nFurther innovation and continued focus on advocacy for orphan drugs will be necessary to build on this global medical success story.\n\nReferencing\n\nChao, S (2024) What is an Orphan Drug?
