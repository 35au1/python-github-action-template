            "article_content": "People are 'demanding answers' after home CCTV footage shows a man getting knocked out by a 'weird object'.\n\nBelievers think it's a 'UFO', while others have come up with even crazier theories.\n\nHave a look to see what you think:\n\nA few months ago, a Reddit user shared a mind-boggling video on the platform, and it's certainly divided the crowd.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe viral clip, filmed on 21 July, appears to show a man being knocked over outside of a home shortly after entering the property.\n\nThis happens 14 seconds into the video, as an object that appears out of nowhere slams into the door frame.\n\nFriends or family then head outside to check on the individual who fell over.\n\nSome think this viral Reddit video shows a 'UFO' knocking out a man 'in Columbia' (Reddit/u/kamm03)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"So this happened a few days ago in my hometown in Colombia,\" the user claimed.\n\n\"A really fast and strange object knocked a man down to the floor thru the stairs.\n\n\"He had 24 stitches at the hospital.\n\n\"I wouldn't classify this as an orb as some my friends think neither an animal, what do you guys think?\"\n\nAdvert\n\nAs you'd expect, people in the comments were coming up with all sorts of theories, as one person said: \"This video is absolutely wild.\n\nIt has been claimed that the incident was filmed 'in Columbia' earlier this year (Reddit/u/kamm03)\n\n\"Haven\u2019t ever seen anything like it. Looks like there\u2019s lots of reflection on the side of the vehicle. Not sure if that\u2019s from traffics or what.\"\n\nWhile another thought: \"It was just something tied to the door tied tight to hold it open. If you watch the door starts to close right before it happened.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThen a third argued: \"Not... really. Just actually look at the reflection and you see it actually goes on a lot longer than the 'object'.\n\n\"What likely happened here is the guy got knocked out by something from inside, or got electrocuted and jumped back.\n\n\"And at the exact same time some bug lit up in front of the camera.\"\n\nThe clip has divided the viewers (Reddit/u/kamm03)\n\nAdvert\n\nSomeone else also questioned: \"Idk.. the fact that the dog goes immediately towards where the object came from kinda freaks me out. Right after that, the dog does move to the body on the ground but its attention is immediately taken to that area. I wonder if the dog's sniffer picked something up.\"\n\n\"The eagle eyes that spotted the object circling around the cement mixer help confirmed depth and motion,\" a fifth added. \"This is a bug that is flying to the left, then towards the camera then up and over the top right edge of the camera nearly directly at it. Velocity and size of the object increase relatively proportionally to each other.\"\n\nWhatever your opinion, we can surely all agree how weird it is?"

Eerie \u2018UFO cloud\u2019 shocks Brits as rare phenomenon lurks over UK town for 10 minutes before disappearing\n\nA MYSTERIOUS cloud, shaped just like an alien spaceship, has been spotted hovering over the UK.\n\nThe strange sighting has been likened by onlookers to something out of sci-fi horror movie Nope, in which humans are sucked up and eaten by an otherworldly monster.\n\n2 This cloud is often what reports of UFOs turn out to be Credit: SWNS\n\nBut the cloud isn't anything sinister.\n\nIt's actually a rare phenomenon known as a lenticular cloud.\n\nCivil servant Dave Pickett, 38, and his son Blake, 7, snapped the moment before it quickly disappeared as it flew above Greenfield, near Oldham in Greater Manchester on Friday.\n\n\"We agreed it looked like a spaceship,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't the same ten minutes later, when the sky lost its colour as the sun was rising.\n\n\"I got lucky and had my phone to hand.\"\n\nHe added: \"I\u2019d never seen anything like it.\n\n\u201cA friend commented that it was a lenticular cloud, I had never heard of it.\n\n\"It reminded me of Nope. A cloud-looking UFO which turned out to be a big balloon thing.\"\n\nLenticular clouds usually fly between 6,500 to 16,500 ft off the ground.\n\nI\u2019m an Area 51 investigator \u2013 FBI raided my home & tried to silence me but I know secret UFO base is hiding new weapons\n\nThey can appear in the sky if a series of events with air and mountains occurs.\n\nWhen winds encounter a mountain it can create a train of large standing waves in the air downstream.\n\nIf there is sufficient moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, which causes lenticular clouds to appear.\n\nThey're believed to be one of the most common explanation for UFO sightings, according to the Met Office.\n\nPilots usually avoid flying near them in possible as they can result in increased turbulence."

I didn't sleep last night. When I would get up and look out my window, at 2am, 4am, they were still hovering,' Julie Shavalier, a Morris County resident, said.\n\nOthers have raised concerns that the objects are not drones, but UFOs.\n\nThe FBI has launched an investigation into mysterious, 'car-sized' drones seen flying over over New Jersey at night in the last several weeks\n\nSightings have been reported over Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster\n\nThe sightings have gained attention on social media, prompting speculation about where the drones came from and what they are doing.\n\n'False flag alien invasion. That\u2019s what they want, to induce fear,' one person posted on X.\n\nOthers suggested the drones are being used to spy on President-elect Donald Trump, who has been known to vacation at his Bedminster golf club and typically flies into Morristown Airport.\n\nTrump was the target of a failed Iranian assassination attempt in November.\n\nFarhad Shakeri, 51, was revealed to have admitted to orchestrating the terrifying scheme which was thwarted by the FBI and involved three alleged hitmen who were hired by the feared Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to carry out a hit on the president-elect.\n\nAnd earlier last month, Chinese spies were said to have hacked the smartphones of Trumps' lawyer and campaign staff.\n\nThe attacks have raised concerns about America's adversaries spying on the president-elect.\n\nEyewitnesses have reported spotting the unexplained drones over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster and the Picatinny Arsenal Military Base in Rockaway, among other locations\n\nBut it is not clear whether he has been at the golf course recently or who is behind the drones.\n\nX users also speculatively attributed the drones to Amazon's new Prime Air delivery service or, worryingly, to surveillance from a foreign power.\n\nMorris County Sheriff, James Gannon, told NBC News: 'There is no advisable immediate danger to the public at this time.'\n\nThe drone sightings first began in mid-November and have continued almost every night since, residents have reported.\n\nBut strangely, they appeared to 'take the night off' on Thanksgiving, Mike Walsh, a Morris County resident, told NBC New York.\n\nThe flying objects are larger than drones used by hobbyists, raising questions about their proximity to those specific locations\n\n\u201cCar-sized drones\u201d have reportedly just been spotted over President Trump\u2019s private residence in Bedminster, NJ \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfa5: @Civil_Disco pic.twitter.com/llL6uGoky2 \u2014 Matt Wallace (@MattWallace888) December 3, 2024\n\nOn November 22, the FAA banned drone flights over the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster until December 6, and the Picatinny Arsenal Military Base in Rockaway until December 26.\n\n'We look into all reports of unauthorized drone operations and investigate when appropriate,' the FAA said in a statement.\n\nThe agency also noted that drone operators who endanger aircraft of pedestrians could be fined up to $75,000 and lose their drone operators' pilot certificates.\n\nDays later, the FBI confirmed they were investigating the drone activity.\n\nThe digital news site NJ.com spoke with Eric Kowal, a spokesman for Picatinny Arsenal, who said it is illegal to fly drones over the base without prior authorization. But he does not believe the drones pose an immediate threat.\n\n'From our standpoint we're not alarming our residents and employees,' he said.\n\n'The FBI are the experts on the threat. We don't believe there to be a threat at this juncture.'\n\nNew Jersians are 'unnerved' by the incidents, telling reporters that they have seen drones hovering near their homes for hours at a time, sometimes in groups.\n\nWalsh stated that he has seen up to eight drones at once.\n\nChristian Kalweit, a small business owner from Mendham, said one of the drones he was was as big as a Cessna airplane.\n\n'All somebody needs to do is see the size... you're not buying that off of Amazon or some hobby store,' he told NJ.com.\n\nHe believes that the size is indicative of a military-grade aircraft.\n\nFor now, New Jersey residents can only guess who or what is behind the strange activity, as officials have not released any new information to explain their presence."

The three co-direct and are featured in this 55-minute show, with visuals by Xuan, the film by Four/Ten Media and music by Finkelmeier. Their work has amassed 15 nominations and awards, including from the Wisconsin Film Festival.\n\nLaurenz\u2019 great-great uncle and accomplished writer Lafcadio Hearn is the muse behind \u201cDESCENDED.\u201d A 19th century journalist, wayward traveler, teacher and meta-folk-ghost-story writer, Hearn followed his heart into the unknown.\n\nHearn\u2019s metaphysical literature explores paranormal and dissonant cognitive states, and Laurenz found peace through his story as she navigated the uncertainties of a career in the arts.\n\n\u201cI found a lot of hope and inspiration in how one can build a beautiful life that wanders,\u201d Laurenz said. \u201cIt gave me so much comfort just to know that I come from somebody like that.\u201d\n\nIn their post-performance Q&A, the artists shared how liberating they feel letting go of the sheet music and focusing on gestures and the narrative arc. Rather than sticking to a rigid plan, they bring about authentic evocations, connecting to their storytelling on a deeply emotional level."

Learn about the wonders of the cosmos, experience the scale of the universe in our wrap-around planetarium shows, and stargaze through our observatory telescopes\".\n\nThe huge dome on top of the building houses the Planetarium where screenings take place.\n\nInside the Planetarium, there's a 10m-high projection screen where different shows are projected and 59 seats for visitors.\n\nShows range from pre-recorded animations and presenter-led tours of the night sky to guest lectures and cinema shows.\n\nOther attractions at Sherwood Observatory Science Discovery Centre and Planetarium include the Observatory Telescope, which is one of the largest public-access optical telescopes in the country.\n\nVisitors who buy a show ticket for the Planetarium can also go to the Science Centre.\n\nHoused inside the underground Victorian reservoir, the Science Centre is a brick building that features a mix of permanent and temporary exhibitions.\n\nThe permanent exhibition displays rocket parts that Rolls Royce donated and a display that details the history of the Victorian reservoir.\n\nNew Attractions coming to the UK\n\nA temporary exhibition currently documents the history of human space flight.\n\nThere's also a Radio Astronomy, which is closed for refurbishment until 2025, and a cafe.\n\nEntry tickets to shows cost \u00a37.50 for a full-paying adult and \u00a36 for kids.\n\nThose visitors with show tickets can arrive one-hour before their time slot to explore the Science Centre and cafe.\n\nDr Steve Wallace, Chair of Sherwood Observatory and client project manager, told Building Design & Construction Commercial: \"Right from the initial vision, this project has been about collaboration and teamwork.\n\n\"The new Planetarium & Science Centre has exceeded expectations and the excitement that has been generated in the area as it has taken shape has been tangible.\n\n\" We are really pleased to open our doors to visitors and show them the wonders of the universe.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cllr Jason Zadrozny, Leader of Ashfield District Council, said: \"It really is spectacular, and it is something that will transform the lives of not just the people of Ashfield but also further afield.\"\n\nSherwood Observatory is a 40-minute drive from Nottingham, and it's a 70-minute drive from Birmingham.\n\nHere are five other space attractions to visit in the UK HERE are five other space attractions for would-be astronauts to visit in the UK. National Space Centre in Leicester - This is one of the UK's leading visitor attractions dedicated to space science and astronomy, featuring interactive exhibits, the UK's largest planetarium, and the iconic Rocket Tower. Royal Observatory Greenwich in London - Established in 1675, this historic observatory offers a range of exhibits on astronomy and navigation, as well as the opportunity to stand on the Prime Meridian Line. Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre in Cheshire - Home to the famous Lovell Telescope, this centre provides visitors with interactive displays, gardens, and opportunities to learn about the universe and the workings of this significant radio telescope. Armagh Observatory and Planetarium in Northern Ireland - Founded in 1790, this observatory offers a range of educational programmes, a planetarium show, and beautiful grounds to explore. Glasgow Science Centre in Glasgow - Featuring the Planetarium, which offers immersive shows about the stars, planets, and the universe, this centre is a great place for space enthusiasts of all ages.\n\nMeanwhile, a huge new attraction will launch in the UK next year - and it's based on an iconic 1980s video game.\n\nAnd across the Atlantic, there's a new Super Nintendo World opening at the new Universal Theme Park coming to Florida next summer."

In 2024, modern methods like DNA analysis and remote sensing technology revealed new evidence of past cultures, technologies, and social structures. But while archaeology often now advances through science, it still needs fresh excavations to feed future studies.\n\nHere are some of the most important archaeological discoveries from the last 12 months.\n\n1. Lidar reveals hidden cities around the world\n\nLidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging, an analog of radar and sonar that scans terrain with thousands of pulses of laser light every second. While the technology has been around for decades, its ability to detect vast structures beneath layers of vegetation and to map the subtle changes of ancient landscapes has recently revolutionized archaeology."

Roivant is discontinuing the development of a drug for the lung disease sarcoidosis following negative results from a mid-stage clinical trial.\n\nMoving forward with AI and drug discovery\n\nThe hype bubble of AI-driven drug discovery is getting a little precarious. We recently saw Insilico Medicine fall short on statistically significant efficacy with its AI-designed drug, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals showed no reportable efficacy with its own AI-discovered therapy.\n\nAI\u2019s true potential, Caleb Appleton of Bison Ventures opines in a new First Opinion essay, is in complementing traditional drug discovery, particularly in environments where data are plentiful enough to help answer specific biological questions.\n\n\u201cImprovements in efficiency will be real, but they won\u2019t take the $3 billion it costs to develop a successful drug to $50 million anytime soon,\u201d he writes. \u201cHow the industry reacts in the coming months and years will dictate whether we enter an AI winter.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead more.\n\n5 companies using AI to design small molecule drugs\n\nIn a related piece, STAT\u2019s Brittany Trang this morning highlights five companies in the AI-driven drug discovery space for small molecules.\n\nStartups like Terray Therapeutics and Isomorphic Labs are at the forefront of the field, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars to find new medicines. Interestingly, companies like Schr\u00f6dinger and Iambic are distancing themselves just a touch from labels: \u201cWe don\u2019t think of ourselves as an AI company,\u201d said Fred Manby, chief technical officer at Iambic Therapeutics \u2014 saying instead the company integrates machine learning with automated lab data, synthetic training data generated with computational physics, and Iambic\u2019s platform that \u201cenables us to move so effectively in discovery.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nUpdating the obesity drug tracker. Plus, a new feature\n\nFrom STAT\u2019s Allison DeAngelis: The competition to build better obesity drugs has gotten more intense than ever.\n\nA new quarterly update of STAT\u2019s Obesity Drug Tracker shows there are now close to 50 obesity drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, setting the stage for a news-filled 2025.\n\nLast week, Amgen \u2014 one of the pharma companies angling for a slice of weight loss drug sales \u2014 reported that its therapy MariTide led to an average of roughly 20% weight loss over a year. Boehringer Ingelheim has discontinued the development of an obesity drug targeting neuropeptide Y receptor type 2, while Arrowhead is moving its INHBE program into clinical trials. More startups clamored into the field this last quarter, including Kailera Therapeutics and Pep2Tango Therapeutics.\n\nAll told, the tracker is keeping tabs on roughly 150 drugs in development for weight loss and related conditions, about double the number of compounds than when STAT first published the tracker in fall 2023.\n\nTracking these updates is about to get even easier \u2014 you can register to get notified of updates to STAT\u2019s data tools and industry trackers, including the Obesity Drug Tracker, Generative AI Tracker, and CRISPR Tracker.\n\nGilead expanding in ADCs with Tubulis\n\nGilead Sciences is trying harder in the antibody drug conjugate space \u2014 partnering with Germany-based Tubulis in a deal worth $20 million up front to target solid tumors. Just last month, Gilead withdrew its antibody drug conjugate Trodelvy in bladder cancer, which had been approved in 2021, after a confirmatory trial failed. Trodelvy is still available for other indications, including some advanced breast cancers, and still remains a strong seller for the company.\n\nIn the deal, Gilead said Tubulis will design a topoisomerase I inhibitor-based ADC meant to have address challenges like durability and off-target toxicity issues.\n\nSanofi pours $1 billion into China for insulin plant\n\nSanofi just made its largest investment thus far in China, committing just over $1 billion to build a new insulin manufacturing facility in Beijing. This is Sanofi\u2019s fourth such site in China, which reflects the increasing demand for diabetes treatments for the 140 million adults there who have the disease. Sanofi\u2019s been in China for four decades now, and the company\u2019s plans are to integrate advanced automation, digital management, and sustainability practices into the plant.\n\nThis move comes amid challenges in China for Western pharma, FiercePharma points out, such as AstraZeneca\u2019s compliance woes and reported layoffs at Johnson & Johnson and Merck. Pfizer, meanwhile, has its own $1 billion planned investment in the country to accelerate drug development and support local biotechs.\n\nMore reads"

            "article_content": "\u201cThe web is a collection of data, but it\u2019s a mess,\" says Exa cofounder and CEO Will Bryk. \"There's a Joe Rogan video over here, an Atlantic article over there. There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.\u201d\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren\u2019t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can\u2019t do that, says Bryk: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.\u201d\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn\u2019t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it\u2019s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user\u2019s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven\u2019t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today\u2019s AI search engines as a sandwich with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nMore than keywords\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here\u2019s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users\u2019 queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nA screenshot of Websets showing results for the search: \"companies; startups; US-based; healthcare focus; technical co-founder\"\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa\u2019s search engine predicts the next link. Type \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa\u2019s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That\u2019s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn\u2019t see this as a problem: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embed the whole web to be useful,\u201d he says. (Fun fact: \u201cexa\u201d means a 1 followed by 18 0s and \u201cgoogol\u201d means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)"

            "article_content": "2025 promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development, driven by the relentless advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). As AI continues to permeate every facet of our lives, its impact on the software development landscape is undeniable. From automating mundane tasks to revolutionizing the creative process, AI is poised to reshape the way we build and deploy software.\n\nDevPro Journal recently spoke with Bhavani Vangala, VP of Engineering at Onymos, who identified five key trends that will significantly influence software development in 2025. By understanding these trends, developers can harness the power of AI to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and create more innovative and sophisticated applications.\n\nSkepticism Around Current AI Deployments Will Foster More Thoughtful and Scalable Future AI Development\n\nVangala says AI has become a crucial topic for executives and technology leaders over the past two years, especially following the surge of generative AI tools and models in late 2022 and early 2023. However, he adds that there is growing skepticism about whether some current AI deployments are truly production-ready solutions or just conceptual and document-level implementations driven by hype\u2014especially in the healthcare, finance, legal, and manufacturing industries. \u201cIn 2025, enterprises will increasingly evaluate their end-customer needs to accurately gauge AI\u2019s potential impact, assess the relevance of new AI trends for their businesses, and determine whether their development efforts will yield a return on investment,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis evaluation process will lead to more enterprises focusing their AI efforts on delivering tangible and scalable AI that will solve a particular need or challenge for their customers and businesses.\u201d\n\nThe Next Wave of Generative AI Model Training Will Focus on Improving Inference and Reasoning\n\n\u201cThe next wave of generative AI model training in 2025 is set to be transformative, focusing on enhancing reasoning and inference capabilities to make AI responses more intuitive and aligned with human thought processes,\u201d says Vangala. \u201cOpenAI\u2019s recent release of models like o1-preview models this shift, demonstrating significant improvements in inference and reasoning abilities. These advancements enable AI to process and respond to prompts with increased coherence and contextual awareness, marking a promising step forward.\u201d\n\nCurrent generative AI models often require detailed prompts and follow-up questions to provide accurate responses, especially for complex or nuanced inquiries, he adds. \u201cThis reliance on precise inputs can make interactions feel less fluid, as users must know how to phrase questions specifically to achieve accurate responses. Ongoing training efforts over the next year will aim to make AI\u2019s reasoning processes more natural and adaptable, enabling models to grasp context dynamically, consider implicit details, and apply logical steps similar to human thought patterns. This progression will allow models to not only answer questions but also infer intent and address nuanced needs effectively.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI Will Continue to Improve, Evolving Into Key Collaborative Partner\n\n\u201cWhile models like o1-preview represent substantial progress, the AI field is moving toward even greater strides in making models true collaborative partners,\u201d explains Vangala. \u201cThis involves continuous improvements to help models better emulate the way humans approach complex, layered decision-making. Such progress isn\u2019t just about faster responses\u2014it\u2019s about creating a depth of understanding that lets AI interact in a way that feels smooth, helpful, and highly attuned to user intent. However, human oversight remains vital, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare, finance, and law, where AI should support rather than replace decision-making.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, generative AI will continue to serve as an assistant, providing experts with fast, refined insights they can validate and adapt as needed. This evolution in model training positions AI as an increasingly trusted partner in decision-making and problem-solving, delivering insights with a depth and accuracy close to human judgment while respecting the complexity and nuances of each unique domain. By embracing AI as a collaborative tool rather than an autonomous replacement in the year \u2013 and years to come \u2013 industries can strike a productive balance, leveraging AI\u2019s strengths to enhance human expertise and drive meaningful, responsible advancements.\u201d\n\nAI Will Not Take Away the Roles of Software Developers or Architects\n\nVangala says that while some industries may still be exploring AI solutions at a conceptual level, it\u2019s clear that generative AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs), can improve productivity by summarizing vast amounts of data in minutes.\n\n\u201cThis capability allows professionals to draw insights and make informed decisions more rapidly,\u201d he adds. \u201cHowever, AI will not replace critical roles like software developers and architects in 2025 \u2013 or even in the years to come. Generative AI tools can indeed produce code that developers and enterprises may leverage to accelerate software development.\n\n\u201cWhile this efficiency can appeal to enterprises looking to cut costs and speed up project timelines, AI-generated code requires careful review. The code these tools produce comes from existing text and data shared online, which are contributed for specific purposes or products. Therefore, it cannot be directly integrated by simple copying and pasting.\n\n\u201cSoftware developers and architects must thoroughly review, test, and adapt this code to fit specific software requirements and ensure it\u2019s robust and maintainable over the long term. This means that software developers and architects remain essential to the software lifecycle. They bring the expertise necessary to adapt code to unique applications and to handle the ongoing evolution of software, making their roles crucial for successful development and deployment. As a result, AI is a tool that aids productivity but does not replace the need for experienced professionals in the development field. This blend of AI-driven efficiency and human oversight is particularly relevant across healthcare, finance, legal, retail, and manufacturing industries, where AI serves as an enabler rather than a replacement.\u201d\n\nSmall Language Models Will Gain Popularity for Specific Domains\n\n\u201cIn 2025, growing concerns about cost, infrastructure, and privacy will fuel the development and utilization of small language models [SLMs] across multiple sectors, such as healthcare, law, government, and finance, explains Vangala. \u201cWhile large language models can be beneficial in certain situations, they often necessitate specialized infrastructure and cost, making them less accessible to many companies, especially startups.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, significant privacy and security concerns exist around the data used in training LLMs. This concern is particularly high in healthcare, where safeguarding user (or patient) information is crucial, and model customization is preferred. Just think about it this way: would you be comfortable integrating an LLM based on accurate and misleading data from the web in a tool that assesses cancer risk? By utilizing SLMs, organizations in high-stakes sectors can develop tailored models based on domain-specific and accurate data while ensuring privacy, security, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"
