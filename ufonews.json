            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nAt some point, the truth about all of these UFO and drone sightings has to start being revealed. There are just too many eyewitness reports and videos being shared online for governments to just keep pretending like nothing is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the United States either (though that is where a majority of the reports are originating). They have also been happening in places like the United Kingdom, Germany, and now, in Brazil.\n\nWhile orb-shaped UFOs are perhaps the most common type of UFO that has been seen over the years, triangular-shaped crafts have also been reported being seen quite often.\n\nThe latest triangular-shaped UFO to be reported, and in this case filmed, occurred recently in the Barigui Park, in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.\n\n\u201cI came across the video yesterday while browsing reels on Instagram,\u201d a report written for Ovniologia in Brazil read. \u201cThe account published the footage, called Paranadrone , is a page dedicated to aerial images to with drones and has no connection to the UFO theme.\n\n\u201cI contacted you and requested the original footage, which was sent to me. The video was forwarded them by a follower who requested anonymity. The images were recorded around 8 pm, while the witness was in a trade in the park region.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the video, it is possible to see that the person filming was apparently close to a wall, inside a residence or business, the Paranadro told me. Then, we see a large, luminous point coming from the left, reveals its which triangular shape when the witness zooms in,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cThe object crosses the sky at a considerable and constant speed until it disappears from the author\u2019s field of vision behind the trees. See below.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have what appears to be beautiful footage of a triangular UFO. The fixed, unwavering lights at the bottom seem to match reports of these craft. One worth thing noting is the number of lights. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, three to four lights are usually reported on these objects. However, in the footage, in addition to the three lights at the ends, we can see two more luminous points near the larger central light.\n\n\u201cThis led me to question if it was actually a solid object or just a formation of orbs. While the footage is quite clear, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say that another witness to the same UFO claimed it had \u201ctwo lights at a considerably low altitude that same day. One of them was in front of her house, with a green and red coloration, while the other, located behind the house, was orange in color and considerably larger.\u201d\n\nHer neighbor also saw the UFO and also filmed it.\n\nThe report by Ovniologia went on to explain, \u201cI spoke to other people who reported strange activity in the skies over Curitiba this month. The reports describe some anomalous sightings and experiences. It is possible that that some incidence of the phenomenon is occurring in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the video of the triangular UFO, the first thing thing that came to mind was the wave of drones on American soil. Could there be any possible connection? Could it be starting to spread to other regions of the Americas? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo far, no definitive explanation has been revealed."

            "article_content": "Smaller artificial intelligence stocks have seemingly gone parabolic at the close of 2024, especially those that have been backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the form of an investment. Although Nvidia invested a mere $3.7 million in voice-AI start-up SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) about a year ago, that investment put SoundHound squarely on the map as a potential AI winner.\n\nAfter making several accretive acquisitions and racking up an impressive customer list, SoundHound's stock has soared in recent weeks.\n\nIs this price increase a signal that SoundHound could be the next \"killer app\" AI platform? Or is it a sign of a bubble waiting to burst?\n\nWhy SoundHound has made a big noise lately\n\nSoundHound appears to have achieved escape velocity as the go-to voice-enabled AI system outside big tech, especially within the automotive and quick-serve restaurant (QSR) verticals. SoundHound has landed seven of the top 20 QSR brands, including heavyweight Chipotle, for things like phone and drive-through ordering. In automotive, SoundHound's voice AI is now embedded in many leading auto brands such as those owned by car giant Stellantis, as well as four major electric vehicle manufacturers as of last quarter.\n\nIn addition to those two big verticals, this past summer's acquisition of Amelia, another voice-based start-up for enterprises, has boosted SoundHound's enterprise platforms both for customer service applications and employee-facing IT AI applications.\n\nWhy SoundHound has an early lead in voice AI\n\nWhile the generative AI craze has only been happening for two years, SoundHound has actually been around since 2005, and first released its Houndify voice AI platform 10 years later in 2015. So, the company has been developing this technology for a long time.\n\nWhile SoundHound does incorporate other third-party large language models into its products when necessary, it has distinguished itself by building its own proprietary model called Polaris. Polaris is built on its two decades of experience spanning billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio in dozens of languages.\n\nSoundHound has only been building Polaris since LLM training was available, but the platform is already in use for one-third of the company's restaurant ordering transactions, while management aims to eventually use Polaris in all of SoundHound's interactions across its platform.\n\nIn the age of AI, having proprietary data to build one's own model or augment a general-purpose LLM -- in this case, SoundHound's billions of voice transaction data going back decades -- should be a competitive advantage.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nIn the tech world, we like to label periods as the year of (insert milestone here). This past year (2024) was a year of broader experimentation in AI and, of course, agentic use cases.\n\nAs 2025 opens, VentureBeat spoke to industry analysts and IT decision-makers to see what the year might bring. For many, 2025 will be the year of agents, when all the pilot programs, experiments and new AI use cases converge into something resembling a return on investment.\n\nIn addition, the experts VentureBeat spoke to see 2025 as the year AI orchestration will play a bigger role in the enterprise. Organizations plan to make management of AI applications and agents much more straightforward.\n\nHere are some themes we expect to see more in 2025.\n\nMore deployment\n\nSwami Sivasubramanian, VP of AI and data at AWS, said 2025 will be the year of productivity, because executives will begin to care more about the costs of using AI. Proving productivity becomes essential, and this begins with understanding how multiple agents, both inside internal workflows and those that touch other services, can be made better.\n\n\u201cIn an agentic world, workflows are going to be reimagined, and you start asking about accuracy and how do you achieve five times productivity,\u201d he said.\n\nPalantir chief architect Akshay Krishnaswamy agreed that decision-makers, especially those outside of the technology cluster, are beginning to get antsy about seeing the impact these AI investments will have on their businesses.\n\n\u201cPeople are rightfully fatigued about more sandboxing, because it\u2019s off the back of the whole data and analytics journey of the past 10 years, where people also did a ton of experimentation,\u201d said Krishnaswamy. \u201cIf you\u2019re an executive, you\u2019re like, \u2018this has to be the year I actually start to see some ROI, right?\u2019\u201d\n\nAn explosion of orchestration frameworks\n\nGoing into 2025, there is a greater need to create infrastructure to manage multiple AI agents and applications.\n\nChris Jangareddy, a managing director at Deloitte, told VentureBeat that next year will be very exciting. Competitors will face LangChain and other AI companies looking to offer their own orchestration platforms.\n\n\u201cA lot of tools are catching up to LangChain, and we\u2019re going to see more new players come up,\u201d Jangareddy said. \u201cEven before organizations can think about multiagents, they\u2019re already thinking about orchestration so everyone is building that layer.\u201d\n\nMany AI developers turned to LangChain to start building out a traffic system for AI applications. But LangChain isn\u2019t always the best solution for some companies, which is where some new options includingMicrosoft\u2019s Magentic or LlamaIndex come in. But for 2025, expect to see an explosion of even more new options for enterprises.\n\n\u201cOrchestration frameworks are still very experimental, with LangChain and Magentic, so you can\u2019t be heads down for just one,\u201d said PwC global commercial technology and innovation officer Matt Wood. \u201cTooling in this space is still early, and it\u2019s only going to grow.\u201d\n\nBetter agents and more integrations\n\nAI agents became the biggest trend for enterprises in 2024. As organizations gear up to deploy multiple agents into their workflows, the possibility of agents crossing from one system to another becomes more apparent. This is particularly true when enterprises are looking to demonstrate their agents\u2019 full value to executives and employees.\n\nPlatforms like AWS\u2019s Bedrock, and even Slack, offer connections to other agents from Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce or ServiceNow, making it easier to transfer context from one platform to another. However, understanding how to support these integrations and teaching orchestrator agents to identify internal and external agents will become an important task.\n\nWhen agentic workflows become more complex, the recent crop of more powerful reasoning models, like OpenAI\u2019s recently announced 03 or Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0, could make orchestrator agents more powerful.\n\nHowever, all of this will be in vain if enterprises do not get their employees to actually use new AI tools in 2025.\n\nDon Vu, chief data and analytics officer at New York Life, told VentureBeat that the last-mile problem of employees often choosing more manual methods over AI will continue for the next year.\n\n\u201cThe last mile problem is something that we\u2019ve all stubbed our toe on in 2024, and understanding that change management, business process reengineering stuff that\u2019s not maybe as sexy as building an agent that can do all these incredible things,\u201d said Vu. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to change human behavior than deploy an app.\u201d"

The book is unusual in more ways than one. Unlike most ex-cops who would write of tales of bravery, achievements, administrative ills, or insider info, Ganapathy detours towards a path less taken and fictionalises a policeman\u2019s life and gives it a paranormal twist, as if to make sense of many puzzling events he must have witnessed in his long and illustrious career.\n\nThis is an interesting choice given his writing about his work at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Ministry of Home Affairs, Central Industrial Security Force, and as the DGP of Uttarakhand before hanging his boots as the chief of the NSG earlier this year, could have made for a juicy read.\n\nHowever, the ex-cop takes the Ruskin Bond route of paranormal tales, who also serves as an inspiration. \u201cRuskin Bond\u2019s stories in this genre became my staple at one point, which I read several times over,\u201d Ganapathy writes about the much-loved writer, who, in turn, reviews the book as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy interest in the paranormal was fuelled in no small measure by the stories of certain odd events narrated by my grandfather, a retired forester, who had served in remote corners of South India,\u201d the author writes in the introduction, and it shows. While every short story in this quick-to-read book spanning just over 100 pages is engrossing, the tales where he absolutely shines are those set against forests with spirits and wildlife appearing periodically to seek redemption for the victims through a paranormal route.\n\nThe stories are told through the eyes of Avinash, a diligent and low-profile cop. The first book of any writer is an autobiography of sorts, they say, and it\u2019s evident in Ganapathy\u2019s work as he takes the readers through India\u2019s varied landscapes where he grew up and worked, from his native home in the Western Ghats and alma mater in Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the Naxal-hit regions of central India.\n\nUnlike how policemen are generally showcased in popular culture as either god-sent or pure evil, Ganapathy doesn\u2019t portray them as either but rather shines the light on the victims. And in the process, he also humanises his lot by focusing on what they experience on the field and their relationship with their work, colleagues, families, teachers, alma mater, and even the victims and the offenders. \u201cWhy do human beings inflict such unspeakable atrocities on other human beings, that too for an outdated ideology, he (Avinash) wondered,\u201d he writes, giving a peak into a policeman\u2019s psyche.\n\nWhispers in the Shadow isn\u2019t your typical horror read. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even use horror to spook the reader but to make sense of the difficult-to-comprehend events and offer closure where none exists. From spooky forest spirits to post-death experiences and time travel, Ganapathy employs just enough elements to make his debut book an interesting and captivating read.\n\nWhispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman\n\nAuthor: M.A. Ganapathy\n\nPublisher: Srishti Publishers and Distributors\n\nPages: 120\n\nPrice: Rs 299"

Frankenstein \u2014 2025 1. 28 Years Later \u2014 June 20, 2025\n\nWhile 2024 may have been a terrific year for horror films, 2025 has plenty of more scary movies that may top what came before. The next 12 months won\u2019t just bring audiences terrifying sequels like M3GAN 2.0 and 28 Years Later. Audiences will also witness new IPs being brought to life in films like The Monkey and Companion.\n\nNext year should present a healthy balance of familiar and original stories to cinemas and streaming, and these seven movies currently stand out as the most highly-anticipated horror movies of 2025.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n7. The Black Phone 2 \u2014 October 17, 2025\n\nThe Black Phone, the hit supernatural horror film from director Scott Derrickson, continues its chilling story with this long-awaited sequel. The Black Phone 2 will see the return of stars Mason Thames, Madeline Graw, and Ethan Hawke, the latter of whom played the terrifying serial killer, the Grabber.\n\nConsidering the Grabber\u2019s death at the end of the first film and the ending its young protagonists had, it seemed like the franchise couldn\u2019t go any further. However, since ghosts are an important part of the story, the sequel seems prime to bring the Grabber back to unleash another haunting on Finney and Gwen.\n\n6. Companion \u2014 January 31, 2025\n\nProduced by Zach Cregger, writer/director of the horror film Barbarian, Companion features a romance that goes straight to hell when a group of friends get together at a lavish lakeside estate. The film\u2019s darkly humorous trailer shares very little about the plot but does suggest plenty of blood and scares.\n\nIt also hints at a tense and disturbing look into the toxic relationship shared by its two leads, igniting a powder keg of death and terror that must be seen to be believed. The film also features a lead performance from rising Scream Queen Sophie Thatcher, which should attract horror fans\u2019 attention after her riveting performance in 2024\u2019s Heretic.\n\n5. The Monkey \u2014 February 21, 2025\n\nFresh off the viral success of his chilling horror film Longlegs, director Osgood Perkins will release his adaptation of author Stephen King\u2019s short story The Monkey. This Neon and James Wan-produced film revolves around the titular cursed toy, which unleashes a series of bizarre and gruesome deaths, forcing two brothers to try and destroy it once and for all.\n\nThe trailers for this film tease a wild but terrifying blend of Annabelle and Final Destination, making for one of the most unique and over-the-top King adaptations in recent memory.\n\n4. The Conjuring: Last Rites \u2014 September 5, 2025\n\nAs one of the most popular horror movie franchises in modern cinema, The Conjuring Universe will have all eyes on it as it closes the book on its fictionalized accounts of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The story surrounding this frightening fourth film is still unknown \u2014 however, the Warren family\u2019s several real-life cases exploring the supernatural allow for multiple creative possibilities.\n\nIn previous films, the Warrens have faced all sorts of possessions brought on by ghosts, demons, witches, and cursed dolls. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what The Conjuring franchise will unleash next with Last Rites, but it will surely be a fright fest for the ages.\n\n3. M3GAN 2.o \u2014 June 27, 2025\n\n2025 will be another big year for killer dolls, particularly due to the upcoming release of M3GAN 2.0 and the return of its titular dancing, slashing robot. It\u2019s unknown what this sci-fi horror sequel will present after the hit original film, which ended with Gemma and Cady destroying M3GAN\u2019s body and the evil AI transferring her consciousness to another machine.\n\nNevertheless, M3GAN seems geared toward exacting bloody vengeance on her former caretakers, making for another gruesome and satirical horror blockbuster for fans to enjoy.\n\n2. Frankenstein \u2014 2025\n\nLegendary filmmaker Guillermo del Toro returns to the director\u2019s chair with his adaptation of one of the horror genre\u2019s most popular stories ever. Considering del Toro\u2019s reverence of both Mary Shelley\u2019s source novel and the many films it spawned, 2025\u2019s Frankenstein will likely breathe new life into this iconic tale, adding to the resurgence of classic horror movies brought on by The Invisible Man, Nosferatu, and The Wolf Man.\n\nAlso, with an all-star cast including Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Mia Goth, and Christoph Waltz, this Netflix-exclusive film will surely electrify the internet once it premieres on streaming.\n\n1. 28 Years Later \u2014 June 20, 2025\n\nAfter over 20 years of waiting, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland have returned with their threequel to their iconic zombie movie 28 Days Later. Shot entirely on iPhones, 28 Years Later built up tremendous hype with its haunting teaser trailer, featuring glimpses of evolved zombies and a huge, post-apocalyptic war breaking out decades after the franchise\u2019s film.\n\nThis third movie won\u2019t just include new stars like Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes. It will also feature the return of actor Cillian Murphy, fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer. 28 Years Later even sets up a fourth movie set to premiere in 2026, reinvigorating this groundbreaking zombie franchise for modern audiences as one of the most hotly-anticipated horror blockbusters of 2025."

(Getty Images)\n\nRobbie Williams' incredible life on and off the stage will keep Better Man audiences gripped.\n\nDespite packing so much into the biopic, there are still another 20 years of highlights that the film doesn't get around to.\n\nHis life story finishes circa 2003 in the Michael Gracey movie, due out on Boxing Day, and Williams has not exactly had a quiet time of it over the following two decades.\n\nWhether that means a sequel could be on the horizon remains to be seen but these are the highlights of everything Williams has done since Better Man's final scenes.\n\nSolo success\n\nThe singer has had huge success as a solo artist. (Redferns via Getty Images)\n\nBetter Man takes us up to a milestone in Williams' solo career, his sell-out three nights of shows at Knebworth in 2003.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, far from marking the end of his success, it saw him go on to release seven more solo albums \u2014 Intensive Care (2005), Rudebox (2006), Reality Killed the Video Star (2009), Take the Crown (2012), Swings Both Ways (2013), The Heavy Entertainment Show (2016), and The Christmas Present (2019), as well as a greatest hits album in 2004.\n\nThe singer's loyal fans have continued to allow him to sell out shows across the world, with a new tour announced for 2025.\n\nWilliams has also been in-demand for collaborations with stars including Kylie Minogue on Kids in 2000, Somethin' Stupid with Nicole Kidman in 2001, and We Are the Champions with Queen in the same year.\n\nRejoining Take That\n\nTake That fans were thrilled to see Take That back together. (Redferns)\n\nAlthough Williams has made no secret of his difficult years with Take That in the 90s, he did eventually reconcile with his former bandmates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn recent BBC documentary Boybands Forever, Williams talked about rebuilding his relationship with Gary Barlow during a clear the air chat which led to them \"rolling on the floor belly laughing\".\n\nHe said: \"Gaz is one of the best songwriters we've ever had in the country. And he also happens to be an incredibly dependable person that you can lean on. He's solid, Gaz. I've just got overwhelming amounts of admiration for the man.\"\n\nFollowing some one-off appearances at each other's shows, Williams officially reunited with Take That in 2010, a huge moment for fans of the group who had been left devastated when Williams quit in the 90s.\n\nThey released Progress later that year which became the fastest selling album since 2000, and went back out on tour together including eight nights at Wembley.\n\nWilliams missed the group's London 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony performance as his wife Ayda Field was due to give birth around the same time, and chose not to join Take That for their following albums and tours. But he remains on good terms with his former co-stars.\n\nMarriage and fatherhood\n\nRobbie Williams and Ayda Field married in 2010. (WireImage)\n\nHe's had some high-profile relationships with stars including Melanie Chisholm, Nicole Appleton (who went on to marry his Liam Gallagher) and Geri Halliwell, but Williams is now happily married to US actor Ayda Field.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe couple met on a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the paranormal and UFO sightings which Williams made with Jon Ronson and featured Field. The singer began dating her in 2006 and they married in 2010.\n\nField and Williams, who now live in London, have four children \u2014 daughters Teddy and Coco and sons Charlie and Beau. Their two youngest children were born via surrogate.\n\nThe star says family life has transformed him. (Getty Images)\n\nWilliams has often joined Field on Loose Women, where she is a panellist, and she recently spoke about her pride at Williams' work on Better Man. She said: \"What's so amazing about it is that not only are you watching the story of Robbie Williams but you're really watching an evolution of a character who goes through some really heavy things. Rob said it's not a musical, it's an abusical. It is no holds barred, it's honest, it's brave, everyone who saw the film with us was crying.\"\n\nThe couple have opened up on their podcast about a rocky start to their relationship which saw Williams dump Field three times while he tried to get control of his addictions. Field admitted: \"He was my soulmate and then he was gone.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut they are now stronger than ever, as Williams revealed in his recent Netflix documentary: \"There is a happy ending for me anyway. I guess the god-shaped hole has been filled with four kids and a wife. I'm a dad of four and a loving husband. I'm on my way to being really happy.\"\n\nOpening up on mental health\n\nRobbie Williams in 2006. (WireImage)\n\nWilliams' life today looks very different from the days when he had just left Take That and he has been open about how working through his mental health struggles and addictions has helped him.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo ahead of Better Man's release, he said: \"We were in the dark ages, when it comes to talking, thinking, representing mental health as a problem. Now we\u2019re not.\"\n\nWilliams also told the Telegraph that he is in a great place now: \"See, I\u2019ve struggled with mental illness, and all the way through the most successful parts of my career, I couldn\u2019t derive joy from them. There\u2019s been a couple of decades, maybe a bit more, of just depression, anxiety, agoraphobia, dyslexia, dyscalculia - all the things we diagnose our friends with at dinner parties, I\u2019ve got them.\"\n\nHe added: \"Through working on myself, through seeking help and taking help, and through the love of a good woman and four kids, and just growing up and maturing, I\u2019m in the best place that I\u2019ve ever been.\"\n\nRobbie Williams says meeting Ayda Field has changed his life. (Getty Images)\n\nField also addressed the ongoing effects of Williams' struggles recently as she told Loose Women her feelings on their children one day watching his Netflix documentary or Better Man.\n\nShe said: \"I don't think there's ever been a moment where we've sat Teddy down and said, you know your father is an addict, he did lots of drugs, he slept with lots of women.\n\n\"But there are things that come up in our lives and we have very age-appropriate conversations about their father's story and what he's been through, what we've been through as a couple. In our house we're very honest and Teddy is aware that her father is an alcoholic and a drug addict and that's why Daddy doesn't touch these things. She knows a lot about his story to the right degree.\"\n\nOutside of music\n\nRobbie Williams founded SoccerAid for UNICEF. (PA Images)\n\nHis superstar status has meant that Williams is in demand for all kinds of other projects away from his music career.\n\nIn 2018, he and Field joined The X Factor together as a coaching duo for the series, while Williams has also coached on German reality show Popstars: Girls Forever.\n\nHe voiced the character of Dougal in the 2005 film of The Magic Roundabout and wrote the music for Channel 4's adaptation of The Tiger Who Came To Tea.\n\nAs a keen football fan, Williams briefly set up a team called Los Angeles Vale FC between 2005 and 2007 while living in the US, and in January 2024 he was named president of his hometown club, Port Vale FC.\n\nWilliams combined his love of football and his keen support of charities by founding Soccer Aid for UNICEF, an annual charity football match played by professionals and celebrities.\n\nAwards\n\nThe singer at the 2005 Brit Awards. (PA Images)\n\nAs you might expect, Williams' long and varied career means he has a full-to-bursting trophy cabinet.\n\nEnding Better Man in 2003 means that the singer has modestly bypassed some of his bigger wins, which include Ivor Novello awards in 2005 when Angels was named song of the decade, and in 2012 with Take That for outstanding contribution to British music.\n\nWilliams has been a regular at the Brit Awards for decades, but left behind the heady days of the 2000 ceremony where he used his acceptance speech to challenge Liam Gallagher to a fight and went on to pick up some prestigious titles.\n\nIn 2003, the Brits named him British male solo artist of the year, while in 2005 Angels was crowned the best song of last 25 years. He was honoured in 2010 with the prize for outstanding contribution to music, in 2011 Take That won best British group, and in 2017 Williams was honoured again with the icon award.\n\nFuture plans\n\nRobbie Williams still has big plans for the future. (Getty Images)\n\nWilliams packs more into the years covered by Better Man than most artists would in a lifetime, but even adding on the 20 years of achievements since then, the star claims he is not done yet.\n\nSpeaking in 2022 about his early days of success and plans for the future, he told The Guardian: \"I felt very driven in the early days, in competition with the world and with myself...But do I unashamedly want to still be one of the biggest artists in the world? Yeah, I do.\"\n\nHe added: \"I\u2019ve had an interesting first half of my life. I\u2019d like an interesting second half, too.\"\n\nBetter Man is released in cinemas on Boxing Day."

            "article_content": "The CEO of DeepMind has forecasted a fantastic shift in science: the rise of \u201cdigital biology.\u201d This emerging discipline, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), is poised to redefine how we approach biology, drug discovery, and other scientific fields. By using AI\u2019s unparalleled ability to process and analyze complex datasets, researchers are now equipped to address some of the most intricate challenges in science. From breakthroughs in protein folding to advancements in quantum computing, the implications of this shift are expected to accelerate innovation at a pace previously unimaginable. The integration of AI into these domains signals a new era of discovery and progress.\n\nBut what exactly is digital biology, and how can AI transform fields as complex as biology and drug development? Think of it as a innovative way of viewing life itself\u2014as an information system that can be analyzed, predicted, and even simulated. With tools like AlphaFold already making waves by solving the decades-old puzzle of protein folding, the possibilities seem endless.\n\nWhat Is Digital Biology?\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Digital biology, powered by AI, is transforming biology and drug discovery by decoding complex biological systems, exemplified by breakthroughs like DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold in protein folding.\n\nAI accelerates scientific discovery by reducing research timelines, simulating biological systems, and solving long-standing challenges in areas like cellular mechanisms and drug development.\n\nAI is most effective in problems with massive search spaces, clear objectives, and large datasets, with synthetic data generation expanding its applicability in data-scarce scenarios.\n\nClassical and quantum computing serve as complementary tools, with quantum systems addressing extreme computational demands while classical computing remains vital for many efficient algorithms.\n\nAI\u2019s integration into science is driving fantastic advancements across disciplines, including materials science, physics, and engineering, promising new discoveries in the coming decades.\n\nDigital biology envisions biological systems as information-processing frameworks, where AI serves as a powerful \u201cdescription language\u201d to decode life\u2019s complexities. A prime example of this is DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold, an AI system that has significantly advanced protein folding research. For decades, scientists grappled with the challenge of predicting protein structures, a critical task for understanding biological processes and developing treatments. AlphaFold solved this long-standing problem with unprecedented accuracy, offering insights that are already transforming drug discovery and disease research.\n\nThis achievement underscores how AI can enhance our understanding of life at the molecular level. By treating biological systems as data-rich environments, digital biology enables researchers to uncover patterns and mechanisms that were previously hidden. The success of AlphaFold demonstrates the potential of AI to bridge knowledge gaps and accelerate progress in fields that rely on molecular and cellular insights.\n\nAI\u2019s Expanding Role in Scientific Discovery\n\nAI\u2019s applications in science extend far beyond protein folding, offering fantastic benefits across multiple disciplines. In drug development, for instance, AI can drastically reduce the time required to identify promising drug candidates. What once took years can now be accomplished in months or even weeks. By simulating biological systems, AI allows researchers to predict experimental outcomes with remarkable precision, minimizing the need for costly and time-consuming laboratory trials.\n\nBeyond drug discovery, AI is addressing complex challenges in biology, such as modeling cellular mechanisms, simulating entire organisms, and analyzing genetic interactions. These capabilities are reshaping how science is conducted, allowing researchers to explore questions that were previously considered too complex or resource-intensive. AI\u2019s ability to process vast amounts of data and identify meaningful patterns is unlocking new opportunities for innovation in areas such as genomics, neuroscience, and environmental science.\n\nGoogle Deepmind CEO\u2019s Prediction \u2013 Digital Biology\n\nUncover more insights about Artificial Intelligence (AI) in previous articles we have written.\n\nWhen Is AI the Right Tool?\n\nAI is not a universal solution for all scientific problems, but it excels in specific scenarios where its strengths can be fully used. The most promising applications of AI in science share three defining characteristics:\n\nMassive combinatorial search spaces that require evaluating countless possibilities\n\nClearly defined objective functions that guide the AI toward optimal solutions\n\nAccess to large datasets, which provide the foundation for training and refining AI models\n\nIn cases where real-world data is limited, researchers can generate synthetic datasets to train AI systems. This approach enables scientists to simulate scenarios that would otherwise remain inaccessible, further expanding the scope of AI\u2019s utility. By combining real and synthetic data, researchers can tackle problems that demand high levels of precision and adaptability.\n\nClassical vs. Quantum Computing: Complementary Tools\n\nWhile classical computing has been instrumental in advancing scientific research, it faces limitations when dealing with extreme computational demands. Quantum computing offers a complementary solution, using its unique ability to process information in fundamentally different ways. For example, Google\u2019s advancements in quantum systems, such as reducing error rates, highlight the potential of this technology to solve problems that are beyond the reach of classical methods.\n\nHowever, classical computing remains indispensable for many applications, particularly those where existing algorithms efficiently model natural phenomena. Together, classical and quantum computing form a synergistic partnership, providing researchers with a diverse set of tools to address a wide range of scientific challenges. By integrating these technologies, scientists can push the boundaries of what is computationally possible, opening new avenues for discovery.\n\nBroader Implications for Science\n\nThe integration of AI into scientific research is set to redefine numerous disciplines, extending far beyond biology. In materials science, AI can accelerate the discovery of new materials with desirable properties, such as superconductors or lightweight alloys. In physics, AI-driven models are helping researchers unravel the mysteries of the universe, from dark matter to the behavior of subatomic particles. In engineering, AI is optimizing designs for greater efficiency, sustainability, and performance.\n\nAI\u2019s influence also extends to fields like complexity theory and information theory, where it is allowing researchers to analyze and model intricate systems with unprecedented accuracy. The rapid pace of AI innovation suggests that the coming decades will bring breakthroughs across a wide range of scientific domains. By automating routine tasks and enhancing analytical capabilities, AI is empowering scientists to focus on creative problem-solving and hypothesis generation.\n\nLooking Ahead: A New Frontier\n\nThe prediction of a digital biology revolution underscores the fantastic potential of AI in reshaping science and technology. From solving protein folding with AlphaFold to accelerating drug discovery and exploring the possibilities of quantum computing, AI is unlocking new frontiers of innovation. As researchers continue to harness AI\u2019s capabilities, the boundaries of what is scientifically achievable will expand, paving the way for discoveries that were once considered unattainable.\n\nThis era of digital biology and AI-driven science represents a paradigm shift in how humanity understands and interacts with the natural world. By integrating AI into the fabric of scientific inquiry, researchers are not only solving existing problems but also uncovering entirely new questions to explore. The future of science lies at the intersection of human ingenuity and machine intelligence, promising a wealth of opportunities for discovery and progress.\n\nMedia Credit: Matthew Berman\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

Could AI work this out, though?\n\nThe long and short answers are both yes. They broke down the two parts of the equation to explain how they reached their respective answers; the same answers.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get more black and white than this \u2013 one all.\n\nGrok 1 - ChatGPT 1\n\n\u201cHow much power should my car have?\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nThis is a much trickier question because there\u2019s no right or wrong. I was hoping that the chatbots would help me make an informed decision.\n\nThey both broke down different car power outputs by usage and included influencing factors like fuel economy.\n\nGrok\u2019s answer had it for me, because the X-run chatbot also raised other considerations that affect performance, like aerodynamics and transmission type. A 300hp coupe isn\u2019t the same as a 300hp SUV, and Grok knew this.\n\nIt was also able to cite sources, which included X posts. When opinion comes into play, Grok\u2019s access to an endless resource of opinion is valuable.\n\nGrok 1 - ChatGPT 0\n\n\u201cWrite an itinerary for a weekend in Athens\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nI had to give one of my favourite European cities to two of the best and highest-profile chatbots out there, and they both came back to me with a detailed itinerary broken down into time blocks.\n\nThey both considered meals, but neither mentioned accommodation, which is an unfortunate oversight.\n\nChatGPT added some history and context about why I might want to visit certain sites, but Grok took it a step further and closed in on a more personalised experience by advising me when to avoid certain areas and when the best events are held.\n\nGrok 1 - ChatGPT 0\n\n\u201cWrite a short meditation script\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nTwenty-first-century life can be chaotic, and many workers are now maxing out their productivity with help from artificial intelligence, but could AI also help us wind down?\n\nBoth produced a short script, around two minutes in length, but Grok\u2019s felt a little more mindful and present.\n\nMeditation and mindfulness can be subjective, but we felt Grok\u2019s script had the broadest appeal.\n\nGrok 1 - ChatGPT 0\n\nBONUS: \u201cGenerate an image of a horse riding a bike\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nImage generation is where AI really stands out \u2013 putting words in order is easy, but creating a totally unique image requires a lot more context and processing. Especially when it\u2019s as unlikely as a horse riding a bike.\n\nGrok set out by generating four separate options simultaneously in 23.51 seconds. Having multiple options is great, but the reality is that none of them were useable.\n\nChatGPT was quicker, at 13.73 seconds, but it only produced one option in a less life-like, more cartoon-like format. At least this one was accurate and usable.\n\nGrok 0 - ChatGPT 1\n\nChatGPT vs. Grok: Which is best?\n\nGrok 4 - ChatGPT 3\n\nEvery AI chatbot has its use cases, but for the best all-rounder, Grok performed well across four of the six tests it was subjected to, slightly ahead of ChatGPT.\n\nIt uses its own LLM plus access to the entire database of X posts, which really helps to add real-world context."

But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

            "article_content": "Web scraping and data engineering can turn that wish into a reality. With these two, you can automate the process of gathering data from different websites and sources, processing, and organizing that data into useful actionable insights for your business. This facilitates faster and better decision-making, giving your business a competitive edge \u2013 all without the hassle of having to visit websites to manually collect, process, and organize data every now and then.\n\nEmploying web scraping services and solutions from a trusted web scraping company can help you save time, cut down manual labor, and obtain accurate, up-to-date data to allow your company to make better business decisions that would keep you ahead of the competition.\n\nWhat is web scraping?\n\nWeb scraping uses software tools to automate the process of extracting data from different websites and sources, including emerging market trends, customer reviews, stock prices, contact information, sentiment analysis, and competitor pricing. After it is extracted, the data is then converted from unstructured HTML content to structured information, making it easier to store, analyze, and use for market research, price intelligence, lead generation, or any other intended purpose. This structured format can be in the form of CSV, PDF, DOC files, or Excel spreadsheets.\n\nEssentially, web scraping provides businesses with an efficient way of collecting vast data from the web, making it a key tool for corporations in the current digital era.\n\nFor example, partnering with a data scraping company can provide access to advanced tools and expertise for extracting structured data efficiently and ethically.\n\nSo how does web scraping work?\n\nThere are a number of techniques that can be used to scrape data from the web; for instance:\n\nAPI scraping \u2013 this method uses an API (Application Programming Interface) provided in a specific website to access and extract data. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon, among others, include APIs that can be used to scrape and access data more easily and in a structured format.\n\nDOM parsing \u2013 in this method, the required data is retrieved from nodes on the webpage using DOM (Document Object Model), which transforms HTML code into a tree-like structure to make it easy to scrape the information.\n\nHTML parsing \u2013 in this web scraping approach, the HTML code is broken down into basic elements like classes, attributes, tags, and text content, making it easier to locate and scrape the relevant data.\n\nRegardless of the web scraping technique, each of these methods allows you to extract information from a website, process it, and create a data file (like a PDF or Excel spreadsheet) containing the scraped data. In general, the process includes requests being sent to a specific site\u2019s server using a bot, script, or program. After the HTML code is retrieved, the program then parses it to find specific data elements using \u201clocators\u201d like XPath, class names, or tags. Finally, the identified elements are used to get the necessary information, which is stored in a structured format like a PDF or CSV file.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say that your company wants to know the pricing of your competitors\u2019 products or services. Instead of going through the hassle of visiting their websites or social media pages to check individual products or services, you can employ the services of a web scraping company to automate the process. This includes special programs being used to analyze various web content and extract the specific data needed to eliminate the need for manually entering data. This way, the relevant data is automatically extracted across different sources, including social media platforms, blogs, e-commerce websites, and review aggregator sites, among others, and then organized in a structured format like PDF to make it easier to read, compare, and analyze.\n\nBenefits of web scraping and data engineering\n\nThe explosion of information on social media, e-commerce websites, and other websites in the past two decades has led to vast volumes of data. And with more and more organizations adopting data-driven approaches, web scraping has become a key tool for businesses to gain valuable insights. In fact, a recent Statista report shows that over 149 zettabytes of data have been generated, extracted, copied, and consumed in 2024 and projects that this figure will increase to over 394 zettabytes in the next 5 years. And with such exponential growth, data engineering and web scraping techniques are preferable over manual collection for a number of reasons, for example:\n\nCustomer analysis \u2013 web scraping allows you to study and understand customer behavior and sentiment based on reviews from different platforms, including social media and review aggregator sites like Yelp, Google My Business, and Capterra, among others.\n\nLead generation \u2013 employing web scraping services allows you to easily collect contact information from different platforms and create a list of potential clients that can also be used to create marketing campaigns.\n\nData aggregation \u2013 by automatically visiting and extracting relevant content from different sources and platforms, web scraping techniques make it easy to create a comprehensive database that can be used to provide key insights by a business to give them a competitive edge.\n\nPrice intelligence \u2013 using web scraping tools and programs, you can track real-time changes in products and services\u2019 pricing from different competitors\u2019 websites or social media platforms.\n\nMarket research \u2013 the data collected using web scraping and organized using data engineering techniques can be used to inform your company of the best business strategies to take based on the current market trends and competitor products and pricing.\n\nTo outsource or not to outsource web scraping services\n\nYou might think that web scraping is a simple process. After all, it only includes the few steps of identifying the target site, collecting the target pages\u2019 URL, making requests to the server to extract the relevant content, and saving the information in PDF or CSV files. However, you would be largely mistaken. While the process might be clear-cut for small web scraping tasks, it gets rather complex if you need to scrape data on a large scale or in other sophisticated situations. Take, for instance, if you wanted to scrape data from a site whose layout keeps changing or where you have to manage proxies, execute JavaScript, or work around antibots. Such situations would require complex scraping solutions, e.g., the constantly-changing website layout might require the implementation of a dynamic scraper that uses patterns like XPath to adapt to the changes. To bypass the antibot processes, it might mean using APIs to ensure that you are fetching data from the website ethically and legally. All these processes can be very complex, requiring technical expertise to develop advanced programs, implement them properly, and constantly monitor to ensure that everything runs smoothly and accurately.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why it is recommendable to outsource web scraping solutions from a trusted web scraping company. Outsourcing with GroupBWT gives you a smooth operation, providing you with efficient, worry-free web scraping, content extraction, and data organization experience.\n\nWhy you need a web scraping and data engineering company\n\nGroupBWT uses advanced tools and processes that ensure efficient extraction, cleaning, and organization of data to save you time and resources while providing quality, actionable insights to facilitate decision-making processes in your business.

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "Summary\n\nHere are ways one manufacturing leader navigated its digital transformation using a work management platform to enhance productivity, safety and innovation.\n\nBetter Insights Lead to Better Manufacturing Management\n\nIntroducing new technology, especially for a 100+ year old manufacturer, can be intimidating. Oftentimes, it means changing core processes and workflows core to daily operations while balancing the demands of the business. This is why many manufacturers often find themselves in an \u201cin-between\u201d state when it comes to technology adoption and usage on the shop floor, in the back office and in the head office.\n\n\n\nWhile not deliberate, it can make for an unwieldy mix of paper-based processed and other outdated record collection methods alongside newer digital tools that creates siloes of data and information. Those siloes mean there are multiple sources of information throughout the company, disconnected from other systems and making it difficult to gain a big picture view. Lacking that, it is impossible to gain key insights for decision-making to get ahead of production delays, machine maintenance, personnel and safety, impacting operations and revenue.\n\n\n\nPicture the impact of an unplanned machine shut down when all the key stakeholders\u2013the shop floor, customer service, accounting, suppliers and more are working from inconsistent information. Scrambling to realign production and deliveries and keep customers satisfied without incurring unnecessary charges is challenging on a good day. The long-term ripple effects can carry into the next several days, weeks or even longer.\n\n\n\nWhen information sources are not integrated throughout the manufacturer\u2019s business, it leads to delays and creates productivity gaps. These productivity gaps may require employees to work double time to catch up on reconciling data, using workarounds and chasing information across systems, projects and teams. The lost time is known as \u201cGray Work,\u201d and can take up to 11 hours or more each week of a manufacturing employee\u2019s time, according to a recent survey.\n\n\n\nAnother common Gray Work issue is the introduction of a new process or method on the shop floor. It is often demonstrated on a whiteboard, which is not much better than paper-based processes. If the new method is not digitally captured, that knowledge can\u2019t be widely and accurately shared.\n\n\n\nThese are a few reasons why manufacturers are moving to work management platforms. They allow information captured digitally to be stored, accessed and shared from a central location among teams. The upsides are better planning, fewer surprises, easier succession planning and the elimination of Gray Work.\n\n\n\nHere are ways that manufacturing leader NSK\u2013a 100-year-old manufacturer\u2013navigated its digital transformation using a work management platform from Quickbase to enhance productivity, safety and innovation.\n\n\n\nNavigating digital transformation at NSK\n\nNSK is a global company that makes bearings, automotive components and precision machinery products. In 2006/2007, NSK began its own digital transformation journey, starting with a mandate that all new equipment be data-driven and capable of data capture. Like many manufacturers, NSK faced the challenge of integrating legacy systems with modern technology.\n\n\n\nTaking a pragmatic approach, NSK assessed existing equipment based on performance and failure tolerance. Older machines still operating within acceptable limits are maintained with basic monitoring processes. For workflows, NSK sought to balance current performance metrics against opportunities where modern analytics can drive improvements, focusing on the most challenging processes where database-driven approaches can enhance efficiency.\n\n\n\nThis shift was accompanied by adopting CAD and 3D modeling practices to create digital twins for accurate measurements and specifications. The focus now is on predictive maintenance, identifying potential machine failures before they occur.\n\n\n\nData, not \u2018gut feelings\u2019 drive decisions\n\nThroughout the automotive industry, digital transformation has enabled a shift from \u201cgut feel\u201d decision making to reliance on connected data. Replacing verbal shift handoffs and disconnected spreadsheets, an integrated data-driven approach enables smarter decisions.\n\n\n\nFor example, by capturing data from shop floor processes and machines and integrating it with additional critical information from across the company on a work management platform, NSK makes strategic decisions faster. These include determining the best course of action regarding machine usage, maintenance and replacement.\n\n\n\nUsing technology to reinforce safety\n\nNSK\u2019s digital transformation also enhanced its safety measures, transforming their \"Take A Minute for Safety\" program using digital kiosks to log employee observations of shop floor conditions, hazards and employee behaviors. The kiosks replace paper forms with a digital version, building an app using low/no code tools available on its work management platform. This transition allows for quick action on safety observations, tracking issues through completion with dashboard-driven reports that monitor maintenance, repairs, training and other key information. And, since the data is connected, it is easy to share best practices and document site conditions.\n\n\n\nSetting a foundation for AI\n\nNow able to collect and connect data to identify efficiency opportunities, NSK has built a foundation for supporting the strategic use of AI. The manufacturer envisions AI playing a significant role in automating data collection and analysis, further enhancing productivity measurement processes. This approach ensures that time and resources are not wasted on digesting vast amounts of data but are instead used to effectively calculate critical KPIs.\n\n\n\nNSK\u2019s digital transformation has been rooted in continuous improvement. By connecting real-time data on a work management platform while supporting critical legacy systems, the company can more easily identify and seize new opportunities, get ahead of potential issues and drive productivity without creating staff burnout.\n\nAbout The Author Jeremy Myer is manufacturing strategy manager at NSK. NSK is one of the world's largest manufacturers that is focused on automation."

            "article_content": "Canton Repository entertainment writer lists what he's most looking forward to in 2025.\n\nEd Balint's top 10 list includes local food discoveries, Finney's Arcade in downtown Canton and Mural Fest 2.\n\nBig concerts in 2025 will include Pearl Jam selling out two shows in Pittsburgh, and another headliner at the Concert for Legends in Canton.\n\nA new year always holds the promise of good times and stress relief \u2014 music, concerts, amusement parks, the outdoors, local art, tasty eats and more.\n\n2024 was chock-full of personal highlights, from a trip abroad with my 18-year-old daughter as she embarked on her post high school life to meeting one of my rock 'n' roll heroes backstage \u2014 Gary Cherone, who briefly fronted the mighty Van Halen, one of my all-time favorite bands.\n\nNext year has the potential to please, too, from snagging tickets to a sold-out concert to anticipating the insanity of a new thrill ride to carving up the slopes. Here are the top 10 things I'm looking forward to in 2025, although whittling down the list wasn't easy.\n\n1. Finney's Arcade in downtown Canton\n\nFinney's Arcade & Parlor checks my box for nostalgia.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nRyan Miller, owner of the successful Deli Ohio in downtown Canton, said Finney's Arcade, 417 Market Ave. N, will be retro in character and vibe, as well as in the rotating video game and pinball inventory.\n\nOld souls will appreciate Skee-Ball and Pop-A-Shot! Newer video and pinball games are also planned such as Avatar and John Wick.\n\nBesides the games, Finney's Arcade is partnering with UnHitched Brewing Co. and its downtown spot The Woodshop to create a custom brew \u2014 Finney's Brew Skee Ball Cream Ale, described as light, crisp and refreshing.\n\nThe arcade is scheduled to open in the first quarter of next year. And I'm rooting for Miller and his business partner, Micah Dorward, to pull off another entrepreneurial triumph and inject a cool new entertainment option downtown.\n\n2. Hail, Hail Pearl Jam\n\nThat's a reference to a song from Pearl Jam's 1996 album, \"No Code.\"\n\nBack when Pearl Jam were bona fide rock stars and pioneers of the grunge rock scene and Seattle sound. Fast forward to 2024, and Pearl Jam is remarkably and impressively still intact and musically potent.\n\nOther grunge bands sadly have lost their frontmen. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain. Soundgarden and Chris Cornell. Alice In Chains and Layne Staley. Stone Temple Pilots and Scott Weiland.\n\nVocalist Eddie Vedder and bandmates have transitioned into elder statesmen of the modern rock scene. Pearl Jam is also a highly successful touring act, selling out shows and curating a new setlist for each concert while playing for around three hours.\n\nPearl Jam is hitting the road next year, but announced only 10 concerts. That's why I'm stoked to have snagged tickets to the first of two Pittsburgh dates in May. Seats are in the upper deck, but just being there is the point.\n\n3. Pizza Palooza in North Canton\n\nA food fest arrives early with North Canton's new Pizza Palooza on Feb. 2.\n\nPizza Palooza will be in the cafeteria of Hoover High, 525 Seventh St. NE.\n\nMy only disappointment is the timing. Pizza Palooza screams summertime and outdoors. Casting that quibble aside, count me in. Pizza is my No. 1 favorite food. All types, all shops, all countries.\n\nPizza masters will include Luigi's in Akron, who I consider to be the Cadillac of za. Nothing compares to its robust, distinctive flavor. The dough, the sauce, the cheese baked a beautiful golden brown. It's pizza perfection.\n\nGrab a slicePizza paradise coming to North Canton with new Pizza Palooza event\n\nCanton shops also will be showcasing their pizza prowess. Lots of standouts, including the OGs of the local scene \u2212 Pizza Oven and Italo's. Also excellent are Park City Pizza and SOL Pie Pizza. Zepp's also has a loyal legion of fans.\n\nToo many to choose from? Don't fret. A passport ticket allows you to indulge in multiple pizzerias.\n\nTickets can be purchased at https://ticketscandy.com/e/2025-pizza-palooza-7254.\n\n4. Siren's Curse at Cedar Point\n\nCedar Point has been a summertime tradition with my daughter since she was a toddler.\n\nWe're ride warriors no matter the month. Busy times, slow times, sweltering August days ... and even a few years ago on Nov. 1 when snowflakes were falling.\n\nEach summer, Paige advanced to more thrilling rides. Until the insanity stage hit in her teenage years. All the biggies \u2014 Magnum XL\u2212200, Millennium Force, Steel Vengeance, Maverick, Valravn and Top Thrill 2, which is scheduled to reopen in 2025. But Cedar Point is once again trying to top itself with the introduction of Siren's Curse in 2025.\n\nThe newest scream machine will be the tallest, fastest and longest tilt coaster in North America, the amusement park boasts.\n\nHighlights include a 160-foot tower, 90-degree vertical position, and plunging and zooming on nearly 3,000 feet of track before reaching a top speed of 58 mph. And there's more \u2014 13 weightless airtime moments and two 360-degree, zero-gravity barrel rolls.\n\nYowza! My daughter undoubtedly will be game. I'll take some convincing.\n\n5. Snowboarding in the ... spring\n\nLearning how to snowboard was knocked off my bucket list years ago. And it's become a passion and way to spend quality time with my daughter for more than a decade.\n\nWe frequently take to the slopes of the Cuyahoga Valley. For more challenging terrain, we day trip to Seven Springs in Pennsylvania. And we recently took advantage of an early-season discount in rates at The Inn at Holiday Valley in Western New York.\n\nBut what I love perhaps even more than carving the hills in December, January and February is doing so in March. Spring skiing and snowboarding can be sloppy due to warming temperatures. Regardless, it's still glorious to slay the slopes in early spring under a sunlit blue sky while wearing a fleece sans a bulky jacket.\n\n6. Mural Fest 2\n\nCanton Mural Fest was a vibrant new addition to Stark County's roster of summer events last year.\n\nAround a dozen artists created eye-catching and inspired murals in the Cherry and Walnut Avenue NE area. Special ones include a sprawling, multi-colored peregrine falcon at the Strauss Studios building, and a racoon in Boy Scout attire near Deli Ohio.\n\nAnother is a gorgeous tribute to The O'Jays, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame singing group hailing from Canton. Imparting a throwback and classic vibe, it's a beauty, created by Northeast Ohio artist Derrin Fletcher and stretching 40 feet.\n\nFellow art lovers can look forward to the second Canton Mural Fest in 2025. Maureen Ater, CEO of ArtsinStark, said the goal is to have the follow-up event in September.\n\n\"We don't expect that in our second year we will unveil 14 murals like we did this year,\" she said. \"But continuing to grow the number of murals from this original 14 was always part of our goal.\"\n\n7. More food discoveries like Liebermann's Bakery\n\nI'm embarrassed to admit it took me this long to discover the legend of Liebermann's Bakery\n\nNot only are the baked goods scrumptious, but the friendliness of the staff was exemplary on a recent visit to Liebermann's, 49 First St. SE, in downtown Massillon.\n\nLiebermann's raspberry-filled doughnuts are sublime. A ginormous pastry combined elements of a cinnamon roll and glazed doughnut, topped with a generous amount of peanut butter icing. Wow! Flaky and light and originally delicious, I loved it. There's nothing else quite like it.\n\nLiebermann's awakened the need to be a culinary adventurer. And I look forward to more local food finds in 2025.\n\n8. Canton area music festivals and concerts\n\nEach summer, I anticipate Stark County's big music events that draw nationally touring performers.\n\nI'm eager to learn who will be headlining the Concert for Legends during the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Festival. The Hall of Fame Village hasn't disappointed the last three years, booking Journey, Zac Brown Band and Carrie Underwood.\n\nCountry star:6 fun and cool things about the Carrie Underwood show at the Pro Football HOF Fest\n\nAlive Music Festival, The Country Fest and Neon Nights are also highly recommended for even casual fans of their respective genres. The relaxed, welcoming and festive atmosphere at each event is as good as the music.\n\nNeon Nights is an increasingly stellar sister event to The Country Fest, mixing country and classic rock. Foreigner, Brooks & Dunn, Night Ranger and Bret Michaels should make for a rousing, raise your drink in the air affair in August.\n\n9. More Civic Center concerts\n\nAnother big concert is coming to the Canton Memorial Civic Center.\n\nCeCe Winans, a Grammy-winning gospel singing legend, will open her tour at the 73-year-old downtown arena on Feb. 12.\n\nDowntown arena:'Possibilities are endless.' City, business leaders discuss future of Canton Civic Center\n\nWhile working on an extensive series of articles about the future of the Civic Center, I gained a new appreciation for its rich history and continued relevance as a concert venue.\n\nBoth the Brantley Gilbert and Chris Tomlin shows were outstanding in 2024, far exceeding my expectations for a concert at the 5,200-seat arena. Acoustics, atmosphere and the view were tremendous.\n\nI'm eager to see what else the Civic Center books in 2025.\n\n10. Tent camping\n\nTent camping is another family favorite.\n\nBeach vacations are fun. European adventures are amazing. But camping in the wilderness at a state or national park is in a class of its own.\n\nThere's a lot of work and preparation \u2014 loading a cargo box on the roof of an SUV; going through a detailed checklist of camping and cooking supplies and other essentials; and then unpacking it all and setting up camp while hoping it doesn't rain.\n\nBut it's well worth the effort and inconveniences. Rewards include falling asleep to the sound of wind blowing through towering pines; gazing up at the glitter of a star-filled night sky; and campfire breakfasts with crispy bacon, fried potatoes and scrambled eggs that can't be replicated at restaurants.\n\nFinding new camping spots is part of the fun. This past summer, we experienced Letchworth State Park in Western New York. And what a prize it is, adorned with waterfalls, ravines, creeks and woodlands.\n\nAnother camping gem awaits discovery in 2025. High on my list are Blackwater Falls State Park in West Virginia and Indiana Dunes National Park in Indiana.\n\nReach Ed at ebalint@gannett.com.

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "ChatGPT is credited for making generative AI popular, but in the two years that it\u2019s been publicly available, it\u2019s faced growing competition from all manner of AI tools.\n\nIt remains first and foremost a chatbot, with text and image generation capabilities, but new features have been added along the way such as support for internet searches, image generation and more.\n\nA new era of AI is emerging, though. Personalized AI and AI assistants might seem like the ultimate goal when it comes to this time-saving tech, but can Martin\u2019s AI keep up with OpenAI\u2019s more established product?\n\nThe tests\n\nChatGPT is primarily a text and image generation tool, so it\u2019s this part of Martin that we wanted to put to the test, even though it\u2019s capable of integrating more deeply into everyday routines.\n\nStill, because Martin is sold as an AI personal assistant, we wanted to check whether its integrated chatbot offered a more personalized experience.\n\nThe questions included a factual explanation, a mathematical equation, a broader request for advice, an open-ended request, an expression of creativity and freedom to express creativity.\n\n\u201cExplain the process of sunburn\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nWe wanted to understand the biological process and implications of sunburn, and both chatbots offered a full overview of how the damage occurs in a logical, step-by-step breakdown.\n\nThey also offered further context regarding long-term effects and advice to prevent sunburn in the first place.\n\nOn the whole, we were pleased with the well-rounded responses from both sources.\n\nMartin 1 - ChatGPT 1\n\n\u201cWhat is (99/9)(5+5)\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nTwo really simple equations bundled into a single, third equation should produce a really straightforward answer, but getting there can be a riddle for anybody who wasn\u2019t paying attention in school.\n\nThe two systems broke down the steps involved to reach the correct answer \u2013 110.\n\nHowever, while ChatGPT was able to lay everything out clearly and in a range of formats, Martin struggled, making understanding how 110 was reached slightly less digestible.\n\nMartin 0 - ChatGPT 1\n\n\u201cHow many calories should an adult male eat?\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nThere\u2019s no definite answer here, because everybody\u2019s answer should be slightly different. Martin and ChatGPT both shared advice per lifestyle, for example sedentary and active days.\n\nMartin also included advice for different age groups, which ChatGPT omitted, however there\u2019s little evidence or data to suggest that these offer the correct advice.\n\nThe hope was that they would give us broad advice, which they did, and then go on to explain how to calculate the correct number of calories more accurately. Martin failed to do this, but ChatGPT cited the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation.\n\nMartin 0 - ChatGPT 1\n\n\u201cWrite an itinerary for a weekend in Reykjavik\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nTwo or three days should be enough to see everything Reykjavic has to offer for anybody who\u2019s short on time, but can AI pinpoint what we should see and when to make the best use of our time?\n\nBoth systems counted Friday night as part of the weekend, but Martin assumed we had the whole day. They also highlighted some good places to eat, and more or less nailed the brief.\n\nMartin and ChatGPT responded well to the prompt, but OpenAI\u2019s chatbot went further and included advice on the weather, transportation and currency.\n\nMartin 0 - ChatGPT 1\n\n\u201cWrite a story suitable for a three-year-old\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Craig Hale)\n\nIf your toddler is struggling to get to sleep and you\u2019re out of books, you\u2019ll need a story whipped up in seconds \u2013 Martin and ChatGPT delivered on this front.\n\nThey both generated an easily digestible and fairly captivating tale split into short paragraphs of no more than a sentence or two in length.\n\nBoth centered around some sort of a mission and a positive outcome, however we found the vocabulary used in Martin\u2019s story to be marginally more challenging. This can either be a positive or a negative, depending on your parenting and educational preferences, but on the whole, ChatGPT\u2019s story was easier to follow.\n\nRealistically, you could imagine both being printed in a children\u2019s book or being turned into a short animation.\n\nMartin 1 - ChatGPT 1\n\nChatGPT vs. Martin: Which is best?\n\nMartin 2 - ChatGPT 5\n\nPutting Martin\u2019s chatbot head-to-head against ChatGPT resulted in a clear verdict \u2013 ChatGPT performed well across all five tasks, while we felt Martin was lacking across three of them\n\nHowever, that\u2019s just the start of Martin\u2019s abilities, and if you\u2019re after a more contextual assistant then Martin can integrate with to-do lists, calendars, reminders and your email inbox to learn more about your preferences and habits.\n\nMartin also integrates across messaging, calling and email platforms, including Slack, so it can be easy to share information with the AI assistant across more settings. OpenAI recently added voice calls for ChatGPT in the US and Canada, or VoIP calls via WhatsApp, but this is currently limited."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nTime and again, Data Science has made its mark on human society. It is repeatedly making headlines in newspapers and magazines. It mainly involves getting insights from huge datasets and making decisions based on the analysed data.\n\nData Science is significant as it helps companies to optimise their process. Companies can also predict trends and find answers to difficult questions with the help of it. Machine Learning plays an important part in this whole process.\n\nMachine Learning transforms Data Science processes by automating repetitive and boring tasks. It also helps in identifying patterns in data and improving the accuracy of prediction. The aim of this article is to explore how Machine Learning enhances each stage of the Data Science process.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Machine Learning, then you need to enrol in free Data Science courses and learn Data Science free. Hence, you can focus on your learning without worrying about financial limitations.\n\nCore Components of Data Science Processes\n\nNow, we\u2019ll look at the core components of Data Science processes. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, Data Science focuses on getting insights from raw data. It follows a systematic approach in this process. There are several steps involved, and each step plays an important role. Let\u2019s explore these steps in detail.\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nData collection and preprocessing is the first step in the Data Science process. Data collection involves getting relevant and appropriate data. The data can come from various sources like databases, APIs and manual inputs. It is important to collect data appropriately as it lays down the foundation for correct analysis.\n\nWhen raw data is collected, it has inconsistencies like missing values, duplicates, or outliers. Here comes the role of data preprocessing. It involves cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.\n\nSeveral techniques like imputation, normalisation, and feature engineering are also used in this step. These techniques make the data ready for later stages of the Data Science process. It is important to invest time in preprocessing as it reduces errors and improves the accuracy of the model.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the second step in the Data Science process. It helps in discovering patterns in the data. It also helps in uncovering the trends and relationships within the data. In this step, statistical methods and visualisation tools are used. These help in better understanding the characteristics of data.\n\nEDA gives you the roadmap for modelling by plotting distributions and identifying correlations. It\u2019ll also help you with detecting anomalies in the data. With the help of EDA analysts can make crucial decisions like selecting appropriate features. It also helps in handling uneven data.\n\nMany tools are used in this process like Pandas and Matplotlib library of Python. Other than this, Tableau and PowerBI are also used to make this process effective.\n\nModelling, Evaluation, and Deployment\n\nModelling, evaluation and deployment is the third step in the Data Science process. Let\u2019s look at them briefly one by one.\n\nModelling is like the heart of Data Science. It uses Machine Learning algorithms to transform data into actionable insights. In this step, Data Scientists will select and train models. These models will then be tuned to achieve optimal performance.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the next step i.e. the evaluation process. It ensures that the model is performing well on both trained and untrained data. You might not know this, but various metrics are also used in this step.\n\nFor example, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score are used to measure the effectiveness of a model.\n\nFinally comes the deployment process. In this process, the model is integrated into real-world systems. It enables automated predictions and decision-making. It ensures that the project gives value and enables ongoing improvements.\n\nHow Machine Learning Optimises Each Step\n\nNow, in this section, I\u2019m going to tell you how Machine Learning is revolutionising each step of the Data Science process. I\u2019m going to tell you how ML improves efficiency and accuracy at every stage. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nAutomating Data Preprocessing and Cleaning\n\nAlthough data preprocessing is a crucial step in Data Science, it\u2019s also a time-consuming process. Machine Learning algorithms play the magic here by simplifying this process. ML algorithms automate tasks like missing value imputation and outlier detection. Not only this, but data normalisation is also automated by these algorithms.\n\nFor instance, Machine Learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) estimate missing values based on patterns in the data. On the other hand, clustering algorithms identify and handle outliers in the data.\n\nMoreover, advanced tools like AutoML streamline feature scaling and encoding. It makes sure that your data is ready for analysis. Thus, all this automation helps in reducing manual work and improving the quality of input data. Thus, it directly impacts the reliability of downstream models.\n\nEnhancing EDA with ML-Driven Insights\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously mentioned, EDA helps in uncovering trends and correlations in data sets. It also helps you with finding anomalies in the data. The traditional EDA process uses visualisation and basic statistics. But here, Machine Learning takes it one step further.\n\nIf used, unsupervised Machine Learning techniques will be very fruitful. For instance, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) find dominant patterns. On the other hand, clustering algorithms will reveal natural groupings in the data.\n\nDo you know that ML-powered tools can also generate automated insights? These tools will highlight relationships in the data that might not be immediately noticed. Thus, ML enhances the EDA process and allows Data Scientists to focus on strategic problem-solving instead of manual exploration.\n\nImproving Prediction Accuracy and Model Selection\n\nYou might be surprised to know how Machine Learning improves prediction accuracy.

            "article_content": "Managing expenses effectively is crucial to maintaining financial integrity. However, the rise in fraudulent expense claims poses a significant challenge for organizations worldwide. Fraudulent activities not only drain resources but also damage trust within the workplace. Detecting such fraud manually can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. This is where machine learning comes into play, offering innovative ways to combat expense fraud efficiently and proactively.\n\nWhat Is Expense Fraud?\n\nExpense fraud refers to the act of submitting false or exaggerated claims for reimbursement. Employees may manipulate receipts, inflate mileage claims, or create fake invoices to gain undeserved compensation. Common examples of expense fraud include:\n\nSubmitting personal expenses as business-related costs.\n\nAltering the amounts on genuine receipts.\n\nCreating entirely fictitious receipts or invoices.\n\nReimbursing duplicate claims for the same expense.\n\nThese fraudulent activities can cost businesses thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually. While traditional audits can uncover some discrepancies, they often miss more sophisticated schemes. This highlights the need for advanced technologies like machine learning to tackle fraud more effectively.\n\nThe Role of Machine Learning in Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning (ML) leverages algorithms that analyze data, learn patterns, and make predictions. Unlike rule-based systems, ML models continuously improve over time as they process new data. In the context of expense fraud detection, machine learning offers the following advantages:\n\nAutomated Data Analysis: ML systems can process vast amounts of expense data in real time, identifying anomalies that may signal fraudulent behavior.\n\nPattern Recognition: By analyzing historical data, machine learning models can detect unusual patterns that deviate from normal expense behaviors.\n\nRisk Scoring: ML algorithms assign risk scores to expense claims, flagging those with high likelihoods of fraud for further review.\n\nAdaptive Learning: As fraud tactics evolve, machine learning models adapt by learning new patterns and identifying emerging threats.\n\nKey Machine Learning Techniques for Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning employs various techniques to identify fraudulent expense claims. Below are some of the most commonly used approaches:\n\nSupervised Learning\n\nSupervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the outcomes (fraudulent or non-fraudulent) are already known. The model learns to classify new expense claims based on the patterns it observes in the training data. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks are commonly used in supervised learning for fraud detection.\n\nUnsupervised Learning\n\nUnlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. This approach is ideal for detecting unknown types of fraud. Techniques like clustering and anomaly detection help group similar data points and identify outliers. For instance, if an employee\u2019s expense claim is significantly higher than their peers\u2019, the system flags it for investigation.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nNatural language processing is used to analyze text-based data, such as descriptions in expense claims. NLP can identify inconsistencies, suspicious keywords, or unusual phrasing that may indicate fraudulent intent.\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\nReinforcement learning involves training models through a reward-based system. In fraud detection, the algorithm receives rewards for accurately identifying fraudulent claims and penalties for false positives or negatives. This iterative process improves the model\u2019s accuracy over time.\n\nBuilding an Effective Machine Learning Framework for Fraud Detection\n\nImplementing a machine learning-based expense fraud detection system requires careful planning and execution. Below are the critical steps:\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nThe first step is gathering expense-related data, such as receipts, invoices, and transaction records. Preprocessing this data is crucial to ensure accuracy and consistency. Steps include:\n\nCleaning and removing duplicate entries.\n\nConverting unstructured data into structured formats.\n\nNormalizing numerical data for better model performance.\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering involves selecting and creating relevant variables (features) that help the model identify fraud. Examples include:\n\nFrequency of claims per employee.\n\nAverage claim amount by department.\n\nExpense categories with unusually high costs.\n\nModel Training and Testing\n\nOnce features are defined, the next step is training machine learning models. A portion of the data is used for training, while the rest is reserved for testing. This ensures that the model performs well on unseen data.\n\nDeployment and Monitoring\n\nAfter successful testing, the model is deployed to monitor expense claims in real-time. Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are essential to maintain effectiveness and adapt to new fraud patterns.\n\nChallenges in Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection\n\nWhile machine learning offers powerful tools for expense fraud detection, it is not without challenges. Some common obstacles include:\n\nData Quality Issues: Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to unreliable model predictions.\n\nHigh False Positives: Over-sensitive models may flag legitimate claims as fraudulent, leading to inefficiencies.\n\nEvolving Fraud Tactics: Fraudsters continuously adapt, requiring models to be updated regularly.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Handling sensitive financial data necessitates strict adherence to data protection regulations.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach involving robust data governance, regular model audits, and input from domain experts.\n\nBenefits of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nDespite the challenges, machine learning brings numerous benefits to expense fraud detection:\n\nEfficiency: Automating fraud detection reduces the manual workload, allowing finance teams to focus on high-priority tasks.\n\nAccuracy: ML models often outperform traditional methods, identifying subtle patterns that humans might miss.\n\nScalability: Machine learning systems can handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for organizations of all sizes.\n\nCost Savings: By preventing fraud, businesses can save significant amounts of money that would otherwise be lost.\n\nReal-World Applications of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMany organizations have successfully implemented machine learning to combat expense fraud. For instance:\n\nCorporate Finance Departments: Large corporations use ML tools to monitor employee expense reports, flagging anomalies in real-time.\n\nExpense Management Software: Companies like Expensify and Concur integrate machine learning algorithms to provide fraud detection features for their clients.\n\nFinancial Institutions: Banks and credit card companies employ ML models to detect suspicious transactions that could indicate fraudulent expense claims.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpense fraud is a pressing issue that requires proactive measures to mitigate its impact on businesses. Machine learning offers a transformative solution, enabling organizations to detect and prevent fraud with unprecedented efficiency.Furthermore, By leveraging techniques like supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, companies can build robust fraud detection systems that evolve alongside emerging threats. Although challenges remain, the benefits of machine learning far outweigh the drawbacks, making it an indispensable tool in the fight against expense fraud. Organizations that invest in this technology not only safeguard their finances but also foster a culture of transparency and trust."

            "article_content": "In the ferocious civil war between ethnic rebel groups and the junta (military) in Myanmar, the Arakan Army, the biggest of all the rebel groups, is now in control of large parts of the Rakhine province. The security dynamics along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh have considerably altered in the second week of December as the junta lost control over the area.\n\nThis uncertainty is bound to have a spillover effect along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, raising concerns of a fresh wave of Rohingya refugees attempting to escape the region. Myanmar has been consumed by civil war after the military coup in 2021, which ousted the democratically-run government.\n\nFor the world grappling with wars in Europe and West Asia, Myanmar's strife is forgotten. Except as the looming reality for its neighbours, the world doesn't seem to remember the disastrous events unfolding within Myanmar and the volatile politics consuming it. India is closely watching the developments as there may be implications.\n\nWhy the continuing strife?\n\nDeprived of fair play, various ethnic armed organisations like the Arakan Army have been battling the military since independence for autonomy and control of beneficial resources.\n\nThe Arakan Army is part of the anti-junta group called Three Brotherhood Alliance (the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army are the other two). The same alliance had initiated an assault in October 2023, gaining several considerable wins along Myanmar's border with China.\n\nIn August this year, the alliance gained command of the north-eastern town of Lashio, indicating the first capture of a regional military command in Myanmar's history.\n\nThere are even reports that the Arakan Army now commands areas inside Bangladesh along the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and that may lead to a fight between Bangladesh Army and the Arakan Army and exacerbate the security crisis in the region.\n\nExperts say the Arakan Army operates as the military wing of the ULA (United League of Arakan), the political organisation of the Buddhist people in Myanmar's western Rakhine state.\n\nIn the last 15 months, the Arakan Army has gained ground, capturing dozens of townships and military outposts. The group's continuous capture of regions in its fold have raised questions about its motive.\n\nMyanmar has never recognised the Rohingya community residing in the Rakhine province as its citizens. In 2017, after a brutal crackdown on Rohingya villages by Myanmar's military, hundreds of thousands Rohingya fled across the border into neighbouring Bangladesh to escape the atrocities. India has faced an influx of Rohingya refugees since then.\n\nAs of now, keeping a larger picture of Rakhine province's autonomy, the Arakan Army wants to project the Rohingya as their own, but in the past, the organisation is known to have committed deadly atrocities against the community.\n\nHighlighting the events of the region, Sripathi Narayanan, foreign and security policy analyst, said, \"The Rohingya have been used as cannon fodder by both the junta and the rebels. Much of the supplies of the AA (Arakan Army) come from across the western border of Myanmar. The communities across the border also share fraternal ties with one another.\"\n\nIndia's interests\n\nIndia's attitude towards Myanmar has been mixed as it has been facing its own problems in the northeast, particularly in Manipur, for the past 20 months, and the arrival of Christian and Buddhist refugees from Myanmar have further complicated the issues.\n\nThere are fears about advanced weaponry in the hands of Myanmar's rebel groups reaching terrorist groups operating in India's northeastern states. Also, there are reports of Myanmar's rebel groups increasing drug trafficking activities to raise funds, which is another major concern for India.\n\nSensing the risks, the Centre recently tightened the rules for the movement of people from either side of the border in India and Myanmar. The new rules further restrict the movement of people from 16 km under the free movement regime (FMR) to 10 km now, on either side.\n\nA common trait of the ever-altering political scenario of India's neighbourhood - be it Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Myanmar - is their growing reliance on China. This offers Beijing with chances to further contain India's influence in the Global South as a part of its known strategy.\n\nThe political turmoil in Myanmar and Bangladesh can be used by China to its advantage to foment further internal troubles in the northeastern border states of India.\n\nChina has been engaging with the junta and the rebel groups to derive the maximum protection of its own interests in Myanmar. Beijing has invested billions into the country's oil and gas sector, as well as other physical infrastructure. The Myanmar military controls Kyaukphyu, a major town in Rakhine state that is the terminus of a $1.5 billion oil pipeline and a parallel natural gas pipeline running to Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province in southwestern China.\n\nThe pipelines are a major part of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which is an important part of Beijing's ambitious BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).\n\nWith the help of the Arakan Army, China also wants to keep an eye on India's Kaladan project in Rakhine, which is meant to connect the Bay of Bengal with India's northeast. However, the Kaladan project, which entails building new port facilities at Sittwe (Rakhine province capital), a river transit system and a road to India's Mizoram state, seems to be delayed. It would have also reduced India's dependence on Bangladesh for its transit routes. Now, India may have to engage with the Arakan Army, a non-state actor, for starting the delayed project work.\n\nIndia is engaging both with the rebel group and the military government, and has initiated other diplomatic channels.\n\n\"In the past few months, India has started benign engagement with the rebel groups/EAOs (also called Ethnic Armed Organisations) in the regions bordering India because we want to keep our strategic interests of protecting the northeast region at priority,\" says Cchavi Vasisht, senior research associate, Chintan Research Foundation.\n\n\"We need to make further efforts to increase our engagements with AA. To protect our bordering areas as well as the Kaladan project which crosses through the Rakhine state,\" she adds.\n\nAs a way out, there is a need to facilitate dialogue between the rebel groups and junta for initiating an inclusive democratic process where all communities have a say. \"India has been vocalising its concerns with respect to Myanmar, it wants a smooth transition of the country into a federal and democratic setup,\" says Ms Vasisht."

            "article_content": "In retrospect, it was inevitable.\n\nDown more than 8% and holding just above $300 on Monday, MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are now lower by about 30% since just after the announcement of their inclusion into the Nasdaq-100 index and nearly 50% from their late November record high.\n\nThe signs of at least a major short-term top in one-time barely known enterprise software company turned juggernaut Bitcoin Development Company MicroStrategy were everywhere.\n\nFirst among those signals was the rocketing stock price \u2014 at its high of $543 in late November, MSTR was up nearly eight-fold in 2024 and more than a 50-bagger since the company began buying bitcoin (BTC) in August 2020.\n\nThere was also founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor \u2014 never shy about promoting his company's prospects and evangelizing for Bitcoin \u2014 who late this year had somehow become even more ubiquitous on the financial news, podcast and social media carousels.\n\nIt wasn't just the constant appearances, but subtle changes in Saylor's attitude to what might charitably be described by U.S. sports fans as \"spiking the football\" following a touchdown. Among them was the constant promotion of the MicroStrategy-invented key performance indicator of \"bitcoin yield,\" which recalled late 1990s made-up internet bubble metrics like \"page views.\" His company flush with cash from share and convertible debt sales, Saylor \u2014 for reasons unknown \u2014 late in the year also got in the habit of teasing announcements of sizable new bitcoin purchases on the Sunday prior to the official regulatory filing on Monday morning.\n\nAnd then there was the emergence of copycats. Despite years of the obvious success of Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, there had been a decided lack of other publicly traded corporates adopting the same. Yes, a few \u2014 even large-caps like the Elon Musk-led Tesla and Jack Dorsey-led Square \u2014 had dipped their toes into bitcoin acquisition. No other company of note, though, was willing to not only adopt bitcoin as their main treasury asset but take advantage of willing markets to raise additional capital with which to accumulate tokens.\n\nThat changed in a sizable way this year however, with small cap medical device maker Semler Scientific, Japan hotel operator Metaplanet, and a number of bitcoin miners among those embracing the Saylor vision \u2014 each of them earning social media plaudits from Saylor with every capital raise and bitcoin purchase announcement.\n\nIf something cannot go on forever, it will stop\n\nNot content with being maybe the greatest trader ever and accumulating many billions of dollars, George Soros wanted to be known as a great thinker. It's no coincidence that his magnum opus on trading \u2014 the Theory of Reflexivity \u2014 sounds suspiciously similar to a famous theory from a fellow named Einstein.\n\nSoros explained that investor perception and its effect on prices is a constant two-way street. In this way, perception (which is often wrong, as humans are fallible) can not just influence prices, but literally create its own reality, i.e. 1) investors believe a stock will go higher because earnings are about to get a big boost, 2) the stock price goes higher, 3) the high stock price allows management to raise capital at a cheaper cost than otherwise, 4) this improves earnings, 5) the stock price goes even higher, 6) the bulls pat themselves on the back for their brilliance and win over converts, \u2026 and so on.\n\nStrip away much of Soros' philosophy and this is also known as a virtuous circle, in which MicroStrategy had surely found itself in 2024. Part of Soros' trading genius was recognizing these circles when they were happening and jumping on \u2014 in size. Another part of his genius was figuring out when the circles were about to break and getting out or even betting against them.\n\n\"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop,\" said the late economist Herb Stein, who at the time was talking about government budget/trade deficits. Stein's Law, it turns out, was equally applicable to MicroStrategy shares.\n\nScoreboard: still showing remarkable gains\n\nChanging hands at about $430 just after the Dec. 14 announcement of its coming inclusion into the Nasdaq-100 Index, MicroStrategy is now selling at just above $300, a decline of roughly 30% in just two weeks.\n\nLooking back, there appear to have been cracks in the MicroStrategy bubble three weeks earlier. The stock peaked at about $543 on Nov. 21. Despite bitcoin's continued rise through late November and early December to an ultimate high above $108,000, MSTR lost ground \u2014 what technicians might call a troubling negative divergence. At the current $300, MicroStrategy for the moment is suffering a peak-to-trough drop of 45% in about five weeks.\n\nMSTR shares have still put in a remarkable performance under anything except that very tiny time frame. They remain higher by more than 400% year-to-date and about 20-fold from the time Saylor initiated bitcoin purchases in August 2020.\n\nWhile the bears might thus say the plunge has far to go, the bulls would surely point out that during MSTR's run since August 2020, the stock has suffered a number of similar scary short-to-medium term declines and has always resolved higher.\n\nWhat would Soros say? Just possibly, he would remind that his Theory of Reflexivity taught that prices can go further (both upward and downward) than most could possibly expect."

            "article_content": "I still can\u2019t quite believe that I\u2019m using an Arm-powered Windows laptop every day. After more than a decade of trying to make Windows on Arm a reality, Microsoft and Qualcomm finally nailed it this year with Copilot Plus PCs. These new laptops have excellent battery life and great performance \u2014 and the app compatibility issues that have plagued Windows on Arm are mostly a thing of the past (as long as you\u2019re not a gamer). Microsoft wanted 2024 to be \u201cthe year of the AI PC,\u201d but I think it was very much the year of Windows on Arm. If 2024 was anything to go by, 2025 is going to be even bigger for Windows on Arm.\n\nMicrosoft set the stage for the 2024 year of Windows on Arm announcements in January at CES with promises of AI PCs and the first big change to Windows keyboards in 30 years. Laptop manufacturers started putting a Copilot key on keyboards early this year, providing quick access to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant. While the Copilot experience on Windows has gone through several confusing revisions, it\u2019s still a key I accidentally press and then get frustrated when a Copilot window appears.\n\nAfter the Copilot key was met with a lukewarm reception, Microsoft reignited the Mac vs. PC war a few months later. Inside Microsoft, confidence had gradually been growing throughout the early months of 2024 that it could finally beat Apple\u2019s MacBook Air after falling behind for years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the company\u2019s new Copilot Plus PC devices at a special event in May, setting the stage for a summer of Windows on Arm laptops from every major OEM.\n\nThe processor is the key\n\nThe key to Windows on Arm\u2019s revival this year was Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processors, which were announced in April. They\u2019ve provided the type of performance and power efficiency only previously available with Apple\u2019s MacBooks and challenged Intel and AMD to do better in the x86 space. After much debate over Microsoft\u2019s MacBook Air-beating benchmarks, the reviews rolled in and showed that Windows on Arm was indeed capable of matching and beating Apple\u2019s MacBook Air. Qualcomm even hired the \u201cI\u2019m a Mac\u201d guy to promote Windows on Arm PCs, showing how confident it was in challenging Apple\u2019s laptop dominance.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best Windows laptops available right now. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm also worked closely with developers to make key apps compatible, and it\u2019s now very rare to run into an app compatibility issue that can\u2019t be solved by a native Arm64 version or Microsoft\u2019s improved emulator. Even Google, which previously shunned Windows Phone, has created Arm64 versions of Chrome and Google Drive to support Microsoft\u2019s efforts. With developers continually providing native versions of their apps, it makes it a lot easier to switch to a Windows on Arm laptop. The only big exception is gaming, where x86 still reigns supreme for compatibility and performance.\n\nIntel didn\u2019t sit still while all this Windows on Arm hype was occurring, nor AMD. Intel struck back with Lunar Lake at IFA in September, delivering impressive performance and battery life improvements. AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen AI chips are also competing directly with Qualcomm, and both AMD and Intel have the key advantage of game compatibility that Windows on Arm is definitely not ready for.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting for an M4-powered MacBook Air, Apple did refresh its cheapest MacBooks in October with a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM. Apple would probably argue it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence, but the unusual change came months after Copilot Plus PCs launched, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM at price points that challenge the MacBook Air. Apple did manage to squeeze its new M4 chip into the MacBook Pro recently, though, showing that Qualcomm has some ground to make up in 2025.\n\nApple and Microsoft have both been focusing on AI-powered features for laptops this year, and the end results have been underwhelming on both sides. While a lot of the initial Copilot Plus PC buzz was around Windows on Arm, Microsoft also rolled out some Windows AI features on these devices in June.\n\nIncomplete Recall\n\nThe flagship feature was supposed to be Recall, a feature that snapshots mostly everything you do on a laptop and then lets you recall moments or scroll through a timeline of how you\u2019ve used your PC. But because Recall was met with privacy and security concerns, undermining Microsoft\u2019s entire Copilot Plus PC marketing effort, Microsoft was forced to delay Recall several times to improve its security. In fact, it has only recently appeared in test versions of Windows.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Microsoft\u2019s stumbles with Recall will mean the company slows down with its Windows AI efforts. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri recently told me that the very future of Windows is about cloud and AI, so expect a lot more of this in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly focusing on Windows AI features like Recall. Image: Microsoft\n\nComing in 2025\n\nNext year will also be a fascinating battle between x86 and Windows on Arm. AMD and Intel are teaming up to fend off Arm-based chips from Qualcomm, and Intel is facing a period of turbulence after ejecting its CEO, facing desktop chip issues, and a wave of layoffs earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see 2025 as the year that Windows on Arm continues to eat into the laptop space. A Dell leak revealed Qualcomm is preparing new chips for 2025, and the chip maker has also been rolling out cheaper Arm-based chips to bring laptop prices down. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll see more of those at CES in January, alongside the usual slew of laptops that set the stage for the year.\n\nThe Dell leak also hinted at Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU plans, which now look set for a CES announcement. Leaks suggest we\u2019ll see RTX 50-series desktop GPUs and even the laptop variants, with OEMs rumored to be preparing new models to show at CES. Given the Windows on Arm gaming situation, a new generation of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs could help generate fresh excitement around x86 laptops throughout 2025.\n\nNvidia might also be planning to help the Windows on Arm effort. The chip maker has long been rumored to be planning to launch Arm PC chips as soon as 2025. Nvidia\u2019s expertise in AI chips and gaming could certainly shake up the Windows laptop world and make Windows on Arm even more enticing."

And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "There\u2019s a compelling theory floating around that Google\u2019s AI agent, called Deep Research, could negatively impact affiliate sites. If true, not only would this impact affiliate site earnings, it could also decrease ad revenues and web traffic and to informational sites, including to the \u201clucky\u201d sites that are linked to by Google\u2019s AI research assistant.\n\nGemini Deep Research\n\nGemini Deep Research is a new tool available to premium subscribers to Gemini Advanced. Deep Research takes a user\u2019s queries and researches an answer on the web then generates a report. The research can be further refined to produce increasingly precise results.\n\nGoogle rolled out Deep Research on December 11th. It describes it as a time-saver that creates a research plan and once approved will carry out the research.\n\nGoogle explains:\n\n\u201cDeep Research uses AI to explore complex topics on your behalf and provide you with findings in a comprehensive, easy-to-read report, and is a first look at how Gemini is getting even better at tackling complex tasks to save you time. Under your supervision, Deep Research does the hard work for you. After you enter your question, it creates a multi-step research plan for you to either revise or approve. Once you approve, it begins deeply analyzing relevant information from across the web on your behalf.\u201d\n\nDeep Research presents a report that features a summary and recommendations. If searching for a product it will summarize the pros and cons with enough data that a user won\u2019t need to click a link to visit a site, they can just go directly to a retailer and purchase the product, thereby eliminating the possibility of a site visitor clicking an affiliate link from a review website and depriving that informational site of revenue.\n\nAccording to an article by Marie Haynes on YouKnowAI, the thoroughness of the summary generated by Gemini Deep Research negates the need to visit a websites, thereby depriving the site of affiliate link revenue.\n\nYouKnowAI explains:\n\n\u201c\u2026perhaps sites like foodnetwork.com will get clicks and subsequent affiliate sales. I\u2019ve found in my own research so far that I\u2019m not clicking on sites as I get what I need to know from the research and then go to official sites or perhaps Amazon, or stores near me to purchase. \u2026The obvious question here is what happens when sites like foodnetwork.com and seriouseats.com see a reduction in traffic? \u201c\n\nIf it\u2019s true that Gemini Deep Research users won\u2019t need to visit sites to make up their minds then it\u2019s possible that this new tool will also negatively affect web traffic and advertising revenue.\n\nIs Google Out Of Touch With The Web Ecosystem?\n\nIn a recent interview, Google\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, insisted that Google cares about the web ecosystem. When asked how Google supports the web ecosystem he struggled to articulate an answer. After a long series of uhms and false starts he started talking about how Google\u2019s own YouTube platform enables multinational media corporations to monetize their intellectual properties on YouTube.\n\n\u201cHe avoids mentioning websites, speaking in the abstract about the \u201cecosystem\u201d and then when he runs out of things to say changes course and begins speaking about how Google compensates copyright holders who sign up for YouTube\u2019s Content ID program. He answered: \u2018Look I\u2026 uh\u2026 It\u2019s a\u2026 very important question\u2026 uhm\u2026 look I\u2026 I\u2026 think\u2026 I think more than any other company\u2026 look you know\u2026 we for a long time through\u2026 you know\u2026 be it in search making sure\u2026 while it\u2019s often debated, we spend a lot of time thinking about the traffic we send to the ecosystem. Even through the moment through the transition over the past couple of years. It\u2019s an important priority for us.'\u201d\n\nThis Is Why Google CEO\u2019s Explanation Falls Short\n\n1. YouTube is not the web ecosystem, it\u2019s Google\u2019s own platform.\n\n2. Multinational mega corporations are not web creators.\n\nPichai\u2019s answer sent the unintended message that Google is completely out of touch with web creators and if the author of the article about Google Gemini\u2019s Deep Research tool is correct, this is further proof that Google continues to focus on providing information to users at the expense of creators.\n\nIs Gemini Deep Research Harvesting Data Without Giving Back?\n\nThere\u2019s an old television episode of The Twilight Zone called To Serve Man that relates the story of a benevolent race of aliens who bring advanced technologies that allow humans to live in peace, with food security and prosperity for everyone. As evidence of their good intentions they give the world a book written in an alien language that\u2019s titled To Serve Man. The episode ends when government cryptographers translate the book and discover that it\u2019s a cookbook and that the aliens true intentions are to farm humans as a food source.\n\nGoogle\u2019s mission statement promising \u201cto organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful\u201d also seems like proof of their good intentions. However, the mission statement doesn\u2019t explicitly say that Google will refer users to the sources of information. It only promises to organize and provide the information itself in a way that\u2019s accessible and useful. While referring users to the creators of the information could be a part of making information accessible and useful, it\u2019s not explicitly stated; it\u2019s not even implied in the mission statement.\n\nIs Google Gemini Deep Research further proof that Google is harvesting websites as an information source?\n\nIf you\u2019re a creator, does it make you feel farmed?\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Nomad_Soul"

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nAt some point, the truth about all of these UFO and drone sightings has to start being revealed. There are just too many eyewitness reports and videos being shared online for governments to just keep pretending like nothing is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the United States either (though that is where a majority of the reports are originating). They have also been happening in places like the United Kingdom, Germany, and now, in Brazil.\n\nWhile orb-shaped UFOs are perhaps the most common type of UFO that has been seen over the years, triangular-shaped crafts have also been reported being seen quite often.\n\nThe latest triangular-shaped UFO to be reported, and in this case filmed, occurred recently in the Barigui Park, in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.\n\n\u201cI came across the video yesterday while browsing reels on Instagram,\u201d a report written for Ovniologia in Brazil read. \u201cThe account published the footage, called Paranadrone , is a page dedicated to aerial images to with drones and has no connection to the UFO theme.\n\n\u201cI contacted you and requested the original footage, which was sent to me. The video was forwarded them by a follower who requested anonymity. The images were recorded around 8 pm, while the witness was in a trade in the park region.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the video, it is possible to see that the person filming was apparently close to a wall, inside a residence or business, the Paranadro told me. Then, we see a large, luminous point coming from the left, reveals its which triangular shape when the witness zooms in,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cThe object crosses the sky at a considerable and constant speed until it disappears from the author\u2019s field of vision behind the trees. See below.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have what appears to be beautiful footage of a triangular UFO. The fixed, unwavering lights at the bottom seem to match reports of these craft. One worth thing noting is the number of lights. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, three to four lights are usually reported on these objects. However, in the footage, in addition to the three lights at the ends, we can see two more luminous points near the larger central light.\n\n\u201cThis led me to question if it was actually a solid object or just a formation of orbs. While the footage is quite clear, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say that another witness to the same UFO claimed it had \u201ctwo lights at a considerably low altitude that same day. One of them was in front of her house, with a green and red coloration, while the other, located behind the house, was orange in color and considerably larger.\u201d\n\nHer neighbor also saw the UFO and also filmed it.\n\nThe report by Ovniologia went on to explain, \u201cI spoke to other people who reported strange activity in the skies over Curitiba this month. The reports describe some anomalous sightings and experiences. It is possible that that some incidence of the phenomenon is occurring in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the video of the triangular UFO, the first thing thing that came to mind was the wave of drones on American soil. Could there be any possible connection? Could it be starting to spread to other regions of the Americas? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo far, no definitive explanation has been revealed."

            "article_content": "Photo: VCG\n\nThroughout the year of 2024, there has been no shortage of posts and videos on social media platforms by bloggers from home or abroad, sharing how they were captivated by China's surging scientific revolution tide, ranging from real-time food delivery by hotel room service robots, driverless artificial intelligent (AI) robots delivering parcels to spherical robots patrolling the street side by side with police officers.In a recent milestone, a group of four-legged \"Made in China\" robotic dogs, designed for tunnel inspections and maintenance tasks, have been put on duty and are now operating in a 6-kilometer underground power tunnel inspection project in Singapore - the first overseas deployment of a Chinese robotic solution in such an application scenario.These unique creatures have wooed thousands of netizens after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian shared a video of them on social media in mid-December, calling them \"cool.\"The \"cool\" wave of the tech revolution has been unlocking more exciting possibilities across multiple Chinese industries in 2024, a year that is deemed critical for the rapid advancement of China's robotics technology. It, in a broader picture, underscored the explosive progress of new quality productive forces -an emerging key term in China's economic and social axis that is playing an expanding role in driving the country's high-quality development.A walk-in into manufacturing bases across various Chinese localities also provides insights into how the development of new quality productive forces has been transforming traditional industries while injecting new impetus into driving the country's industrial upgrade.To date, a flurry of auto-makers and logistics providers including Geely, BAIC New Energy, and SF Express have been integrating humanoid robots, considered at the forefront of the development of new quality productive forces, into their facilities, the Global Times learned from Hong Kong-listed UBTech Robotics. These robots are being trialed on factory floors to perform tasks like assembly, transportation, testing, and maintenance, making remarkable progress in automation and industrial efficiency improvement in the world's second-largest economy.In December, the just-concluded Central Work Economic Conference set priorities for economic work in 2025, including ensuring that scientific and technological innovation drives the development of new quality productive forces and builds a modernized industrial system.As China is steadily marching toward the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026-30), industry insiders expect that the development of new quality productive forces will serve as a cornerstone of China's long-term strategic vision in the face of a more complicated geopolitical landscape, rising protectionism and global tech supply chain \"decoupling.\" Meanwhile, China's build-up of a host of emerging industries like AI and 5G would also create a new type of global supply and value chains that injects strong momentum and brings more development opportunities to the Global South, analysts stressed.During this year's national two sessions in March, the phrase new quality productive forces has become a buzzword among Chinese officials, national lawmakers, and political advisors, with \"developing new quality productive forces at a faster pace\" listed among the major tasks for 2024 in the Government Work Report for the first time.More elaborations on the concept, as well as detailed plans and coordinating measures, were released in follow-ups, further highlighting its profound ramifications in the country's economic policymaking and future development course.In early December, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting to analyze and study the economic work of 2025, during which it was noted that new quality productive forces have developed steadily this year.According to industry insiders, scientific and technological innovation is the core of the new quality productive forces. In this regard, China has achieved numerous monumental milestones in sci-tech innovation this year in a variety of sectors, such as semiconductor, quantum computing, telecom technology, AI, low-altitude economy, biomedicine, new energy, and large aircraft manufacturing.It is important to sustain this homegrown technological climb-up momentum, according to analysts, and they expect the 15th Five-year Plan (2026-2030) to continue prioritizing the development of new quality productive forces, listing it as both an urgent task and a long-term vision.Pan Helin, a member of the Expert Committee for the Information and Communication Economy under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told the Global Times that the accumulation of these technological edges is crucial to fueling China's ongoing industrial transformation and upgrading. It is also conducive to the formation of new economic drivers and new business models, which are all decisive elements in buttressing China's high-quality development course in the years to come.The accelerated efforts in the development of new quality productive forces also come as Western countries show no sign of retreating from technological suppression against China.Against the backdrop, industry insiders called for more inputs in independent innovation and a strong spirit of self-reliance in core technologies, so that the country will be less vulnerable to any malicious attempts to curb its development and will have a greater say in international technological standard-setting.In terms of humanoid robots which integrate a wide range of cutting-edge full-stack AI technologies, Chinese players may start late as the technology and products were initially developed in countries like the US and Japan a decade ago. But this year, Chinese humanoid robot companies have achieved remarkable innovations, establishing themselves as global leaders in both robot products and applications, UBTech Robotics told the Global Times.The Government Work Report delivered in March 2024 stressed that China will pool the country's strategic scientific and technological strength and non-governmental innovation resources to make breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields and step up research on disruptive and frontier technologies.Highlighting the country's institutional advantage, Hua Rongqi, a Beijing-based AI entrepreneur, told the Global Times that China is perhaps the most efficient in mobilizing resources nationwide to enhance its capacity for innovation across the board. He said that this advantage is particularly palpable in the generative AI industry which is in a white-hot global race.At the same time, China excels in applying these technologies to real-world scenarios, and also is home to the world's most efficient and cost-effective supply chain alongside a deep pool of talent, which will all propel the development of new quality productive forces, Hua added.Zhou Hongyi, founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology, told the Global Times that China's stepped-up efforts are poised to make greater contributions to global technological progress and economic development, with its innovation-driven development model offering valuable experience for other countries to draw upon.\"On the one hand, industrial digitalization will create more new business models and growth dynamics, thereby generating great opportunities for global investors to tap into the country's expanding market. On the other hand, more and more countries will show great interest in engaging with technological cooperation taking account of China's growing technological prowess,\" Zhou explained.Chinese industries related to the development of new quality productive forces have increasingly risen to become a magnet to foreign investors this year.In the first 11 months, foreign direct investment in the country's high-tech manufacturing reached 82.53 billion yuan, accounting for 11 percent of the national total, data released by the Ministry of Commerce showed.According to UBTech Robotics, China's fast-lane development of new quality productive forces has also elevated the global standing and influence of Chinese enterprises and rendered them with more business opportunities in the global market. The company to date has collaborated with local partners to apply robotics solutions in countries such as Thailand, Dubai, South Korea, Japan, and Germany.Huang Lingxiao, overseas marketing manager of DEEP Robotics, the Chinese company that provides robotic dogs for tunnel maintenance tasks in Singapore, told the Global Times on Thursday that as developed nations like Singapore upgrade their industrial infrastructure through automation and digitization, this creates enormous opportunities for innovative solutions from Chinese robotics companies."
