Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new study published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, unveils a novel approach to measuring public attention using reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The research bridges the gap between unconventional indicators and macroeconomic analysis, revealing surprising links between UAP sightings and economic conditions at multiple geographical levels in the United States.\n\nThe study highlights that UAP reports, often dismissed as a niche phenomenon, serve as a robust proxy for public attention. By analyzing daily-level data from NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center), the researchers show that UAP sightings are more frequent in wealthier regions but exhibit counter-cyclical patterns within those regions over time. These findings suggest that shifts in attention to extraordinary phenomena may reflect broader fluctuations in public focus.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nMacroeconomic correlation: UAP sightings are positively correlated with economic conditions across regions but display counter-cyclical patterns within regions over time.\n\nCausal evidence: A quasi-experimental design leveraging variations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions demonstrates a causal link between restricted mobility and increased UAP reports, further establishing the measure as an indicator of public attention.\n\nPolicy implications: Regions with higher UAP sighting levels show muted responses to monetary policy shocks, suggesting that attention variations can significantly influence economic outcomes.\n\nThe researchers compared UAP sightings to conventional attention metrics, finding strong correlations. This innovative measure offers unique advantages, including the ability to analyze attention at different geographical and temporal scales.\n\nImplications for policy and research\n\nGoldstein and Raveh's findings underscore the central role of public attention in economic dynamics. Their work not only enhances the toolkit for macroeconomic analysis but also provides policymakers with insights into managing public attention to mitigate economic shocks.\n\nThe study invites further exploration into how unconventional forms of attention, like UAP sightings, intersect with economic behaviors. \"We hope this work inspires future research to deepen our understanding of the connection between public attention and macroeconomic outcomes,\" the authors state.\n\nThe research uses comprehensive UAP sighting data from NUFORC, spanning over two decades, to construct a daily-level panel of reports across U.S. counties. The analysis integrates economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure robust conclusions.\n\nThis pioneering work highlights the value of thinking beyond traditional metrics, shedding light on the role of seemingly unrelated phenomena in understanding economic patterns.\n\nMore information: Nathan Goldstein et al, Looking up the sky: unidentified aerial phenomena and macroeconomic attention, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (2024).

            "article_content": "The FAA has placed temporary flight restrictions on the operation of drones over parts of New Jersey, according to a notice published on the agency\u2019s website. The ban on drone activity is likely related to the recent bout of mass hysteria over supposed \u201cdrone\u201d sightings, though the agency hasn\u2019t said so explicitly. The FAA told the New York Times the ban was enacted at the request of \u201cfederal security partners,\u201d without elaborating further.\n\nThe drone ban covers 22 different New Jersey communities and is set to expire on Jan. 17, 2025. It\u2019s not immediately clear why that end date was chosen. The FAA didn\u2019t address Gizmodo\u2019s questions about the specific timing of the flight restrictions and their relation to drone sightings in an email Thursday morning and directed us to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cWe continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,\u201d a spokesperson from DHS told Gizmodo over email. The spokesperson did not address our specific questions on the record.\n\n\u201cIn coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nPeople in New Jersey started reporting odd \u201cdrones\u201d in the sky to police around Nov. 18, according to NBC News, and there have reportedly been sightings every day since, aside from a conspicuous pause on Thanksgiving. The so-called drones have caused more and more people to post videos taken of what they believe to be unmanned aerial vehicles. And while some of the videos are difficult to explain, the vast majority appear to be regular commercial aircraft.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for internet cranks to get worked up about nothing, this drone panic has spread to areas that are unexpected. Several elected leaders have called for action by the federal government, including president-elect Donald Trump who\u2019s both claimed the government is trying to hide something and said they should be shot down.\n\nBut the concern has been bipartisan. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, has called for more action and played up the hype.\n\n\u201cSome of the drones are small. Some of the drones\u2019 flight patterns are erratic,\u201d Schumer said on Sunday, according to NBC News. \u201cMultiple drones flying together can confuse a traditional radar system and that\u2019s why, again, this new technology can really get us the answers that we need.\u201d\n\nPeople are also pointing lasers at commercial flights, an incredibly dangerous activity that can light up the inside of a cockpit and blind pilots. Laser strikes were already a serious problem, but have become so common during the current drone hysteria that the FAA was forced to issue a statement warning the public not to do it. Shining a laser at planes is a federal crime that can bring jail time and hefty fines.\n\nSome of the most difficult-to-believe theories about the drones are coming from elected leaders, including claims by a Republican congressman that they\u2019re actually being deployed by an Iranian mothership off the east coast of the U.S.\n\n\u201cKnow that Iran made a deal with China to purchase drones, motherships, and technology in order to go forward,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey on Fox News Dec. 11. \u201cThe sources I have are good. They can\u2019t reveal who they are because they are speaking to me in confidentiality. These drones should be shot down.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Iran has deployed a drone mothership, despite the fact that Van Drew has access to real power and should know things. Van Drew is a member of the U.S. House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. But nothing would surprise us at this point when it comes to weird sightings. With Trump taking power again in a month, things are shaping up to get so much weirder in the months and years ahead, drones or no drones."

Here's how experts say you can and should, report UFO or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in Canada.\n\nTransport Canada collects aviation occurrence information and enters it into the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, known as CADORS.\n\nIn CADORS reports, Transport Canada said the term \u201cUFO\u201d can include sightings of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs or drones), balloons, meteors, weather phenomena and birds.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u201cIt should not be interpreted to mean something of extraterrestrial origin. The information in CADORS should be treated as preliminary, unsubstantiated and subject to change,\u201d said Flavio Nienow, Transport Canada spokesperson, in a statement.\n\nTransport Canada said they don't have any additional information to provide beyond what can be found in CADORS.\n\nHow does Transport Canada followup on reports?\n\nWhen reports like these are generated, Nienow explained the next steps depend on the type of the incident reported.\n\n\u201cFurther follow up may be undertaken by various organizations including Transport Canada, Nav Canada, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u201d he said. \u201cTransport Canada will use every tool at its disposal in an attempt to find an aircraft found to be operating in an unsafe and unlawful manner.\u201d\n\nNienow said anyone who witnesses unsafe aviation activity should contact Transport Canada or local law enforcement. Witnesses are encouraged to record and provide as much information as possible to help Transport Canada review incidents more effectively. For example, send clear photos or videos, record the date, time and any other identifying marks.\n\nOther aviation incidents may be reported at Incident reporting: Report an aviation incident. Drone-related incidents can also be reported.\n\nHow else can you report?\n\nThe U.S.-based National UFO Reporting Center collects all sorts of reports \u2014 including UFO and UAP reports from Canada, the U.S., and around the world. They encourage people to use their website to report occurrences.\n\nThroughout its history, the organization has processed more than 180,000 reports.\n\n\u201cWe look at every single report. We make an assessment,\u201d said Christian Stepien, the organization's chief technology officer, and follow up on reports that require a more in-depth look.\n\nReports are placed in the organization's databank, where you can review past reports categorized by date and location.\n\nThis publication reached out to the Ontario Provincial Police about UFO or UAP reports and asked how they advise citizens both generally and specifically to report them. We have not yet received a response."

            "article_content": "While we wait for OpenAI\u2019s next big thing \u2014 presumably ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 model (or whatever it\u2019s called) \u2014 we might get to see and use another big upgrade for genAI products. AI agents are programs that let you manage and control Mac or Windows apps using written ChatGPT prompts and voice.\n\nThat\u2019s the future of AI computing I want from ChatGPT and similar AI products. I want to tell AI to look at my screen and do whatever I ask it to. I also want it to perform internet searches on my behalf, whether in the ChatGPT app or a browser. More importantly, I want to do most of it by voice, with the help of Advanced Voice Mode and future versions of it.\n\nOpenAI isn\u2019t quite there, but the demos the company showed during its penultimate \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement tell me we\u2019re heading in that direction.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for Mac now works with even more coding apps. OpenAI also added support for note-taking apps, including the Apple Notes app that comes on all Apple devices. The best part about it is that Advanced Voice Mode can be used to talk to ChatGPT about the contents on your screen.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nWe\u2019re still not getting full agentic functionality from ChatGPT. It\u2019s an iterative upgrade over what OpenAI announced about a month ago for the Mac app. At the time, the company gave ChatGPT the ability to look at the contents on the screen in certain coding apps on the Mac. The feature wasn\u2019t as much an agentic control of the computer as OpenAI leveraged a built-in accessibility API in macOS to read text.\n\nBut OpenAI has built on that, adding support for more coding apps, including Warp, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others. As you can see in the short clips below, you can use the Mac app to instruct ChatGPT to look at the screen in a specific app. You\u2019ll be able to choose which app you\u2019re giving the AI access to, and that\u2019s the only thing it\u2019ll see.\n\nIn addition to expanding support to more apps, OpenAI is also bringing o1 and o1 pro mode to the mix of models that can be used to code for you. Advanced Voice Mode wasn\u2019t a part of these demos, as the OpenAI engineers still used text-based prompts to demo the new functionality.\n\nNow you can code with the power of o1 and o1 pro mode. pic.twitter.com/qdj9RuLRKQ \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThese updates aren\u2019t exciting if you don\u2019t code for a living. But you can already write all sorts of text. That\u2019s where ChatGPT might come in handy if you use a Mac. Here\u2019s where the Advanced Voice Mode feature shines.\n\nOpenAI showed a demo of ChatGPT\u2019s agentic behavior for note-taking apps. The list of supported apps includes Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. The demo below shows ChatGPT looking at a Notion note to understand the context and answer a prompt. The AI then performs a search for factual information about a historic event and generates text trying to mimic the voice of the note\u2019s author.\n\nInstead of typing the prompts, you might want to talk to ChatGPT with Advanced Voice Mode rather than type your prompts. This might boost your productivity, assuming everything works as intended. As you\u2019ll see in the second demo, the AI quickly understands your needs, but it might fail here and there.\n\nAnd you can use Advanced Voice when you work with these apps. pic.twitter.com/drZoRc7xvC \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThen again, we\u2019re still in the early days here. What OpenAI has shown only scratches the surface of what ChatGPT might do one day on Mac and PC.\n\nUntil then, you can try these new ChatGPT capabilities in the Mac app as long as you have access to a premium tier (Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu). OpenAI will bring these features to the Windows app in the future. ChatGPT Free users will also get them next year."

            "article_content": "Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Android 16 is introducing a new WritingTools API.\n\nThe WritingTools API lets apps opt out of writing tools that enable keyboards to replace the user\u2019s text with text generated by AI.\n\nApps might want to disable AI writing tools when the user is inputting text in certain text fields like for emails.\n\nGoogle rolled out the second developer preview of Android 16 the other day, bringing the platform a whole host of new developer features like better app control over haptics, search support for cloud media items in the photo picker, an adaptive refresh rate API, and more. As usual, it also includes changes that Google didn\u2019t highlight in its announcement, some of which we\u2019ve already covered. The latest change we\u2019ve spotted is a new Writing Tools API that seemingly lets apps opt out of having AI rewrite text for you.\n\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\n\nWhile digging through the documentation for Android 16 DP2, we notice that Google documented two new methods in the EditorInfo class: isWritingToolsEnabled() and setWritingToolsEnabled() . The EditorInfo class basically lets apps communicate information about an editable text field (like the type of text content it contains) to the current input method (i.e. an Android keyboard app).\n\nThe new isWritingToolsEnabled() method returns true when an Editor has AI writing tools enabled, which are enabled by default on all text fields. The documentation notes that \u201ctoolkits can optionally disable [AI writing tools] where not relevant e.g. passwords, number input, etc.\u201d\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nThe documentation under the new setWritingToolsEnabled() method explains how it can be used by apps to opt out of having writing tools rewrite text using generative AI.\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nSome keyboard apps like Gboard have AI writing tools that help you proofread or rewrite text using on-device or cloud-based generative AI models. Gboard has a proofread option on some Pixel devices, for example, that helps correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in any text that you\u2019ve typed, pasted, or dictated.\n\nMost apps should have no reason to opt out of AI writing tools in most text fields, but some apps may want to instruct the current keyboard app to not allow them in some situations. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allow AI writing tools to be used to replace text in fields where you have to input an email address, password, or phone number, for example.\n\nWhile Gboard already hides most irrelevant options when it\u2019s focused on a number or password field, some other keyboard apps might not, which seems to be the logic behind this new Writing Tools API. Regardless, it\u2019s going to be up to keyboard apps to respect this new API. Even if they do, though, it seems like it\u2019d be very easy to work around, as you could always just generate text in another app and then insert it into the text field where it\u2019s supposed to be blocked.\n\nWe\u2019re still digging through Android 16 Developer Preview 2 to find out what\u2019s new, so keep an eye out for more coverage on Android Authority.\n\nGot a tip?

            "article_content": "Yet realizing measurable business value from AI-powered applications requires a new game plan. Legacy application architectures simply aren\u2019t capable of meeting the high demands of AI-enhanced applications. Rather, the time is now for organizations to modernize their infrastructure, processes, and application architectures using cloud native technologies to stay competitive.\n\nThe time is now for modernization\n\nToday\u2019s organizations exist in an era of geopolitical shifts, growing competition, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. AI applications can help by supporting innovation, but only if they have the flexibility to scale when needed. Fortunately, by modernizing applications, organizations can achieve the agile development, scalability, and fast compute performance needed to support rapid innovation and accelerate the delivery of AI applications. David Harmon, director of software development for AMD says companies, \u201creally want to make sure that they can migrate their current [environment] and take advantage of all the hardware changes as much as possible.\u201d The result is not only a reduction in the overall development lifecycle of new applications but a speedy response to changing world circumstances.\n\nBeyond building and deploying intelligent apps quickly, modernizing applications, data, and infrastructure can significantly improve customer experience. Consider, for example, Coles, an Australian supermarket that invested in modernization and is using data and AI to deliver dynamic e-commerce experiences to its customers both online and in-store. With Azure DevOps, Coles has shifted from monthly to weekly deployments of applications while, at the same time, reducing build times by hours. What\u2019s more, by aggregating views of customers across multiple channels, Coles has been able to deliver more personalized customer experiences. In fact, according to a 2024 CMSWire Insights report, there is a significant rise in the use of AI across the digital customer experience toolset, with 55% of organizations now using it to some degree, and more beginning their journey.\n\nBut even the most carefully designed applications are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. If given the opportunity, bad actors can extract sensitive information from machine learning models or maliciously infuse AI systems with corrupt data. \u201cAI applications are now interacting with your core organizational data,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cHaving the right guard rails is important to make sure the data is secure and built on a platform that enables you to do that.\u201d The good news is modern cloud based architectures can deliver robust security, data governance, and AI guardrails like content safety to protect AI applications from security threats and ensure compliance with industry standards.\n\nThe answer to AI innovation\n\nNew challenges, from demanding customers to ill-intentioned hackers, call for a new approach to modernizing applications. \u201cYou have to have the right underlying application architecture to be able to keep up with the market and bring applications faster to market,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cNot having that foundation can slow you down.\u201d\n\nEnter cloud native architecture. As organizations increasingly adopt AI to accelerate innovation and stay competitive, there is a growing urgency to rethink how applications are built and deployed in the cloud. By adopting cloud native architectures, Linux, and open source software, organizations can better facilitate AI adoption and create a flexible platform purpose built for AI and optimized for the cloud. Harmon explains that open source software creates options, \u201cAnd the overall open source ecosystem just thrives on that. It allows new technologies to come into play.\u201d\n\nApplication modernization also ensures optimal performance, scale, and security for AI applications. That\u2019s because modernization goes beyond just lifting and shifting application workloads to cloud virtual machines. Rather, a cloud native architecture is inherently designed to provide developers with the following features:\n\nThe flexibility to scale to meet evolving needs\n\nBetter access to the data needed to drive intelligent apps\n\nAccess to the right tools and services to build and deploy intelligent applications easily\n\nSecurity embedded into an application to protect sensitive data\n\nTogether, these cloud capabilities ensure organizations derive the greatest value from their AI applications. \u201cAt the end of the day, everything is about performance and security,\u201d says Harmon. Cloud is no exception."

Oh, and they\u2019re also searching for a pair of missing testicles.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThe critically acclaimed show debuted on October 4, 2024, and quickly became a hit across the 12 episodes that aired on Crunchyroll and Netflix.\n\nSeason 2 was announced at the same time as the Season 1 finale appeared in December, but we didn\u2019t know when it would air\u2026 until now.\n\nDandadan gets Season 2 release window\n\nA Dandadan video that Netflix posted on social media has revealed that Season 2 will drop in July 2025. Which is just seven months after the end of Season 1.\n\nUnfortunately, the 93-second video is simply the opening credits to the show, so doesn\u2019t offer any clues regarding what to expect.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nBut the announcement has fans speculating about what might happen in the forthcoming run, with one writing, \u201cSeason 2 will be cursed house arc and alien invasion arc I hope.\u201d Another said, \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d get Season 2 faster, can\u2019t wait til everyone meets Vamola,\u201d while a third claimed, \u201cKinta is coming baby.\u201d\n\nThose are all solid predictions, but it remains to be seen if anything in Season 2 will be as good as Episode 7 of Season 1 \u2013 titled \u2018To a Kinder World\u2019 \u2013 which we declared the best Dandadan episode thus far, and is currently the show\u2019s highest rated instalment on IMDb, with a corking 9.7 score.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nFor more on the show, you can read about the surprising musical Easter egg in the Dandadan credits, an explanation of the show\u2019s unusual title, plus details of Dandadan\u2019s antagonist.

            "article_content": "You've almost certainly put lettuce on a burger, but what if a type of seaweed called sea lettuce was the burger.\n\nResearchers at the Chalmers University of Technology have high hopes for just that after unveiling a method to extract three times more protein from sea lettuce than a conventional burger. They published their findings in the Food Chemistry journal, via Science Direct, and pointed to a number of potential uses for the flavorful seaweed, as VegNews detailed.\n\nThe overall problem the researchers were looking to address was creating alternatives to land-based protein sources, whether that be meat, dairy, or plant-based. Seaweed provides a promising solution. It can grow well in a variety of conditions without fertilizers, watering, or insecticides.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Humanity will need to find and combine the intake of many more diversified protein sources than we have available in our diet today to meet sustainability and nutritional requirements,\" said Ingrid Undeland, a professor of food science at Chalmers, in a news release.\n\nThe research team said that its new method of extracting protein makes it more affordable and comparable to the process for pea and soy proteins. Sea lettuce is also rich in vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. As far as the taste, the scientists were bullish that there were tons of applications for it.\n\n\"It tastes like umami with a certain salty flavor, despite not containing such high levels of salt,\" said researcher Jo\u00e3o Trigo of a concentrate of the sea lettuce proteins. Trigo said the powder would be a \"great flavor enhancer for seafood dishes and products\" but dreamed bigger down the road.\n\n\"Why not protein smoothies or 'blue burgers' from the sea?\" Trigo asked.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that were to come to fruition, it would provide another alternative to animal-based protein sources. That could be important for the health of humans and the health of the planet, as research has clearly shown the benefits of plant-based diets.\n\nOn the human health side, a recent study said reducing red-meat consumption by 30% could save over 45,000 lives in a 10-year span. Those sorts of health benefits were also seen in a study featuring identical twins when the twins on the vegan diet saw major improvements in key health metrics.\n\nWhy do you eat plant-based foods?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nAs far as the planet's health, another study revealed switching away from red meat and dairy-based diets to plant-based ones could reduce greenhouse gases by 17%. The Guardian also explored a study that showed how much climate damage and resource usage could be cut down with plant-based diets.\n\nThe Chalmers University team said it is also working to boost the protein content in the seaweed by growing it in processed water used by the seafood industry. It also hopes to use the nonprotein parts of the sea lettuce for food, medical, and material applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, when it comes to food sources, Undeland noted that \"sea-based possibilities\" or \"blue proteins\" have so far been \"overlooked.\"\n\n\"Algae is a good addition to many of the products already on the market,\" Undeland concluded.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Italy\u2019s data protection authority says it has fined OpenAI $15.6 million after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by its generative artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT\n\nROME -- Italy\u2019s data protection watchdog said Friday it has fined OpenAI 15 million euros ($15.6 million) after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by the U.S. artificial intelligence company's popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nThe country\u2019s privacy watchdog, known as Garante, said its investigation showed that OpenAI processed users\u2019 personal data to train ChatGPT \u201cwithout having an adequate legal basis and violated the principle of transparency and the related information obligations towards users\u201d.\n\nOpenAI dubbed the decision \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and said it will appeal.\n\n\u201cWhen the Garante ordered us to stop offering ChatGPT in Italy in 2023, we worked with them to reinstate it a month later,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson said Friday in an emailed statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve since recognized our industry-leading approach to protecting privacy in AI, yet this fine is nearly 20 times the revenue we made in Italy during the relevant period.\u201d\n\nOpenAI added, however, it remained \u201ccommitted to working with privacy authorities worldwide to offer beneficial AI that respects privacy rights.\u201d\n\nThe investigation, launched last year, also found that OpenAI didn\u2019t provide an \u201cadequate age verification system\u201d to prevent users under 13 years of age from being exposed to inappropriate AI-generated content, the watchdog said.\n\nThe Italian authority also ordered OpenAI to launch a six-month campaign on different Italian media to raise public awareness about ChatGPT, specifically in regard to data collection.\n\nThe booming popularity of generative artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT has drawn scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nRegulators in the U.S. and Europe have been examining OpenAI and other companies that have played a key part in the AI boom, while governments around the world have been drawing up rules to protect against risks posed by AI systems, led by the European Union's AI Act, a comprehensive rulebook for artificial intelligence.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report"

It has also poured fuel on the fire of the OpenAI-Google rivalry, an accelerating game of one-upmanship taking place unusually close to the Christmas holiday.\n\n\"How are people surviving with the firehose of AI updates that are coming out,\" wrote one user on X last Friday, which is still a hotbed of AI-related conversation. \"in the last <24 hours we got gemini flash 2.0 and chatGPT with screenshare, deep research, pika 2, sora, chatGPT projects, anthropic clio, wtf it never ends.\"\n\nRumors travel quickly in the AI world, and people in the AI industry had been expecting OpenAI to ship some major products in December. Once OpenAI announced \"12 days of OpenAI\" earlier this month, Google jumped into gear and seemingly decided to try to one-up its rival on several counts. So far, the strategy appears to be working, but it's coming at the cost of the rest of the world being able to absorb the implications of the new releases.\n\n\"12 Days of OpenAI has turned into like 50 new @GoogleAI releases,\" wrote another X user on Monday. \"This past week, OpenAI & Google have been releasing at the speed of a new born startup,\" wrote a third X user on Tuesday. \"Even their own users can't keep up. Crazy time we're living in.\"\n\n\"Somebody told Google that they could just do things,\" wrote a16z partner and AI influencer Justine Moore on X, referring to a common motivational meme telling people they \"can just do stuff.\"\n\nThe Google AI rush\n\nOpenAI's \"12 Days of OpenAI\" campaign has included releases of their full o1 model, an upgrade from o1-preview, alongside o1-pro for advanced \"reasoning\" tasks. The company also publicly launched Sora for video generation, added Projects functionality to ChatGPT, introduced Advanced Voice features with video streaming capabilities, and more."

On Thursday, Google dropped its latest party trick: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, which is a new AI model that uses runtime \"reasoning\" techniques similar to OpenAI's o1 to achieve \"deeper thinking\" on problems fed into it.\n\nThe experimental model builds on Google's newly released Gemini 2.0 Flash and runs on its AI Studio platform, but early tests conducted by TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers reveal accuracy issues with some basic tasks, such as incorrectly counting that the word \"strawberry\" contains two R's.\n\nThese so-called reasoning models differ from standard AI models by incorporating feedback loops of self-checking mechanisms, similar to techniques we first saw in early 2023 with hobbyist projects like \"Baby AGI.\" The process requires more computing time, often adding extra seconds or minutes to response times. Companies have turned to reasoning models as traditional scaling methods at training time have been showing diminishing returns."

            "article_content": "You've almost certainly put lettuce on a burger, but what if a type of seaweed called sea lettuce was the burger.\n\nResearchers at the Chalmers University of Technology have high hopes for just that after unveiling a method to extract three times more protein from sea lettuce than a conventional burger. They published their findings in the Food Chemistry journal, via Science Direct, and pointed to a number of potential uses for the flavorful seaweed, as VegNews detailed.\n\nThe overall problem the researchers were looking to address was creating alternatives to land-based protein sources, whether that be meat, dairy, or plant-based. Seaweed provides a promising solution. It can grow well in a variety of conditions without fertilizers, watering, or insecticides.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Humanity will need to find and combine the intake of many more diversified protein sources than we have available in our diet today to meet sustainability and nutritional requirements,\" said Ingrid Undeland, a professor of food science at Chalmers, in a news release.\n\nThe research team said that its new method of extracting protein makes it more affordable and comparable to the process for pea and soy proteins. Sea lettuce is also rich in vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. As far as the taste, the scientists were bullish that there were tons of applications for it.\n\n\"It tastes like umami with a certain salty flavor, despite not containing such high levels of salt,\" said researcher Jo\u00e3o Trigo of a concentrate of the sea lettuce proteins. Trigo said the powder would be a \"great flavor enhancer for seafood dishes and products\" but dreamed bigger down the road.\n\n\"Why not protein smoothies or 'blue burgers' from the sea?\" Trigo asked.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that were to come to fruition, it would provide another alternative to animal-based protein sources. That could be important for the health of humans and the health of the planet, as research has clearly shown the benefits of plant-based diets.\n\nOn the human health side, a recent study said reducing red-meat consumption by 30% could save over 45,000 lives in a 10-year span. Those sorts of health benefits were also seen in a study featuring identical twins when the twins on the vegan diet saw major improvements in key health metrics.\n\nWhy do you eat plant-based foods?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nAs far as the planet's health, another study revealed switching away from red meat and dairy-based diets to plant-based ones could reduce greenhouse gases by 17%. The Guardian also explored a study that showed how much climate damage and resource usage could be cut down with plant-based diets.\n\nThe Chalmers University team said it is also working to boost the protein content in the seaweed by growing it in processed water used by the seafood industry. It also hopes to use the nonprotein parts of the sea lettuce for food, medical, and material applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, when it comes to food sources, Undeland noted that \"sea-based possibilities\" or \"blue proteins\" have so far been \"overlooked.\"\n\n\"Algae is a good addition to many of the products already on the market,\" Undeland concluded.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Researchers from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Jackson State University have explored the severity of police-involved traffic collisions by harnessing advanced machine learning techniques. Analyzing data from 1,022 police-related accidents in Mississippi between 2010 and 2018, the study uncovers critical factors influencing collision outcomes. Using machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, the researchers pinpointed key variables and developed actionable recommendations for improving traffic safety and mitigating the risks faced by law enforcement officers during such incidents.\n\nThe Role of Seatbelt Usage in Reducing Collision Severity\n\nThe study identified seatbelt usage as one of the most significant factors influencing the severity of police-involved collisions. Data showed that the absence of seatbelt use substantially increased the likelihood of severe injuries or fatalities. This underscores the urgent need for stricter enforcement of seatbelt compliance among police officers. While the general public is often reminded of seatbelt regulations, this study emphasizes that officers themselves must adhere to safety measures, especially during high-risk scenarios like emergency responses. Promoting seatbelt usage could save lives and reduce the impact of severe accidents.\n\nHow Location and Weather Conditions Contribute to Risk\n\nEnvironmental and situational factors also emerged as significant contributors to collision severity. Accidents occurring on interstate highways were far more likely to result in severe outcomes compared to those on local roads. Higher vehicle speeds and the complexity of traffic patterns on highways amplify the risks. Similarly, adverse weather conditions such as rain or snow were found to significantly increase the probability of severe accidents. These findings highlight the importance of understanding and preparing for the unique risks posed by specific environments and weather patterns, particularly for officers who spend much of their time on the road.\n\nElevated Risks During Emergency Responses\n\nThe study provided critical insights into the heightened risks officers face during emergency responses. When responding to calls or emergencies, officers encounter significantly higher chances of severe collisions. Factors such as high-speed driving, heightened stress levels, and potential distractions were identified as key contributors to these outcomes. The interplay of these elements makes emergency responses one of the most hazardous situations for law enforcement personnel. This research sheds light on the occupational dangers faced by police officers and emphasizes the need for focused training and policy interventions to mitigate these risks.\n\nRecommendations for a Safer Future\n\nBased on the findings, the researchers put forth several recommendations aimed at reducing the severity of police-involved collisions. Strengthening seatbelt compliance among officers is a critical step. Agencies must ensure that officers prioritize their safety by consistently wearing seatbelts, especially in high-risk scenarios. Additionally, specialized training programs for officers should focus on high-speed driving and emergency response skills. Such training could help officers manage stress, maintain situational awareness, and minimize distractions. The study also highlights the potential of advanced vehicle safety technologies, such as collision avoidance systems and speed limiters, to enhance safety during high-speed pursuits or emergency responses. Implementing these technologies in police vehicles could significantly reduce the risks faced by officers.\n\nFurthermore, the research underscores the value of predictive, data-driven approaches in addressing traffic safety challenges. By leveraging machine learning tools, law enforcement agencies can gain deeper insights into risk factors and develop targeted strategies to prevent accidents. Predictive models could help identify high-risk locations or scenarios, enabling agencies to allocate resources more effectively. The insights gained from this study are not limited to police-involved collisions; they also offer valuable lessons for broader traffic safety initiatives. The interplay of factors such as seatbelt usage, environmental conditions, and high-speed driving is relevant to various traffic safety challenges and can guide efforts to reduce accident severity across different contexts.\n\nToward Proactive Traffic Safety Measures\n\nThis study highlights the intricate interplay of factors influencing the severity of police-involved traffic collisions and underscores the potential of machine learning in uncovering these patterns. By integrating advanced technologies, policy changes, and behavioral interventions, law enforcement agencies can take proactive steps to address the identified risks. Ensuring seatbelt compliance, providing specialized training, and adopting vehicle safety technologies are vital components of a comprehensive strategy to enhance officer and public safety. The findings from this research pave the way for meaningful action, empowering agencies to reduce the frequency and severity of collisions, safeguard officers, and improve community safety."

            "article_content": "A researcher from Sweden\u2019s J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University has proposed a machine learning-based health monitoring approach for PV systems using infrared thermography.\n\nThe method is based on a hybrid local features-based approach to monitor panels, designed to resist scaling, noise, rotation, and haze. It achieved 98% training accuracy and 96.8% testing accuracy.\n\n\u201cExisting image processing-based machine learning approaches for health and fault diagnosis are often limited to specific datasets and suffer from issues such as sensitivity to rotation, scaling, noise, blurring, and haze,\u201d said Dr. Waqas Ahmed in his paper. \u201cThese approaches also face trade-offs between memory usage and accuracy. Deep learning-based approaches, while powerful, have high computational complexity, memory, and processing requirements, and are prone to underfitting and overfitting without strong datasets and careful hyperparameter tuning.\u201d\n\nThe novel method begins by capturing infrared thermographs with an infrared camera. In the preprocessing step, it assesses the quality of the thermographs, improving them with a dehazing algorithm and contrast adjustment in the grayscale channel if too much noise is present. Each thermograph is then divided into 5\u00d75 pixel sub-thermographs.\n\nLocal features are extracted from each sub-thermograph using Gaussian and nonlinear methods. The most significant 80% of these features are retained, while irrelevant and redundant values are removed. A k-means unsupervised clustering algorithm then reduces the feature vector to 300 elements per thermograph for optimal memory use.\n\n\u201cShallow classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), train the model on the feature vectors. A 5-fold cross-validation approach ensures proper model training,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA test vector from unseen thermographs is utilized to test the model\u2019s accuracy in classifying the PV panels into three health-based classes: healthy, hotspot, and faulty.\u201d\n\nThe novel method tested on a 44.24 kW crystalline silicon (c-Si) rooftop PV system in Lahore, Pakistan, consists of eight strings, each with 22 PV modules in series, totaling 5.28 kW. The system installs 376 PV modules, each rated at 240 W. Infrared thermographs were captured under ambient temperatures ranging from 32 C to 40 C, wind speeds of 6.9 m/s, and an irradiance level of 700 W/m\u00b2. The thermographs were randomly divided, with 80% used for training and 20% for validation.\n\n\u201cThe results of this study are particularly striking, with the method achieving a remarkable 98% training accuracy and 96.8% testing accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cAdditionally, the model\u2019s precision values of 92%, 100%, and 100%; recall values of 100%, 100%, and 90%; and F1 scores of 0.958, 1.0, and 0.947 for the faulty, healthy, and hotspot classes, respectively, indicate a high level of performance across these metrics.\u201d\n\nCompared to other artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in the literature, only the RB scale-invariant feature transform outperformed the proposed method, with a score of 98.66%. The strongest SURF scored 97.6%, deep neural features (pre-trained network) and shallow classifier scored 97%, RGB, LBP, mean HOG, and texture scored 96.8%, isolated CNN scored 96%, and Texture, HOG, and PCA scored 94.1%.\n\nAhmed presented the results in \u201cEnhancing solar PV reliability with hybrid local features and infrared thermography,\u201d which was recently published in Energy Reports."

            "article_content": "People take shelter in a metro station during an air raid alarm in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Friday.\n\nA Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, early Friday killed at least one person and wounded 12 other people, officials said. Moscow claimed it was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Russian soil using American-made weapons.\n\nAt least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine\u2019s air force said that it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said. Falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts.\n\n\u201cWe ask citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats, because there is very little time to find shelter,\u201d the air force said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the almost three years since Moscow\u2018s full invasion of Ukraine began, Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia\u2019s bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country\u2019s war effort.\n\nThe falling debris in Kyiv smashed into the city center, causing damage to around two dozen high-rise office buildings as well as the Catholic Church of St. Nicholas, a city landmark, and the Kyiv National Linguistic University.\n\nWhat may have been the blast wave from an intercepted low-flying missile also blew out windows or caused other damage at six embassies, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout five hours later, air raid sirens rang out again. Valeriia Dubova, a 32-year-old photographer, took cover with many others in a crowded subway station.\n\nShe said that in the morning attack, she sheltered at home and could feel the walls shaking from the blasts. Outside, fire engines and ambulances raced down city streets, she said.\n\n\u201cWith the naked eye you could see that many buildings, high-rises, were damaged, with glass shards on the ground, far from the explosion epicenter,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia\u2019s Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said.\n\nThat day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country\u2019s war effort.\n\nThe use of Western-supplied weapons to strike Russia has angered the Kremlin. Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time on Nov. 19 after Washington eased restrictions on their use.\n\nThat development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile, called Oreshnik, for the first time. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used a second time.\n\nNovikov writes for the Associated Press."

            "article_content": "Apparently believing that the more you repeat a lie the truer it becomes, President Biden recently quoted a Time article claiming that \u201cPresident Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history.\u201d\n\nThe Time article was little more than a setup designed to position Democrats to take credit for the inevitable Trump economic boom\u2014as I noted on these pages just four days before Biden repeated this audacious claim. Expect similar efforts from the Left as they attempt to rewrite economic history in hopes that our memories are weak enough\u2014and our gullibility strong enough\u2014to overcome economic reality.\n\nThe fact is, Biden is handing Trump an economy on the precipice of disaster. Thanks in large part to Biden\u2019s four-year deficit spending spree, the economy is shackled by an incomprehensibly huge $36 trillion in debt and $1 trillion less in Treasury cash on hand. That debt is growing exponentially, with interest alone now consuming over $1.1 trillion annually.\n\nPresident Biden speaks about the future of the American economy at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nAnd while Biden has been touting jobs numbers, those estimates keep getting revised down after wildly overoptimistic initial reports. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia just estimated that net job growth in the second quarter of this year was likely negative, meaning employment was falling.\n\n>>> Why Are Americans Still Feeling the Economic Squeeze?\n\nAdd in inflation that is once again accelerating by every measure, and you have some understanding of the debt-ridden, inflationary, dumpster-fire economy Trump is actually inheriting.\n\nSo, what is Biden talking about?\n\nOf course, much of Biden\u2019s speech was laced with false and misleading data woven into generalities about Bidenomics \u201cgrowing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up\u201d (which means absolutely nothing) and the evils of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d (which exists only in the minds of the economically illiterate). Biden actually blamed nonexistent trickle-down economics for creating \u201cbigger deficits.\u201d I guess he had to blame something.\n\nBut, seriously, bigger than what?\n\nThere has never been a bigger federal deficit than the one Biden is handing off\u2014other than in times of severe national crises. But we are not facing a severe national crisis. The pandemic is long over and we are not at war. Nonetheless, the federal debt is 121% of our gross national product\u2014the level at which it peaked during World War II!\n\nFor a more recent comparison, our annual federal deficit was just under $1 trillion in 2019 heading into the pandemic. In 2022, following the pandemic, it was about $1.4 trillion. For the most recent fiscal year (ending Sept. 30), Biden\u2019s runaway-train spending deficit hit a stunning $1.8 trillion, an 80% increase from pre-pandemic levels. Now that\u2019s big.\n\nFor some perspective, at over $1.1 trillion annually, interest alone on our federal debt now exceeds our entire pre-pandemic annual federal deficit.\n\nWhy? A feedback loop of excessive government spending. First, Biden\u2019s reckless spending regime set off inflation (as even the Democrats\u2019 economist emeritus Larry Summers warned it would). That inflation then induced the Fed to raise interest rates. Now Biden has the economy in a death spiral of higher debt levels and higher interest rates driving each other\u2014and his deficit spending spree continues.\n\nHow quickly are things spiraling out of control? Very quickly!\n\nIn October and November 2023, the federal deficit was $380 billion. For the same months this year, it's already $624 billion, a shocking 64% increase over last year with no plan in place to constrain it. None.\n\nThis is the actual economy \u201cTrump is receiving.\u201d Rather than the \u201cstrongest economy in modern history,\u201d it\u2019s a house of cards built on federal debt, creating what is one of\u2014if not the\u2014most dangerous economies in modern history.\n\nSo, what is Biden\u2019s proposed solution? Piling the ridiculous atop the absurd, Biden stated that it is his \u201cprofound hope that the new administration will preserve and build on [his] progress.\u201d He actually said this.\n\nWhy? Well, according to Biden, things are getting better as inflation has declined \u201cto pre-pandemic levels\u201d while \u201cwages have increased.\u201d Of course, as most Americans know, neither statement is true.\n\n>>> National Debt Is a Burden on Every American\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first term, the average year-over-year inflation rate was 1.9%. When Biden took office in January 2021, annual inflation was 1.4%. Following its June 2021 peak at 9%, the inflation rate under Biden never declined to the Fed\u2019s 2% target\u2014let alone \u201cpre-pandemic levels\u201d\u2014and is currently increasing by literally every measure, with inflation around 3% or higher becoming the new normal.\n\nAs for wages going up, keep in mind that inflation is a tax. So, while the average American\u2019s weekly paycheck was a record high $1,221.42 in November, that paycheck could purchase $176.86 less than nominally smaller average paychecks when Biden took office. This is because real weekly wages (the number on your paycheck minus inflation) are down 3% since Biden took the economic reins. That is not what most people consider an increase.\n\nReal wages were up 6.8% under Trump. Now that was an increase.\n\nSo, with crocodile tears, Biden bemoans the possibility that we could \u201cbackslide to an economy that benefited those at the top, while working people and the middle-class struggle\u201d to get \u201ca fair share of growth.\u201d Does anyone honestly believe that inflation-strapped working- and middle-class Americans are getting a fair share under Bidenomics? The people benefiting in today\u2019s economy are those who own stocks, interest-bearing securities or real estate. In other words, \u201cthose at the top.\u201d That is what Bidenomics produced.\n\nAs a reminder for the outgoing president, in 2019 under Trump, the unemployment rate declined to historic lows for every race and both sexes, family incomes hit historic highs, the poverty rate hit an historic low, and income inequality declined\u2014all with inflation below 2%.\n\nHonestly, the misery of \u201cthe strongest economy in modern history\u201d cannot end soon enough."

            "article_content": "With a newly installed Windows PC, only a few system services and programs start. The resource requirements are correspondingly low and the operating system responds quickly.\n\nThis changes over time, which is mainly due to the additional software installed. Programs and services that start automatically after Windows logon lead to delays. The startup time of the system increases and it takes longer and longer for the desktop to respond to mouse clicks or for a program to start.\n\nHow noticeable the system slowdowns are depends on the overall performance of the computer and the performance of the hard drive or SSD.\n\nAs a general rule, a program that is only installed but does not start automatically cannot slow down Windows. However, this only applies if there is enough space available for temporary files or downloading updates, for example.\n\nTo avoid mistakes, you should therefore never fill drives close to their capacity limit. With both hard drives and SSDs, too little free space also affects speed for other reasons (see box \u201cMaking the most of hard drives and SSDs\u201d).\n\nAs in real life, tidying up is also a regular task in Windows. Removing superfluous files ensures that there is always enough free space on the drive. You should also remove unused programs, move particularly large files from the SSD to an existing hard drive and deactivate autostart if it is not required.\n\nget windows 11 pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro Price When Reviewed: 199.99 Best Prices Today:\n\nThe Windows on-board tools can provide valuable services here, while additional tools offer more and advanced functions.\n\nHowever, there is no simple one-click solution. Ultimately, the tools can only collect what you can possibly delete. After that, the responsibility lies with you. In this article, we provide decision-making aids and show you where you should be careful and what you should not delete.\n\nNote: The tips in this article apply to Windows 11, but some of the functions are also available in Windows 10.\n\n1. Check memory utilization\n\nCall up Settings \u2014 for example, with the key combination Win+I or a search in the Start menu. Go to System > Memory. You will see an informative overview with the total utilization of the system drive as well as the storage space used by temporary files and installed apps.\n\nUnder Other, Windows displays the space occupied by files that cannot be specified in more detail. Clicking on Show more categories takes you to a list of other areas, such as Documents, Pictures and Videos. You can see how much storage space is occupied in each case.\n\nClicking on one of the categories shows detailed information:\n\nOther shows some of the largest folders on the drive. You can open the folders by clicking on them in Windows Explorer and then decide whether something can be deleted.\n\nshows some of the largest folders on the drive. You can open the folders by clicking on them in Windows Explorer and then decide whether something can be deleted. Installed apps leads to Apps > Installed apps. The view can be sorted by size or installation date. You can use the three-dot menu to uninstall programs that you no longer need.\n\nleads to Apps > Installed apps. The view can be sorted by size or installation date. You can use the three-dot menu to uninstall programs that you no longer need. Temporary files shows a list of areas in which files that may no longer be required are stored. After a Windows upgrade, Previous Windows installation(s) appears in the list. This is the folder C:\\Windows.old. You can remove this if everything is running smoothly and you no longer want to return to the previous Windows installation. Windows automatically deletes the folder after about a month.\n\nUnder System > Storage > Temporary files there is a tick in front of all entries that you can delete without hesitation. To do this, click on Remove files. You can also tick the boxes in front of Downloads and Recycle bin.\n\nBut be careful: Downloads relates to your personal download folder. If you do not want to lose the downloaded files, do not tick this box. For Recycle Bin, you should make sure that there are no unintentionally deleted files in the recycle bin. Open the recycle bin by double-clicking on the desktop icon and check the contents.\n\nOnly delete if necessary: You can delete everything under Temporary files, but this is not useful in every case. The \u201cthumbnails,\u201d for example, are preview images that Windows saves in db files in the folder C:\\Users[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer.\n\nThis allows Windows Explorer to load the preview images more quickly. After some time, the db files also contain preview images whose originals have long since been deleted. Regular cleaning therefore seems advisable.\n\nOn the other hand, the files do not usually take up much memory space and if you delete everything, Windows Explorer has to rebuild the cache of the preview images. Although this does not take long, it is unnecessary.\n\nThe situation is similar with temporary internet files. Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser saves the elements of web pages in a cache, allowing it to display them more quickly. If the temporary internet files are deleted, it will take longer to load pages on regularly visited websites.\n\nAs a rule, the Edge cache does not occupy more than 1GB, which means that not much storage space can be freed up. Other web browsers use their own cache, which can be emptied in the respective programs (see point 7).\n\nStorage overview: In the Settings under System > Storage you can find out how the hard drive is used. Click on the categories for further details. Foundry\n\n2. Windows 11 cleanup functions\n\nIn Windows 11, go to System > Storage in Settings and click on Cleanup recommendations. You will see the storage space occupied by downloads and the recycle bin as well as Previous Windows installation(s), if still available.\n\nTick the areas in which you want to delete files and click on the [X] GB cleanup button. However, this will not only delete the selected files, but also other temporary files. Click on Advanced options to find out about the effects.\n\nThe settings correspond to those under System > Storage > Temporary files, but the current selection is added, for example Recycle bin. If you consider it necessary, you can remove the tick from some areas before cleaning.\n\nThe list you get after clicking on Large or unused files is more interesting. You will see particularly large files and files used a long time ago that you may be able to delete. The list under Unused apps can also be helpful. However, only programs that you have installed via the Microsoft Store are displayed.\n\nAn alternative for Windows 10 and 11 is Iobit Uninstaller.\n\nUnder Programs, go to Rarely used to display the applications that are rarely used. The list can serve as a guide, but is usually not complete and sometimes shows inaccurate dates. However, it is not possible to do better than this because Windows does not reliably log the start time of a program.\n\nWhat can be deleted? The \u201ccleanup recommendations\u201d point to obvious areas such as the recycle bin. However, you can also have large files and unused apps listed. Foundry\n\n3. Free up storage space\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do all the tidying up yourself, you can leave the task to Windows. In the Settings, go to System > Storage and set the switch behind Storage Sense to On.\n\nThe service can be configured by clicking on Storage Sense. A tick is already placed in front of Keep Windows running smoothly by automatically cleaning up temporary system and app files.\n\nAutomatic user content cleanup is also switched on, but is only activated when required due to the default setting During low free disk space (default). However, you can also set a schedule for the clean-up with Daily, Every week, or Every month.\n\nAn interval can be specified under Delete files from recycle bin if they have been there for over:. The default setting is 30 days. If you are worried that there may still be files in the recycle bin after 30 days that you would like to restore, it is better to set Never and empty the recycle bin manually.\n\nThe same applies to the setting for the download folder, where the default setting is Never. Only if you are sure that this folder will never contain files that you still need should you set it to 30 days or 60 days, for example.\n\nUsers of the Microsoft cloud storage Onedrive will find a useful setting under Locally available cloud content. With the default setting of 30 days, Onedrive automatically changes the status of the files in the synchronized folder to Available online if they have not been opened within this period.\n\nThis means that the files no longer take up any space on the drive. If you open one of these files afterwards, it will be available on the device again. Files that you have marked as Always keep on this device are not affected by this setting. If you do not want Onedrive to change the status of the files, set Never.\n\n\u201cStorage optimization\u201d automatically creates more space on the system drive. You can specify what is deleted and when. IDG\n\n4. Relocate standard storage locations\n\nIf your PC has an additional SSD or hard drive, you can use this as alternative storage. An external USB drive is also suitable, but must be permanently connected depending on how it is used.\n\nFurther reading: The best SSDs\n\nYou can simply move personal files to the other drive using Windows Explorer. However, Windows also offers options to change the storage location of default folders.\n\nIn the Settings, go to System > Storage, click on Advanced storage settings and then on Where new content is saved.\n\nAs the name suggests, the settings only apply to new files. To save space on the system drive, you can specify the second drive under New apps will save to:, for example E:\\. Click on Apply for the setting to take effect.\n\nYou can also select the second drive under New documents will save to:, whereby Windows creates the folder E:[user name]\\Documents. If you now save a document in a word processor or the Windows Notepad editor, the new storage location is preset.\n\nHowever, this procedure has a disadvantage: In Windows Explorer, Documents still leads to the previous folder on drive C:\\. An overview of files from both locations is provided by the libraries, which Windows Explorer does not display by default.\n\nTo change this, go to Options in the three-dot menu and switch to the View tab. Under Navigation pane, tick the box next to Show libraries. If you then go to Libraries > Documents, you will see the files from both folders.\n\nMoving personal folders completely: Because of the disadvantage mentioned above, it makes more sense to move folders such as Documents, Pictures, and Downloads completely to another drive.\n\nFirst create the destination folder, for example E:[username]\\Downloads. Right-click on the desired folder in Windows Explorer, go to Properties and then to the Path tab.\n\nClick on Move and select the previously created folder. After clicking on OK, confirm with Yes that Windows should move the existing files to the new location. In Windows Explorer, under Start or in the navigation area, open the folders with the previous content but with the new storage location.\n\n5. Change storage location for apps\n\nA conventionally installed desktop program is located by default in the folder C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files (x86), which Windows Explorer displays as C:\\Program.\n\nIf space becomes tight, programs cannot simply be moved to another drive, as the paths to components and settings in the Windows registry are then no longer correct. However, you can usually specify a user-defined destination on a different drive when reinstalling programs in the setup program.\n\nThis is particularly recommended for an SSD with little storage space and if a program requires a lot of storage space, for example a PC game. However, the loss of speed when starting from a slower hard drive must be accepted.\n\nApps from the Microsoft Store can also be moved to another drive without reinstalling them. In Settings, go to Apps > Installed apps and click on Move in the three-dot menu for the desired app.\n\nSelect the target drive and click on Move. If the menu item is not available, it is a desktop application. The pre-installed system apps cannot be moved, which is why the menu item is grayed out.\n\nApps from the Microsoft Store can be moved to another drive. This option is not available for pre-installed system apps. IDG\n\nMaking optimum use of hard drives and SSDs Due to its physical structure, a conventional magnetic hard drive delivers data at different speeds. The average transfer rate of a current hard disk can be 200MB per second, for example. In the outer area of the magnetic disk, the read/write heads can capture more sectors in the same amount of time than in the inner area due to rotation and circumference. With a freshly installed Windows, the system files are located in the fast outer area; what is added later is located in the increasingly slower inner areas. The hard disk can reduce this effect by using a cache. The data first ends up in the fast cache and only then on the hard drive. The transfer rate is gradually reduced by the limited size of the cache as you copy many small or a few large files to the hard drive. In the course of using a hard drive, files are deleted and new ones are created. The drive\u2019s controller uses the next free blocks to store the data. If a file does not fit into the area of a contiguous block, the next one is used, which may be a long way away. The read/write heads then require longer paths, which reduces the transfer rate and increases access times. The performance of the hard drive can be improved by defragmentation. The files are reorganized in blocks that are as contiguous as possible, which speeds up access. The \u201cOptimize drives\u201d defragmenter from the Windows accessories (Win R, dfrgui) does this automatically once a week by default. The Windows defragmenter seems to do its job perfectly, as it regularly certifies that the drives have a fragmentation level of \u201c0%.\u201d This may even be more or less true for PCs in average use. However, large files are often heavily fragmented, which increases as the hard drive fills up because the contiguous, free blocks become fewer and fewer. This particularly affects games and the usually very large virtual hard disks of virtualization software. If this applies to you, first make sure there is enough free space on the hard drive. Only then can a defragmenter work optimally. A suitable program for this is Defraggler. After starting, select the hard drive and click on \u201cCheck.\u201d If the program shows severe fragmentation, click on \u201cDefrag.\u201d As the process takes a long time for large hard drives, you can also selectively process individual files. Switch to the \u201cFile list\u201d tab. Click on the \u201cFragments\u201d column header to sort the list by heavily fragmented files. The selected file can be optimized via the context menu item \u201cSelected defragmentation.\u201d Special features for SSDs: SSDs do not need to be defragmented because the memory accesses are direct and the position of the memory cells is irrelevant. This results in short access times, which means that Windows and programs start faster. The transfer rate is approximately 2 to 4 times higher than with hard disks, which also has a positive effect on overall performance. However, you should also regularly free up storage space on SSDs. If the drive is filled to the brim, the controller on the device does not have enough free cells to organize the memory. The service life of an SSD increases if memory cells are not rewritten too often and there are enough spare lines. With an average-use PC, however, there is no need to worry about the internal functions of the SSD. The manufacturers reserve an area for over-provisioning as standard, to which the user has no access. Depending on the model and total capacity, this reduces the actual usable memory by 7 to 10 percent. This ensures that even with a well-filled SSD there are still free cells available. On SSDs for server use with many write accesses, a larger area is usually reserved for over-provisioning. Some manufacturers also offer tools with which the reserve memory can be increased, for example Samsung Magican. However, this is only useful for servers. Defraggler attempts to move files into areas that are as contiguous as possible. The function can also be used specifically for individual, particularly large files. IDG\n\n6. Clean up discs\n\nThe disk clean-up function has been included with Windows 98, but the tool\u2019s days are numbered. It is still included in Windows 11 24H2, but Microsoft already recommends using the functions in the Settings (see points 1 to 3).\n\nHowever, if you wish, you can still use Disk Cleanup. However, this does not offer any particular advantage because the functions are now fully available in the settings under System > Storage.\n\nIf you still want to use Disk Cleanup, start the tool by searching in the Start menu or by pressing Win+R, entering cleanmgr and clicking on OK. If there are several hard drives, select the drive that you want to clean up, usually the system drive, C:. Click on OK to confirm.\n\nAfter the analysis, tick the areas in which you want to delete something. For more information, click on a line and read the description. There is nothing you cannot delete without hesitation. However, the instructions for the recycle bin and temporary internet files from point 1 also apply here.\n\nBy default, Disk Cleanup only handles user files. If you click on the Clean up system files button and select the system drive, additional options are available to you. For example, Previous Windows installation(s) (if available), Log files for Windows upgrades, and Device driver packages.\n\nOn the More options tab, you can also click on Clean up under System restore and shadow copies. This deletes all restore points except for the last one, which can save several gigabytes.\n\nConfigure profile: If you want to use disk cleanup regularly for certain tasks, you can save the settings in a profile. If system files are also to be deleted, the configuration must be carried out with administrative rights, otherwise the rights of the standard user are sufficient.\n\nWith the saved settings, you can start Disk Cleanup without further configuration and delete everything at once.\n\nStep 1: Use the Start menu to search for cmd. Right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.\n\nStep 2: Type cleanmgr /sageset:1 and confirm with the Enter key. The number \u201c1\u201d is the serial number of the profile. You can enter any number up to four digits to save multiple profiles.\n\nStep 3: Tick all the desired options. Click on OK to save the settings.\n\nStep 4: Right-click on a free area on the desktop. Select New > Shortcut from the menu. In the input field, type\n\ncleanmgr /sagerun:1\n\nand click on Next. Enter a meaningful name and confirm with Finish.\n\nStep 5: Right-click on the shortcut, go to Properties and switch to the Shortcut tab. Click on Advanced and tick the box next to Run as administrator. Click OK and then click OK again.\n\nIf you now start Disk Cleanup by double-clicking on the shortcut, all configured tasks will be processed automatically.\n\nDisk Cleanup is considered outdated in Windows 11. However, it is still available in Windows 11 24H2 and can be used as usual. Foundry\n\n7. Delete browser data\n\nOne program that constantly generates data on the hard drive is the web browser. Browsers do not display websites, images, or videos directly, but first save the content, including images and JavaScript files, in the cache memory.\n\nDepending on how a website is configured, data is preferably loaded quickly from the cache or updated via the internet connection.\n\nAs the cache improves the performance of the browser, it is not recommended to delete it. Browsers usually use memory space moderately and do not use more than necessary. However, you should delete the cache if there are errors in the page display, for example.\n\nIn Microsoft Edge, click on the three-dot menu at the top right and select Settings. Continue in the navigation area on the left-hand side and Privacy, search, and services.\n\nUnder Delete browser data, click on Choose what to clear. Under Time range, you can select a time period for which you want to delete elements. Under Cached images and data you can see how much memory the browser is using.\n\nRemove the tick in front of the areas in which you do not want to delete anything. It is better to exclude Cookies and other site data. Cookies are required, for example, for navigation on websites and also for automatic login.\n\nYou should also be careful with Passwords and Autofill form data. If you have saved data via the browser, this will be lost if you tick the box here. After checking the settings, click on Clear now.\n\nOther browsers offer similar options. Firefox users, for example, go to Privacy & Security in the Settings menu. Under Cookies and website data, click on Remove data. Remove the tick in front of Cookies and website data (recommended) and click on Clear to delete only the cache memory.\n\nBrowsers store numerous files on the hard drive, which makes websites load faster. However, in the event of errors or for data protection reasons, the files should be deleted. Foundry\n\n8. Optimize autostart\n\nMany programs install services or nest themselves in the notification area next to the clock. This is practical for some applications \u2014 for example, if they regularly display important information or report available updates.\n\nHowever, programs that you rarely use should be removed from the autostart. You can do this using Windows\u2019 on-board tools via the Task Manager, which you can start most quickly by pressing the key combination Ctrl+Shift+Esc.\n\nOn the Autostart tab, programs can be removed from Autostart via the Deactivate context menu item. Nothing is deleted in the process. You can reactivate the programs at any time.\n\nIf you want to analyze all autostart ramps, use the Autoruns tool. You can deactivate services and autostart entries and reactivate them later.\n\nThe tool also offers an analysis via virustotal.com to determine whether malware is present.\n\nIf possible, you should uninstall programs that you do not use. This frees up space on your hard drive and improves security. However, the uninstall routines are often not thorough.\n\nIf you want to remove software with less residue, use tools such as Geek Uninstaller or Iobit Uninstaller.\n\nThe cleanup functions in Windows 11 already do a good job. However, additional tools allow a different view of the situation and work more thoroughly. Sometimes too thoroughly, however. Therefore, familiarize yourself sufficiently with the functions before you delete something irretrievably.\n\nBleachbit is one of the tools that can be used to delete a great deal. Close all applications, especially the web browser, before starting the tool. For each category, such as Firefox, Microsoft Office or System, there is a brief description of the options. Only tick the options if you are aware of the effects.\n\nIf in doubt, click on Preview first. Bleachbit will then show you which files are affected. Only after this check do you click on Final cleanup.\n\nAnother tool for the same purpose is Ccleaner. It is somewhat clearer than Bleachbit, but offers more settings and explanatory texts.\n\nYou can also use the Ccenhancer extension, whose rule sets you can set up via Download latest. This will significantly extend the scope of the main program\u2019s program recording.\n\nCcleaner is by far the most popular software for cleaning up the operating system and installed applications.\n\nAmong other things, it offers tools for clearing out the autostart, analyzing hard drive contents, searching for duplicates, managing browser plugins, and securely overwriting free hard drive space in order to delete any file fragments.\n\nTreesize Free and Windirstat help to analyze the drives. These tools detect large files that you may no longer need and want to delete. Everything is actually a particularly fast search tool, but can also be used to sort the file list by size and thus identify space wasters.\n\nTidying up the registry usually does nothing. Nevertheless, you can use a tool such as Wise Registry Cleaner to analyze the registry. If you change anything here, you should first create a backup copy, for example with the Registry Backup tool.\n\nFiles or folders cannot be deleted if the access rights are missing. Use PC-WELT MyRights to add a new context menu item to Windows Explorer, which appears after a right mouse click while holding down the Shift key. Click on Take ownership to obtain full access rights.\n\nWinsxs: The supposedly huge folder When examining your hard drive, you may come across the \u201cWinsxs\u201d folder in the Windows directory. In the properties, Windows Explorer often shows a size of several gigabytes. It contains important program libraries that are used by many applications, as well as system and exe files in different versions. Some of the supposedly numerous files are hard links, i.e. special file links that refer to the corresponding files under \u201cWindows System32,\u201d for example. The actual size is therefore sometimes several GB smaller. Never delete files from the \u201cWinsxs\u201d folder yourself. Doing so can permanently damage the function of the system or applications. Windows regularly cleans up the folder automatically via the task scheduler and removes files that are no longer required.\n\nFoldersizes\n\nFoldersizes\n\nAnalyze partitions and search for large folders\n\nWhen tidying up your hard drive, you often don\u2019t know where to start. Foldersizes helps you by organizing folders by size and displaying this list as a pie chart, bar chart, or map. You can search for space-wasters down to file level with a click of the mouse.\n\nIn contrast to Windirstat, for example, Foldersizes offers a wider range of functions. The disadvantages: The tool is only available in English and must be licensed for 30 US dollars after a trial period of 15 days.\n\nLargest File Finder\n\nLargest File Finder\n\nCompile a list of the largest files\n\nIf you are wondering where all the free space on your new SSD has gone, the freeware Largest File Finder will help you. You don\u2019t need to install the tool, instead you can start searching for the 100 largest files on the entire disc or in the specified folder immediately after double-clicking on its EXE file. At the end, it compiles a list organized by size, which you can use as a guide if you want to create space as easily and efficiently as possible.\n\nDuplicate Media Finder\n\nDuplicate Media Finder\n\nFind and delete all duplicate files\n\nDespite its name, Duplicate Media Finder Free not only searches for media files such as videos, audio files, and images, but also for duplicate files in general. It also finds duplicates that have a different name than the original, which is referred to here as the \u201cmaster file.\u201d The free program is only available in the Microsoft Store. It is a slimmed-down version of a much more comprehensive, paid-for software, which is available for a good $40.\n\nClonespy\n\nClonespy\n\nFind duplicate files and delete them individually\n\nAn alternative to Duplicate Media Finder is Clonespy. The English-language tool immediately indicates when it encounters a duplicate file and, if desired, marks the older versions or the versions with the longer file or folder name. Clonespy is also able to find files with the same name but different contents or to compare files in two folders \u2014 for example on a local and a shared network drive.\n\nRevo Uninstaller\n\nRevo Uninstaller\n\nRemove programs cleanly and without leaving any residue\n\nRevo Uninstaller is the reference in the category of free uninstall programs: The program works very reliably, first starts the uninstall routine of the respective software, and then scans the registry and file systems for any remnants.\n\nThe uninstaller also includes tools for cleaning up browsers, Microsoft Office, Windows, the registry, and Autostart. A special feature is the hunting mode, which allows you to remove programs without a functioning uninstaller.\n\nIobit Uninstaller\n\nIobit Uninstaller\n\nConvenient uninstaller with many extras\n\nIobit\u2019s uninstaller works in exactly the same way as Revo\u2019s uninstaller, but offers a deletion mode for selected programs in one go without prompting. It lists apps from the hardware manufacturer, recently installed programs as well as oversized and rarely used applications, and can also delete browser extensions and Windows apps. You can use an install monitor to log the installation of new software and remove the programs cleanly later.\n\nPrivazer\n\nRemove superfluous ballast\n\nThe free Privazer program carries out a deep scan for user traces on your drives, USB sticks, network drives, and much more. The first step is to select which storage medium is to be analyzed. Then specify which files you want to search for.\n\nAfter starting Privazer, a wizard will help you with the configuration with recommendations. Then start the search by clicking on OK. In the search results, you can click on categories such as Internet activities or Cookies to obtain information on the files concerned. To be on the safe side, you should tick the box next to Create a restore point.\n\nIf problems occur, the deleted files can then be restored. Finally, click on Clean. The deletion of cookies, residual traces of old files, or temporary files is intended to counteract the slowing down of your computer due to data ballast.\n\nThe Spybot \u2013 Search & Destroy freeware scans the system for various types of spyware, malware, dialers, keyloggers, Trojans and other threats. IDG\n\nSpybot\n\nRemove unwanted software\n\nSpybot \u2013 Search & Destroy is a long-established product for searching for browser tracking cookies and unwanted software. This does not necessarily have to be malware in the true sense of the word. Sometimes, however, programs install additional software that you do not want to use.\n\nAfter clicking on Scan system, the tool scans the drives and displays the findings. Check the results, uncheck the boxes next to entries that you do not want to delete, and click on Fix selected.\n\n7-Zip\n\n7-Zip\n\nArchive files and compress them to save space\n\nSpring cleaning is a good opportunity to go through your own file archive and move older or rarely used files to an archive. To save space, you should compress the files. If you want to protect confidential documents, the archive can also be encrypted and secured with a password.\n\nAll this is done for you by the 7-Zip compression program, which is free open source software. You can also use it to copy or move the archives to new folders.\n\nFaststone Image Viewer\n\nFaststone Image Viewer\n\nManage and edit photos\n\nMany users accumulate thousands or even more photos over time, which makes searching for a specific motif much more difficult. Faststone\u2019s Image Viewer shows you all the images in a folder in a preview and offers to convert them into a range of other commonly used formats. The software also has simple editing tools on board, can create a slideshow, and copy and move the image files collectively to other folders.\n\nDigikam\n\nDigikam\n\nManage and search for photos professionally\n\nSoftware for managing large photo collections is usually expensive and therefore only of interest to professional photographers. Digikam is an exception to this rule. The program is open source and free of charge. Digikam is based on a database engine that offers extensive search options according to the date and place the photo was taken as well as other Exif data. This additional information can also be edited. But beware: Digikam is a professional program, which is why it takes time to get to grips with its operation.\n\nPowerlame\n\nPowerlame\n\nSearch and convert MP3 files\n\nAs with photos, the problem with MP3 music is that hundreds or even thousands of files gradually accumulate. The desired song is then difficult to find, especially if you don\u2019t have the title or artist on hand. In these cases, Powerlame can help.\n\nThe tool also reads large MP3 collections and offers a search mask for ID3 tags. It can also rip CDs, adjust the volume of all MP3s, and convert them into WAV files or search for the corresponding CD covers.\n\nMedia Monkey\n\nMedia Monkey\n\nAdd missing data to song files\n\nFor the search in the ID3 tags to be successful, the fields must also be filled in. This is usually not the case with self-ripped MP3s in particular. Media Monkey helps you to enter information about a song such as artist, title, album or composer. Among other things, the program automatically searches for the album, downloads the cover, and enters the data in the tag fields. The tool is also an excellent player that creates playlists and offers an equalizer.\n\nSumo\n\nSumo\n\nCheck installed software for updates\n\nYou should not only regularly clear your Windows PC of junk data, but also make sure that the installed programs are always up to date. Updates not only eliminate software errors and close security gaps, they often also bring new functions. The freeware Sumo scans the existing applications, lists the outdated programs, and takes you to a download site for the update. The paid Pro version can also take care of the installation for you.\n\nDriver Easy\n\nDriver Easy\n\nUpdate drivers to the latest version\n\nAs a rule, Windows provides the appropriate drivers for all hardware components of the PC and also updates them. However, these are often slimmed-down versions without the extended functionality offered by the drivers from the manufacturer\u2019s website.\n\nDriver Easy makes it possible to check the existing driver equipment, point out newer versions, and install them. The free software version only allows manual installation and has a limited download speed.\n\nIobit Driver Booster Free\n\nIobit Driver Booster Free\n\nDetailed driver information\n\nThere is also a free version of Iobit\u2019s Driver Booster. This is limited in the display of outdated drivers and refers to other products from this manufacturer in several places. However, the installation of new driver versions works automatically and quickly enough after a mouse click. In comparison with Driver Easy, Driver Booster found more and more up-to-date driver versions for our test PC. The Pro version offers an automatic update and the automatic creation of restore points.\n\nCore Temp\n\nCore Temp\n\nMeasure and display CPU temperature\n\nIt\u2019s not just in spring that you should take a look at your computer\u2019s hardware. This also includes checking the processor temperature: If it\u2019s too high, this is often a sign that the cooler is dusty, the fan has become loose, or the heatsink is no longer firmly attached to the processor.\n\nAlthough a protective circuit prevents the CPU from burning out, this lowers the processor clock and slows down the computer. The freeware Core Temp shows you the current temperature of each individual CPU core.\n\nGPU-Z\n\nGPU-Z\n\nAll information about the graphics card at a glance\n\nA PC\u2019s graphics chip can also overheat and should therefore be checked regularly. The freeware GPU-Z is suitable for this purpose: It determines the model of the graphics card or chip during installation and retrieves the corresponding data from a database on the Internet. A click on Lookup takes you to the corresponding website. In the Sensors tab, you will find the current GPU measurement values, including the clock frequency, temperature, fan speed, memory utilization, and power consumption.\n\nHD Tune\n\nHD Tune\n\nCheck the temperature and status of the hard drive\n\nIf your computer\u2019s hard drive or SSD fails, important data is often lost. You should therefore keep an eye on its condition and check it regularly. With the HD Tune tool, you can perform a benchmark test, check the sectors for errors, and read out the current temperature.\n\nIf the values deteriorate, you can intervene at an early stage, back up your data or transfer it to a new SSD straight away. The paid version HD Tune Pro provides further benchmarks and information."

            "article_content": "In recent years, the cloud computing landscape has undergone a seismic shift. After fully embracing the potential of public cloud services, many companies are reevaluating their strategies and shifting workloads back to on-premises infrastructures.\n\nThis trend, known as cloud repatriation, is driven by rising costs and increasing complexities in public cloud environments. More and more repatriation projects are underway as enterprises continue to receive exorbitant cloud bills. Many enterprises now realize that the unexpectedly high costs of cloud services are unsustainable in the long term.\n\nGEICO has made headlines for its decision to repatriate numerous workloads back to on-premises solutions. In a recent interview, Rebecca Weekly, the vice president of platform and infrastructure engineering, said the initial goal of moving to the cloud was to reduce costs and complexity, but it ultimately had the opposite effect."

You\u2019re probably not going to be prepared for this, so hold onto your hats.\n\nWhile we all know that Gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) is a little different to other gens, namely because they seem to be swearing off what others would call as right of passages, such as getting drunk all of the time as a teenager.\n\nAdvert\n\nBut they are also taking things slower in the bedroom department too.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re not partying and hooking up with people?\n\nIt turns out that Gen Zers are taking things a bit slower in the bedroom (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAnyway, it has been reported that his generations have been engaging in less sex than other generations, with less partners and less commitments.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe report is based on information from over 3,310 people who use the Feeld dating app and it has been collected from those living in 71 different countries.\n\nThe age range it has looked into is pretty varied too, as you\u2019ll see data from anyone aged between 18 to 75.\n\nSo, you\u2019re about to know what people your grandparents your age is doing with each other.\n\nDrumroll please.\n\nAdvert\n\nGen Z typically had had sex three times in the last month, while Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen X (born between 1965 and 1980) had sex five times.\n\nMillenials and Gen X seemed to have the most sex (Getty Stock Image)\n\nBut Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) were right on parr with Gen Z when it came to sex, and also reported having sex three times in the last month.\n\nHowever, just because Gen Z is less likely to sh*g, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re vanilla.\n\nAdvert\n\nAccording to Dr Justin Lehmiller, the lead author in the study, 55 percent of Gen Z discovered a new kink since joining the dating app, and 49 percent of Millennials also reported the same thing.\n\nOn the lower scale, 33 percent of Gen X said they found new kinks, while 33 percent of Boomers agreed.\n\nThe study said: \u201cThere are at least two explanations for this. One is simply that older adults have had more time to learn and discover what they enjoy about sex, so they may have already uncovered their kinks.\n\nMany have found new kinks since joining dating apps (Getty Stock Image)\n\n\u201cHowever, the other is that it also appears to be the case that younger adults today have a greater overall interest in kink than older adults, which may create greater openness to exploring and learning about one's kinks.\u201d\n\nThe study also believes that Boomers and Gen Z are more alike than originally thought.\n\nDr Lehmiller shared: \u201cGen Z and Boomers exhibited nearly identical sexual frequencies, suggesting that both the youngest and oldest adults are having the least sex.\n\n\u201cAlso, nearly half of Gen Z reported that they were single, compared to only one-\ufb01fth of Millennials, Gen X, and Boomers.\u201d\n\nThe study went on to say that sexuality and relationships \u2018have always existed on a continuum\u2019 which \u2018will only evolve and expand further as Gen Z and future generations continue their pursuit of sexual and relational self-discovery\u2019."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

            "article_content": "People have been fascinated by Neanderthals ever since we discovered their bones in a German cave in the mid-19th century. Their stocky bodies and huge heads give us a fun-house-mirror glimpse into the evolutionary road we might have traveled. Even though DNA research has shown that all modern-day human populations have a little Neanderthal in them, we still view our Neanderthal cousins as the black sheep lineage of the Homo genus.\n\nHere's a look at 10 things we've learned about our closest known relatives \u2014 and, by extension, ourselves \u2014 this year.\n\nRelated: Lucy's last day: What the iconic fossil reveals about our ancient ancestor's last hours\n\n1. Neanderthals had a keen sense of fashion.\n\nNeanderthals lived in Europe, so they had to protect their bodies from frostbite and other cold-related problems. Although no frozen caveman clothing has ever been discovered, archaeologists think Neanderthals wore clothing to help maintain their core body temperature.\n\nCircumstantial evidence of Neanderthal clothing includes a stone tool with residue from hide scraping, pointed bone awls used to punch holes in hides, and a twisted bit of cord, possibly from shoes or fabric.\n\nThe kind of clothing Neanderthals wore is still being debated, but it was likely more elaborate than a loincloth. If Neanderthals were wearing parkas, pants and boots, they were probably the first fashionistas, researchers told Live Science.\n\n2. Neanderthals cared for their comrades with disabilities.\n\nA reconstruction of a Neanderthal family in a cave (Image credit: Bjanka Kadic via Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nA fragment of a Neanderthal child's ear bone suggests she had Down syndrome and that she was cared for by her community. In a study published in June in the journal Science Advances , researchers identified a 6-year-old Neanderthal child nicknamed \"Tina\" in a cave in Spain. Tina's ear bone, which dated to between 273,000 and 146,000 years ago, has a shape associated with Down syndrome, as well as other abnormalities.\n\nAlthough no genetic work has conclusively shown that Tina had Down syndrome, she nevertheless would have required care from her community to survive, according to the researchers, since her ear bone also suggested she had major hearing loss and vertigo. The finding suggests that other Neanderthals were helping her and her mother out of a sense of altruism.\n\n3. Neanderthals created an early \"glue factory.\"\n\nA Neanderthal man curates a fire in the dark (Image credit: MARCO BERTORELLO via Getty Images)\n\nAs far back as 65,000 years ago, Neanderthals on the Iberian Peninsula were skilled engineers who made sticky tar in a precisely controlled environment. In the December issue of the journal Quaternary Science Reviews , researchers detailed their discovery of a hearth in a cave floor in Gibraltar. The hearth was full of charcoal and plant resin and was likely heated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) to produce the gooey glue, which would have been used to fashion weapons such as spears.\n\nThe findings show Neanderthals were both very intelligent and able to collaborate to produce complex tools.\n\n4. Modern humans and Neanderthals buried their dead differently.\n\nBurial of a Neanderthal at La Chapelle-aux-Saints, France (Image credit: DEA / A. DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini via Getty Images)\n\nPutting a dead body in a hole and covering it up is a burial practice exclusive to humans and Neanderthals. But Neanderthals buried their dead differently than Homo sapiens , according to research published this summer in the journal L'Anthropologie .\n\nBy looking at burials in Western Asia over a span of 85,000 years \u2014 when modern humans and Neanderthals overlapped \u2014 researchers noticed both similarities and differences. Everyone buried their dead without regard to their sex or age, and both modern humans and Neanderthals put items in their graves. But while Neanderthals buried their dead in a variety of positions in caves, early H. sapiens buried theirs in the fetal position outside caves.\n\nNeanderthals and H. sapiens started burying their dead during the same time period \u2014 about 90,000 to 120,000 years ago \u2014 perhaps to mark their territory or lay claim to certain resources in a landscape teeming with hominins.\n\nRelated: From 'Lucy' to the 'Hobbits': The most famous fossils of human relatives\n\n5. They looked a lot like us.\n\nReconstruction of the face of Neanderthal 'Shanidar Z' on the right along with her skull on the left. (Image credit: JUSTIN TALLIS / Contributor via Getty Images)\n\nNumerous burials found in Shanidar Cave in Iraq provide some of the earliest evidence of purposeful interment of the dead. The skull of a woman known as Shanidar Z was pieced together from hundreds of fragments, and her face was reconstructed to provide a picture of one of our extinct relatives.\n\nNeanderthal skulls look different from those of modern humans; they have huge brow ridges, prominent noses and no chin. But when muscles and skin are put back on the bone, even virtually, the similarities between Neanderthals and humans are apparent, and their long history of interbreeding is not surprising.\n\n6. The last Neanderthals were isolated.\n\nThe jawbone of 'Thorin' - one of the last Neanderthals - emerging from the dirt (Image credit: Ludovik Slimak)\n\nDNA sequencing of a Neanderthal nicknamed \"Thorin\" revealed that some groups may have been isolated for thousands of years before going extinct. Discovered in France's Rh\u00f4ne Valley, Thorin was dated to between 52,000 and 42,000 years ago. His DNA suggested that his lineage was quite inbred, even though other Neanderthal groups lived nearby.\n\n\"How can we imagine populations that lived for 50 millennia in isolation while they are only two weeks' walk from each other?\" said Ludovic Slimak , a researcher at the Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France and lead author of the research. \"Everything must be rewritten about the greatest extinction in humanity.\"\n\n7. Male Neanderthal DNA seems to have vanished without a trace.\n\nReconstructions of a human and a Neanderthal in a museum display case (Image credit: mauritius images GmbH / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nAlthough plenty of genes are shared between modern humans and Neanderthals, the H. sapiens genome does not have any Neanderthal Y chromosome DNA , which raises the question of how and why this genetic material vanished.\n\nOne intriguing possibility is that mating simply didn't work between Neanderthal males and H. sapiens women. Even though the two groups interbred several times over thousands of years, if a human mother was pregnant with a male Neanderthal baby, her immune system may have attacked the male fetus with unknown Y chromosome genes during pregnancy, resulting in a miscarriage. Eventually, if fewer male Neanderthal hybrid babies were born, the Y chromosome genes would disappear.\n\nBut it is not yet certain why the Neanderthal Y chromosome is no longer in our evolutionary gene pool. Because it is passed down only from father to son, it may have simply been lost over the generations.\n\n8. Neanderthals were probably absorbed into modern-human groups.\n\nA reconstruction of a woman who lived 45,000 years ago, around the time Neanderthals also existed (Image credit: Tom Bj\u00f6rklund)\n\nTwo key studies published recently showed that, although Neanderthals disappeared as a group, many of their genes did not.\n\nBy looking at more than 300 human genomes from the past 45,000 years, researchers estimated that most of the Neanderthal DNA that persists in us is from almost 7,000 years of interbreeding that began around 47,000 years ago .\n\nConversely, research published in July in the journal Science estimated that the Neanderthal genome may have been between 2.5% and 3.7% human, indicating that both human and Neanderthal populations had a long history of exchanging mates. The genetic analysis also revealed that the Neanderthal population size was quite small. The finding suggests that, rather than undergoing a dramatic extinction, the Neanderthals were simply absorbed into larger human groups.\n\nRelated: Ancient human ancestor Lucy was not alone \u2014 she lived alongside at least 4 other proto-human species, emerging research suggests\n\n9. Neanderthal DNA affects our health.\n\nIllustration of an early modern human man embracing a Neanderthal woman (Image credit: Kevin McGivern for Live Science)\n\nOngoing DNA research also revealed that our health is affected by Neanderthal genes , for better or for worse.\n\nHumans inherited Neanderthal genes for certain pregnancy hormones, which are associated with increased fertility and a lower risk of miscarriage. But other gene variants from our Neanderthal cousins make us more susceptible to allergies and Type 2 diabetes , more sensitive to pain and sunlight, and more likely to be at risk for nicotine addiction , severe COVID-19 , autoimmune conditions and depression .\n\n10. Humans probably did not kill off Neanderthals \u2014 at least, not directly.\n\nA statue of a Neanderthal man wearing fur and carrying a stick (Image credit: Arterra Picture Library / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nWe also learned that modern humans didn't purposely kill off the world's last Neanderthals . In addition to absorbing some of the Neanderthals through interbreeding and gene exchange, humans appear to have simply outcompeted Neanderthals by falling back on our vast social networks when times were tough and leaving our introverted cousins high and dry."

            "article_content": "The story so far: On December 13, Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of the Mission Governing Board of the nascent National Quantum Mission, said India plans to launch a quantum satellite in \u201c2-3 years for quantum communications\u201d.\n\nWhat is the National Quantum Mission?\n\nThe National Quantum Mission (NQM) is a Department of Science & Technology programme to accelerate the use of quantum physics in the development of next-generation communications and sensing systems.\n\nThe development of computers changed the course of human history from the mid-20th century onwards. Thanks to advances in this sector, which continue to this day, humankind has access to telecommunications, weather forecasts, drug-discovery programmes, search-and-rescue plans, artificial intelligence, etc.\n\nBut many of these advances are nearing a saturation point because the physics phenomena on which they are based, called classical physics, are hitting a performance upper-limit. Today scientists around the world are building new devices to perform the same functions but using quantum physics. Because the rules of quantum physics allow for the outcomes of classical physics as well as \u2018bonus\u2019 ones not found in the classical paradigm, the new devices are expected to have new abilities.\n\nThe Union Cabinet approved the NQM in April 2023 at a total cost of Rs 6,000 crore, to be implemented from 2023 to 2031. The planned quantum satellite is an experiment in this package.\n\nWhat is a quantum satellite?\n\nA quantum satellite is a term for a communications satellite that uses quantum physics to secure its signals.\n\nCommunications is a broad term that refers to technologies that send and receive signals. An important part of these technologies is security: preventing bad actors from intercepting a message being transmitted across large distances, through multiple networks.\n\nThe advent of quantum computers threatens the technologies currently being used to secure messages. Fortunately, quantum physics has also paved the way for new forms of protection, and quantum satellites are expected to facilitate them.\n\nHow are messages secured?\n\nSay two people, Anil and Selvi, are standing at two ends of a playground and wish to speak to each other. The simplest way is to shout or wave their hands. There is also a third person, Kaushik, standing in the middle of the ground trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. If Anil and Selvi are shouting or using hand signals, Kaushik will have little difficulty intercepting their messages \u2014 but not if they are communicating via WhatsApp.\n\nMessages in WhatsApp are encrypted. Encryption means a message is written in a secret code before it is transmitted. When the recipient receives it, they will use their knowledge of the code to decrypt the message and read it. If a bad actor like Kaushik somehow intercepts the message, he can\u2019t read it without knowing the code.\n\nFor example, in a Caesar cipher, the letters of the alphabet are offset by a fixed number. If the number is 5, the words BIRDS FLY AWAY become GNWIX KQD FBFD.\n\nThis paradigm is called cryptographic security. It gets its strength by hiding the key to cracking the code behind an extremely difficult mathematical problem. Anil\u2019s and Selvi\u2019s devices already have the solution to this problem. If Kaushik wants it, however, he has to first solve the problem with a computer \u2014 and the harder the problem, the more time (or more computing resources) he will need.\n\nA modern computer can crack a Caesar cipher quickly by repeatedly trying all possible keys (1-26) until the text becomes legible. But even the most powerful supercomputers can\u2019t crack the best Advanced Encryption Standard ciphers today in a single lifetime. Quantum computers may be able to do better, however.\n\nHow can quantum physics protect messages?\n\nQuantum cryptography uses the tenets of quantum physics to secure messages. Its most famous type is quantum key distribution (QKD).\n\nIn the example before, Anil used a secret code to encrypt or \u2018lock\u2019 his message and Selvi had the key to decrypt and read the message. QKD is concerned with sharing the key with Anil and Selvi such that if Kaushik is eavesdropping on the transmission, everyone will find out and the sharing is aborted.\n\nQuantum physics can reveal eavesdropping in different ways. One is quantum measurement \u2014 the act of measuring the properties of a quantum system, like a photon (the subatomic particle of light). According to the rules of quantum physics, a quantum measurement changes the state of the system. If information about the key is encoded in a stream of photons (in two states, one representing 0 and the other 1) and Kaushik traps and measures them to look for it, the state of the photons will change and Anil and Selvi will know the key has been compromised.\n\nAnother way is to use quantum entanglement: when two photons are entangled, any change to one particle will instantaneously change the other. (This is a necessarily simplistic description.)\n\nSince the key will be lost irrespective of what technological capabilities Kaushik possesses, QKD is said to provide unconditional security.\n\nHas QKD been implemented?\n\nRavindra Pratap Singh, of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, wrote in 2023 that the standards for different QKD protocols and the technologies they will require to implement as designed are still a decade away. This said, China currently operates the world\u2019s largest QKD network with three quantum satellites and four ground stations.\n\nExperts are also trying to implement QKD across longer distances. In the two decades since its experimental proof in 1992, the distance of reliable transmissions has increased to several hundred kilometres either through fibre-optic cables or free space.\n\nIn 2013, researchers from China reported that they had implemented QKD between a ground station and a moving hot-air balloon (carrying a payload of instruments) 20 km up. This demonstration bolstered the case for quantum satellites.\n\nIn an October 2024 study, researchers at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, reported that the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, Ladakh, offered the best atmospheric conditions through which to transmit data for a satellite-based QKD system. It had an estimated signal loss of 44 dB, compared to 50 dB in the Chinese experiment.\n\n\u201cOur main signal would be at 810 nm while the uplink and downlink would use 532 nm and 1550 nm of wavelength, respectively,\u201d the paper\u2019s lead author Satya Ranjan Behera told the Department of Science & Technology. The planned beam distance is 500 km.\n\nDoes QKD have drawbacks?\n\nBecause QKD on paper can be very different from that in the real-world, the U.S. National Security Agency has recommended the use of post-quantum cryptography rather than quantum cryptography. Its criticism is focused on five limitations:\n\n(i) \u201cQKD does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source\u201d;\n\n(ii) \u201csince QKD is hardware-based\u201d, QKD networks can\u2019t be upgraded or patched easily;\n\n(iii) \u201cQKD increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks\u201d that \u201celiminate many use cases from consideration\u201d;\n\n(iv) \u201cthe actual security provided by a QKD system is not the theoretical unconditional security from the laws of physics \u2026 but rather the more limited security that can be achieved by hardware and engineering designs\u201d; and\n\n(v) since eavesdroppers can cause a transmission to stop, they can deny the use of a transmission by its intended users (a.k.a. a denial-of-service attack).\n\nPost-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic techniques that resist attacks from both quantum and classical devices using more advanced classical encryption.\n\nQuantum physics also imposes some restrictions. For example, non-quantum information can be amplified before being transmitted across large distances whereas the no-cloning theorem prohibits the amplification of quantum information."
