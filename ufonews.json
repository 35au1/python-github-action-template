        "article_content": "Alejandro Rojas, a UFO expert at Enigma based out of Arizona, told rdnewsNOW that sightings usually coordinate with population.\n\n\u201cWherever there\u2019s more people, there\u2019s more sightings,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also outreach. For example, who knows about us and who knows where to report. We have enough connections in Canada that Canadians often participate.\u201d\n\nEnigma allows the public to upload pictures and videos of UFO\u2019s across the world which is used by researchers and scientists. It also allows for community scientists and the rest of the users to crowd analyze the sightings. The data collected is from those reported by the public but also through historical databases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that the northern lights in particular caused a lot of sighting reports and really it\u2019s because people are outside looking at the sky for an extended period of time,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen they do that, often they see something they can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nOften UFOs seen by people can vary in shape and size but Rojas said there are more frequent types of shapes.\n\nPoints of light and spheres are the more common reported, which makes sense because people sometimes see what appear to be satellites but are unsure of what they are.\n\n\u201cThose are also some of the most mysterious ones because one of the most frequent types of sightings is seeing what they think is a satellite but then it starts to do something weird like zig zag or speed up,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the most recent reports in Red Deer came in April and August of this year. However, one case was also reported in November 2023.\n\nRed Deer resident Shelby Leclarc said she and her partner have a nightly routine where they\u2019ll watch for satellites and look at the different constellations.\n\nOn that night in November she looked up at the sky and after watching a plane go by she saw multiple moving orange dots in the sky.\n\nThey also twinkled like a star but was much more noticeable and moved faster than the plane. The UFO\u2019s were more circular shape and did not make any sound.\n\n\u201cWhat the heck was that,\u201d Leclarc remembers saying. \u201cSeeing lights you don\u2019t recognize is a little weird. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it since.\u201d\n\nA year ago, David Grusch. a former U.S. intelligence official and whistle blower said at a congressional hearing under oath, that the U.S. government is in possession of non-human space crafts as well as bodies of deceased corpses.\n\nThe claims raised many questions and also excitement online and in social media.\n\nRojas explained that those were just claims without any evidence. However, he did say the government has a lot of secrecy around this topic.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which they collect all of that data is classified so they\u2019re not in the best position to share a lot of data with the public,\u201d Rojas said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always going to lead to secrecy and speculation about what they know. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that they really know much.\n\n\u201cI think one thing that\u2019s exciting is that they have admitted they\u2019re having reports of these metallic orb type things. They don\u2019t know what they are and they haven\u2019t figured it out.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Carl Petrick is a sky-watcher.\n\nThe East Moline resident and Moline native is a retired longtime zookeeper at Niabi Zoo. He studies his surroundings with scientific attention. Science is his religion, Petrick said. The 66-year-old just wants to figure it all out.\n\n\u201cMoving things,\u201d in particular, are fascinating to him. He\u2019s an avid bird-watcher. Birds\u2019 camouflaging abilities, their ability to fly into the wind, their speed \u2014 it\u2019s all impressive to Petrick.\n\n\u201cPeople are smart, but we can't do some of the things they do,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrick is willing to go to great lengths to identify birds he spots in local parks \u2014 once, he chased a bird 50 yards just to get answers after he glimpsed it through a bush. Eventually, he tracked it down.\n\nBut there\u2019s one flyer that got away. It\u2019s nagged at him for more than 50 years.\n\nPetrick is one of several Quad-Citians who reported seeing UFOs over several days in early March 1967. At the time, Petrick was a 9-year-old student at Sacred Heart Catholic School, now Seton Catholic, in Moline.\n\nThe record of this local UFO phenomenon, which stretched across multiple counties in western Illinois, is part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs in the 1950s and 1960s, a time of heightened concern due to the Cold War.\n\nNuns, sheriff\u2019s deputies, elementary students and more reported seeing something in the sky that spring.\n\nThe story is still vivid in Petrick\u2019s head.\n\nIf he stares long enough at a wall, he can close his eyes and see it like it was yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s not an airplane\n\nPetrick saw it between 2 and 3 p.m., as he went back inside for class, he said. The weather was chilly but clear.\n\n\u201cI looked up and I saw something in the distance,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nTo his naked eye, the object in the western sky looked like a spot or a small silvery thing. He estimated its height to be like that of airplanes when they emit contrails as they fly over.\n\nAs Petrick watched the object, Bill Fisher, a Moline police officer, came around the corner. The officer had binoculars or a movie camera with him. Fisher looked at the object then handed the instrument he carried to Petrick.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d the police officer asked the boy.\n\nWith the instrument\u2019s assistance, Petrick saw a silver, cigar-shaped object with what Petrick described as three long windows along the side. Those windows were powder blue, like the jersey shade of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe thing was not moving and Petrick estimated its length to be between 20 and 40 feet.\n\nPetrick told Fisher the thing was not an airplane, then the police officer said he had to go.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last I saw of him,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nThat day, Fisher recorded the object with a portable 8mm movie camera. He and his recording would be a central part of the Air Force\u2019s investigation.\n\nAfter Fisher left, Petrick watched the object for about 10 more minutes before returning to class, he said. About 30 or 45 minutes later, he came back outside.\n\n\u201cIt was still there,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nAt home a short time later, he observed it again with his father and brother, using a small telescope. The object still had not moved and its appearance remained the same.\n\nPetrick does not know what the object was, but he said he knows what it wasn\u2019t. It was not a bird or a butterfly, he said. It was not an airplane, helicopter or zeppelin.\n\nBy the process of elimination, he concluded it was a UFO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, so obviously and logically, it would be unidentified,\u201d he said. \u201cJust common sense.\u201d\n\nNow decades removed from the event, Petrick said he does not think the object had a human origin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just observing us like we observe.\u201d\n\nPetrick said he saw the object in the same place in the sky for several days after those initial sightings.\n\nThen, one day, it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nInitially, he thought it might have moved. After a bit more time, he decided it was gone for good.\n\nDuck and cover\n\nAt the time of the Quad-Cities sighting, the Cold War was in full swing. The rivalry between America and the Soviet Union even extended into space.\n\nPetrick remembered a childhood game he and his friends played, inspired by the monthly emergency siren tests. When they heard the siren, the children would pretend the Russians were attacking.\n\nPeople feared a nuclear holocaust, Petrick said. Incidents like the Bay of Pigs had occurred and the conflict in Vietnam was heating up.\n\n\u201cWe were so inundated with the Cold War\u2019s \u2018Russians are bad, we\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d Petrick said.\n\nHe also described an exercise he had to do at school: the duck-and-cover drill.\n\n\u201cIf the siren goes off, get under your desk because if a bomb explodes, you\u2019ll be protected,\u201d he said.\n\nShould they find themselves in the hallway, children were supposed to get against the wall and cover themselves as best they could, he said.\n\nThe school phased that drill out while he was still a student.\n\nThere was also a big emphasis on science in school because of the Cold War. The Russians had their Sputnik satellite. The Americans were after the Moon.\n\nAfter he saw the object in the sky that day, Petrick said, he considered, then discarded, the possibility that another nation was behind it.\n\n\u201cIf it was Russian or Chinese or whatever, you think it would have been attacking the States or would have been doing something to throw us off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sat there.\u201d\n\nNot just Petrick\n\nPetrick wasn\u2019t the only person in the Quad-Cities who spotted a UFO that week. The local newspapers covered the phenomenon extensively.\n\nJames Maifield, of Silvis, reported that he and his wife spotted a \u201cwhite light\u201d in the sky for several minutes. An anonymous Silvis police dispatcher told the Moline Dispatch she saw a \u201cweird\u201d white light, too.\n\nGary Bennett, an Augustana College student, told the Times-Democrat he saw an \u201cunfamiliar airborne vehicle\u201d around 9:30 p.m. on March 9.\n\nArnold Buchmeyer, Helen DeRocker and Leo Schmitz, all of Moline, separately reported to the Times-Democrat that they saw something strange in the sky, too. Schmitz said it was \u201cvery white\u201d and \u201cmoving northwesterly.\u201d\n\nA Northwestern University astronomer speculated that it was just the planet Venus.\n\nThe weekend after the sightings, pranksters were caught deploying a balloon with a candle that crash-landed in Rock Island. A similar balloon was found near the Monmouth waste disposal plant on Thursday, March 9, pieced together with soda straws.\n\nJimmie Scott, a 12-year-old from Buffalo, Iowa, told the Times-Democrat he got out of bed around 2 a.m. on March 9 to get a drink of water. He looked into the sky and saw a \u201cbright, white object that looked like a saucer.\u201d\n\nHis sketch of the saucer was published on the front pages of the Times-Democrat.\n\nThe principal witness, though, was Fisher, the Moline officer who greeted Petrick on the campus of Sacred Heart.\n\nThe star witness\n\nAfter the Quad-Cities area sightings drew the attention of the federal government, Fisher was interviewed at length by the U.S. Air Force, who sent Capt. Edward Orenic and Capt. Anton Kato to investigate.\n\nAfter their visit, they produced a 94-page report on their methods, avenues of inquiry and conclusions. The report is available online through the U.S. National Archives.\n\nThe two captains cast a wide net, the report shows. Their efforts included interviewing witnesses and collecting weather data. They also checked with regional military, airport and National Weather Service officials for aircraft and weather balloon flights as well as for reports of anything strange.\n\nOrenic and Kato took particular interest in Fisher\u2019s account and the footage he took.\n\nThe officer told the Air Force that he was initially at Sacred Heart on March 9 to deliver a message to his son, a student there. He arrived around 1:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I glanced upward above the treetops and viewed a object that I was not sure of its description or its identity,\u201d he told investigators.\n\nHe described the object as \u201cU-shaped \u2014 like a pickle,\u201d and said he watched it for \u201ca precious minute and a half.\u201d Soon after, he began shooting footage with his 8mm camera, using a telescopic lens and outdoor film. The footage is also available online in the U.S. National Archives.\n\nFisher told the Dispatch in 2015 that he kept the camera in storage on his motorcycle, aware that UFO rumors were already swirling in town.\n\n\u201cThere were stories all around,\u201d he told the Dispatch. \u201cI was just naturally curious.\u201d\n\nAfter he arrived on the campus, Fisher says the object then began moving \u201cnorthwesterly\u201d away from him. It \u201cappeared to have stopped\u201d and hovered, he said, and then it continued its pace until it faded from view.\n\n\u201cBefore it faded away here, before it got completely obscure, I did have a definite sighting of a metallic, shiny surface on the side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe side that was the broad side to me, was metallic and appeared to be of the same construction like some of our large aircrafts that I\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n\nAs he stood at the school, Fisher asked several kids and a state policeman\u2019s wife about what they saw. The woman told him it \u201clooked shiny and reflected a white light.\u201d Fisher said he didn\u2019t spot any lights or objects connected to the craft. He heard no sound emitted from the object, but the woman reported a hissing or whirring sound.\n\nIn the report, captains Orenic and Kato also highlighted the accounts of two sheriff\u2019s deputies, one from Knox County and the other from Henry County.\n\nThe Knox County deputy\u2019s account was that early on March 6, 1967, he saw a flying object.\n\nHis account included that it was shaped like an upside-down bowl, the report states. It had a glowing red base and at one point emitted a bright beam of white light.\n\nThe deputy from Henry County saw something in the sky late on March 8, the report states.\n\nThe deputy\u2019s description included that the object was framed by three lights \u2014 one red, one white and one green. Periodically it would emit an intense red light bright enough to obscure the other three lights.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict?\n\nOrenic and Kato concluded at the end of the report that the sightings most likely involved the mundane.\n\nIn Fisher\u2019s case, the object was most likely an air vehicle \u2013 a plane or helicopter, the report states. In another part of the report, Orenic and Kato also state it could have been a balloon.\n\n\u201cThe description, duration and flight characteristics are similar to that of a balloon,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe 8mm film failed to reveal any information that would dispute this evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe captains said the Henry County deputy\u2019s sighting was also likely an aircraft.\n\nThe Knox County sighting was probably of a home-made hot air balloon created using a garment bag, similar to the one Rock Island pranksters made the weekend of March 12, and the one recovered in the Monmouth area. The method of making the balloons had been published in a national magazine, the report states.\n\nDuring that period, two red kites along with batteries and a light bulb were also recovered in the Galesburg area, according to the report.\n\nNearly all the witnesses Orenic and Kato interviewed appeared extremely reliable but had a \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d or an attitude of \u201cthought I\u2019d never see a saucer,\u201d the report states.\n\nThose attitudes, the extensive news coverage and prank launchings appeared to have caused wide-spread UFO sightings, the captains wrote.\n\nStill looking, still believing\n\nIn 2015, the year before Fisher\u2019s death at the age of 81, the Dispatch interviewed him about the incident. They asked how he felt about investigators pointing out his affinity for science fiction and \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d \u2014 the report said, for example, that Fisher \u201cwatches the sky every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nThe former officer told the Dispatch he felt investigators were fishing for statements like that. But Fisher remained \u201cadamant that he saw what he saw,\u201d even years later.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what it was, but it most certainly wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d the Dispatch wrote. \u201cAnd several other people saw it and were startled by it, too.\u201d\n\nPetrick also stands by his story. He said he never read the conclusions of the Air Force, but he doesn\u2019t mind skepticism. Like Fisher, he knows what he saw.\n\n\u201cPeople believe in love,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cCan you prove it? Can you prove it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also quick to point out that his interest in the UFO comes from a place of scientific curiosity, not opportunity. It\u2019s the bird that got away.\n\nPetrick jokes about his father, whose experience with the unknown was a little different. Milton Petrick lived in rural New Jersey when Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of The Worlds\u201d went over the radio the night before Halloween in 1938. Milton and his buddies saw through the radio play\u2019s facade, but took it as a chance to improve the town.\n\n\u201cThey went down with their shotguns and rifles and shot the water tower, called the police and said, \u2018Yeah, we just killed a Martian,\u2019\u201d Petrick laughs. \u201cThey got their new water tower out of it.\u201d\n\nPetrick, though, isn\u2019t looking for a new water tower. He\u2019s just looking for answers. To this day, the 66-year-old scans the western sky almost daily, longing to see the UFO again. The uncertainty, though, is a sort of gift.\n\n\u201cEverybody has beliefs that they can't prove,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cWhich is actually a good thing, or life would be boring.\u201d\n\nWhile walking around the grounds of his old elementary school on a recent fall day, Petrick\u2019s voice rattled with a certain giddiness. He shuffled his feet along the sidewalk. Every time he found the perfect spot to recreate the memory, he\u2019d find an even better one a few inches over.\n\n\u201cNow it really hits home,\u201d Petrick said, aligning a triangle between the rightmost spire on the church steeple and the roof of the school.\n\nHe lingered in the neighborhood for about a half hour, in awe of the sky. Waiting, perhaps, for an answer to appear. The weather conditions were similar to those in 1967. The sky was clear and a seasonal chill lingered in the air.\n\nFor a moment, a plane flew overhead to the north. Petrick estimated it was about the same size as the UFO of 1967. The jet left contrails behind, but they faded after a few minutes.\n\nPetrick kept on looking, raising his hand to his forehead to block out the sun \u2014 a salute, of sorts, to the puzzling sky."

        "article_content": "An ex-Pentagon official, who gained fame for blowing the lid off a $22-million, secretive government UFO program, has revealed an image of an alleged UFO 'mothership.'\n\nLuis Elizondo, a career US Army counterintelligence specialist, previously ran the military's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.\n\nMonday night in Philadelphia at a private UFO event, Elizondo dropped what he described as a craft 'looking like the mothership from \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\"' referring to the 1977 Steven Spielberg film.\n\n'Guess what we caught in Romania in 2022? By the way, the US Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo: 'That.'\n\nHe went on to describe it as a 'huge mini city floating in the sky.'\n\nBut the UFO, which resembles a gleaming disc-shaped craft, has already drawn withering critiques from skeptics, believers and even military UFO witnesses alike, who claim to have traced the photo to, not to the US Embassy, but a Facebook page.\n\nOne suggested to DailyMail.com that Elizondo has been lax in his vetting of such images in a bid to add sensational new material to his 'paid speaking engagements.'\n\nEx-Pentagon official Luis Elizondo (right), who gained fame for blowing the lid off a $22-million, secretive government UFO program, has revealed an image of a UFO 'mothership'\n\n'Guess what we caught in Romania in 2022?

'I witnessed him exaggerate or outright fabricate information that simply wasn't true.'\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2024 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for $50-$30 per ticket.\n\n'There's a whole lot more here folks,' Elizondo told the audience in a leaked clip. 'I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on \"behind the scenes.\"'\n\n'We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible,' as Elizondo began to explain his 'real photo' of a UFO.\n\n'They described it literally 'the mothership,'' Elizondo said.\n\nBut despite credible federal reports of 'mothership' UFOs over domestic US military sites \u2014 investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an FBI task force, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and 16 local sheriff's offices \u2014 internet sleuths quickly managed to poke holes in Elizondo's 2022 Romanian UFO.\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault, quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled 'Mysterious Ancient Discoveries.'\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault , quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled ' Mysterious Ancient Discoveries' (above)\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass\n\n'I reverse imaged searched it,' Greenewald posted on X. 'It got more than 182,000 likes and more than 23,700 comments.'\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away.\n\nAmerica's Embassy in Romania is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, in the capital city of Bucharest.\n\nWhile dedicated UFO skeptics were eager to pounce on Elizondo's inaccurate claims, UFO enthusiasts also expressed frustration over the episode.\n\n'Lue is 100 percent using us as pawns to line his pockets,' one contributor to the Reddit forum r/UFOs lamented. 'His most recent book was no.1 seller in the nation.'\n\n'It's muddying the waters and detracting from the important convo,' another opined.\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago.'\n\nRetired USAF Staff Sergeant McGowan, however, told DailyMail.com that Elizondo's error was far from a one-off mistake.\n\n'I've been on the receiving end where Lue has pulled out his cell phone and shown me what he described as highly classified video,' McGowan told DailyMail.com.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station (above) indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away.

'And it wasn't just me, multiple podcast hosts were shown video Lue attributed to things they were not.'\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about this instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet Union probe near Mars.\n\nThe video, as McGowan recollected to DailyMail.com, looked to be a decades-old public UFO video from the Soviet's Phobos 2 probe, released by retired Soviet Air Force Colonel Marina Popovich in 1991.\n\nElizondo had shown the video to McGowan, in hushed tones, in January 2021.\n\nWhile Popovich, who wrote a book about her own UFO encounters as a test pilot, long maintained the Phobos 2 video depicted a legitimate alien craft, the odd video had nevertheless been public for about three decades, in other words.\n\n'There is a striking similarity between that public video and what Lue showed me on his phone,' McGowan recollected.\n\n'Only saw it for a few seconds,' he said, 'so the granular details didn't get absorbed.'\n\nMcGowan, whose duties in the Air Force included service in Desert Storm attached to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and drug enforcement missions in Colombia, has been public for years on his own UFO encounter.\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' Jeremy McGowan (above) says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about an instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet probe near Mars. The video however had been public since 1991\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' McGowan says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert.\n\nHe spoke to the History Channel about this UFO sighting in the Mid East for the 2020 docu-series 'Unidentified,' which had been hosted by Luis Elizondo.\n\nAs McGowan recollected about his appearance on the show in a Medium blog post, he had agreed to this on-camera interview in the hopes of getting back in touch with other witnesses to the event, but felt 'used' by the experience.\n\n'I was supposed to be introduced to investigators and researchers who could help me identify the person with me on that dune and saw what I saw!' he wrote in 2022.\n\n'I left with no answers [...] I sent a few emails to production that were ignored, and I was never extended the courtesy promised to me.'\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago' (above)\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2004 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , for $50-$30 per ticket\n\nFederal government concern about 'mothership' UFOs harboring swarms of 'drones,' have spilled out into public view following the release of internal reports via the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in recent years.\n\nWeeks of reports of mystery 'drones' swept eastern Colorado and nearby areas of Nebraska, Wyoming and Kansas over the winter holidays of 2019 into the new year.\n\nThe sightings worried citizens and local law enforcement alike, but odd craft and thier 'motherships' troubled the US military especially for their proximity to some of America's sensitive, nuclear-equipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\n\n'They all seem clustered in an area that has quite a few Minuteman sites,' a redacted official confessed in one email released via FOIA by F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n\nF.E.

        "article_content": "Heaven's Gate and Lil Uzi Vert: What to Know About UFO Religion That Inspired 'Eternal Atake' and Its Sequel\n\nA split image showing a close-up of a man with facial tattoos and a septum ring on the left, and an older man with wide eyes on the right.\n\nA split image showing a close-up of a man with facial tattoos and a septum ring on the left, and an older man with wide eyes on the right.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, two Earth-bound souls who would come to be known as Do and Ti embarked on a journey toward what they hoped would be the ultimate form of transcendence. Half a century later, that journey is again serving as a key point of inspiration in the work of Lil Uzi Vert , whose 2020 album Eternal Atake is soon getting a sequel.\n\nThe original cover art for Eternal Atake, released mere days before the world went into pandemic lockdown, saw Uzi repurposing a version of a keyhole logo associated with Heaven\u2019s Gate , a UFO religion often disparagingly referred to as a cult. The overarching story at the core of the album\u2019s sequencing, namely Uzi's space travels, also seemed to mirror certain aspects of the beliefs of the group once led by the late Marshall Applewhite, a.k.a. Do, and Bonnie Nettles, a.k.a. Ti.\n\nAs far back as 2018 in the run-up to EA's release, numerous headlines posited that Heaven\u2019s Gate, in its current form, was not exactly thrilled by Uzi\u2019s choice of imagery. With a sequel on the horizon, we\u2019re taking a look back at not only the group\u2019s central message but also its sustaining impact on pop culture at large. We even hear from the current operator of the official Heaven\u2019s Gate website, a welcome banner for which still reads , \u201cAs was promised, the keys to Heaven\u2019s Gate are here again in Ti and Do (the UFO Two) as they were in Jesus and his father 2000 years ago.\u201d\n\nKeep reading for more.\n\nWhat is Heaven\u2019s Gate?\n\nWhile the group\u2019s beginnings are often disparately linked to both the New Age movement and Christianity, Heaven\u2019s Gate was then, and remains, a truly unique presence among religions. Founders Do and Ti, sometimes referred to jointly as the UFO Two, are reported to have first met a hospital in Texas in the early 1970s.\n\nBy the late 1990s, when scholars and journalists were deep into the process of studying the group\u2019s history following the suicide deaths of 39 members, the \u201cblend\u201d of ideas driving their ideology had also been linked to what a sociologist described at the time as \u201cesoteric interpretations of the Book of Revelation.\u201d Estimates place the total membership as being in the hundreds in the 1970s before dropping to less than 100 by the 1980s, and fewer still before the 1997 deaths.\n\nWhat do they believe?\n\nIn texts attributed to Do, it\u2019s asserted that he was among those who originally came from \u201cthe King of Heaven.\u201d Thus, he and others were bound to return. Key to Heaven\u2019s Gate in terms of how the group has been represented in American pop culture are the elements more strictly concerned with matters of extraterrestrial life. Namely, it was believed that a spacecraft would be the manner of travel when leaving Earth on this return mission, though this facet was later expanded to treat the body itself as a vessel or \u201cvehicle.\u201d\n\nThis expansion was preceded by Ti's death from cancer in 1985.\n\n\u201cTi stayed with me, setting an example and preparing me for this present responsibility until 1985, and then separated from her borrowed human container and returned to the Next Level,\u201d a text attributed to Do reads.\n\nIn another text, this time attributed to a \u201ca student,\u201d an overview of the group\u2019s mission is provided alongside an excerpt from the Extraterrestrials Return With Final Warning book. According to the student, \u201cclear signals\u201d started to be noticed in the early 1990s suggesting that the group\u2019s \u201cclassroom time\u201d was intended to soon draw to a close. This became more apparent, the student added, with the public\u2019s reaction to a 1995 statement shared by the group.\n\n\u201cThe response was extremely animated and somewhat mixed. However, the loudest voices were those expressing ridicule, hostility, or both - so quick to judge that which they could not comprehend,\u201d the text reads. \u201cThis was the signal to us to begin our preparations to return \u2018home.\u2019 The weeds have taken over the garden and truly disturbed its usefulness beyond repair - it is time for the civilization to be recycled.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in 1997?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been away, and now we\u2019re going back.\u201d\n\nThese words from Do are featured prominently in the opening moments of the Max docuseries Heaven\u2019s Gate: The Cult of Cults, released back in December 2020. This concept, of having been \u201caway\u201d and in need of orchestrating a large-scale return mission, formed the underlying ethos of the group\u2019s Away Team. On March 22, 1997, a statement was shared by the group in which it was said that Away Team members had returned to a \u201clevel above human\u201d after leaving bodies they said were merely borrowed, not permanent.\n\n\u201cBy the time you receive this, we'll be gone, several dozen of us,\u201d the message, intended as an \u201c exit press release ,\u201d states.\n\nBy March 26, law enforcement in San Diego County had discovered dozens of bodies inside a Rancho Santa Fe mansion following what was initially said to be an anonymous welfare check request. Per the San Diego County Sheriff's Office, deputies found 39 Heaven\u2019s Gate members dead inside the home, with their investigation later finding that all 39 had taken part in what they described as \u201ca mass suicide that took place over the course of several days.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later said that members died after ingesting phenobarbital and vodka. Members also reportedly placed plastic bags over their heads .\n\nWhat does Nike have to do with this?\n\nAll 39 members on the Away Team wore matching outfits, including black-and-white Nike Decades. According to a 2015 email response from an individual behind the Heaven's Gate site, the shoes were chosen, at least in part, due to the group having been able to secure a \u201c good deal on them .\u201d\n\nIs Heaven\u2019s Gate still active?\n\nNo, at least not according to two individuals who describe themselves as former members who control the intellectual property of the group. When reached via email by Complex, the two, who asked to remain anonymous, agreed to answer a few questions in light of Uzi\u2019s Eternal Atake 2 announcement. See a lightly edited version of the resulting exchange below.\n\nTWC: What is your role in relation to Heaven\u2019s Gate?\n\nHG: We joined the Group at the very beginning in 1975 and have either been in the Group or associated with them for 49 years. We provide information on request and protect it from infringement (like Lil Uzi Vert tried to do in 2020).\n\nIs Heaven\u2019s Gate active in any way in 2024?\n\nNo. Heaven\u2019s Gate came to an end in 1997. There is no Group and there are no members.\n\nHow many surviving members are there?\n\nWe really don\u2019t know. Most members have died natural deaths and the few remaining lead private lives and wish to keep it that way.\n\nWhat were your thoughts when you first started seeing the Heaven\u2019s Gate inspiration in Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s work, namely their Eternal Atake album imagery?\n\nIt was a distortion and misuse of our IP. We took action and forced him to make changes in the product.\n\nThere were reports several years back that someone connected to Heaven\u2019s Gate was considering legal action. Is there truth to that?\n\nYes, we hired a music entertainment lawyer and he took care of working with his people to back away from using our logos, trademarks, copyrights, and imagery in what he finally produced. He still stepped over the line in one circumstance but we got him to give up thinking he could use our IP to push his idea of him being a divine \u2018leader\u2019 and motivating his \u2018followers\u2019 to leave the planet. We will see if he takes it too far this time.\n\nWith Uzi set to release a sequel to Eternal Atake, what are your feelings on the Heaven\u2019s Gate inspiration now?\n\nSame as last time. Stay away from our Intellectual Property. Give the Group some respect. And don\u2019t try to offer to buy us off, like last time. We do not want your money, no matter how much it is.\n\nHave you listened to Uzi\u2019s music? If so, what are your thoughts?\n\nNo, we have not listened to Vert\u2019s music. Living in this world is hard enough as it is, and we do not need the brain damage involved in listening to his works.\n\nWhat would you like people to know who may be learning about the Heaven's Gate story for the first time?\n\nThe true information about Heaven\u2019s Gate is at one sole location ( www.heavensgate.com ). It has access to the video tapes, the writings, and the book from the Group. It also has the information that the Group deemed necessary to be left to the world at this time, and nothing else, as they instructed.\n\nRelated\n\nLil Uzi Vert Welcomes Fans Back to World of 'Eternal Atake' With Sequel Announcement\n\nRemembering the Nike Sneaker That Took One Cult to Heaven\n\n'Extraterrestrial Travelers' Invited to Kentucky With Tourism Message Beamed Into Space"

According to an unlisted article seen by 9to5Mac, the company wants to show a summary of users\u2019 app reviews before they download a new app.\n\nThe Apple blog says there\u2019s no clear example of what these App Store summaries could look like. However, they will possibly be made by Apple rather than using local processing. This upcoming feature will help users understand the most usual feedback about an app, whether it\u2019s worth buying/downloading or not.\n\nDevelopers will also be able to report if they consider a summary \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Here\u2019s how Apple explains this feature:\n\n\u201cAn app may have a summary that highlights the most common customer feedback and sentiment in user reviews about the app. The summaries are refreshed as new reviews are added. Summaries are available in select countries and regions and for apps with enough reviews to provide a summary. They appear on the app\u2019s product page.

Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAt the moment, it seems Apple is planning a slow rollout of this feature. If it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence in some way, that means the US App Store will be the first to get the App Store summaries, followed by other English-speaking countries.\n\nThis new feature could be part of Apple\u2019s ideas to prevent users from downloading fraudulent apps. Over the years, BGR reported on several copycat and fraudulent apps trying to deceive users and even passing Apple\u2019s App Store review process. If a summary suggests that an app doesn\u2019t work as intended, it might help users steer clear of it.\n\n9to5Mac says a launch is expected soon, as this feature can already be found in the App Store API. We\u2019ll let you know once Apple makes this new feature official."

        "article_content": "October is known as the spookiest month of the year, and some people say there\u2019s less of a boundary between what\u2019s normal and the supernatural.\n\nThat includes a team of investigators based in mid-Michigan called Ghost Contact Paranormal. They may not always be busting ghosts, but they have collected what they say is proof of spirits are still among the living .\n\nHolt resident Benjamin Strongwolf said he used to consider himself a skeptic when it came to the paranormal, but that changed about four years ago when he was talking a walk and tried to speak to the spirit of a woman killed in the area in the 1980s .\n\n\"I went to a local park and was walking around and caught a female spirit come through my camera. \"\n\nStrongwolf said he and his wife created Ghost Contact Paranormal to conduct investigations across the Midwest.\n\nTheir team has traveled to both known haunted locations like the U.S.S. Edson in Bay City and the Stimson Hospital in Eaton Rapids as well as to the homes of people who say they\u2019re dealing with malevolent spirits, offering their services for free.\n\n\"Our first goal is to try to debunk any claim that or experience that they're having, to try to comfort them, and if need be, if there's activity in their home, we have the means to actually remove the spirit,\" he said.\n\nStrongwolf said that can involve using their team's medium to connect with spirits or cleansing the location. When it comes to debunking spirits, he said it can often be electronic devices like smart speakers emitting energy into the space to make it feel haunted.\n\n\"I say this for anybody that has an Alexa device, if you feel like somebody's staring at you, it's the energy that those things are inputting into the air.\"\n\nOne of their most recent investigations took Strongwolf to the Mason Area Historical Museum. He said he captured what might have been a shadow figure on camera as well as what he says was the voice of a spirit.\n\n\"I first heard what sounded like somebody upstairs saying hello, and no one else heard it. There wasn't anybody upstairs,\" he said.\n\n\"When I went back and pulled the recording off my camera, you can clearly hear somebody going, 'Hello.'\"\n\nCourtesy / Ghost Contact Paranormal Strongwolf says his team is divided on if they captured what's known as a shadow figure on the left side of this still. The outline of the figure starts near the picture frame on the wall. What do you think?\n\nStrongwolf said it might be natural to doubt what he\u2019s experienced, but he said sometimes cynics are the best paranormal investigators\n\n\"If there's anybody that's super skeptic, all I say is, join us on a couple investigations, and we'll prove you wrong there,\" he said.\n\nStrongwolf said he plans launch a series of solo investigations looking for spirits in woodland areas.\n\n"

        "article_content": "CALDWELL, Idaho \u2014 Idaho News 6 met up with Western Idaho Paranormal at the Requiem Haunted House in Caldwell for a paranormal investigation.\n\n\n\nThe Requiem is over 100 years old.\n\nMany spirits are said to haunt the floors of the building, including a doctor, a lady in white, and children.\n\nFor more information on the Requiem click here. For more information on Western Idaho Paranormal click here.\n\n(Below is the transcript from the broadcast story)\n\nOne year ago I took you on a Halloween adventure through Haunted World. but this season I wanted to experience a true haunt. I'm your neighborhood reporter Alexander Huddleston and some coworkers and I went on an investigation with Western Idaho Paranormal here at the Requiem in Caldwell.\n\nRELATED: Haunted World still keeping Caldwell spooky.\n\n\"98 percent of investigations are you staring at each other in the dark. You ask questions, you wait for answers,\" said Jennifer Ward, the marketing director for Western Idaho Paranormal.\n\nWard continued, \"Sometimes you get those golden moments where you audibly hear something or you see something out of the corner of your eye and catch it on camera.\"\n\nIt was a hot August night in Caldwell, as I mentally prepared for one of the scariest experiences of my life.\n\nSpeaking with Requiem owner Krista Brower-Wood, she laughed saying, \"We have people tell us they have seen the little boy on the third floor and the old man on the third floor. There is Alyssa on the third floor. She is a lady in white and she hangs out here. There is a doctor down here.\"\n\n\"Down in the basement, we were all sitting down there and within the first five minutes we started playing with the K2 meter, and we started doing an EVP (electronic voice phenomena) session. Per the client, they stated there is a spirit of a doctor downstairs, and when questioning that doctor we immediately got hits. We got very strong hits and they went away. I've been doing this for over a decade, but a good solid K2 meter where they answer you immediately, I have had happen one time,\" explained Western Idaho Paranormal operations manager, Pete Kruger.\n\nHaving watched hours and hours of paranormal investigations myself, there was one method I've always wanted to try and personally requested we did.\n\nKruger went on saying, \"We did that modified EVP session with the Estes Method where you wore a blindfold and had your head stuffed with a spirit box. While I do not put a lot of credence into it and have given an entire presentation on why spirit boxes are junk, the fact that you were able to answer questions without hearing us, without seeing us, was interesting. That has only happened one time.\"\n\nNow having been on both sides, watching investigations might be fun and creepy, but let me tell you it does not even come close to being there for the experience."

        "article_content": "As India continues its rapid development and is set to become a USD 7 trillion economy by 2030, businesses face immense pressure to innovate quickly and operate more efficiently than ever before. Due to the current demand to outpace competitors and respond quickly to customers, businesses today operate in a hyper-evolving environment with the need for rapid innovation, increased agility, and real-time customer care.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen it comes to the application development process, for many years, only two options were available to organizations: purchasing ready-made solutions off the shelf or employing skilled programmers to create solutions from scratch. This has changed with the introduction of low-code/no-code (LCNC) development platforms that have revolutionized how businesses develop applications by making the process easy and more available to a wider section of the workforce These platforms can lead to cost reductions of up to 70% compared to traditional application development methods. In fact, a recent survey from Gartner indicates that by 2025, 87% of new applications developed by enterprises will use low-code or no-code technologies.\n\nLCNC platforms have changed the traditional development approach that could only be implemented by technical users. Now, both technical and non-technical users are able to make applications without additional coding knowledge. So, these platforms allow citizen developers to rise and become leaders in their business processes and workflows. These platforms empower \"citizen developers\" not only to adopt new techniques and strategies but also to get involved in the whole process of application development.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nUnderstanding Low-Code/No-Code Platforms\n\nFirst of all, both low-code and no-code platforms are programming customization techniques for a high level of expertise in IT, and these two differ in the extent of expertise in information technology required. Low-code development platforms offer a more user-friendly coding experience, which means that a partial amount of programming skill will be required. Thus, the developers are free to do their part of coding as well as to create applications in a personalized manner that meets the unique requirements of the user's business. On the flip side, no-code platforms are completely free from coding as they support those with no technical skills to design applications. Beyond this, businesses can also develop applications using the drag-and-drop method without employing any programmers.\n\nLCNC platforms are designed to make application development faster and more efficient. Whether automating workflows, streamlining processes, or improving customer experiences, LCNC platforms provide the flexibility and speed businesses need to stay competitive. The growing adoption of LCNC platforms has led to impressive market growth. According to Forrester, the combined low-code and digital process automation (DPA) market reached $13.2 billion by the end of 2023, with a projected growth rate of 21% since 2019. This surge is driven largely by the institutionalization of low-code in IT, with 87% of enterprise developers now using low-code platforms for some development work. Furthermore, Forrester predicts this growth to continue, with the market potentially reaching $30 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing adoption of citizen development strategies.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFuture Growth Potential\n\nWith the rise of generative AI market growth at an annual rate of 36% according to Forrester, LCNC platforms, being inherently flexible and AI-compatible, are poised to benefit from this trend. A similar AI-driven explosion in citizen development could push the LCNC and DPA market to $50 billion by 2028. However, a shift toward high-code methods due to AI-infused development platforms might slow LCNC growth, aligning it with the broader software market's 11% annual growth rate.\n\nThe Rise of Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nOne of the most significant impact of LCNC platforms is the rise of citizen developers\u2014non-technical users who now actively participate in application development. These individuals, often business process owners, possess deep knowledge of their domain but lack formal coding expertise. With LCNC tools, they can develop applications that address their unique challenges, driving innovation within their departments.\n\nThousands of companies are using low-code platforms to develop business-critical solutions. As businesses mature, however, some may encounter nonstandard practices that basic low-code platforms can't address. Borrowing development practices from core development, such as unit testing or build quality control, can help improve a solution\u2019s quality and reduce team effort.\n\nApplications Across Industries\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe versatility of LCNC platforms has led to their adoption across a wide range of industries. For instance, in supply chain management, businesses can develop applications to enhance visibility, traceability, and efficiency. In manufacturing, LCNC tools are powering smart factories by integrating IoT networks and automating workflows.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn finance and accounting, LCNC platforms enable businesses to automate complex tasks such as loan approvals and risk assessments. Human resources teams are using them to streamline hiring processes and develop training programs, while even IT departments benefit from faster application development and increased agility.\n\nLCNC platforms play a significant role in business process automation (BPA), complementing robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. RPA bots can follow rules set by citizen developers, reducing bottlenecks and increasing efficiency.\n\nLow-code visual software development is a powerful solution for modernizing legacy systems at reduced cost and with minimal risk. Low-code platforms provide developers with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface through which they find it easier to accelerate their software development and minimize inefficiencies accompanied by security vulnerabilities typical for traditional systems. In general, legacy applications, including ERP systems, happen to be quite cumbersome to update and not cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHowever, low-code platforms enable organizations to modernize such systems by integrating cloud-based innovations and extending them with modern web and mobile interfaces without the need to undertake costly customized development. It also helps in the gradual phasing out of existing obsolete applications without causing a jolt.\n\nAn important feature of low-code platforms is the democratization of software development, wherein the complexity of coding work is abstracted into more user-friendly and visual interfaces. This enables the possibility of collaboration among developers with varying skill levels, accelerates time-to-market, and reduces the risk of error. In addition, the built-in security and compliance features ensure that applications are better designed and show adherence to specific industry standards, which enhances the resilience of digital infrastructure.\n\nSuch low-code platforms offer pre-built connectors and APIs that connect easily to legacy systems for easy access to data and, thus, even modernization becomes a simplified exercise. Organizations can unlock actual new opportunities for innovation by embracing low-code development, thus propelling business growth in this fast-paced digital landscape."

        "article_content": "When it comes to antivirus software, small business\u2019 needs often fall in an in-between space: Personal antivirus tools such as McAfee or Kaspersky may not be robust enough, while enterprise solutions are too complicated and expensive. Fortunately, there are antivirus solutions tailored to the needs of smaller companies, so we\u2019ve rounded up our six top choices of the best antivirus software for small businesses.\n\nTop antivirus software for small businesses comparison\n\nBesides price, there are many other factors to consider when choosing the best small business antivirus software.

Fortunately, Norton offers online chat support 24/7 for English-speaking customers. There\u2019s also a large knowledge base that you can consult for self-help before reaching out to customer service. Norton\u2019s small business plans bundle together many features, including password management and cloud backup. Why I chose Norton I chose Norton because it offers 24/7 customer support in addition to an all-in-one security platform. It\u2019s not big enough to scale with your business the way some other options on the list can, but it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re a true small business that needs to protect 20 devices and under. Pricing Norton Small Business: Starts at $59.99 a year for 6 devices.\n\nStarts at $59.99 a year for 6 devices. Norton Small Business Premium: Starts at $149.99 a year for 10 devices.

Trend Micro offers two tiers of software: Trend Vision One for Small Businesses, and Trend Vision One for larger companies. The small business version can protect not just endpoints but also workloads and cloud apps as well with both endpoint detection response and extended detection response. Why I chose Trend Micro I selected Trend Micro because of its multiple cyber threat tools that promote early detection and elimination. I also appreciate that its many plans can scale with a small business as it becomes a midsize business or even a large enterprise. It also offers managed services through partnerships with third-party providers if you\u2019re interested in outsourcing your IT work.

Ability to run simulated attacks on endpoints.\n\nESET: Best for scalability ESET is antivirus software for small businesses that offers five different pricing plans to choose from. This gives growing businesses a lot of runway to upgrade as their cybersecurity needs grow. A handful of add-ons increases the flexibility of the pricing tiers even further. Even the entry-level plan covers all types of endpoints and device control, while upper tier plans have additional features such as full disk encryption and patch management. Why I chose ESET I picked ESET because the platform offers four pricing plans and three add-ons for small and medium-sized businesses, giving companies lots of flexibility to scale as they grow. It\u2019s also relatively easy to manage \u2014 though you\u2019ll want a dedicated IT administrator to fully take advantage of the cybersecurity features offered by the more expensive plans.

This small business antivirus software only charges $134.99 per year for up to 25 devices, which costs about the same (or less!) than what many competitors charge for 5-10 devices. The bundle also includes an unlimited VPN, a password manager, and a device cleaner, so you\u2019re getting more than just antivirus software at that price. If you need an even lower cost option, then check out our list of the best free endpoint detection software. Why I chose Avira I opted for Avira because it offers one of the most affordable pricing plans, allowing small businesses owners to protect up to 25 devices at a decent cost. I also like that it bundles additional features into its plan, like a VPN, instead of breaking them off into separate paid add-ons like some competitors.

Block trackers and adware while internet browsing.\n\nMicrosoft Defender: Best for Windows-only systems If your small business only uses Windows devices, then Microsoft Defender may be sufficient for your basic antivirus needs. In fact, Defender already comes built into Windows 11 and 12, and you can even get it bundled in with other Microsoft apps like Word and Excel through the 365 E3 and E5 software packages. While you can use Defender on other types of operating systems and devices, such as Macs and iPhones, you\u2019ll probably find it easier to set up other options on this list on non-Windows endpoints. Why I chose Microsoft Defender I chose Microsoft Defender because it\u2019s often the most seamless option for small businesses that only use the Windows operating system. If you opt for one of the 365 E5 software bundles, you\u2019ll get Defender alongside your other Microsoft apps, so you don\u2019t even have to set up a separate subscription.

Pricing plans are difficult to navigate. Often bundled together with other Microsoft tools. Lacks advanced protection and features of competitors. Integrates with other security solutions from Microsoft.\n\nHow do I choose the best antivirus software for my small business?\n\nTo choose the best small business antivirus software, first consider your needs as well as your budget. Bear in mind that bundled plans that include additional features (such as a VPN and password manager) may save you more money in the long run than purchasing each tool \u00e0 la carte. Use your budget and must-have features to narrow down your options to a shortlist, or start with the six platforms listed here.\n\nThen it\u2019s time to take advantage of free trials so that you can test the software for yourself. I always strongly recommend hands-on testing of the software before committing to an annual contract. You should also schedule demo calls with the sales team if you have additional questions during or after the trial.\n\nIf you still aren\u2019t certain about your choice of antivirus software, then you might want to try a platform that offers a month-to-month option, such as Avira and Bitdefender. That way, you aren\u2019t locked into a year-long contract if you ultimately decide to change your mind.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo choose the best small business antivirus software, I consulted product documentation and users reviews. I considered features such as endpoint protection options, phishing and anti-malware measures, included VPNs and password managers, and automatic software updates. I also weighed other factors such as price plans, scalability, free trials, customer service available, ease of use, and user interface design."
