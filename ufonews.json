        "article_content": "An office in the Pentagon investigated UFOs\u2014and the paranormal\u2014over a decade ago, segueing into a long saga leading to Congressional hearings and breathless news stories today. But the real story looks more like former defense officials pushing their personal mythology, rather than any cover-up of aliens\n\nAfter a long hiatus of systematic U.S. government\u2013affiliated investigations into UFOs, a Pentagon office quietly resumed such efforts in 2008. Called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP), it was funded to the tune of $22 million in total. The life\u2014and cancellation four years later\u2014of this Defense Intelligence Agency program has featured in congressional hearings, UFO \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims and renewed public uproar about aliens. But the real story is more sordid than sensational.\n\nIn 2022 the U.S. Department of Defense established the brand-new and separate All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate military reports of UFOs, now called unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. Currently AARO offers a unique chance for the government to get this UFO thing right once and for all\u2014but not in quite the way that more hard-line alien believers might wish.\n\nThe new office has its hands full. Last year congressional hearings heard claims of alien technology recoveries and a supposed decades-long cover-up of ET\u2019s presence on Earth. Such assertions fill the new book Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs, by former military counterintelligence officer Luis Elizondo, attracting renewed notice among podcasters and serious news outlets alike.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nInvestigating these unverifiable fables about aliens should be scrapped as a fool\u2019s errand for AARO, which earlier this year released a historical review demolishing this long-running conspiracy theory. The office\u2019s real value, from a technical standpoint, lies in resolving UFO sighting reports with the very latest technology and tools, supplementing time-honored fact-checking and investigation, and showing how UFOs can be tracked and resolved in real time using high-tech sensors, rather than relying on the suboptimal witness testimonials that fill bookshelves and cable-news specials.\n\nGovernment-themed conspiracy theories have been part of the UFO milieu for decades, but recent testimonies by \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to congressional committees have given these accounts a hitherto unparalleled air of authenticity. Far from being a scientific sea change, however, as longtime scholars of UFO claims we regard them as having elements closer to religion, with the same core group of advocates\u2014including some former AAWSAP insiders\u2014pushing the \u201cnonhuman intelligence\u201d narrative of hidden aliens or interdimensional beings.\n\nAAWSAP was officially meant to research future aerospace threats but was a de facto UFO/paranormal investigation effort, a fact affirmed in the AARO historical report. Controversy has surrounded the office since the publication of a credulous 2017 New York Times article identified it by the moniker \u201cAdvanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\u201d (AATIP). The acronym soup confusion regarding the name has been exacerbated by Elizondo, who co-opted the AATIP label for his own, informal follow-on effort at the Pentagon after AAWSAP\u2019s termination in 2012.\n\nAAWSAP\u2019s output included 38 \u201cDefense Intelligence Reference Documents\u201d produced by scientists contracted by mogul and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow, along with other reports described in two books. The latter reports reference as-yet unreleased databases of international UFO cases, investigations and findings from the \u201cspooky\u201d Skinwalker Ranch in Utah once owned by Bigelow, and monthly reports supposedly delivered to the DIA, along with a 494-page \u201c10 Month Report\u201d replete with charts, graphs and findings. There are good reasons to harbor doubts about these reports\u2019 quality and objectivity.\n\nElizondo\u2019s effort, despite his countless mass media and podcast appearances, has yielded no publicly accessed findings or deliverables proving any claims about a UFO cover-up. These may come to light, but \u201cAARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG [U.S. government] is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite a lack of evidence,\u201d that office concluded in its recent report.\n\nThis entire saga shows how pseudoscientific thinking can metastasize in a positive feedback loop, ensnaring not only scientists with paranormal inclinations but also government officials. This was bemoaned by the former head of AARO, Sean Kirkpatrick, who remarked that these officials are tasked with matters of national urgency\u2014a responsibility necessitating a mindset committed to objective investigation and analysis. Some of these officials are on the record casting AARO as part of the \u201ccover-up.\u201d Indeed, the UFO belief system has long ago morphed into a type of faith requiring no evidence.\n\nThe fact that officials harboring evidence-deficient beliefs regarding extraterrestrials and \u201chigh strangeness\u201d (a term first popularized in the early 1970s by ufologists to describe certain bizarre and seemingly absurd elements of some UFO and \u201calien\u201d encounters) are entrusted with national security matters should give one pause. America\u2019s adversaries, to the extent that they are paying attention to the UFO mess, might well regard it as yet another avenue to undermine American institutions\u2014somewhat reflecting a CIA panel\u2019s 1953 warning about potential Soviet exploitation of the genre.\n\nOn a more positive note, ufology is now in vogue among historians keen to understand the mythical nature of the problem and how it relates to historical waves of aerial phenomena reports. Because of how modern media, and especially now digital media, magnify the voices of breathless advocates, sundry frauds and scientists with a penchant for the paranormal, the UFO phenomenon from 1947 onward has acquired much greater gravitas than prior scares and waves, some of which predate it by centuries.\n\nMany serious people dismiss UFOs as a fringe interest or a pop culture distraction. Yes, they are. Yet we maintain, along with an increasing number of scholars, that there is much to be learned from studying UFO sightings, flaps and waves. While our own view is that UFOs, or UAP, emphatically do not represent any truly anomalous physical phenomena such as an extraterrestrial presence, this nevertheless does not consign ufology to insignificance. We should explore its meaning rather than ceding it to sensationalistic advocates employing shoddy methodologies and pushing quasi-religious, otherworldly stories. AARO and academia are thus tasked with an important responsibility that could yield original and fascinating developments into how and why people interpret and react to things they see in the sky.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

Explore the details of this fascinating extraterrestrial event.\n\nThe trend of information about UFO discoveries making their way from classified government documents to the general public continues.\n\nAccording to a report published by Fox News, the very first image of a mysterious UFO shot down over Canadian airspace last year has finally surfaced. The grainy, almost ghostly photo, which seems to be a photocopy of an email printout, shows a cylindrical object hovering menacingly in the sky just days before a U.S. fighter jet was ordered to take it down. This extraterrestrial drama unfolded in February 2023, as the unidentified craft drifted from Alaska into Canadian skies, sending military forces scrambling.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8BREAKING: FIRST IMAGE OF UFO SHOT DOWN OVER ALASKA RELEASED\n\n\n\nCanada has unveiled the first-ever image of the UFO downed during a joint US-Canada mission in February 2023. The grainy photo shows a circular, white object shot by a US Air Force F-22 fighter jet.\n\n\n\nMilitary\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9ZxmC7QBI5 \u2014 Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) September 24, 2024\n\nThe high-altitude object, detected by NORAD at around 40,000 feet, sent shockwaves through the defense forces on both sides of the border. Canadian authorities were tight-lipped at first, but thanks to an information request from CTVNews to Canada\u2019s Department of National Defence, the photo was finally released to the public. The official description for the UFO is as follows, \u201csmall, metallic balloon with a tethered payload.\u201d\n\nApparently the same object, and/or additional UFOs similar to the one that was shot down, was spotted at least three times between February 10 and February 12 last year. And while many recall the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over South Carolina on February 4, 2023, reports state that the UFO taken down in Canada was much smaller that the aforementioned spy technology.\n\nThe timing of this revelation is uncanny, given the string of UFO encounters that have been making headlines this year. From strange metallic orbs spotted over California to mysterious lights dancing across European skies, and strange flying objects darting across the horizons in Brazil. Overall, it seems 2024 has been a year filled with unexplained aerial activity.\n\nCheck out the images of the UFO above."

He is a foundational figure in the national pantheon and leader of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as it settled Boston.\n\nWinthrop\u2019s sensational account of \"a great light in the night\" was witnessed by a group of \"sober, discreet\" and \"credible persons\" over Muddy River in Boston \u2014 a trickle of a creek that today wraps around American sports landmark Fenway Park.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST PLANTED APPLES IN THE COLONIES: WILLIAM BLAXTON, ECCENTRIC SETTLER\n\nWinthrop's leadership of the fledgling Massachusetts colony shaped the destiny of the United States, established more than a century after his death.\n\nHe has serious street cred in academia, making his spectacular record of unexplained phenomena all the more remarkable.\n\n\"John Winthrop\u2019s journal has long served as a cornerstone of Massachusetts historical scholarship,\" the Massachusetts Historical Society writes in a recent look at the Puritan's UFO sightings.\n\n\"He diligently recorded the events of his life, along with the trials and tribulations of the people of the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the first 19 years of its existence.\"\n\n\"John Winthrop\u2019s journal has long served as a cornerstone of \u2026 historical scholarship.\" \u2014 Massachusetts Historical Society\n\nWinthrop\u2019s incredible tales of aerial phenomena in early America, long unknown, generated sudden interest in recent years, after federal government and military officials admitted that it\u2019s been studying UFOs for decades.\n\nStories of paranormal and unexplained phenomena were effectively mainstreamed for academics and serious analysts.\n\nFew Americans were more serious than Winthrop.\n\nHe was a devout Christian and an industrious nation builder. Despite the hardship of carving a new civilization from the wilderness, and governing a new society, he dutifully kept almost daily records of life in the colony for nearly two decades.\n\nOne 2005 biography is titled \"John Winthrop: America's Forgotten Founding Father.\"\n\n\"His energies seemed prodigious and inexhaustible.\"\n\n\"His energies seemed prodigious and inexhaustible,\" PBS Frontline said of Winthrop.\n\n\"Repeatedly elected governor, he was chiefly responsible for maintaining civic and social order.\"\n\nBorn to establish \u2018a city upon a hill\u2019\n\nJohn Winthrop was born on Jan. 12, 1587 or 1588, in Edwardstone, Suffolk County, England, to Adam and Anne (Browne) Winthrop.\n\nBoth his parents came from prosperous families, according to various accounts.\n\nHe began journal-keeping in 1605 while still a teenager, chronicling his growing devotion to Christ. His faith was increasingly at odds with national sentiment after King Charles I, an Anglican sympathetic to Roman Catholicism, gained the throne in 1625.\n\nWinthrop departed for the New World in the spring of 1630 aboard the Arbella with an expedition of Puritans to establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony, about 35 miles north of the Plymouth Colony settled by the Pilgrims in 1620.\n\n\"For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill.\" \u2014 John Winthrop, 1630\n\nWinthrop issued a message on the ship that has echoed through American history.\n\nIt\u2019s remembered today as the \"city upon a hill\" sermon \u2014 inspired by several biblical passages and delivered to a daring people fleeing decrepit old Europe to create a New World in service of Christ.\n\n\"For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us,\" Winthrop said.\n\n\"So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world.\"\n\nThe \"city upon a hill\" sermon helped establish the concept of American exceptionalism \u2014 a new society that would be a \"model of Christian charity\" for the world to admire and emulate.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORK\n\nThe phrase \"a city upon a hill\" has been widely quoted by following generations, most notably by President Ronald Reagan, who cited Winthrop by name in his farewell address.\n\n\"I've spoken of the shining city all my political life,\" Reagan said to the nation on Jan. 11, 1989.\n\n\"In my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace \u2026 That's how I saw it, and see it still.\"\n\nHe reported mystifying events that defy explanation.\n\nWinthrop was God-fearing, intrepid, faithful, hard-working and diligent \u2014 serious in faith and deed. Few people in American history had less time, inclination or motive to devote to fantasy or foolishness.\n\n\u2018Great light in the night\u2019\n\nWinthrop\u2019s report of an eerie UFO encounter on a winter night in Boston is sandwiched between perfunctory passages about business dealings with the natives.\n\nThe subject turned suddenly.\n\n\"In this year one James Everell, a sober, discreet man, and two others, saw a great light in the night at Muddy River,\" Winthrop wrote on March 1, 1639.\n\n\"When it stood still, it flamed up, and was about three yards square; when it ran it was contracted into the figure of a swine.\"\n\n\"James Everell, a sober, discreet man, and two others, saw a great light in the night at Muddy River.\" \u2014 John Winthrop\n\nWinthrop went on, \"It ran swift as an arrow toward Charlton [Charlestown] and up and down about two or three hours. They were come down in their lighter [a small barge] about a mile, and, when it was over, they found themselves carried quite back against the tide to the place they came from. Divers[e] other persons saw the same light, after, about the same place.\"\n\n\"That's stunning,\" UFO researcher Nick Pope told Fox News Digital after hearing the story for the first time.\n\nPope is a former UFO investigator for the U.K. Ministry of Defense and contributor to \"Ancient Aliens\" on The History Channel.\n\nSeveral sources say ignis fatuus, a spark of swamp gas, is the likely cause of the strange light.\n\nANGELS IN OUR MIDST? ONE SCIENTIST EXPLAINS WHY THE BIBLE SUPPORTS EXTRATERRESTRIALS\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t explain how the phantom light raced across the river \u2014 or why Everell and the other men in the boat wound up a mile downstream.\n\n\"Most UFO witnesses, like Everell or Winthrop, are serious, sober individuals.\" \u2014 UFO expert Nick Pope\n\n\"Some researchers would interpret this as a possible alien abduction if it happened today,\" authors Jacques Vallee and Chris Aubeck wrote in \"Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times.\"\n\nWinthrop reported two more UFO sightings in 1644, the first on Jan. 18.\n\n\"About midnight, three men, coming in a boat to Boston, saw two lights arise out of the water near the north point of the town cove, in form like a man, and went at a small distance to the town, and so to the south point, and there vanished away.\"\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO ROWED WASHINGTON ACROSS THE DELAWARE ON CHRISTMAS: SAILOR-SOLDIER JOHN GLOVER\n\nA week later another supernatural encounter was \"seen by many,\" he wrote.\n\n\"A light like the moon arose about the N.E. point in Boston, and met the former at Nottles Island, and there they closed in one, and then parted, and closed and parted diverse times, and so went over the hill in the island and vanished. Sometimes they shot out flames and sometimes sparkles.\"\n\nWinthrop never mentioned the events again.\n\nHis journal was not published until 1825. The mysterious passages were ignored amid the insight into colonial history culled from his voluminous writings.\n\nThe eerie objects remain unidentified today, yet come from one of the most trusted sources in American scholarship.\n\n\"I think it speaks to the fact that those skeptics don\u2019t like to admit, but most UFO witnesses, like Everell or Winthrop, are serious, sober individuals,\" said Pope.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t surprise me you have these very historical figures seeing these things.

        "article_content": "DENVER (KDVR) \u2014 When people think about UFO sightings, it is often imagined as someone alone in a large field of corn with flashing green lights and crop circles. Although rare, UFO sitings are reported in hundreds of places across the U.S., including major cities.\n\nSome of these cities are in proximity to notorious UFO areas like Roswell, New Mexico or Area 51, but most of them are in major cities scattered across the U.S. With millions of eyes in these places, it\u2019s no wonder the sighting rate is higher.\n\nMoose swims alongside paddleboarders at Chatfield Reservoir\n\nBetUS gathered data from the National UFO Reporting Center and composited it based on sightings per city, state and date tracking back from 2013.\n\nThe top 20 visited cities include:\n\nPhoenix, Arizona \u2013 323 UFO sightings New York, New York \u2013 313 UFO sightings Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 309 UFO sightings Portland, Oregon \u2013 279 UFO sightings Tucson, Arizona \u2013 244 UFO sightings Boise, Idaho \u2013 236 UFO sightings Los Angeles, California \u2013 222 UFO sightings San Diego, California \u2013 220 UFO sightings Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2013 216 UFO sightings Seattle, Washington \u2013 209 UFO sightings Orlando, Florida \u2013 210 UFO sightings Denver, Colorado \u2013 177 UFO sightings Myrtle Beach, South Carolina \u2013 171 UFO sightings Chicago, Illinois \u2013 167 UFO sightings Austin, Texas \u2013 164 UFO sightings Colorado Springs, Colorado \u2013 160 UFO sightings Jacksonville, Florida \u2013150 UFO sightings Spokane, Washington \u2013 146 UFO sightings Columbus, Ohio \u2013 141 UFO sightings Indianapolis, Indiana \u2013 139 UFO sightings\n\nOut of the 20 cities listed, two Colorado cities made the cut. Colorado Springs is one of the smaller, if not smallest cities, on this list, but it still held a high amount of sightings possibly due to the amount of air traffic with the military bases there. Denver, not notorious for its UFO encounters, ranked 12th on the list. Maybe those tunnels under the Denver International Airport aren\u2019t so empty after all.\n\nDenver\u2019s biggest September snowstorm on record: A look back\n\nAnother notable inclusion was Arizona, which was featured in the top five twice. Nevada\u2019s featuring in the top three comes as no surprise due to it containing Area 51, making it possibly the most famous UFO-encountering state in the country.\n\n\u201dThe possibility of extraterrestrial life forms existing out there lives rent-free in the minds of many as they gaze at the night sky and ponder, \u2018Are we alone in this universe?\u2019 This eternal question fuels not just scientific curiosity but also our sense of wonder and imagination. Our rankings have identified when and where in the U.S. you are most likely to see a UFO and find answers to such a profound question,\u201d said Andres Vargas, head content editor at BetUS.\n\nThey also offered a bit of advice for those trying to spot UFOs in Colorado. Head to the quieter outskirts of the city around 10 p.m. and find a high point. The elevation and clear skies of Colorado create the perfect scenario for spotting extraterrestrial visitors.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

        "article_content": "An unassuming field next to a housing estate in Stoke-on-Trent is taking centre stage in the latest alien blockbuster - and it's inspired by true events.\n\nThe new stage production, Bright Lights Over Bentilee, focuses on the event in which dozens of people on an estate in the town claimed to have witnessed bright lights in the sky and a UFO landing in the field next to their homes.\n\nSky News went to meet playwright and former Coronation Street star Deborah McAndrew, to discuss what happened on the 2nd of September 1967 and why she felt compelled to bring the story to life.\n\n\"What they saw was a large red saucer-shaped object about the size of a car,\" she explained.\n\nImage: Some in the community claim they saw a large red saucer-shaped object about the size of a car in the sky. Pic: Andrew Billington Photography\n\nOn that night, just after 9pm there were eight separate sightings from people claiming to have seen a mysterious \"glowing craft\" which silently flew over the heads of residents.\n\nHousewives, children, even a police officer said they saw it, that it changed colour and then dropped down into scrubland.\n\nImage: Former Corrie star Deborah McAndrew said she believes what people told her they saw\n\nThey claimed, as they set about searching through the fields for it, it then \"took off and was bright white like a car headlight\u2026 and then just disappeared\".\n\nMcAndrew found herself delving into what happened after coming across some old news footage of interviews with residents at the time.\n\nImage: Pic: Andrew Billington Photography\n\nImage: Pic: Andrew Billington Photography\n\nFascinated by how locals seemingly went back to work the next day and carried on as normal, she started doing her own digging which included speaking with one of the young kids who'd chased it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When nothing happens it just gradually fades into myth... until some random playwright phones you up 50 years later and says 'do you want to tell me about that UFO you saw?'\" McAndrew explained.\n\nImage: Pic: Andrew Billington Photography\n\nWhile she admits \"there's no way of knowing now what it was\" the writer says \"when people tell me they've seen things, I believe them\".\n\nWhile doubters might speculate that, coming at the time of the space race, locals perhaps might have confused a UFO with a satellite, McAndrew points out: \"It was a landing, it didn't just fly in the sky, it came down and then took off again.\"\n\nCould TV shows be partly to blame? As sci-fi related culture took off, the MoD saw a gradual increase in reports of UFO sightings.\n\nImage: Pic: Andrew Billington Photography\n\nActress Polly Lister, who plays a housewife called Beverley in the play, says: \"It would be very hard to completely write it off because every single one of those people, I believe, is telling the truth of what they saw.\"\n\nEddy Westbury, who also stars in the drama, says: \"You hear a lot of things people have seen in America... this one is particularly interesting purely because of all the accounts... completely different people, in different places... it wasn't like [they] saw a green man jumping out of a vehicle, literally what they saw, what they experienced, they all seem to line up.\"\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nLady Gaga still thinking about Harley Quinn\n\nComedian Janey Godley reveals end-of-life care\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nDid locals see something 'out of this world?'\n\nNo doubt the truth is out there somewhere, but until then, they'll have to make-do with the dramatised version which follows the community fall-out from that night.\n\nClaybody Theatre's Bright Lights Over Bentilee runs until 12 October at The Dipping House, Stoke."

        "article_content": "15 years ago, this movie took the world by surprise \u2026 and scared everyone who saw it\n\nFifteen years ago, on September 25, 2009, Paranormal Activity was released in theaters and scared the pants out of audiences everywhere. Even before the movie\u2019s premiere, it had already become legendary. Instead of debuting via a massive theatrical release rollout, the micro-budgeted movie was screened in college towns across the country to drum up word of mouth.\n\nIt worked. Thanks to the (somewhat still new) popularity of Facebook and the prominence of texting on phones, Paranormal Activity didn\u2019t need a marketing campaign. Frightened audiences told everyone they knew about the scary movie they just watched. Soon, the internet was ablaze with word of this new movie that didn\u2019t have stars anyone had heard of before.\n\nThe birth of a new horror franchise\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nFilmed in the found-footage style, the movie centers around a young couple, Micah and Katie, who are determined to capture the paranormal activity happening in their house. But it\u2019s not just a ghost that\u2019s haunting them, it\u2019s a demon. Even worse, the more attention they give to it, the stronger and more active it becomes.\n\nParamount realized Paranormal Activity was destined to become a hit and picked it up for wide distribution. When the movie finally premiered in theaters across the country, audiences were terrified. When speaking to Empire, Jordan Peele recounted his experience seeing the movie in theaters. \u201cWhen the s*** hit the fan, Katie is dragged out of the room screaming. The audience absolutely lost it,\u201d the horror icon said.\n\nSince then, Paranormal Activity has received six sequels and has become one of the most prominent examples of found-footage movies ever. It\u2019s also just as scary as it was in 2009, and aside from the dated use of the camcorder, it still looks and feels terrifying.\n\nParanormal Activity was genuinely scary to a desensitized audience\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nPeele isn\u2019t the only one who was horrified by Paranormal Activity. In 2009 Roger Ebert even gave the movie 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \u201cIt illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x.\u201d\n\nThe movie was so scary that its trailers even used audience footage from its screenings to show how horrified moviegoers were. By the end of its box office run, Paranormal Activity had raked in over $193 million.\n\nSimilarly to The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity gets a lot of its horror from what audiences don\u2019t see. Strange sounds and small movements captured by the camera seem trivial, but when the movie\u2019s pacing is flawless, each small instance can feel monumental and the anticipation that builds between them is undeniable.\n\nAs the movie continues, the stakes get higher and the hauntings more intense. But the film never uses special effects or has some haggard-looking ghost running around. Even its \u201cbig moments\u201d are subtle compared to other horror movies. For example, at one point Micah scatters baby powder around the floor to see if something really is walking through their house at night. When he turns the lights on, the prints left behind look like some kind of lizard or bird.\n\nEven as someone who doesn\u2019t believe in the paranormal, this movie still gets to me. It utilizes our natural fears, like being in a big, empty, dark house at night \u2014 and then hearing a strange sound in the hallway.\n\nBut the movie definitely requires some patience. If you like being scared by CGI-generated monsters and loud musical cues, then this probably isn\u2019t the movie for you. But if you turn off all the lights in a quiet room late at night and watch Paranormal Activity, you will discover just how horrifying it is.\n\nParanormal Activity ushered in the paranormal horror era\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nThe success of Paranormal Activity was so massive it created a sea change in the horror genre. When the film premiered initially in 2007 and then had its full release in 2009, horror was in its full-blown \u201ctorture porn\u201d phase, where filmmakers were doing everything they could to have the goriest and grossest torture movie possible. The Saw franchise, Hostel, and The Hills Have Eyes reboots were proving to be box office hits, and The Human Centipede had just made its debut at FrightFest.\n\nBut after Paranormal Activity outgrossed all those movies (Saw II for example was the highest-grossing Saw film, making just under $148 million, which was $40 million less than Paranormal Activity), Hollywood realized a new horror trend may have just emerged. The torture porn trend ended almost immediately after Paranormal Activity, and by the following year, the paranormal era was hitting high gear and gore was gone.\n\nAfter Paranormal Activity, more paranormal horror films followed, including numerous Paranormal Activity sequels, as well as Insidious and The Conjuring, both of which would spawn their own massive franchises. There was also a wave of other low-budget found-footage paranormal movies that, while never making a huge splash, became notable hits within the horror community, like Hell House LLC, Grave Encounters, and The Taking of Deborah Logan.\n\nNow could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParanormal Activity was made and released during a period of massive change. Social media had just become a widely used tool by society, and smartphones had just started rolling out to the general public.\n\nNew technology that wasn\u2019t around at the time of its release could be used to make a really fun modern Paranormal Activity sequel or reboot. Between Nest cams, doorbell cameras, smartphones, drones, and even dashcams, there are so many new tools that could be used to reinvent the found-footage genre and add new touches.\n\nThe streaming era could also be helpful, since studios don\u2019t need to invest as much money into theatrical releases and instead can release low-budget movies on their streaming platforms for much less investment. With how cheap the Paranormal Activity movies are to make, they could be perfect for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Shudder, or even Tubi.\n\nAnother reason why now could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity movie is that belief in the paranormal has actually risen in recent years. There\u2019s a lot of really touchy topics that have probably caused this \u2014 largely America\u2019s regression into fanaticism and conspiratorial thinking \u2014 but modern studies have shown some shocking results. In 2021, it was reported that 57% of Americans believe in ghosts, and in 2023 another study revealed that over half of Americans think they\u2019ve actually been visited by a ghost.\n\nThese findings might make some of us question our fellow Americans and their belief systems, but for Hollywood and anyone wanting to make a paranormal movie to scare the crap out of people\u2026now seems to be the perfect time.\n\nYou can watch Paranormal Activity on Max."

While excavating the remains of a Gaulish town, they unearthed a little glass bottle hidden inside an earthenware pot, according to the BBC.\n\nThe bottle, which had been hidden for nearly 200 years, carried a note from a prior archaeologist who had worked at the same location. Guillaume Blondel, the chief of Eu's Regional Archaeology Service, was sent in to investigate the findings. Blondel opened the bottle and read the note.\n\nThe message reads: \"PJ Feret, a native of Dieppe, member of various intellectual societies, carried out excavations here in January 1825. He continues his investigations in this vast area known as the Cite de Limes or Caesar's Camp.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: facebook.com/villedeu\n\nPJ Feret was a local notable, and municipal records confirm that he conducted a first dig at the site 200 years ago.\n\nArchaeologists and historians are both excited and fascinated by the discovery. The message could provide insight into the history of the Gaulish village as well as the archaeological procedures used in the early nineteenth century.\n\n\"It was the kind of vial that women used to wear around their necks containing smelling salts,\" team leader Guillaume Blondel, who heads the archaeological service for the town of Eu, told BBC News.\n\n\"It was an absolutely magical moment,\" said Mr Blondel. \"We knew there had been excavations here in the past, but to find this message from 200 years ago... it was a total surprise.\n\n\"Sometimes you see these time capsules left behind by carpenters when they build houses. But it's very rare in archaeology. Most archaeologists prefer to think that there won't be anyone coming after them because they've done all the work.\""

        "article_content": "Understanding that the development of Caleb Williams is at or near the top of Shane Waldron\u2019s job description, the Chicago Bears can share optimism in the fact the rookie quarterback has improved each of the last two weeks.\n\nWilliams\u2019 completion percentage, yards and yards per attempt have increased in the two losses since the season-opening victory against the Tennessee Titans, and he\u2019s coming off a 363-yard effort against the Colts on Sunday in Indianapolis that included two touchdown passes.\n\nWilliams looks to be improving incrementally, and while it\u2019s never going to be a linear progression, he already looks more comfortable than any Bears rookie quarterback has in a long time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of new as we all know,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWide receivers, running backs, quarterback, the offensive linemen and all these different parts. Us constantly having the encouragement mindset, but also the positivity that we see on the actual film \u2014 if you actually watch it and not get into all the emotions of the game.\n\n\u201cYes, we do need to get it going a little bit more efficiently than we are. But the growth and positivity that we have within the film that we\u2019ve seen and things like that over these past couple of weeks (is encouraging).\u201d\n\nThe overall picture for the offense, though, has been murky \u2014 to put it nicely. Waldron\u2019s unit has struggled to form any kind of identity. The offense has been particularly bad in a handful of areas and hasn\u2019t scored enough. It\u2019s a familiar movie and without improvements will offer a familiar ending.\n\nThe Bears have three offensive touchdowns, tying them for last in the NFL with the Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers. The Philadelphia Eagles have yet to score in the first quarter this season. The Bears and Sunday\u2019s opponent at Soldier Field, the Los Angeles Rams, are next worst with three points each.\n\nAsked if he uses a play script to begin games, Waldron labeled that \u201cscheme\u201d related during a fast-talking, 15-minute news conference Thursday morning. It\u2019s worth noting the Bears are No. 2 in the league in fourth-quarter scoring with 30 points.\n\nComing off a rough showing in the 21-16 loss to the Colts, Waldron opened with a statement complimenting the team\u2019s leadership group for being solution-oriented. Interestingly, one player said Waldron was more engaged seeking player input this week. If you heard a coach or player mention communication since Monday, you\u2019ve heard it 100 times.\n\nVeteran Marcedes Lewis is one of the players Waldron credited, along with fellow tight end Cole Kmet, Williams and wide receiver DJ Moore.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel like he can\u2019t point guys out,\u201d Lewis, 40, recalled saying to Waldron. \u201cFrom the oldest guy in the room \u2014 being me \u2014 to the youngest guy. Don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t coach us. I want to be coached. I want to be great. This is not for play. This is our job. We understand that. It\u2019s a highly stressful, production-based business, and we\u2019ve all got to be doing the same things or everybody gets fired. Ego is supposed to be left at the door.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very receptive to that. I think, obviously, coming in, we\u2019ve got a bunch of dudes. Not just guys on the team or on this offense. We have dudes \u2014 dudes who have done it at a high level. Sometimes as the coach coming in, you might be walking on eggshells. I just kind of put that to bed. Nobody\u2019s sensitive in here. We want to win games just as bad as you do. It\u2019s a collaborative effort. This is not Pop Warner.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Williams probably needed to look like a two-time Pro Bowl selection from the jump to meet some of the audacious expectations put on this offense. Folks dared to dream \u2014 and dream big \u2014 when the Bears chose him with the No. 1 pick in the draft, the most decorated quarterback to join the franchise in decades and the greatest signal of hope to enter Halas Hall perhaps ever.\n\nPredictably, Williams has encountered challenges that make the position difficult to navigate for rookie starters, including myriad pressures and a mixing of coverages with the intent to fool him or cause a delay in his reaction.\n\nAll of that was expected, but the cast of players surrounding Williams, perhaps as good or better than almost any rookie starter has discovered in the last decade or two, was supposed to ease the transition. The Bears invested heavily on offense in the offseason, trading for wide receiver Keenan Allen, who has missed the last two games with plantar fasciitis, drafting receiver Rome Odunze with the No. 9 pick and signing running back D\u2019Andre Swift and tight end Gerald Everett in free agency to join a cast that already included Moore, Kmet and a functional collection of running backs.\n\nEarly results \u2014 and a lot of football remains \u2014 have been discouraging.\n\nPass protection remains an issue. Williams has been sacked 13 times, the same number Justin Fields took through three games a year ago. Only the Cleveland Browns (16) and Tennessee Titans (15) have surrendered more. The line was supposed to look better with a quarterback that could play within the structure of the system a greater percentage of the time. Simply put, it has not.\n\nThe run game has been a mess. The failed goal-line sequence in the second quarter Sunday \u2014 when the Bears started with first-and-goal from the 4-yard line \u2014 is the symbol of what has gone wrong. Poor execution. Poor design \u2014 there\u2019s no other way to describe a play in which wide receiver DeAndre Carter is asked to block a defensive end. Waldron owned that when asked specifically about it. Poor decisions both in the speed option on fourth-and-1 and the failure to check out of the play.\n\nThe Bears are 31st in rushing offense, averaging 72.7 yards per game, and 31st in yards per attempt at a meager 3.03. The Las Vegas Raiders are the only team worse in both categories. The ground attack was expected to take a hit with the departure of Fields, whose ability to threaten defenses inflated rushing production the last two seasons, but it wasn\u2019t expected to be this bad.\n\nFirst down hasn\u2019t been profitable. The offense ranks 29th in the league, averaging 4.26 yards on first-and-10. So, they\u2019re not in desirable second-and-short situations with a lot of regularity, and when they\u2019re playing behind the sticks, it\u2019s tough sledding. According to @SharpFootball, 64% of Bears\u2019 first downs reach third down, the highest percentage in the league. The NFL average is 47%, and only three teams are over 57%. All of that makes it easier for opposing defensive coordinators to make calls on second and third downs.\n\nExplosive plays have been scarce. The Bears have five runs of 10 yards or more. Three are the result of Williams\u2019 scrambles, and Moore had a 14-yard gain on a jet sweep. The lone explosive rush by a running back was Swift\u2019s 20-yard carry in the Week 1 win against the Titans. The Bears have had only four pass plays of 20 yards or more \u2014 three to Odunze and the 44-yard Hail Mary to Moore last week that came 1 yard short of the goal line before halftime.\n\nFormer Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera used to say, \u201cfigures lie and liars figure,\u201d but you really need to spend time crunching numbers to paint a pretty picture of the offense overall. Again, it has been only three games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to live in the past but I\u2019m going to learn from it,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cI\u2019m going to move forward. And I believe in that. I\u2019m not going to flinch or blink on any of those things. I\u2019m looking forward for a solution to everything that we\u2019ve been through and can\u2019t wait for the next game.\u201d\n\nThe offensive coordinator taking heat even at this early juncture isn\u2019t surprising. The play caller can become the target of ire faster than you can say \u201cthree Mississippi.\u201d Waldron is the franchise\u2019s 13th coordinator in 26 seasons, and things turned so quickly for predecessor Luke Getsy that in about two months he went from being a guy fans feared was so hot he would be leaving quickly to become a head coach after the Bears averaged 29.6 points in a five-game stretch to the guy who was to blame for the offense\u2019s incompetence.\n\nWaldron is standing up in front of players expressing where he needs to be better. He\u2019s being accountable to his players and listening to them. It was a tough outing overall against a Colts defense that otherwise hasn\u2019t played well.\n\nIt would appear there are spots for improvement \u2014 although that was a good storyline at this time a week ago. The next four opponents have been as bad on defense as some of the areas the Bears have struggled offensively.\n\nSunday: Rams 32nd in yards allowed, 31st in scoring\n\nOct. 6: Panthers 24th, 32nd\n\nOct. 13: Jaguars 26th, 28th\n\nOct. 27, Commanders 29th, 29th\n\nSomething has to give, right?\n\n\u201cHe stands up there and lists the plays that he could have called better,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cPuts it up on the board. We all see it. And I think that\u2019s the best way to do it. I mean, we\u2019re not kids, right? We respect that. Because everything is evaluated, especially from a player\u2019s standpoint.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re getting evaluated with whatever we\u2019re doing out there. So when a coach throws himself in that pot of gumbo, then we\u2019re all vested, we all have some skin in the game. He\u2019s been doing that and highly appreciate it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if all the communication is a means to improvement \u2014 or just more talk."
