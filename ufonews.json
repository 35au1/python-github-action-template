        "article_content": "The newly released Silent Hill 2 Remake brings back the Easter egg UFO ending from the original. Follow our guide to learn how to get it!\n\nKonami\u2019s new Silent Hill 2 Remake brings back one of the most iconic and funny secrets from the original game: the UFO Ending. This joke ending requires a bit of work to unlock, but it\u2019s a fun nod to fans of the franchise.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get abducted by aliens and witness Silent Hill 2\u2019s wackiest conclusion, here\u2019s how to do it. Remember that you must have finished the entire game at least once to access it.\n\nWhat is the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake?\n\nThe UFO ending is one of the funniest and most out-of-place things you\u2019ll come across in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nThe UFO Ending is one of the two joke endings that you can get in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. Just like the original game, this bizarre conclusion is unlocked through some very specific actions you carry out during a New Game Plus run.\n\nThe original game had James Sunderland meeting Harry Mason from the first Silent Hill. In this version, James meets Space James, who uses his model from the original game.\n\nThis version of James reveals that the James you\u2019re playing is just a clone before an alien swoops in and zaps James with a ray gun before abducting him.\n\nIf you\u2019re a longtime fan of the franchise, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a tradition for the Silent Hill games to feature a fever dream-like UFO ending in each one.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty funny and lighthearted moment that gives you a breathing moment in between the games\u2019 nonstop onslaught of psychological and gruesome horror.\n\nHow to Get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\nAll you need to do is stare at this shiny object in a few places around town.\n\nTo unlock the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake, you\u2019ll need to follow a few specific steps during your New Game Plus playthrough.\n\nYou need to finish the game at least once. The UFO Ending can only be unlocked in a New Game Plus file, so make sure you\u2019ve wrapped up a full run before attempting this Easter egg.\n\nIn the New Game Plus file, you need to locate the Blue Gem item. It\u2019s the key to triggering the UFO Ending and only appears after your first playthrough, so don\u2019t bother trying to find it during your first run.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in New Game Plus, head to Neely Street in Eastern South Vale. There, you\u2019ll find the Jeweller\u2019s Store, located north of Big Jay\u2019s. Smash through the store window to grab the Blue Gem, which is sitting on top of a jewelry box.\n\nTo trigger the UFO Ending, you\u2019ll need to use the Blue Gem in four specific locations:\n\nSaul Apartments Rooftop (Eastern South Vale)\n\nRosewater Park Pier (Western South Vale)\n\nLakeview Hotel Docks\n\nRoom 312 in Lakeview Hotel\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used the Blue Gem in the first three locations, head to Room 312 in the Lakeview Hotel and inspect the gem there.\n\nTip When you inspect the Blue Gem at each location, it should glow and make alien-like noises.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done everything correctly, the game will instantly cut to the UFO Ending, skipping the final boss fight entirely.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get the \u2018Tinfoil Hat\u2019 trophy, needed as part of getting the Platinum for this game\u2014check out our trophy guide for more information.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it for this Silent Hill 2 ending. With just a tiny bit of effort during your New Game Plus run, you can unlock this weird ending where you seal James\u2019 fate to an eternity in the stars.\n\nStay tuned if you\u2019re looking for more Silent Hill 2 guides or need Silent Hill 2 help with other endings or secrets.

        "article_content": "Have you ever heard of Grendizer and Spazer? Grendizer, also known as Goldorak, is a giant monster robot that connects and synchronizes with Spazer, a flying saucer that enables the robot to fly. FYI, the robot and flying saucer are characters in the 1970s Japanese manga and anime series UFO Robot Grendizer. How do I explain this to a watch audience not up to speed with Japanese animation? Think of Louis Abraham Breguet\u2019s world\u2019s first \u201csympathique clock\u201d first presented in 1798. It\u2019s a system consisting of a clock and a pocket watch. When putting the watch in the clock\u2019s cradle, it will automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with the mother clock. Now you know how the robot and his flying saucer interact, but how did Grendizer end up on the dial of the Tissot PRX?\n\nThere are two possible answers to that question. The first is that it teamed up with Spazer, took off, and perfectly executed a precision landing on the dial of the 40mm watch. The second answer is a bit more lengthy but more realistic. To understand what Grendizer is, please check out the Wikipedia page on the anime series. That\u2019s what I did, and it made me decide not to dive too deep into the complicated world of Duke Fleed, King Vega, and the flying saucer Spazer. Instead, I will just focus on the watch, the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer ref. T137.407.11.041.02.\n\nTissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer \u2014 Who needs a 1970s glow-in-the-dark monster robot on a watch dial?\n\nI need to stop asking questions before answering them. So let me get back to the second possible answer to the previous question: Grendizer appears on the dial of a PRX because the decision-makers at Tissot think manga and anime are cool. The Swiss watch and the Japanese manga and animated TV series originated in the 1970s, creating a timeline-correct connection. The PRX is a retro-hip watch embraced by a large audience. A PRX with a manga robot on the dial appeals to anime fans. I perceive the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer as a clever brand extension constructed to win retro-futurism enthusiasts\u2019 hearts and minds. The Tissot marketing must have done extensive research on the target audience and how big it is.\n\nGrendizer comes with Spazer\n\nI am sure you don\u2019t want a summary of all the technical details of this Grendizer watch because, apart from the styling, it is a 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 model you have been reading about on Fratello for quite a while now. The manga-inspired PRX presents itself with Grendizer\u2019s Super-LumiNova-coated bust on the deep blue dial. The central seconds hand is modeled after the Harken weapon that Grendizer wields, and the robot\u2019s image is engraved on the rotor visible through the transparent case back.\n\nThe Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer landed on my desk, and that was some sort of miracle. Why? Because Grendizer did that without using Spazer. When you buy the watch, though, the box the watch comes in is shaped like Spazer. Maybe this is the coolest feature of the watch. Can the luminescent outline of Grendizer beat the hero\u2019s legendary spacecraft doubling as a box? Maybe not, but the PRX does have some very neat details.\n\nI already mentioned the central seconds hand with its weapon-like counterweight, but there\u2019s also a thematic engraving on the flange. If you angle the watch and look closely, you can read \u201cUFO\u30ed\u30dc \u30b0\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u201d (Y\u016bf\u014d Robo Gurendaiz\u0101), the original Japanese title of the manga series.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer\n\nThe agony of choice is a phenomenon that applies to Tissot\u2019s PRX collection. There are more than plenty of variations to choose from. The Grendizer broadens the collection while simultaneously being a niche product. What I appreciate about the manga-inspired watch is that it doesn\u2019t look too gimmicky. In the dark, the robot presents itself more prominently, but you will only discover his weapon turning around the dial once a minute after close observation. The same goes for the engraving on the flange and the rotor.\n\nThe standard steel versions of the 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 and the versions with the gradient \u201cChameleon\u201d models cost \u20ac775. The PRX UFO Robot Grendizer is a special edition, not a limited one, and costs \u20ac895. You pay extra for the additional lume on the dial and some other details, including Grendizer\u2019s Spazer doubling as a watch box. To be clear, putting the PRX in the box won\u2019t automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with a mother clock because it\u2019s just a box. And since it is just a box, the watch will also not be able to fly like Grendizer could with Spazer. Anyway, if you, like me, are not into manga, paying \u20ac120 extra doesn\u2019t make much sense, although I do appreciate the execution of the Grendizer theme. So, Fratello-reading manga fans out there, what do you think of the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer? Let me know in the comments."

California\n\nCasino.ca found one UFO per 1,075 people, naming the Golden State the top place where people have claimed to \"see\" a UFO, with 36,286 reported sightings since 1974.\n\nA data scientist with Casino.ca says the high number of reported UFO sightings in California may be related to a few reasons.\n\n\"For example, the vastness and diversity of the state's landscapes, which range from expansive deserts to coastal regions \u2014 offer numerous locations where unusual flying objects can be sighted,\" said the data scientist.\n\nA recent NUFORC report from Oct. 5 lists an alleged sighting, with the person saying, \"There were no clouds in sky and no wind. I saw a cloud-shape circle moving quickly in the sky, not too high up.\"\n\n2. Washington\n\nReported in second place, there is one UFO per 1,093 people, finding about 7,125 UFO \"sightings\" in Washington. California\u2019s sightings are 409% more than the state of Washington.\n\nAn alleged sighting took place on Oct. 6, with the witness sharing, \"I was walking out the front door, taking my dog out when I saw a very shiny object high in the sky.\" However, the NUFORC concluded that the claimed sighting was in fact a balloon.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\n3. Florida\n\nIn the Sunshine State, there were more than 11,000 UFO sighting claims since 1974. Casino.ca found one UFO for every 1,444 Floridians.\n\nA report entered in NUFORC, out of Destin, Florida, said that a witness looked into the sky and \"saw this huge slightly bright orange arrow moving across sky then saw it again though further away going the other way.\"\n\n4. Oregon\n\nA total number of 3,667 alleged UFO sightings have been reported since 1974, with one occurring for every 1,156 people.\n\nWitnesses reported to the NUFORC sightings of a \"fast-moving tic-tac looking thing crossing the sky\" and a \"translucent orb in sky with curl or bright lights on top and bottom, panels seen inside.\"\n\n5. New York\n\nThe Empire State came in fifth place with a total of a total of 6,405 claims of sightings. For every 1, 301 New Yorkers, one UFO sighting was reported.\n\nThe most recent entry into the NUFORC was in Pltneyville, New York, where the witness reported an oval shape during the aurora borealis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team for comment."

We're seeing that you know, people are struggling,\u201d said Roman Khaves the co-founder of Rizz. \u201cWhenever people are stuck in the middle of a conversation or don't know how to open up, they don't have the confidence to have these dating conversations.\"\n\nDating app fatigue, along with the struggle to continue a conversation led Khaves to find the solution in the Rizz app.\n\n\u201cAI wing woman, wing man,' Khaves said. \"That's with you 24/7. To help you out whenever you're stuck.\"\n\nThe app was launched in December 2022.\n\nKhaves says the AI tool is similar to ChatGPT, but focuses on dating\n\n\u201cIf you are interested in the profile, but you're not sure exactly how to open up and start the conversation, here's what you do,\" Khaves said. \"You take a screenshot of that profile or that prompt you upload onto rizz. Rizz will scan it, and we'll use our magical ai that we have in the background, and it will give you a strategy on how to open up and follow up with suggestions.\"\n\nKhaves says the goal isn\u2019t to tell someone what to say but to get people on a first date fast.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are stuck and they're in this endless cycle, and these dating apps are swiping endlessly, and they never actually make it to the date,\u201d Khaves said.\n\nDivinity and Jose say if a tool like this was available for them, they wouldn\u2019t have used it.\n\n\u201cI understand how you would do it if you're trying to, you know, have the right first impression, because that's an important thing when meeting someone for the first time,\u201d Jose said.\n\nExperts like Ernesto Verdugo say AI is the future even when it comes to dating.\n\n\u201cPreviously it was based on algorithms,\" Verdago said. \"Right now, it's based on predictions, which is a lot more powerful.\"\n\nAs for Rizz, Khaves says this is only the beginning.\n\n\u201cThe goal for us is to be really the leading ai dating app for, you know, the modern century,\u201d Khaves said . \u201cWe're going to do even more cool, interesting things to help people with dating. The whole point is we want everybody to find love.\u201d\n\nAs more people download apps in search of love, Divinity and Jose hope their story can inspire others.\n\n\u201cMy hearts never felt honestly so full, like, with them in my life,\u201d Divinity said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it's just about being faithful and, you know, taking a risk,\u201d Jose said."

        "source": "The Conversation",
        "article_content": "Just as calculators took over the tedious number-crunching in maths a few decades ago, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming coding. Take Kyo, an eight-year-old boy in Singapore who developed a simple platform game in just two hours, attracting over 500,000 players.\n\nUsing nothing but simple instructions in English, Kyo brought his vision to life leveraging the coding app Cursor and also Claude, a general purpose AI. Although his dad is a coder, Kyo didn\u2019t get any help from him to design the game and has no formal coding education himself. He went on to build another game, an animation app, a drawing app and a chatbot, taking about two hours for each.\n\nThis shows how AI is dramatically lowering the barrier to software development, bridging the gap between creativity and technical skill. Among the range of apps and platforms dedicated to this purpose, others include Google\u2019s AlphaCode 2 and Replit\u2019s Ghostwriter.\n\nIn another example of the power of these apps, an eight-year-old American girl called Fay built a chatbot that purported to be Harry Potter. She had it up and running in just 45 minutes, at which point it asked if she had heard the rumours about the Deathly Hallows and suggested they discuss it over a butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks.\n\nFor those that already know how to code, numerous AI apps have become incredibly helpful too. At the other extreme from the natural language coding apps described above, tools like Tabnine and GitHub Copilot act as intelligent assistants, predicting and autocompleting code as you type.\n\nAlternatives such as Sourcery and DeepCode go a step further, offering real-time code cleanup, suggesting improvements and fixing vulnerabilities. New tools are emerging weekly, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT Canvas, a new GPT version designed to help with sophisticated coding. Many of these tools can also translate code from one programming language to another, say from JavaScript to Python.\n\nThe productivity gains that these tools offer are revolutionising the software industry. As many as 70% of companies have already adopted the likes of GitHub Copilot, with coders reporting that AI is enabling them to write software that is more reliable and bug free.\n\nBy removing the need to spend so many hours ironing out human errors, coders are able to spend more time focusing on higher value tasks such as designing system architecture and collaborating with colleagues.\n\nIt is also changing the game for university educators like myself as we race to keep up. We\u2019ve been having to rethink teaching materials and also assessment methods, wrestling with how exactly to grade a student\u2019s coding in situations where AI tools are doing much of the work.\n\nToday\u2019s limitations\n\nAs exciting as all this is, AI coding is still in its infancy. At this stage it can only help non-coders to build simple applications or games. It can\u2019t yet oversee big complex IT projects by understanding the big picture in a way that a human coder would.\n\nIt can\u2019t yet invent new ways to solve problems either, and is still more likely to lag in areas like, say, spacecraft navigation that require highly specialised knowledge.\n\nMany tools also don\u2019t write perfect code: a program will often work but won\u2019t be efficient or secure enough for use in the real world. Similarly, AI tools don\u2019t inherently understand the context of the data they process, so may mishandle sensitive information or perpetuate biases present in the data on which they were trained.\n\nFor all these reasons, in professional situations there\u2019s still a need for a coder to make sure that everything is meeting the necessary standards. No doubt in future we may see AI coding tools designed to handle everything from security issues to highly specialised subject matter. Their ability to help non-coders to build apps will also only improve. For now at least, however, AI coding is still amplifying the skills of coders rather than replacing them altogether.\n\nHow to build your own game\n\nAll the same, it\u2019s incredible what you can do with these tools as a non-coder already. Here\u2019s a quick guide to making a simple platform game:\n\nStep 1: Sign up for an AI tool: Create an account with, say, Cursor or AlphaCode 2 and follow the setup instructions. Depending on which tool you choose, you may need to do a quick install. You may also need to install a programming language such as Python, as well as a source code editor such as VS Studio Code 2 \u2013 the coding platform will keep you right on this.\n\nStep 2: Start your game: Open a new project in the tool. Into the prompt, type: \u201cCreate a simple platform game where the platforms are made of sweet treats\u201d.\n\nStep 3: See what it\u2019s like: Click \u201crun\u201d or \u201cpreview\u201d to see what you\u2019ve created (depending on which system you are using, you may have to do this in the source code editor). You should see platforms made of candy or cakes.\n\nStep 4: Make some changes: Let\u2019s say we change the main character into a parrot. Simply type into the prompt: \u201cMake the avatar a green parrot\u201d.\n\nStep 5: Add features: Now type into the prompt: \u201cLet the parrot be controlled by the cursor arrows, insert some sweets for it to collect and add a score counter for how many it has collected\u201d.\n\nAuthor provided\n\nStep 6: Test and tweak: Click \u201crun\u201d or \u201cpreview\u201d again to test the updated game. Make changes by typing things like, \u201cInsert a black crow that will chase the parrot around the screen. If the crow touches the parrot, freeze the screen and display a message in the middle of the screen saying \u2018Too Bad!!!\u2019\u201d. Keep repeating these steps until you\u2019re happy with the results.\n\nStep 7: Get it out there: You might now want to share your game with friends or online via an app store. It must be said that AI coders are not yet doing this well, so you may find this trickier without prior knowledge. One option is to deploy the game online via a free platform such as Zeabur, as explained here."

        "article_content": "Yvette Fielding's ghostly encounter in her mid-20s transformed her life\n\nUntil she was 26, former Blue Peter presenter Yvette Fielding didn\u2019t believe in the afterlife. But that all changed the night she awoke to find an eerie figure \u00adstanding at the end of the bed in her mother\u2019s house. She tells me: \u201cI awoke in the middle of the night to discover a young, Second World War soldier staring straight at me from the foot of the bed. It was petrifying.\u201d Even more terrifyingly, rather than being vaporous, the youthful figure \u2013 dressed in a brown military uniform with brass buttons, and sporting Brylcreemed hair and a sharp side parting \u2013 appeared to have formand substance. \u201cI burst into tears and ran screaming from the bedroom into my mum\u2019s room,\u201d Yvette, now 55, recalls. \u201cImagine, as a young woman, awaking to discover a man in your room. But although it was like looking at a solid object, he was only there from the waist up \u2013 his top half was hovering. I was sobbing, \u2018There\u2019s a ghost in the house\u2019.\u201d The experience was destined to change the shape of Yvette\u2019s life \u2013 revealing a new direction in her broadcasting career that continues to this day, as well as helping introduce her to her second husband, TV producer Karl Beattie. Most Haunted, the paranormal research series presented by Yvette and a gang of experts, and produced by Karl, is now filming its 26th season. Yvette explains that her compulsion for the paranormal turned from terror into fascination following a grim discovery made after her haunting experience. \u201cMum and I felt compelled to research the young man in uniform,\u201d she tells me. They started by talking to the neighbours. \u201cThere were only five houses in the road, and we discovered that a couple of them had seen exactly the same thing,\u201dshe explains. Things then became even stranger still when they dug deeper and spoke to anolder resident. \u201cBehind the houses was a wood, and beyond that, the Manchester to London \u00adrailway line. \u201cI spoke to a neighbour who said that during the war, the young soldiers were sent south by railway to fight, but one young conscript had thrown himself off the train as he didn\u2019t want to go, and was cut in half by the train.\u201d Convinced that this explained the apparition that had so alarmed her, fearturned into fascination. \u201cThat first-hand experience has now led me on a journey that has become such a huge passion, and it has actually changed my entire life,\u201d Yvette reflects. \u201cBefore this experience, I didn\u2019t believe in anything. I didn\u2019t believe in a God. I didn\u2019t believe in life after death and those feelings affected me in a negative way because when I had the usual share of awful times, as we all do, I would wonder what life is all about, why are we here, where did we come from and is that it when you\u2019re put in the ground at the end and it all goes black?\u201d\n\nYvette Fielding and husband Karl\n\nNow Yvette\u2019s latest children\u2019s book, about haunted castles, has just been published, mining her on-camera experiences and bringing them to life in spooky fashion for a brand new audience of young readers. And it was shortly after meeting Karl that she discovered he had also had a similar experience to her; a fact that proved to be deeply bonding. \u201cWhen I met my beautiful husband, he had had his own haunted experiences,\u201d she tells me. Karl takes over the tale: \u201cOne night, when I was about 10 and my brother was five, I saw a man wearing a fedora hat and dressed in a 1930s costume, leaning on my bedroom door frame.\u201d As with Yvette\u2019s visitor, he was similarly solid but faded over the next few minutes. Says Karl: \u201cI thought I may have dreamed it, but it was only in the morning when we got up for breakfast that my little brother said that he had got really scared in the night because there was a man leaning on the wall in a Humphrey Bogart outfit. He was so young that this detail made me think there had to be some truth to what we had both seen.\u201d When the couple, who have been married for 25 years and have a daughter, Mary, met on the set of BBC One\u2019s documentary series City Hospital, they soon found themselves sharing their experiences. Says Karl: \u201cYvette and I connected on so many levels when we met, and had this sense that we had met each other before and when I talked about this experience, she took me seriously. We were both used to people being sceptical.\u201d Yvette, who also has a son, Will, from a previous marriage, says that this led them to become \u00adincreasingly intrigued to the point that they came up with the idea for the TV series. Sheadds: \u201cWe were so passionate about the topic that we spent all our life savings making the pilot and for a while we couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage.\u201d\n\nTrending\n\nWorryingly, all the mainstream TV \u00adstations turned it down. \u201cChannel 5 even called us \u2018unprofessional\u2019 for delving into this genre,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut something in us kept pushing until the satellite station UK Living said yes.\u201d At the time, the station was losing viewers, but the couple were told \u201cthis might be just mad enough to work\u201d. Sixteen initial episodes were commissioned, and Yvette found herself launched professionally into the world of the paranormal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the answers and the only experts are those who have passed on,\u201d she says now. \u201cBut I definitely call myself a paranormal researcher.\u201d And as she gazes into the camera, often in the eerie black and white world created by heat-seeking night vision cameras, she says she never forgets the advice she was given as a 19-year-old presenting rookie by Biddy Baxter, the legendary Blue Peter producer. \u201cOne thing Biddy always said was that it is so important just to be yourself as a presenter. She said, \u2018Never, ever when you look in the camera, think of a lot of people. Just think of one, your best friend, and you are trying to talk to them\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s advice she continues to heed. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for presenters to remember that. Audiences are not daft, they know who a genuine person is.\u201d\n\nCaron Keating, Mark Curry and Yvette Fielding on Blue Peter in 1995\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

        "article_content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: CC0 Public Domain\n\nMillions of scientific papers are published globally every year. These papers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine present discoveries that range from the mundane to the profound.\n\nSince 1900, the number of published scientific articles has doubled about every 10 to 15 years; since 1980, about 8% to 9% annually. This acceleration reflects the immense and ever-growing scope of research across countless topics, from the farthest reaches of the cosmos to the intricacies of life on Earth and human nature.\n\nYet, this extraordinary expansion was once thought to be unsustainable. In his influential 1963 book, \"Little Science, Big Science\u2026 And Beyond,\" the founder of scientometrics\u2014or data informetrics related to scientific publications\u2014Derek de Solla Price famously predicted limits to scientific growth.\n\nHe warned that the world would soon deplete its resources and talent pool for research. He imagined this would lead to a decline in new discoveries and potential crises in medicine, technology and the economy. At the time, scholars widely accepted his prediction of an impending slowdown in scientific progress.\n\nFaulty predictions\n\nIn fact, science has spectacularly defied Price's dire forecast. Instead of stagnation, the world now experiences \"global mega-science\"\u2014a vast, ever-growing network of scientific discovery. This explosion of scientific production made Price's prediction of collapse perhaps the most stunningly incorrect forecast in the study of science.\n\nUnfortunately, Price died in 1983, too early to realize his mistake.\n\nSo, what explains the world's sustained and dramatically increasing capacity for scientific research?\n\nWe are sociologists who study higher education and science. Our new book, \"Global Mega-Science: Universities, Research Collaborations, and Knowledge Production,\" published on the 60th anniversary of Price's fateful prediction, offers explanations for this rapid and sustained scientific growth. It traces the history of scientific discovery globally.\n\nFactors such as economic growth, warfare, space races and geopolitical competition have undoubtedly spurred research capacity. But these factors alone cannot account for the immense scale of today's scientific enterprise.\n\nThe education revolution: Science's secret engine\n\nIn many ways, the world's scientific capacity has been built upon the educational aspirations of young adults pursuing higher education.\n\nOver the past 125 years, increasing demand for and access to higher education has sparked a global education revolution. Now, more than two-fifths of the world's young people ages 19-23, although with huge regional differences, are enrolled in higher education. This revolution is the engine driving scientific research capacity.\n\nToday, more than 38,000 universities and other higher-education institutions worldwide play a crucial role in scientific discovery. The educational mission, both publicly and privately funded, subsidizes the research mission, with a big part of students' tuition money going toward supporting faculty.\n\nThese faculty scientists balance their teaching with conducting extensive research. University-based scientists contribute 80% to 90% of the discoveries published each year in millions of papers.\n\nExternal research funding is still essential for specialized equipment, supplies and additional support for research time. But the day-to-day research capacity of universities, especially academics working in teams, forms the foundation of global scientific progress.\n\nEven the most generous national science and commercial research and development budgets cannot fully sustain the basic infrastructure and staffing needed for ongoing scientific discovery.\n\nLikewise, government labs and independent research institutes, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health or Germany's Max Planck Institutes, could not replace the production capacity that universities provide.\n\nCollaboration benefits science and society\n\nThe past few decades have also seen a surge in global scientific collaborations. These arrangements leverage diverse talent from around the world to enhance the quality of research.\n\nInternational collaborations have led to millions of co-authored papers. International research partnerships were relatively rare before 1980, accounting for just over 7,000 papers, or about 2% of the global output that year. But by 2010 that number had surged to 440,000 papers, meaning 22% of the world's scientific publications resulted from international collaborations.\n\nThis growth, building on the \"collaboration dividend,\" continues today and has been shown to produce the highest-impact research.\n\nUniversities tend to share academic goals with other universities and have wide networks and a culture of openness, which makes these collaborations relatively easy.\n\nToday, universities also play a key role in international supercollaborations involving teams of hundreds or even thousands of scientists. In these huge collaborations, researchers can tackle major questions they wouldn't be able to in smaller groups with fewer resources.\n\nSupercollaborations have facilitated breakthroughs in understanding the intricate physics of the universe and the synthesis of evolution and genetics that scientists in a single country could never achieve alone.\n\nThe role of global hubs\n\nHubs made up of universities from around the world have made scientific research thoroughly global. The first of these global hubs, consisting of dozens of North American research universities, began in the 1970s. They expanded to Europe in the 1980s and most recently to Southeast Asia.\n\nThese regional hubs and alliances of universities link scientists from hundreds of universities to pursue collaborative research projects.\n\nScientists at these universities have often transcended geopolitical boundaries, with Iranian researchers publishing papers with Americans, Germans collaborating with Russians and Ukrainians, and Chinese scientists working with their Japanese and Korean counterparts.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the immense scale of international collaboration in global megascience. Within just six months of the start of the pandemic, the world's scientists had already published 23,000 scientific studies on the virus. These studies contributed to the rapid development of effective vaccines.\n\nWith universities' expanding global networks, the collaborations can spread through key research hubs to every part of the world.\n\nIs global megascience sustainable?\n\nBut despite the impressive growth of scientific output, this brand of highly collaborative and transnational megascience does face challenges.\n\nOn the one hand, birthrates in many countries that produce a lot of science are declining. On the other, many youth around the world, particularly those in low-income countries, have less access to higher education, although there is some recent progress in the Global South.\n\nSustaining these global collaborations and this high rate of scientific output will mean expanding access to higher education. That's because the funds from higher education subsidize research costs, and higher education trains the next generation of scientists.\n\nDe Solla Price couldn't have predicted how integral universities would be in driving global science. For better or worse, the future of scientific production is linked to the future of these institutions.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This asteroid is categorized as a fragment of rock and metal that orbits the sun.\n\nThe project was led by Ay\u015fe Arslan, a science teacher at D\u00fczce BILSEM who has been engaged in space observation for five years, along with \u00d6mer Selim Esen, a 14-year-old ninth grade student at D\u00fczce Turgut \u00d6zal Anadolu High School. Their work was part of the \"Asteroid Discovery Campaign,\" supported by the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC).\n\nAs part of this initiative, amateur astronomers sought to identify new asteroids. Arslan and Esen successfully detected a celestial body in 2021, which was subsequently registered as a new asteroid by the IASC. This significant discovery also granted them the privilege of naming the asteroid.\n\nSignificance of discovery\n\nAy\u015fe Arslan shared her excitement with Anadolu Agency (AA), noting that after their application to the Asteroid Discovery Campaign was accepted, they began their observations using data sets provided to them. They utilized specialized software to analyze the data and submitted their reports to the Minor Planet Center of the IASC.\n\nAfter three years of awaiting confirmation, they received an email notifying them that the celestial body they discovered was the first asteroid identified by Turkish researchers. Arslan emphasized the scientific value of this discovery, stating, \"The identification of this asteroid marks the first time a celestial body has been discovered in the solar system by Turkish researchers, which is incredibly significant for both us and T\u00fcrkiye.\"\n\n\u00d6mer Selim Esen expressed his pride in their discovery, recalling, \"We discovered this asteroid three years ago. A long time has passed, but I still remember that moment vividly. It is very valuable to me.\" Driven by his curiosity about astronomy, Esen has been involved in various projects at BILSEM for seven years."
