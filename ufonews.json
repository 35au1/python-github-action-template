            "article_content": "If there is one thing that every Iron Maiden fan can truly remember, it's the first time they witnessed Iron Maiden running out on stage live. For me it was January 21, 1991 on the No Prayer on the Road Tour with Anthrax as the opener at the old Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, NJ. I had just turned 16 two months prior and had been foaming at the mouth for this chance. As a kid growing up in the 80's idolizing everything about Iron Maiden this was my \"Future Past.\"\n\nFor almost five decades the British icons have toured the world captivating fans with their mesmerizing theatrical stage performances and their constant involving of a classic heavy metal sound that has made them a legendary staple to metal fans around the world.\n\nIron Maiden in my opinion could very well be viewed as the Grateful Dead of heavy metal. Take for instance the dedication their fans bring to the table is extraordinary. From touring around the world following the band like Dead Heads of the 60's with their flags representing their countries, too tattooing the iconic mascot Eddie on their bodies truly showing their loyal dedication for life.\n\nDuring the East Coast run of the Future Past Tour I was fortunate enough to have the privilege of attending both the November 2nd show in Brooklyn, NY at the Barclays Center and the November 9th show in Newark, NJ at the Prudential Center. During those shows I got the opportunity to meet and talk with some extraordinary loyal fans, a few ironically I had actually photographed prior on the 2022 Legacy Of The Beast Tour when it made it's stop in Newark at the Prudential Center.\n\nWhen I spoke with these fans I had photographed in the past I was amazed by their stories of dedication and passion they have for Iron Maiden. Johanna, who I photographed in the past, is from Ecuador and has seen Iron Maiden 33 times all over the world. On this tour alone Johanna told me she did 11 shows, 10 cities in 4 different countries. Johanna's friend Adrian from Costa Rica who I also photographed two years ago has been to a whopping 75 shows. They explained to me that they always travel for Iron Maiden.\n\nAnother fan I spoke with Petr, was here from London with a large group of friends from all over Europe, from Sweden, Finland, Scotland, Luxembourg, Italy and France. Petr told me he has done 4 shows on the East Coast and 9 last year on the 2023 leg of the Future Past European leg of the tour, he also told me he already has 11 shows lined up for next years Run For Your Lives tour. It was definitely great to meet these fans and hear their stories and learn their passion.\n\nThe energy was on full blast in Brooklyn on November 2nd as 19,000 fans eagerly awaited as they bared witness to the Mongolian folk metal band known as The HU. A band know for it's traditional Mongolian instrumentation and it's lyrics of ancient Mongolian war cries, the band began to warm up the crowd quickly. The band of eight decked in traditional like Mongolian warrior outfits reminded me of something out of a Conan movie.\n\nFor the majority of the crowd I'm sure this was their first encounter with the bands music as much of them took that opportunity to stand in massive lines for the ever coveted Iron Maiden merch. With the traditional cultural style of throat singing, traditional Morin khuur and tovshuur instruments combined with heart pounding percussions backed with a smooth grooving bass and guitar sound throughout the set they took us back in time the ancient nomadic empire of Xiongnu and brought to life a Frank Frazetta painting. To not say that was a great fit to open the show would be a lie.\n\nWith the ever familiar track of UFO's \"Doctor Doctor\" blasting throughout the PA system of the arena the already defining cheers from fans grew ever more louder as fans sang along word for word with heavy anticipation for the British icons to run out on stage and blow their minds. As \"Doctor Doctor\" wrapped up the theme from Blade Runner properly played which was only fitting as the curtains were pulled back to unveil a Sci-Fi backdrop much to the likes of Blade Runner itself.\n\nAs if the crowd wasn't already heading into a frenzy counting down the seconds with just the mere visual of a lit stage, cue the intro of \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" a blast of pyro tech ushering out the band from each side rushing to the stage galloping into this classic that hasn't been played live since 1987 and you've got faces melting right before your eyes. The shows choreography, flawless sound matched with frontman Bruce Dickson's electrifying stage presence as one of metals best front men electrified the arena.\n\nIt wasn't just Bruce's presence that ignited the crowd, Steve Harris, the backbone to Iron Maiden with his powerful basslines and energetic stage presence matched by the iconic dueling guitar solos of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, both unique in their own way along with the guitar work of the ever charismatic Janick Gers and Nicko McBrain's effortlessly smooth powerful drumming rounding off the bands rhythm section with pure precision as Maiden laid right into \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" another classic track off their 1986 platinum album Somewhere In Time, again another smash hit that hasn't been played live since their 1999 Ed Hunter Tour. Ironically this was the same tour that saw the return of both Dickinson and Smith to the line up.\n\nThe back to back classic bangers were followed up by a trio of tracks from the most recent Senjutsu. The almost two hour long set was a seamless flow of both old and new which delighted the already electrified crowd with four live debuts off Senjutsu and the live debut of one my all time favorites \"Alexander the Great.\" It was during Iron Maiden's trio of encore songs lead by \"Hell on Earth\" that completely blew the roof off the Barclays Center with the cult classic hit \"The Trooper\" that had 19,000 fans signing at the top of their lungs in harmony before ending to me what was the best show of 2024 by bringing back live one last piece of nostalgia, \"Wasted Years.\"\n\nOn November 9th, one week after Iron Maiden's Future Past tour blew the roof off of Brooklyn's Barclays Center, I'm now across the pound in Newark, NJ at the Prudential Center. Unlike Brooklyn the vibe in New Jersey is different. The level of energy and anticipation is the same, but unlike Barclays in Brooklyn where everything and everyone is on top of each other with the non-stop hustle and bustle of NYC where as Newark's Prudential Center is located in a more spread out environment that sees street closures during events along with outdoor parking lots that host your traditional tailgating along with multiple entry points to the arena to thin out the heard of metal maniacs is where I find the vibe to feel a bit more laid back in a sense.\n\nOnce inside the sold out arena of 19,500 things were just as they were in Brooklyn. Fans holding court in the halls over cold beverages, long lines for the famous Maiden merch.\n\nWhen the tours opener The HU hit the stage and kicked things off, again the vibe was much like it was in Brooklyn with the majority of fans still lingering around the arena halls socializing, still waiting in long lines for merch and concessions. However different from Brooklyn's show, it seemed that there were more faces in the crowd more familiar with the Mongolian folk sensation, but lets face it, New York is always a tough crowd and to top that off you're opening up for Iron Maiden.\n\nMaking my way into the media pit area with UFO's \"Doctor Doctor\" playing through the arenas PA system, I couldn't help but to still have this weird vibe around me that I just couldn't put my finger on. At first I thought, hey you guys in the front row here don't seem so energized, but I was quickly assured once the music hit that I would see the energy. Yet there was still something puzzling me. As with the show itself, I'm sure everyone who have hit multiple shows on the tour, myself included was thinking alright this is going to be awesome, same setlist, same choreography, same show. Sick! Ready to go! Let's have our minds blown away again. Let's see who's going to be louder? New York or New Jersey?\n\nThe show did set off just as it has been throughout the tour kicking off the set with the pre-recorded intro to \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" with the thunderous clap of pyro ushering out the band, and just like that thunderous clap, bang, Bruce comes running out and hits the stage blowing away 19,500 fans as he's donning the original Somewhere In Time jacket he wore throughout the 1986 Somewhere On Tour. It might sound corny, but that was it.\n\nThat feeling I had that something was different that night. It was a sense of surprise and one of legendary status. Every Maiden fan of that era along with those of the younger generation that know their Maiden history were completely in aww losing their shit. The jacket itself had been hanging on permanent display at the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame as of 2017. We all know how Bruce feels about the RRHF so theres no question that this was the original. What a way to come out and surprise fans. With a simple wardrobe change that makes an already amazing show that features a setlist of classics that haven't been played live in decades along with a heavy handful of live debuts that turned this show into a history maker. For \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" it was back to Bruce's original wardrobe with long trench like coat and futuristic like sunglasses that gave off the Jedi meets Mad Max bounty hunter vibe. Like the previous shows during this track fans were treated to the monstrous 10ft SSL Eddie.\n\nThis wouldn't be only sighting as fans would get the Somewhere in Time Eddie during \"Heaven Can Wait\" as he Bruce would go at firing off shots at one and other. It wouldn't be until later in the set that Eddie would make his way back out on to the stage this time fans would get the Senjutsu Samari Eddie for the song that started it all \"Iron Maiden.\" Just as flawless as everyone on stage was in Brooklyn, they were just as flawless and energetic in New Jersey with the crowd just as electrifying. Seeing the smiles on the faces of everyone from Iron Maiden as they playing in front of the fans is great to see. It's a highlight all in it's own.\n\nThe prodigious talent combined with a unique personalty and energetic stage presence that every member brings to the stage every night at their age is true testament to Iron Maiden's legacy that will continue to resonate with fans of all ages for years to come. In 2025 will mark Iron Maiden's 50 year anniversary as they kick off the Run For Your Lives World Tour. After witnessing these mind blowing shows of epic proportion with a setlist stacked with classic hits some that hadn't been played live for ages along with a group of live debuts one can only imagine how insane Iron Maiden will bring it for the 50th in 2025.\n\nIron Maiden\n\nThe HU"

            "article_content": "Github Spark launched with minimal fanfare a few weeks ago, promising to revolutionize the world of app and software coding. The new service is basically a no-code platform that allows anyone with a pulse to create a software application using nothing more than an AI text prompt.\n\nSo far, nothing amazingly new, except for the fact that Github is owned by the largest software company in the world, Microsoft.\n\nWhat sets Spark apart from the current crop of no-code app platforms like Cursor, Replit and Bolt, is its focus on building simple apps (they call them 'sparks'), rather than more sophisticated products.\n\nThis is also reflected in the fact that the launch is being very tightly controlled by the company, to the extent that you currently can\u2019t release a generated app outside of the platform. In other words, people who want to access your app have to sign up to Github in order to gain access through the URL.\n\nIt's a little strange, to say the least.\n\nPutting GitHub Spark to the test\n\n(Image credit: GitHub/Nigel Powell)\n\nI managed to slide through the strict waitlist and gain access to the service a week or so ago, and I\u2019ve been playing with it ever since. As you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s good and bad in this very early test version.\n\nI use the word test deliberately because I was told in no uncertain terms that Spark is very much an experiment rather than a finished product. Hence the low-key launch. So my comments should be taken with that in mind.\n\nSign up now to get the best Black Friday deals!

Instead of a typical geeky interface with code terminals and stuff, there\u2019s a very simple chatbot interface with a box for the prompt and not a lot else.\n\nMy first reaction to the app was surprise. Instead of a typical geeky interface with code terminals and stuff, there\u2019s a very simple chatbot interface with a box for the prompt and not a lot else.\n\nA second immediate difference is the fact that instead of running with one AI model to do the work, Spark comes with multiple models from both Anthropic, with Claude Sonnet 3.5, and OpenAI with o1-Preview and o1-Mini.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal because, as anyone who\u2019s worked with these app makers knows, the Claude model works up to a point and then often runs out of steam when trying to complete a project.\n\nAt that point, a \u2018thinking\u2019 model like o1-Preview is useful, because it seems to overcome contextual limits and fixes issues Claude can\u2019t deal with.\n\nThis happened a few times during my testing. Claude would start to fail when faced with a prompt, at which point I would switch to o1-Preview, and stuff would get fixed.\n\nUse GitHub Spark to create a travel log app - YouTube Watch On\n\nUsing the app is extremely easy, basically, because everything is done via the single prompt box. There are no distracting terminal panels full of code flashing in front of your eyes. Just enter a prompt, watch a pretty little graphic roll and wait.\n\nAfter 20 or 30 seconds the result will pop up for you to check and iterate. One cool feature is the fact that each prompt is staged in the sidebar, so you can step back to an earlier prompt if something goes wrong and you need to try again.\n\nThe geeks haven\u2019t been ignored completely. There\u2019s a setting that lets you add extra instructions to tailor the model to your preferences. There\u2019s also a handy icon at the top of the screen to open up a code panel, so you can manually edit anything you don\u2019t want the AI to touch.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAll in all, Github Spark is a very credible and interesting entry into the AI app-making arena. The fact that I could run up a pretty sophisticated jukebox music player using Amazon S3 storage, and even throw in a bit of AI for to help with mood selection, proves that the platform\u2019s not a toy, even at this early stage. And I did it all in just six hours from scratch.\n\nHopefully, they will start to open it up to more people sooner rather than later, and also remove the need to have a Github account to access the apps that are created. Definitely one to watch for the future."

Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale.\u201d\n\nMCP ostensibly solves this problem through a protocol that enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications (e.g., chatbots). Developers can expose data through \u201cMCP servers\u201d and build \u201cMCP clients\u201d \u2014 for instance, apps and workflows \u2014 that connect to those servers on command.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick demo using the Claude desktop app, where we\u2019ve configured MCP:\n\n\n\nWatch Claude connect directly to GitHub, create a new repo, and make a PR through a simple MCP integration.\n\n\n\nOnce MCP was set up in Claude desktop, building this integration took less than an hour. pic.twitter.com/xseX89Z2PD \u2014 Alex Albert (@alexalbert__) November 25, 2024\n\nAnthropic says that companies, including Block and Apollo, have already integrated MCP into their systems, while dev tooling firms, including Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph, are adding MCP support to their platforms.\n\n\u201cInstead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cAs the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and data sets, replacing today\u2019s fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.\u201d\n\nDevelopers can start building with MCP connectors now, and subscribers to Anthropic\u2019s Claude Enterprise plan can connect the company\u2019s Claude chatbot to their internal systems via MCP servers. Anthropic has shared prebuilt MCP servers for enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub, and says that it\u2019ll soon provide toolkits for deploying production MCP servers that can serve entire organizations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem,\u201d Anthropic wrote. \u201cWe invite [developers] to build the future of context-aware AI together.\u201d\n\nMCP sounds like a good idea in theory. But it\u2019s far from clear that it\u2019ll gain much traction, particularly among rivals like OpenAI, which would surely prefer that customers and ecosystem partners use their data-connecting approaches and specifications.\n\nIn fact, OpenAI recently brought a data-connecting feature to ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot platform, that lets ChatGPT read code in dev-focused coding apps \u2014 similar to the use cases MCP drives. OpenAI has said that it plans to bring the capability, called Work with Apps, to other types of apps in the future, but it\u2019s pursuing implementations with close partners rather than open sourcing the underlying tech.\n\nIt also remains to be seen whether MCP is as beneficial and performant as Anthropic claims it to be. The company says, for example, that MCP can enable an AI bot to \u201cbetter retrieve relevant information to further understand the context around a coding task,\u201d but the company offers no benchmarks to back up this assertion."

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nThe competition between startups and big companies such as Google and Meta to offer compelling AI video creation tools has entered a new phase.\n\nLuma AI, a startup founded by former Googlers and others, is dramatically expanding its Dream Machine AI video model with a new interface, mobile app and new image generation foundation model. The model, Luma Photon, combines personalization, efficiency and creative power to push the boundaries of image and video creation.\n\nNow available on web and iOS, the new Dream Machine aims to blend simplicity and sophistication across input devices through a unified intuitive conversational interface.\n\nPromotional image of new Luma desktop interface. Credit: Luma AI\n\nWith over 25 million registered users since its launch in June 2024, Dream Machine is evolving into a subscription-based service for both casual creators and professionals in industries such as fashion, marketing and filmmaking.\n\n\u201cWe built Dream Machine as a visual thought partner, powered by a whole new image model called Luma Photon,\u201d said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI, during a video interview with VentureBeat. \u201cIt\u2019s creative, intelligent, and designed for the people who build our world\u2014designers, creators in fashion, media, and entertainment.\u201d\n\nPromotional image of Dream Machine iOS. Credit: Luma AI\n\nA new approach to visual creation\n\nDream Machine aims to remove the complexity traditionally associated with creative tools. Users can simply describe their ideas in natural language or provide reference images to guide the platform\u2019s outputs. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which requires precise and technical input, Dream Machine is built for intuitive interaction.\n\n\u201cUnlike prompt engineering, where you have to carefully craft specific commands, Dream Machine lets you talk to it like you\u2019re talking to a person. This conversational interface makes editing and creating intuitive,\u201d Jain explained.\n\nThe platform\u2019s new personalization features, including multi-image prompting and single-image character references, enable users to bring their visions to life with greater accuracy and detail. For instance, designers can upload textures, colors and other visual cues to guide the system\u2019s outputs.\n\n\u201cWith Dream Machine, you can give it reference images\u2014colors, structures, or textures\u2014and it will intelligently combine and iterate until you get exactly what you want. It\u2019s a game-changer for designers and creatives,\u201d Jain added.\n\nNew modes include a Brainstorm mode which allows users to apply different style influences to their imagery and video, as well as Boards of multiple images and videos that can be shared between team members and fellow creators, and \u201cConcept Pills\u201d that offer pre-set unified stylistic visuals users can apply to their video and image outputs.\n\nConsistent characters from a single image\n\nLuma AI envisions a future where visual creation is as seamless and accessible as typing text. Dream Machine bridges this gap, making advanced generative tools usable for everyone, from hobbyists to industry professionals.\n\n\u201cWhy should creating images and videos be as hard as using Adobe\u2019s tools? Imagine if making text was that difficult\u2014there\u2019d be no digital revolution. Visual thought should be just as accessible,\u201d Jain argued.\n\nBeyond accessibility, the platform introduces groundbreaking capabilities for video creation. Users can animate storylines with consistent characters derived from a single image, opening new doors for storytelling.\n\n\u201cYou can now create infinite variations of a person from just one image. This consistency allows for entire storylines in videos with the same character\u2014something that hasn\u2019t existed in video creation until now,\u201d Jain said.\n\nNew image generation model Photon\n\nAt the core of these advancements is Luma Photon, the company\u2019s latest image foundation model, which generates high-quality still images from text prompts \u2014 and includes \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d embedded text, something many other image generation models still struggle to accomplish reliably.\n\nPhoton is built on Luma\u2019s Universal Transformer architecture, which Luma says is eight times faster and more cost-efficient than comparable models.\n\nThis efficiency enables rapid iteration without sacrificing quality, making it ideal for high-demand use cases.\n\n\u201cOur new Photon model is the most creative and personalizable model available today. It adapts in real-time without training, using an advanced universal transform architecture,\u201d Jain explained.\n\nDevelopers can also harness the power of Photon through the Luma AI API, which supports text-to-image, text-to-video and image-to-video transformations. The API ensures privacy for user data and offers scalability for products built on its platform.\n\nNew subscription pricing\n\nThe updated Dream Machine is offered in four pricing tiers:\n\nHobbyists: $9.99/month\n\nExplorers: $29.99/month\n\nProfessionals: $99.99/month\n\nEnterprise: Custom pricing for large teams\n\nThese tiers provide flexibility for users with varying needs, whether they\u2019re creating for personal projects or commercial ventures.\n\nA new era of possibilities\n\nSince its founding in 2021, Luma AI has raised $80M in funding from strategic investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Amplify Partners, Matrix Partners, General Catalyst, and South Park Commons.\n\nAnjney Midha, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlighted the platform\u2019s potential to power industries ranging from photorealistic video generation to interactive 3D worldbuilding.\n\nAs Dream Machine evolves, Luma AI is delivering on its mission to democratize creativity. \u201cDream Machine is where you come to visualize what\u2019s in your head. It helps make sense of the increasingly complex world by leveraging AI\u2019s ability to process and simplify vast amounts of information,\u201d Jain concluded.\n\nWith its blend of accessibility, personalization, and cutting-edge technology, Dream Machine is poised to redefine how people create and share their ideas in the digital age.\n\nCorrection: this article originally misstated the amount Luma AI had raised and erroneously mentioned Amazon as an investor. The article has since been updated to the correct number and investor list."

            "article_content": "The opening theme of Dandadan isn\u2019t just an introduction, but rather it\u2019s a portal into the series\u2019 chaotic and creepy universe!\n\nDandadan\u2018s recent anime adaptation has taken the community by storm with its blend of comedy, action, and supernatural chaos. Apart from the theme, what truly sets it apart is its masterful storytelling of Yukinobu Tatsu, which seamlessly incorporates humor into bone-chilling scenarios \u2014 a formula that resonates deeply with fans of both horror and comedy. But of course, without Science SARU, the visual feast that we\u2019re witnessing wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\n\nOkarun from Dandadan | Credit: Science SARU\n\nSimilarly, an example of Science SARU\u2019s creative genius shines through how they crafted the opening and ending sequences of Dandadan. The opening theme of Dandadan, titled \u201cOtonoke\u201c, displays the series\u2019 identity, packing in countless references to occult lore and horror media. For fans who thrive on decoding hidden messages and diving into urban legends, the opening is nothing but a goldmine.\n\nDandadan\u2018s Opening Song: A Tribute to Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s Love For Occult\n\nThe opening theme of Dandadan by Creepy Nuts, titled \u201cOtonoke\u201d, is a subtle nod to spine-tingling occult references and Japanese spiritual practices. While the song seems like a typical upbeat anime opening theme, it incorporates many elements from Japanese horror legends and classics.\n\nFirst off, in the beginning, the phrase \u201cKuwabara\u201d from the song refers to a Japanese superstitious term, which is related to warding off bad luck and evil spirits.\n\nA still from Dandadan\u2019s opening theme | Credit: Science SARU\n\nAnother bone-chilling horror reference is that Dandadan\u2018s opening song\u2019s title \u201cOtonoke\u201d is most possibly derived from \u201cYamanoke\u201d; a word steeped in Japanese urban legend. The song also uses a phrase called \u201cHaireta\u201d which means \u201cI\u2019m inside\u201d \u2014 a term uttered by individuals who\u2019ve been possessed, marking their descent into paranormal phenomena. The same phrase is also used in an urban legend that started on 2chan named Kinkisaki-Pandora.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lyric in the song that translates to \u201cWhen 4:44 rolls around, let\u2019s go\u201d \u2014 a reference to another symbolism from Japanese culture. The number 4, pronounced as \u201cShi\u201d, is considered unlucky because it sounds like the word for death. The inclusion of \u201c4:44\u201d in the song references the time of night when paranormal activity is believed to peak in Japan.\n\nCreepy Nuts\u2019 Incorporation of Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s Influences for Horror\n\nIn previous interviews, Yukinobu Tatsu has openly expressed his admiration for crossover horror films, particularly Sadako vs. Kayako \u2014 the infamous crossover horror film that pits two of Japan\u2019s most iconic horror characters; Sadako from The Ring and Kayako from The Grudge, against one another. The movie\u2019s ability to be both terrifying and hilariously absurd inspired Tatsu to craft the chaotic yet heartfelt storyline that defines Dandadan.\n\nA still from the film \u201cSadako vs. Kayako\u201d | Credit: Universal Pictures\n\nOne of the standout references in \u201cOtonoke\u201d comes in the form of a lyrical shoutout to Sadako vs. Kayako. The lyric translates to \u201cPacked with ghosts like Sada-chan and Kaya-chan\u201d \u2014 not only paying homage to these chilling horror characters but also drawing a playful connection to the title Dandadan.\n\nThe song also mentions \u201cShyamalan\u201d, which is a direct reference to M. Night Shyamalan, the Hollywood director known for his twisty horror films like The Sixth Sense and Signs. While the mention of Shyamalan might seem out of place at first, it reflects the series\u2019 love for blending global influences with Japanese horror traditions.\n\nWhat makes \u201cOtonoke\u201d stand out is its ability to blur the lines between fiction and reality. By incorporating elements from folklore, urban legends, and even modern horror media, the song reflects the chaotic and unpredictable nature of Dandadan\u2018s world. The references aren\u2019t just clever, it literally serves as both a love letter to the horror genre and a thrilling preview of what\u2019s to come.\n\nDandadan is currently available to watch on Crunchyroll."

The Candyman himself shaped the horror genre with each of his iconic performances, and that legacy extends into now, with the upcoming release of Nicholas Gyeney\u2019s supernatural thriller The Activated Man. The film marks Todd\u2019s final lead role, and we have an exclusive clip featuring the icon below.\n\nRead the full synopsis below:\n\nOrs Gabriel is an everyman who loses his beloved dog, Louis. His grief spurs disturbing visions that cause him to wonder if he\u2019s dealing with the usual highs and lows of a painful loss, or if darker forces are preying on his mind.\n\nIn our exclusive clip, Tony Todd discusses the world of mediums and psychics with Gabriel.\n\nWatch now:\n\nTodd stars in the film with fellow genre icons Sean Young (Blade Runner) and four-time Jason Voorhees, Kane Hodder. Jamie Costa, Andrew Keegan (10 Things I Hate About You), Vladimir Kulich (Vikings), Sab Shimono (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III), and Ivana Rojas (Hulu\u2019s This Fool) also star in the film, with Scott Brown appearing as the villainous \u2018Fedora Man.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Activated Man embarked on its festival run almost one year ago,\u201d said Gyeney. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to be able to share our special film with audiences throughout North America this December. Not only will our film appeal to fans of horror and the paranormal, we believe it also will resonate with those dealing with loss and grief through spirituality.\u201d\n\nTo honor the late Tony Todd, the December 12 premiere will serve as both a night to celebrate the release, and to bid farewell to the star. Two special opening-day screenings in Los Angeles on Friday, December 13 will be fan events with Gyeney and Kane Hodder in attendance to meet fans and give out free exclusive The Activated Man t-shirts designed by popular t-shirt brand Rucking Fotten.\n\nAfter its exclusive premiere, The Activated Man will have a limited theatrical run starting December 13, 2024. It also comes to digital and cable on demand on December 13, 2024."

I completed my research!\"\n\nFor some in the crowd, Lowell has always been a treasured part of the community. Sandra and Saylor Darling are newlyweds who celebrated their engagement here on Mars Hill.\n\n\"It's so beautiful,\" Sandra says of the new discovery center.\n\n\"This is making me so proud,\" Saylor adds. \"We're going to invite all our friends back.\"\n\nThey each sniff a silver tube that offers a whiff of the hydrocarbons found in moondust, and have wildly different reactions: \"It's almost pleasant,\" Sandra says, while Saylor interrupts: \"I think it's horrid.\"\n\nSamantha Christensen of Lowell Observatory led the design of the new exhibits. \"Everyone learns in a different way, so the more senses we can engage, we figure, the better,\" she says.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Kids play in the children's gallery, which has quieter areas with puzzles and games as well as interactive exhibits and a slide.\n\nShe gestures to the new children\u2019s gallery, where joyful chaos reigns as kids make water vapor rings, toss parachutes into wind tunnels, and launch model rockets. One girl dissolves into giggles when her rocket falls to pieces during launch. Christensen says the hands-on activities teach the scientific process: \"It's an opportunity to fail,\" she says, \"but fail in a fun way.\"\n\nTwelve-year-old Metta Kuehn says the rocket launching is one of her favorite activities: \"You pressurize it,\" she explains, \"and then you hit a button and the rocket shoots. It's really loud but really fun.\"\n\nKuehn has big dreams for her future: she wants to be the first person on Mars.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Opening weekend included live theater performances, a one-person show about the importance of imagination in science.\n\nAnd the kids here may be just starting out with a passion for science, but some grownups in the crowd are coming from illustrious careers. Famed comet hunter David Levy says he first saw Lowell in 1967 before it had a visitor center.\n\n\"Coming here today is like being wrapped in a cloud of passion and love for the night sky,\" Levy says. \"I\u2019ve been happy as a clam all day.\"\n\nAs night falls, visitors make their way to the open-air planetarium on the building\u2019s roof. It\u2019s just like any planetarium except the starry skies are real, not a projection.\n\nMelissa Sevigny / KNAU Visitors enter the Stardust gallery, which has exhibits that engage nearly all the senses, including smell.\n\nLowell\u2019s historian Kevin Schindler says this is his favorite part: \"Seeing people come up here every night, and listening to them ooh and aah\u2014even if there\u2019s no program or anything, just looking up and seeing the night sky, or seeing the Milky Way in the night sky and being stunned by it.\"\n\nSchindler says they\u2019re all making their own discoveries, just as astronomers have done on this spot for more than a century.\n\n\"The need to explore and to look up and wonder, that\u2019s part of us,\" he says.\n\nA gasp rises from the crowd as they learn a bright star overhead is the planet Saturn. It\u2019s what every scientist and educator at Lowell was waiting for: that moment of awe."

            "article_content": "A recent customer survey by Rockwell Automation shows that improving product quality is considered to be the top accelerant for manufacturing\u2019s digital transition. In addition, survey respondents said the number one area of impact for artificial intelligence (AI) is in closed-loop quality control.\n\nAt Automation Fair 2024, Amanda Thompson, Rockwell Automation product manager for FactoryTalk Analytics VisionAI, held a session highlighting the newest edition of VisionAI that was released in September 2024. This new release of VisionAI addresses the quality and AI capabilities ranked so highly by Rockwell Automation\u2019s customers.\n\nThompson explained that, while VisionAI does leverage machine vision technology, it\u2019s more than a machine vision system. \u201cThis is a quality inspection platform designed to help you understand the quality of the product you're producing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt not only tells you if a part or product is good or bad, it also tells you why.\u201d\n\nShe added that the system can support vision inspection at line speeds up to 500-600 parts per minute, depending on the application, to read barcodes, classify parts for identification and sorting, detect defects on surfaces, perform presence/absence detection and read/verify text.\n\nBeyond inspection, VisionAI also provides traceability so that users can see the images highlighted by the system as defective to drive comparisons with acceptable images and provide proof of specific defects. \u201cVisionAI features root cause analysis capabilities that will tell you why an item failed, and it provides notifications so that detected issues can be addressed immediately,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nIn keeping with Rockwell Automation\u2019s direction of developing AI-powered technologies that depend on end user domain expertise to refine them, Thompson pointed out that VisionAI is a no-code platform designed for operations and quality control personnel and \u201crelies on your expertise to provide the information needed for the system to make good quality decisions.\u201d\n\nVisionAI architecture and operation\n\nThe architecture of VisionAI stretches from the cloud to the edge, incorporating embedded analytics, data storage, and application programming interfaces for integrations with manufacturing execution and enterprise resource planning systems. The cloud hosts the AI engine and remote access features for monitoring, management, and deployment of VisionAI's edge functionalities. At the edge are local hardware such as edge computers, human machine interfaces, PLC integration and the vision system cameras, lenses and lighting.\n\nThompson noted that VisionAI currently works with Basler cameras but support for more third-party vision systems will be announced in 2025.\n\nExplaining how VisionAI works, Thompson said the first step is for the user to \u201cdefine the type of inspection they want VisionAI to run. Then they can start capturing images and labeling them as good or bad. The number of images needed to train the system will depend on the type of inspection.\u201d\n\nShe added that VisionAI provides a chart for image training that shows the user when enough images have been supplied to successfully train the model. A training report generated by VisionAI shows the model accuracy as it\u2019s developed to indicate if you\u2019ve labeled images incorrectly and allows users to correct them to improve accuracy before deployment.\n\nOnce the cloud-based model has been trained, it\u2019s then deployed to the edge where up to eight cameras can be supported on one system, with live camera feed capabilities available on site and via remote access.\n\n\u201cThe defect carousel feature shows failed images, which lets users double-click on the images to learn more about the failure reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cVisionAI also aggregates data across systems and time periods so that the system\u2019s dashboard supports comparison of batches, stations, production days and other factors to support specific troubleshooting needs.\u201d\n\nQuality reports are generated directly by VisionAI so that every stakeholder receives the same report.\n\nThompson added that VisionAI\u2019s remote access also lets users label images so that they can train and deploy models even if they are not on site. \u201cPlus, version control allows users to see when models were changed so that if a new model doesn\u2019t perform as expected, you can revert back to a previously deployed model,\u201d she said.\n\nIndustry applications\n\nThompson noted several different industry applications suitable for VisionAI, including:\n\nPackaging. VisionAI can do numerous packaging inspections, such as checking a bottle for defects, checking the expiration date and time stamps on labels, and assessing a cap to see if it\u2019s twisted correctly or leaking. Thompson pointed out that all of these inspections can be done at the same time with VisionAI to provide one quality result for the product. She added that VisionAI works on a recipe concept. \u201cIf you are running different shampoo brands on a line and you want to run a slightly different set of inspections, you can create an inspection recipe per product or SKU,\u201d she said.\n\nFood and Beverage. VisionAI can identify issues even on complex backgrounds. For example, it can be used to inspect cereal as it passes on a conveyor to verify correct shape and color and to flag imperfections or foreign objects. It can also assess the placement of toppings on a product to identify issues like gaps in topping placement on bagels or doughnuts.\n\nAutomotive. Applications here can include presence/absence of required labels, verification of correct label placement, identification of wrinkles/bunching on car seat covers and note the specific area on the seat where these wrinkles are located for ease of physical assessment."
