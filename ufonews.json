        "article_content": "In the final moments of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs,\u2018 the line between reality and fiction blurs as Jos\u00e9 de Zer loses himself in his search for the UFO. After a series of inexplicable events showcase themselves, the fakery being utilized by the protagonist to sell the vision to the watching public takes on a whole new dimension as certain elements prove themselves to be far more mysterious than established in the beginning. As Jos\u00e9 overcomes his feelings of imposter syndrome, a different kind of belief instills within him as he tries to find salvation in the message he has been spreading among his followers. However, it causes the movie to end in a very confusing way, which flips the script on the whole narrative! SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nThe Man Who Loved UFOs Plot Synopsis\n\nJos\u00e9 de Zer, an entertainment journalist for a TV news channel, suffers a seizure while interviewing a high-profile celebrity, Monica. The attack is triggered after Jos\u00e9 sees a blinding white light hovering above the sky and a strange high-pitched sound in his head. Subsequently, he wakes up in the hospital while his cameraman, Chango, watches him. One day, two residents from the nearby village of La Candelaria visit him at the hospital and propose for him to cover the story about a burnt pasture in their area. They suggest that the protagonist avail himself of a different angle, namely aliens, as they want tourism to spread in their small community, which has been lacking in advancement over the years.\n\nSubsequently, Jos\u00e9 embarks on a trip to La Candelaria with Chango and finds the burnt pasture in one of the surrounding hills. He conducts several interviews with the locals, who mostly speak about a UFO conspiracy being hidden by the government and higher authorities. With the recorded footage, the reporter heads back to his TV channel headquarters and presents it to his bosses, who disapprove of the idea immediately. Their reservations are mostly levied at Jos\u00e9\u2019s embellishment of the report to make it more exaggerated than usual. However, after various persuasive talks, the protagonist convinces them to air the video during the TV news show \u2018Notidiario.\u2019 When it is presented to the public, more doctored evidence is shown, such as burnt insects lying on the charred pasture.\n\nAs soon as the footage is released, the audience\u2019s interest in UFO sightings swells as Jos\u00e9 slowly becomes a household name. Despite being relegated to more obscure entertainment news over the years, his newfound fame drives more attention to his paranormal claims. More support is pumped into his venture as the journalist starts building a crew around himself who help him fabricate the alien story at a higher production level, which includes a mysterious engineer and self-proclaimed alien enthusiast named Sixto Schiaffino. However, amidst the fakery employed by the protagonist, things start heating up as sightings of real inexplicable saucers start appearing in real life. While he continues to believe in their reality, his daughter Martina is not entirely convinced of her dad\u2019s theories.\n\nThe Man Who Loves UFOs Ending: Are the Aliens Actually Real?\n\nOne of the most confusing and yet pivotal aspects of \u2018The Man Who Loved UFOs\u2019 revolves around the existence of the aliens. Although Jos\u00e9 seems to have faith in their existence, for much of the narrative, he employs dodgy schemes to construct a fake reality to make others believe like him. It suggests that the aliens are simply a construct that the protagonist is using to garner more attention to his work, as he has somehow managed to enrapture them with his style of narration. However, the tricky part of the story is how it plays with the idea of belief and how it can determine what people see as real or not. In fact, during a conversation with his daughter, Jos\u00e9 mentions the same thing to her, telling her that if she believed the aliens did not exist, then they also did not exist in reality.\n\nIt adds a layer of complexity to the narration, especially in the later parts as the mysterious events start ramping up. Initially, the so-called alien visits are only relegated to a flashback in Jos\u00e9\u2019s past, specifically when he got lost in the Sinai desert during the Israel war. Whether it is real or not is left up to the audience at that point, with a majority of people likely to side with the latter. However, doubts start creeping in when the reporter becomes acquainted with Sixto Schiaffino, a man he calls Mr. Engineer. From the get-go, the movie presents him with a mysterious aura, albeit seeming ordinary on the surface. The more Jos\u00e9 dives into his supposed delusions, the more Mr. Engineer offers him spiritual advice and encourages him to keep spreading the words of the aliens.\n\nIn many ways, the movie revolves around the power of belief, and initially, Jos\u00e9 is far from a believer. He even expresses to Chango how skeptical he is of a higher power like God, considering the cruelties in the world. Meanwhile, his cameraman assures him that he himself is a believer. As the narrative progresses, the protagonist undergoes a radical shift in his belief system, going from someone who barely relates to any notion of divine authority to someone who clings to the grace and divinity of the aliens. To that end, the reality of the aliens within the story becomes a rather complicated discussion as it is mostly filtered through the eyes of Jos\u00e9. So, the answer might come down to a case of looking at the problem by subscribing to the protagonist\u2019s worldview from beginning to end.\n\nDoes Jose Survive the Cave Collapse?\n\nIn the final part, an excited Jos\u00e9 leads an expedition into a mining cave in the hills of La Candelaria, expecting to find answers to his burning questions about the aliens. After having spent months in the village concocting various reports, the journalist is given one last opportunity to craft a big story before he must leave the place. Consequently, his final adventure also turns out to be one of the most life-changing events. It begins with a helicopter ride through the area around the burnt pasture, during which Jos\u00e9 witnesses a real UFO zipping through the sky. While following it through the air, he and Chango end up at the mining cave. They venture into it despite protestations on the part of his cameraman. Unfortunately, Jos\u00e9 ends up getting trapped in the cave after he moves in too deep, separating him from Chango.\n\nWhile being stuck under a pile of rubble, the protagonist uses his lighter to read the nearby cave walls, which are decorated with all manner of hieroglyphs, most of them eerily recounting his own story thus far. Another strange occurrence takes place as Mr. Engineer materializes out of nowhere and speaks with Jos\u00e9. This adds even more talking points to the reality of the aliens, as Sixto could not have entered the cave after it collapsed. Mr. Engineer picks up one of the cave hieroglyphics and hands it over to the protagonist before disappearing. A few moments later, he is rescued by the local firefighters, who drag him out of the cave on a stretcher.\n\nWhy Does the UFO Take Jos\u00e9?\n\nThe most concrete evidence of the aliens presents itself in the ending moments of the movie. After being carried out by the firefighters, Jos\u00e9 flags down his daughter Martina and tells her in a state of adrenaline that the aliens want to take him with them. He hands her the cave hieroglyphic before he is wheeled into the ambulance and driven away. While Martina studies the hieroglyphic, a monumental revelation takes place as a gigantic UFO appears out of the clouds and uses its traction beam to lift the ambulance. The crowd gathered around the cave watches in stunned silence as the protagonist is taken into the UFO just like he envisioned previously after hearing Mr. Engineer. It is a game-changing final twist that leaves the ending with a sense of ambiguity and wonder.\n\nThere are several ways to interpret the UFO\u2019s appearance at the end and its reasons for taking Jos\u00e9 with it. The straightforward reading suggests that the aliens always existed, and everyone was blind to them except the protagonist, who saw them first in the Sinai desert during the war. Additionally, Mr. Engineer is one of those aliens who is hiding among humanity and providing support to the reporter as he is the staunchest follower and believer in the existence of extraterrestrials. Therefore, when the UFO appears and takes Jos\u00e9 away, it is a reward for his devotion to their ideals and holding on to his convictions despite the world ridiculing him. While it explains most of the ending, there may be an additional aspect to it.\n\nYears ago, when Jos\u00e9 got lost in the Sinai desert while fighting in the Israeli war, he came close to death several times and did not see any way out. In his derelict state, the vision of the UFO appearing out of nowhere must have felt like a sign of divinity or that his prayers had been answered, even if he was not religious. This highlights the crux of the movie, which uses UFOs as a substitute for religious faith. For most of the narrative, Jos\u00e9 has been striving to achieve that feeling of connection he felt when the UFO first appeared to him. Thus, his attempts at fabricating a lie to make people believe is irrelevant to his intentions of surrendering to his belief entirely. Because he achieves full spirituality in the end, the UFO appears to take him away and reveal its existence to the public, who doubts Jos\u00e9 all along.\n\nRead More: Jos\u00e9 De Zer: What Happened to Him?

With OpenAI working on more ways to use ChatGPT such as the newly released Canvas mode, which works as an AI-powered word processor, it\u2019s an exciting time for Mac and Windows users alike. Hopefully, the arrival of a Windows app is a sign that OpenAI\u2019s standalone app development is ramping up and we\u2019ll see more apps, like Canvas, soon.\n\nThe early version of the ChatGPT Windows app is available to download now from the Microsoft Store for all ChatGPT Plus subscribers. ChatGPT Plus costs $20 (\u00a316, AU$30) a month but if you don\u2019t want to pay, you\u2019ll be able to access this ChatGPT Windows app at a later date once development is complete. Until then, OpenAI fans on Windows can be happy that they\u2019re no longer an afterthought and the much-anticipated app is on its way for everyone to enjoy.\n\nYou might also like..."

A new study finds that Ceres, which sits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, has a crust that\u2019s 90% ice. The discovery of this dirty ice crust has led scientists to believe this giant asteroid used to be a muddy water world. Astronomers have studied Ceres since it was first discovered in 1801. It is both a dwarf planet and the largest asteroid in our solar system. The protoplanet is spherical, with a diameter of approximately 590 miles, and is riddled with craters, volcanoes, and landslides. In 2007, NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft to study Ceres. It reached the dwarf planet in 2015 and orbited it until 2018. While examining the rough surface, astronomers ruled out any signs of water existing on the asteroid because of the visible craters all over the surface. The common belief was that Ceres is relatively dry, with less than 30% ice.\n\nHowever, the new study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, argues that scientists might have judged this crater-rich planetoid too soon. The way the craters formed and the planet\u2019s mass suggest an ice-rich environment. Using spectrographic data from the Dawn mission and computer simulations, the researchers noticed that there may be ice in Ceres\u2019s subsurface. Gravity data also showed a density value close to that of impure ice. \u201cWe think that there\u2019s lots of water-ice near Ceres surface, and that it gets gradually less icy as you go deeper and deeper,\u201d says Mike Sori, an assistant professor in Purdue University\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, in a media release. \u201cPeople used to think that if Ceres was very icy, the craters would deform quickly over time, like glaciers flowing on Earth, or like gooey flowing honey. However, we\u2019ve shown through our simulations that ice can be much stronger in conditions on Ceres than previously predicted if you mix in just a little bit of solid rock.\u201d The researchers mapped out a geographical profile of an actual crater from Ceres and used the information to create computer simulations. The computer simulations modeled how the dwarf planet\u2019s craters relax and deform over billions of years. (Credit: Purdue University)\n\nAccording to the authors, the findings suggest Ceres was once a frozen ocean world similar to one of Jupiter\u2019s moons, Europa. The muddy ocean froze over time, creating an icy crust with some trapped rock. The ice-rich crust had found some way to resist crater relaxation. \u201cTo me the exciting part of all this, if we\u2019re right, is that we have a frozen ocean world pretty close to Earth,\u201d adds Sori. \u201cCeres may be a valuable point of comparison for the ocean-hosting icy moons of the outer solar system, like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus.\u201d The new findings could also warrant a manned space mission to the crater-rich dwarf planet as it may be one of the best chances astronauts have to visit an icy world. \u201cSome of the bright features we see at Ceres\u2019 surface are the remnants of Ceres\u2019 muddy ocean, now mostly or entirely frozen, erupted onto the surface. So we have a place to collect samples from the ocean of an ancient ocean world that is not too difficult to send a spacecraft to,\u201d Sori concludes."

        "article_content": "In 1995, astronomers confirmed the discovery for the first time of a brown dwarf, a body too small to be a star and too big to be a planet - sort of a celestial tweener. But it turns out that was not the full story.\n\nResearchers now have taken a fresh look at that brown dwarf and learned that it actually is not a single brown dwarf but rather two of them orbiting astonishingly close to each other while circling a small star. This was documented in two new studies using telescopes in Chile and Hawaii.\n\nThese two brown dwarfs are gravitationally locked to each other in what is called a binary system, an arrangement commonly observed among stars. So the brown dwarf that three decades ago was named Gliese 229B is now recognized as Gliese 229Ba, with a mass 38 times greater than our solar system\u2019s largest planet Jupiter, and Gliese 229Bb, with a mass 34 greater than Jupiter.\n\nThey are located 19 light-years from our solar system - rather close in cosmic terms - in the constellation Lepus. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nBinary brown dwarfs are a rarity. These two orbit each other every 12 days at a distance of only 16 times the separation between Earth and the moon. Only one other pair of brown dwarfs are known to orbit as close to each other as this twosome.\n\nBrown dwarfs are neither a star nor a planet, but something in between. They could be considered wannabe stars that during their formative stages did not reach the mass necessary to ignite nuclear fusion at their core like a star. But they are more massive than the biggest planets.\n\n\u201cA brown dwarf is an object that fills the gap between a planet and a star. They are formally defined as objects that can burn a heavy form of hydrogen, called deuterium, but not the most common basic form of hydrogen,\u201d said Sam Whitebook, a graduate student in Caltech\u2019s division of physics, mathematics and astronomy and lead author of one of the studies, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n\u201cIn practice, this means they range in mass from approximately 13 to 81 times the mass of Jupiter. Because they can\u2019t fuse hydrogen, they can\u2019t ignite the fusion channels that power most stars. This causes them to just glow dimly as they cool down,\u201d Whitebook said.\n\nThe year 1995 was big for astronomers, with the discovery of the first planet beyond our solar system - an exoplanet - also being announced. Until Gliese 229B\u2019s discovery, the existence of brown dwarfs had only been hypothesized. But there were anomalies about Gliese 229B, particularly after its mass was measured at about 71 times that of Jupiter.\n\n\u201cThis didn\u2019t make any sense since an object of that mass would be much brighter than Gliese 229B,\u201d said Caltech astronomer Jerry Xuan, lead author of one of the studies, published in the journal Nature. \u201cIn fact, some models predict that objects with masses above 70 Jupiter masses fuse hydrogen and become stars, which was clearly not happening here.\u201d\n\nThe new observations were able to discern two separate brown dwarfs. They orbit a common type of star called a red dwarf with a mass about six-tenths that of our sun. While both brown dwarfs are more massive than Jupiter, their diameter is actually smaller than the gas giant planet because they are more dense.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t really know how different brown dwarfs form, and what the transition between a giant planet and a brown dwarf is. The boundary is fuzzy,\u201d Xuan said. \u201cThis finding also shows us that brown dwarfs can come in weird configurations that we were not expecting. This goes to show how complex and messy the star formation process is. We should always be open to surprises.\u201d"

We are documenting the lives of all people and ensuring everyone is well-represented at BN.\n\nDid you miss last week\u2019s conversation with Victor Daniel? You can catch up here.\n\nThis week, we\u2019re doing life with Emmanuel Faith, an HR Professional with close to 10 years of experience. Emmanuel has led the HR teams at General Electric, Corywise and Big Cabal Media. He talks to us about his journey into the world of HR. Enjoy the conversation!\n\nHi Emmanuel. How are you feeling today?\n\nI am fine o, I need a sumptuous meal and a rich sleep after a long day of capitalism.\n\nHaha, everybody wants that. Can you share a bit about your background \u2014 your upbringing, education, and any key moments that shaped your career path in HR?\n\nI have always been a leader, always managed people, processes and projects. I played a lot of football in my teenage years and I was always the team\u2019s captain or vice-captain. The fact that people trusted me to give the right instructions and directions in a sport as intense as football quickly built my innate leadership abilities. Being a first-born of a single-parent family also contributed immensely.\n\nI held two perfect positions in secondary school and was an executive at a university from 100 to 400 levels. I was one of those guys that, if they were on your team, you knew the group assignment would get done no matter what. You can call me Mr. Reliable.\n\n\n\nIn the department, I was the Public Liaison Officer at 200 level, Public Relations Officer at 300 level, and a committee head at 400 level. I had a similar stint in the fellowship, from being the Academic Secretary to being the Fellowship Editorial Director. Being able to coordinate people to achieve different kinds of goals and steer them in a certain direction is one trait I think contributed immensely to how successful my HR Career is today.\n\nIs it stereotypical that male folks don\u2019t often aspire to be HRs?\n\nOh, it\u2019s definitely a stereotype. I don\u2019t think there are a lot of males who aspire(d) to be HR professionals or at least, accidentally found themselves in HR. Maybe there were (are) not a lot of systems of structures to spark the interest or build a foundation that enhances pursuing a career in HR. I mean, how many universities offer HR as a course in Nigeria?\n\nRight, but what initially drew you to human resources?\n\nMy interest in HR started when I realised that I didn\u2019t like finance or wasn\u2019t excited about finance like my colleagues who studied Economics. I had a career chat with my senior colleague, Funto Koya, who asked me to go and research the field of HR because she felt I had the traits, thanks to my consistent delivery of excellent leadership. That was my foray into the field.\n\nI don\u2019t have a single career mentor, and aside from my professional materials (GPHR and ACIPM), I have never completed an HR, but I read a lot of articles. I once read an HR article every day for 180 consecutive days. I also have a couple of career guides who held my hands when I was just starting out my career. Shout out to Ijeoma Ihegwagu (nee Nkwota), Samuel Akinlotan, Dolapo Dahunsi and Funto Koya for their helpful counsel and advice.\n\nYou\u2019ve worked at different places like General Electric, Cowrywise and Big Cabal Media. As an HR professional, how have your positions in these organisations shaped you as an individual?\n\nThanks for asking that! GE was my learning point. I learnt from awesome HR Managers and People Leaders who showed me that there was a unique way to practise HR-ing in Nigeria beyond the conventional ways. Their guides made me commit to being a different kind of HR.\n\nAt Cowrywise, I was given the wings to fly and I am forever grateful for that. I had co-founders who believed in my skills, abilities and competence, and it enhanced me to iterate, execute, make mistakes and go again. They asked me a lot of questions and drilled me a whole lot, but the result was building the best place to work at that period. As I often say; I built my HR roots at GE and watched the fruits sprout at Cowrywise. Being the first HR meant I had to build the HR, People and Processes from the ground up. I like to think I did an excellent job. The results are there.\n\nMy stint at BCM was short but my biggest takeaway was executing at a different level of impeccable (ruthless) excellence, and the power of documentation in enhancing operational efficiency. I now document everything; from a spontaneous employer-branding campaign to a full-blown employee engagement project. Shout out to Anita Eboigbe and Ope Adedeji for that lesson.\n\nIs HR our friend?\n\nThe best answer I have found to this so far is that \u201cThe Office of the HR\u2019\u201d is not your friend, they are here to do a job. So sometimes, the HR can be your friend, but has to act in the capacity of \u201cthe office of the HR\u201d and at that point, they are not your friend. They are just an employee like you, obliged to do their jobs.\n\nYour interests are diverse, but what\u2019s interesting is your fun passion for women\u2019s football. Tell us about this\n\nI am ardent about SDG 5 and I love football and basketball. I found love in women\u2019s football while exploring the intersection between my devotion to Gender Equality and my interest in Sports. I currently guest-write for two International Platforms \u2013Impetus Football and Herfootballhub. I am also a returning contributor to Kingsmeadow Magazine, the number-one magazine for Chelsea women fans in London. Last year, alongside two friends, I founded a platform called Fervora, where we tell laser-focused, data-driven stories on African Women Footballers. It\u2019s been an intriguing journey so far and we have been featured on both local and international platforms. We also published an encompassing report about the exploits of African Women Footballers across the globe, the first of its kind ever.\n\nThat\u2019s so great\n\nI know, right?\n\nSo what\u2019s the most rewarding part of your personal life, and what has been a particularly proud moment in your career?\n\nThe most rewarding part of my personal life is people telling me how I have changed their perception of the HR profession, especially in Nigeria. I think a particularly proud moment was winning the HR and Talent Recruiter of the Year at the No-code Tech Summit, and being listed as one of the top 100 creators in Africa by Selar.\n\nCongratulations again\n\nThank you o.\n\nDoing everything, what does success mean to you, Emmanuel?\n\nWhen my YouTube channel hitting 2k subscribers and 4,000 watch hours? Just kidding. For me, success is putting smiles on people\u2019s faces, watching people\u2019s joy after I finish teaching, or facilitating a learning session, and hearing how impactful they thought I was. It\u2019s being able to do good work, make a great impact, get paid the worth of my work across board and get recognised on global stages. Success is getting a second passport. The day I get one ehn, I will first roll on the floor and give thanks to God.\n\nDo you have an unconventional thought about the world that you think people might not agree with?\n\nI think marriage isn\u2019t for everyone, and not everyone should bring children to the world. I think Christians and Christian institutions don\u2019t talk about sex as a concept enough. All they do is mock, condemn and berate people. This has done more harm than good. The last thing is that many things can influence your success in life, but right now, I think where you are born is the most determining factor, as I said in a TEDx speech.\n\nYou seem busy. What\u2019s a typical day in your life like?\n\nI don\u2019t have a typical day o. HR is always quenching the fire at work. I run my day in a 24-hour model as against the conventional day and night, so I spend the first few hours 00:00-04:00, working on things that need intense focus like a data-driven article for the women\u2019s football platforms I write for, an HR Campaign, policy or strategy, or anything important. I sleep by 04:30, wake up by 09:30, and start work by 10:00 after doing a couple \u201cup and grateful\u201d. I close work by 18:00 and think about what to eat. I read a book, watch Kdrama, facilitate speed consulting with a tech founder or career professional, or catch up with my friends, and the cycle continues.\n\nIf you could remove three things from the HR world, what would they be and why?\n\nThe first thing is that I think admin should be completely separated from HR. They should ban any \u201cHR and Admin\u201d role. HR is becoming more operational and strategic, the latter more than the former. Seeing admin being affixed to the profession occasionally reduces us to \u201cerrand folks\u201d who do \u201cadmin stuff\u201d. I also think employees should be able to apply for leave immediately after completing their probation period, and also be able to receive leave allowance accordingly (or as the company stipulates).\n\nOne thing people will be surprised to know about you?\n\nThat I am an introvert at the core or that I read 303 books between 2018 and 2020. The former is more than the latter, tbh.\n\nThank you for being on Doing Life With\u2026, Emmanuel\n\nThank you for having me.\n\n__\n\nMany thanks to Emmanuel Faith for having this conversation with us and answering all our questions \u2013 and swiftly too, we must add.\n\nDo you love this content, have any feedback for us or want to be a BellaNaija Features contributor?
