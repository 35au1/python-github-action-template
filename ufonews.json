            "article_content": "The Pentagon in Washington, Jan. 26, 2020. When unidentified aircraft are penetrating our defenses and arriving at our doorsteps with impunity, it\u2019s time for the Pentagon to show its cards, writes Gregory T. Goins. Read more\n\nLast week, a neighbor sent me a video of a car-size aircraft silently hovering over a nearby neighborhood, its green and red lights flashing in the night. It was one of many messages I\u2019ve received over the last two weeks about an alarming number of unidentified objects flying over Somerset County, N.J., where I live with my wife and daughter.\n\nAs a UFO researcher for over a decade, I\u2019m being asked by friends, family, and neighbors to explain what\u2019s happening in our community. While I don\u2019t have all the answers (and neither does the FBI, which is currently investigating), I try to reassure people that there\u2019s likely nothing to fear. Gov. Phil Murphy offered a similar message on Thursday, posting on X, \u201cThere is no known threat to the public at this time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the truth is, I am concerned \u2014 and I\u2019m also searching for answers.\n\nElected officials, who should have clarity on these vexing objects, appear just as perplexed as the rest of us. Sen. Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told journalist Matt Laslo on Dec. 4 that he is \u201cgravely concerned\u201d not knowing what\u2019s flying in America\u2019s skies.\n\nMy concerns, like Sen. Warner\u2019s, extend beyond the airspace above suburbs in the Garden State. Similar sightings have been reported in recent years near U.S. military and nuclear facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Virginia, and off the coast of California. But even outside of the U.S., drone incursions remain an American problem. Just weeks ago, U.S. military bases in the U.K were on high alert as swarms of unidentified aircraft breached sensitive airspace.\n\nThese incidents follow a troubling pattern: dozens of aircraft varying in size and shape, emitting bright lights, and persisting for days or weeks. After years of such events around U.S. sites equipped with the most advanced sensors available, you\u2019d think the military could offer some answers to ease public concern.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. When asked about progress in addressing these incursions during a Dec. 5 news conference, Department of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to comment.\n\nThis lack of transparency is unnerving. Unknown craft are flying over my community and sensitive U.S. facilities worldwide. Last week, the anniversary of Pearl Harbor reminded us that failures to identify aircraft and effectively share information can lead to tragic results. Providing answers shouldn\u2019t be deferred, leaving residents worrying what\u2019s flying above our heads.\n\nSome officials call them drones or unmanned aircraft systems, implying known technology or origin, while others refer to them as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), suggesting something completely unknown. This distinction between what\u2019s known and unknown is critical, as each presents unique challenges requiring tailored solutions.\n\nDuring a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Nov. 19, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) indicated some of these incursions are from unidentified anomalous phenomena. \u201cNumber one, we don\u2019t have domain awareness, which is very problematic. Number two, we don\u2019t have domain superiority if we don\u2019t understand how different UAPs are flying, what technology they\u2019re using, what their mission is, what their purpose is. And at the base level, we have so many UAPs around our bases, around our military sites, around our nuclear sites, that it\u2019s deeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nThis is a disturbing situation, which is why we, as citizens, must demand that the Pentagon release more information to both Congress and the American people.\n\nIn September, I spent two days visiting the offices of members of Congress in Washington to promote the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act, a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) and cosponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The bill seeks to compel federal agencies to disclose their findings on unidentified anomalous phenomena to Congress and the public.\n\nI acknowledge that national security implications must be considered before sharing sensitive intelligence information with the public. Revealing what we know \u2014 or don\u2019t know \u2014 about these objects could risk tipping our hand to adversaries.\n\nBut when unidentified aircraft are penetrating our defenses and arriving at our doorsteps with impunity, it\u2019s time for the Pentagon to show its cards. As citizens, we deserve the truth. And we\u2019re prepared to handle it.\n\nGregory T. Goins is a UFO/UAP researcher and advocate for UAP transparency legislative action."

            "article_content": "There\u2019s endless hype around generative AI this year, and app developers have clearly been paying attention. AI-focused tools are blowing up Apple\u2019s App Store charts in almost every category, occupying top 10 rankings across education, productivity, and photo editing. Opportunities are particularly rife for free graphics and design apps, a category that\u2019s positively saturated with AI content creation tools.\n\nBut quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality \u2014 and a great many of these apps are bewilderingly bad. I\u2019ve been using some of the most popular offerings to understand the state of AI tools as we head into 2025. And for every serious attempt to make AI useful, there seem to be several more designed to cash in on the hype: quietly paywalling features they advertise behind pricey subscriptions and greatly misrepresenting the results that users can achieve, if the app even works at all.\n\nAround half of the App Store\u2019s top 10 graphics and design apps have \u201cAI\u201d in the name, and three of them are all made by the same company \u2014 HUBX, an app developer founded in 2022 that\u2019s based in Turkey. One of its apps, DaVinci AI, is advertised as an AI image generator with some photo editing features. Almost every tool is locked behind a $30 annual (or $5 weekly) subscription fee, and the free trial only unlocks a subpar text-to-image feature that gives you a choice between using unspecified versions of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E AI models.\n\nMy prompt was simple \u2014 \u201ca photorealistic dragon flying over a volcano\u201d \u2014 but the results were full of errors like missing wings and weird perspectives. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe images it produces are low-quality and resized or cropped incorrectly. In-app ads appear when you click pretty much any link. The UI is unpleasant to navigate. If you do pay for the full version, you can\u2019t download any edited images without slapping an ugly watermark on it. And yet, it sits far above the rankings for more recognizable creative platforms like Microsoft Designer, which has its own built-in text-to-image AI generator. Adobe Express is the only design-focused app in the same category that currently ranks above DaVinci AI.\n\nDaVinci AI did a decent job of removing a zebra from the right side of the image. There\u2019s no way to download AI-edited images without this watermark, though, and every result is forcibly cropped and warped. Image: DaVinci AI / The Verge\n\nThe other two high-ranking HUBX products I tested were just as lackluster: the Home AI \u201cinterior design\u201d app spits out hallucination-riddled images of rooms that are barely usable even as concept plans, and the Tattoo AI app refused to work entirely. Both apps have the same feature paywalls and review pop-up reminders as DaVinci AI. The copy and pasted App Store version history notes across all HUBX products are also devoid of any details.\n\nWhile all three apps feature a surprisingly large number of five-star reviews, the user feedback across social media and the App Store comments is overwhelmingly negative. A recurring complaint is that customer service is impossible to get ahold of. HUBX never responded to my requests for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the reference image I plugged into Home AI... Image: Home AI / The Verge ...and the \u201cTropical\u201d themed results. Why is the bed now made of melting wood? Why does the desk merge into the chair? How is this remotely helpful? Image: Home AI / The Verge\n\nApps that clearly advertise having AI features are highly attractive. According to Sensor Tower, four out of the top 10 most downloaded iOS graphics and design apps in the US so far this year have had \u201cAI\u201d somewhere in their title. That\u2019s actually two fewer than last year, but the most popular apps are booming. Photoroom saw downloads increase by more than 160 percent since last year. Comparatively, Photoshop Express downloads on iOS \u2014 which also includes generative AI features \u2014 fell by 21 percent during the same period.\n\nAI-focused creative apps aren\u2019t all bad, but the app market saturation makes it harder to find the good ones that use the technology in more focused ways. Apps like Google\u2019s Magic Editor and Adobe Photoshop have specific tools for removing unwanted objects from photos or inserting new ones in specific places. Smaller developers that provide similar features and perform those tasks well are also climbing the App Store rankings.\n\nFor example, Photoroom and Picsart AI \u2014 all-in-one graphic design apps akin to platforms like Canva and Adobe Express \u2014 are actually pretty good! They rank highly in the free \u201cPhoto and Video\u201d App Store category and provide a similar variety of features to quickly create online content using premade digital assets and templates, alongside some AI-powered editing tools like automatic background and object removal.\n\nThe Picsart remove tool is easy to use and does a decent-enough job \u2014 nothing feels underwhelming or misleading. Image: Picsart / The Verge and Image: Picsart / The Verge\n\nNeither app blew me away, but they did exactly what they advertised: the background removal features aren\u2019t as good as Canva\u2019s, but they did the job, and object removal erased undesirable aspects of photos even if it wasn\u2019t as convincing as Google\u2019s Magic Editor. Both apps lock some of their more premium editing features and digital assets behind a $13 monthly subscription, which is pretty standard if you\u2019re being upfront about it \u2014 individual Canva and Adobe Express subscriptions start at $15 and $10 per month, respectively, by comparison.\n\nThere\u2019s also a noticeable divide between the iPhone and iPad charts \u2014 very few AI-focused names appear in the top 100 free or paid list for the iPad, which instead feature a more diverse range of graphic design apps like Adobe Fresco, Clip Studio Paint, and Canva. And interestingly, the list of top paid iPhone apps looks very similar. There\u2019s an abundance of sketching and 3D modeling platforms, premium reference materials for artists, and tools that streamline specific creative tasks like removing backgrounds and resizing images.\n\nThe divide suggests the spammy AI app phenomenon is a mass-market one that hasn\u2019t quite caught on with traditional photographers and illustrators who still want to use their tried-and-true apps. It also suggests that AI itself holds less appeal if users are expected to pay for it, which tracks with the kind of creative AI apps that appear most frequently \u2014 custom tattoos, logo makers, and interior design \u2014 which are skilled services that usually require payment. People don\u2019t necessarily want to remove the skill barrier; they want to remove the financial one."

Icebreaker author Hannah Grace called Good Spirits \"an absolute knockout.\"\n\n\"A new Borison book feels like coming home in the best way. She's truly in a league of her own,\u201d Grace adds.\n\nCheck out an exclusive sneak peek of the novel below.\n\n\n\n'Good Spirits,' by B.K. Borison.\n\nThe glow of my tree welcomes me as I drop my things in a heap by the door, shimmying out of my tights. I tug on my favorite pajamas \u2014 a matching red and white flannel set with dancing reindeer \u2014 and toss my curls into a ponytail. Tonight, I\u2019ll soothe the day\u2019s disappointments with White Christmas and peppermint tea. Tomorrow I\u2019ll try again.\n\nChristmas has always been my favorite time of year. It\u2019s the only time of year when it feels like magic might be real, hovering somewhere close to the surface. Like you can reach out and touch it. Cup it between frostbitten fingertips like sugarplum kisses and popcorn strung on ribbon. Crackling fires beneath the hearth and gingerbread cookies fresh from the oven. Christmas has always felt right. Christmas has always felt true.\n\nI sink into the comfort of my couch and watch my movie, unwrapping a candy cane while Betty and Judy sing about sisters. Something thick and heavy settles at the back of my throat. Sisters.\n\nGrowing up, my sister and I used to lay on the floor with our heads tucked together and watch this scene over and over. We\u2019d promise each other that we\u2019d be the same way, laughing and smiling and dancing \u2014 together, always. We watched our mother and our aunt tear into each other until their relationship was a pile of ash. We knew we wanted something different. Something better.\n\nBut the last time I talked to my sister, cherry blossoms were on the trees and tears were on her cheeks. Somehow, despite our best intentions, we managed to become exactly like them.\n\nI took one path.\n\nSamantha took another.\n\nI force the thought away. Today is December 1. It\u2019s not a day for painful memories. It\u2019s a day for Danny Kaye and peppermint candies and my coziest socks.\n\nTradition. Hope. Kindness.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so busy trying to suck down tea and convince myself that I\u2019m fine that I don\u2019t notice the important things. Namely, the strange man in my living room. I don\u2019t see him until he\u2019s edging his way around my Christmas tree. It\u2019s the scuff of his boots against the floor that finally catches my attention, his shadow large and looming in the glow of my lights. He clears his throat, my head snaps in his direction, and I\u2014\n\nI scream. I scream at the top of my lungs and hurl the closest projectile I have. The TV remote sails over his shoulder, landing next to an ornament of a lighthouse.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t so much as flinch, gazing at me steadily from the shadows.\n\n\u201cHello, Harriet,\u201d he says easily.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nHis voice is rough. A faint accent I can\u2019t pinpoint or recognize. I don\u2019t recognize a single thing about him, most of him hidden in the shadows. All I can make out is a strong jaw and broad body, his hands held loose at his sides.\n\nI press myself farther into my couch. My breath goes shallow. Every murder mystery podcast I have ever listened to has started exactly like this.\n\nThe stranger raises his hands, palms facing out. \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be alarmed. Okay. Says the man who is standing \u2014 uninvited \u2014 in the middle of my living room. He moves closer and light dances over his angular face. He drags one of his hands through his messy, windswept hair.\n\nI grip my candy cane. It\u2019s not sharp enough to stab him with, but I\u2019ve got enough adrenaline coursing through my system to probably cause a little damage.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I breathe.\n\n\u201cI want to help you.\u201d He moves closer. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late, Harriet. You can mend your ways.\u201d\n\n\n\nI blink. \u201cIs this, like, a door-to-door thing? I\u2019m not interested in joining your cult, thank you.\u201d His face remains blank. My eyes dart to the door and back again. \u201cHow did you get into my house?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMore importantly, when can you leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything valuable.\u201d I drag my teeth over my bottom lip. \u201cActually, that\u2019s a lie. That gingerbread house by your feet is handpainted. You could probably get something for it on the black market.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack market,\u201d he repeats slowly. He studies the gingerbread house in question, eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cYou can have it,\u201d I whisper. \u201cPlease leave now.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, dragging his attention back to me on the couch. His eyes linger a beat too long on the patterned material of my pajama bottoms. He drags his hand over his jaw. \u201cI have no interest in your gingerbread house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you have interest in, then? Murder?\u201d\n\nGood job, Harriet, my brain chirps. Very subtle.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in murder, either.\u201d The light shifts over his face. He is all angles and sharp, knowing eyes. His jaw firms and he tilts his chin up. \u201cI\u2019m interested in your soul,\u201d he says ominously, and my stomach lurches up to my throat.\n\nI pause, waiting for him to continue, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cSee, that sounds a little bit like murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really, really sounds like murder.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, if you\u2019re not a murderer, you should really work on your presentation because\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for your reckoning.\u201d He cuts me off quickly, raising his voice. He sounds frustrated, like none of this is going to plan. Good. That makes two of us. His lips flatten into a line and he gives me a look, something flickering behind his eyes. A flame. Or a candle, almost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Ghost of Christmas Past, Harriet. Your reclamation awaits.\u201d\n\nMy jaw hinges open. My candy cane falls to the floor.\n\nOn the first day of December, the universe sent to me\u2014\n\nA string of bad luck and a . . . ghost, apparently.\n\n\n\nAdapted from GOOD SPIRITS by B.K.

Just click login.\n\n\n\nEast West Players has announced its 60th Anniversary Diamond Legacy Season, helmed by recently appointed Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal.\n\nThe season includes five productions by acclaimed Asian American writers that blend time-honored classics with bold new works.\n\nEWP\u2019s 60th Anniversary Season will launch in 2025 with Lauren Yee\u2019s Cambodian Rock Band, directed by Chay Yew, followed by Philip Kan Gotanda\u2019s Yankee Dawg You Die. EWP will be part of a simultaneous world premiere of the sequel to The Brothers Paranormal, Prince Gomolvilas\u2019s Paranormal Inside, directed by Jeff Liu. Jaclyn Backhaus\u2019s timely new work Wives will make its Southern California premiere. Closing the season is the golden-era musical Rodgers & Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song with a new, updated book by Tony Award-winner David Henry Hwang revised especially for the Spring 2026 production to be directed by Lily Tung Crystal. Tam Tran Goes to Washington, written by Elizabeth Wong, returns as the 2025/26 Theatre for Youth touring production.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a profound honor to curate and present East West Players' 60th Anniversary Season, a milestone that reflects the enduring power of our stories to transform and uplift,\u201d says EWP\u2019s Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal. \u201cThis season is a celebration of the brilliant writers who define multiple generations of Asian American theater classics, and a tribute to the persistent impact of their work. We\u2019re honoring the legacy artists who paved the way for us and make what we do possible. We\u2019re also looking forward to the new voices in our community who will create the next 60 years of the American canon. We are excited to amplify both long-established and contemporary voices that will continue to inspire and captivate our community for years to come.\u201d\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song\n\nThe enchanting golden-era musical Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song, directed by EWP Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal, will serve as the grand finale for EWP\u2019s Diamond Legacy season. This captivating tale will receive a newly updated book by the Tony Award-winning playwright, librettist, screenwriter, and EWP theater namesake David Henry Hwang. At a time when conversations about identity and cultural preservation are more important than ever, Hwang\u2019s reworking of the book for the Spring 2026 production allows Asian Americans to reclaim this cherished story in a meaningful way, illuminating the complexities and richness of the community\u2019s continuous evolution. Flower Drum Song pulls back the curtain on themes of assimilation and tradition in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown as Mei-li, a young Chinese opera artist fleeing communism, arrives in America, where she is immediately drawn into the dazzling world of the Grant Avenue nightclubs.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy history with East West Players started when I was 10 years old. My mother was the pianist for one of their first productions, Menotti\u2019s operetta The Medium, directed by Mako,\u201d says playwright David Henry Hwang. \u201cAt an early age, I saw people who looked like me as actors and artistic leaders, which perhaps made it possible for me to envision myself as a playwright when I got to college years later. In 2002, EWP co-produced my new version of Flower Drum Song, which premiered at the Mark Taper Forum before moving to Broadway. I\u2019m thrilled to revisit and further revise this classic musical, working once again with the company that has been at the heart of my entire artistic life.\u201d\n\n\n\nEWP Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal says, \u201cAs a theater kid growing up, I'll never forget the first time I saw Flower Drum Song\u2014it was pure magic seeing faces like mine light up the silver screen in a major Hollywood production. The original has its share of flaws and stereotypes, but it nonetheless holds a special place in my heart. Watching David's Tony Award-winning M. Butterfly on Broadway opened my eyes to what seemed impossible: a real path in theater for an Asian American artist like me. This feels like a watershed moment\u2014directing one of my most cherished musicals written by a playwright I've long admired, whose name graces our theater's marquee in my first season as artistic director of East West Players. After directing and bringing David's first adaptation of Flower Drum Song to life in 2019, I'm deeply honored to collaborate with him in shepherding the next iteration of this musical that has meant so much to the Asian American community.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Henry Hwang and East West Players share an intimate history. The theater\u2019s current location at the former Union Church in historic Little Tokyo was funded in part by Henry and Dorothy Hwang, the parents of the renowned playwright for whom the theater is named. Previous productions of Hwang's work at East West Players include FOB (1980 and 1997 revival), The Dance and the Railroad/House of Sleeping Beauties (1993), Golden Child (2000), M. Butterfly (2004), Yellow Face (2007), Chinglish (2015), and Soft Power, a co-production with Center Theatre Group (2018).\n\n\n\nLily Tung Crystal is a director, actor, singer, and the artistic director of East West Players. She is also the former artistic director of Theater Mu in Minneapolis-St. Paul and co-founder of Ferocious Lotus Theatre Company in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a director, her recent productions include the world premiere of Jessica Huang and Jacinth Greywoode\u2019s new musical Blended \u548c (Harmony): The Kim Loo Sisters (Mu/History Theatre); the world premiere of Saymoukda Duangphouxay Vongsay\u2019s The Kung Fu Zombies Saga (Mu); Lauren Yee\u2019s Cambodian Rock Band (Mu/Jungle Theater); Susan Soon He Stanton\u2019s Today Is My Birthday (Mu); and Steven Karam\u2019s The Humans (Park Square Theatre), which won the Twin Cities Theater Bloggers\u2019 Favorite Play 2022. She also helmed David Henry Hwang\u2019s Chinglish and Flower Drum Song (Palo Alto Players) and the world premiere of Leah Nanako Winkler\u2019s Two Mile Hollow (Ferocious Lotus), all for which she was named a Theatre Bay Area Award Finalist for Outstanding Direction.\n\n\n\nCambodian Rock Band\n\n\n\nKicking off the season in February 2025, EWP will present the Los Angeles premiere of Lauren Yee\u2019s Cambodian Rock Band, featuring music from Dengue Fever\u2014the LA band that inspired the play after Yee attended one of their Long Beach concerts. This poignant new classic of the American theater canon has taken the country by storm, and EWP is proud to be the first to bring this production to Los Angeles County, the home of the largest ethnically Cambodian population outside of Cambodia. This part-play, part-rock concert explores the story of a Khmer Rouge survivor as he returns to Cambodia after 30 long years. As his daughter prepares to prosecute one of the country's most notorious war criminals, the ghosts of their shared past begin to stir. This deeply moving story weaves back and forth through time as father and daughter confront history, turning to music as a path towards healing. This production brings back Director Chay Yew and features members of the original cast from the show\u2019s world premiere at South Coast Repertory. Yew also helmed the off-Broadway premiere at Signature Theatre.\n\n\n\nPlaywright Lauren Yee says, \u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than bringing the epic experience of Cambodian Rock Band home to Southern California for its LA premiere at a theater I have long admired, and whose importance to the Asian American theater movement cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"In Cambodian Rock Band, Lauren has deftly fused history, arts, politics, rock concert, family drama into a potent work,\u201d says director Chay Yew. \u201cThis funny intimate epic touches on the timely issues of genocide, human rights abuses and immigration; the rights of refugees and \u00e9migr\u00e9s; the consequences of apathy when a country shifts under the brutal regime; and the destruction of freedom of expression and art in the midst of personal and political upheavals. In Lauren's astute eyes, one thing remains consistent throughout our temperamental world: the resilience and enduring power of art and artists. Cambodian Rock Band celebrates the indomitable legacy of art\u2014how artists capture our individual and national spirit and hopes; and the uncanny ability of art to inspire, affirm our humanity, and to bring us together. I can't think of a more important play for our current times.\"\n\n\n\nPlaywright Lauren Yee is best known to EWP audiences for The Great Leap (2019), co-produced with Pasadena Playhouse, and is one of the most produced playwrights in America. Yee\u2019s current commissions include Arena Stage, Geffen Playhouse, La Jolla Playhouse, Portland Center Stage, Second Stage, and South Coast Rep. This will be Chay Yew\u2019s tenth production as a director for East West Players. His directing credits with EWP include Big Hunk o\u2019 Burnin\u2019 Love (1998), A Beautiful Country, in association with Cornerstone Theatre Company and Mark Taper Forum\u2019s Asian Theatre Workshop (1998), Golden Child (2000), Red (2002), Sisters Matsumoto(2002), M. Butterfly (2004), Question 27, Question 28 in association with Japanese American National Museum and Mark Taper Forum\u2019s Asian Theatre Workshop (2004), Durango (2007), and Kristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord, a co-production with Center Theatre Group (2023). As a playwright, EWP has produced Yew\u2019s Whitelands Trilogy - Porcelain, A Language of Their Own, and Half Lives (1996), as well as Red, A Beautiful Country, and Question 27, Question 28.\n\n\n\nParanormal Inside\n\n\n\nJust in time for Halloween 2025, East West Players joins forces with Theater Mu in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota and Perseverance Theater in Juneau, Alaska to present the simultaneous world premiere of Prince Gomolvilas's thrilling new work Paranormal Inside, directed by Jeff Liu. This haunting sequel to The Brothers Paranormal, which made its acclaimed Los Angeles premiere at EWP in 2022, dives back into the mysterious world of Max and Delia\u2014two souls brought together by tragic loss and mutual compassion. As they grapple with the depths of intergenerational trauma and ancestral influence on their lives, a malevolent spirit threatens to consume them. Will they survive the night, or will they succumb to the spiritual possession that lurks within?\n\n\n\n\"When East West Players mounted a stunning production of The Brothers Paranormal in 2022, I fully intended it to be my last show\u2014a fitting bookend to a career that began at EWP so long ago,\u201d says playwright Prince Gomolvilas. \u201cEast West Players, Perseverance Theatre, and Theater Mu had the audacity to offer me a new-play commission. I couldn't refuse, and I found that I had more to say about supernatural phenomena, Thai America, cross-cultural connectivity, and the mysterious world in which we all inhabit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"How rarely do we get to do a sequel in the theater? What a joy that three wonderful companies came together so we can go on another adventure with these bruised but funny souls, the Thai American Max and African American Delia,\u201d says director Jeff Liu. \u201cThey\u2019re older, possibly wiser, but life\u2019s challenges and those voices from the other side aren't done with them yet, so we too get to deepen our relationship with these indelible characters that Prince has so lovingly imagined into further life.\u201d\n\n\n\nEWP has produced multiple plays by Gomolvilas, including Big Hunk o\u2019 Burnin\u2019 Love (1998), The Theory of Everything (2000), Mysterious Skin (2010), and the EWP Theatre for Youth show Scrimmage (2019). Director Jeff Liu was behind the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre and East West Players productions of The Brothers Paranormal and the East West Players productions of Ixnay (2009), Chinglish (2015), and Unbroken Blossoms (2024). Paranormal Inside was co-commissioned in 2022 by East West Players, Perseverance Theatre, and Theater Mu, and is supported in part by the the National Endowment for the Arts and Venturous Theater Fund, a fund of Tides Foundation.\n\n\n\nYankee Dawg You Die\n\n\n\nEast West Players presents a timely revival of Philip Kan Gotanda's Yankee Dawg You Die. This groundbreaking play, returning to the stage in July 2025, illustrates the complex, often fraught journey of Asian American actors in Hollywood. Through the lens of an unlikely friendship between two artists, Vincent Chang and Bradley Yamashita, at different stages of their careers, Gotanda's masterful storytelling exposes the painful compromises actors make to succeed in the industry. First performed in 1988, Yankee Dawg You Diehas long been an indictment of the stereotypes and limitations imposed by the entertainment industry on actors of color. This play ignites crucial conversations about representation, identity, and the resilience of Asian American artists\u2013how far we\u2019ve come in the last 60 years and how much further there is to go.\n\n\u201cDoing Yankee Dawg You Die at East West Players is a homecoming,\u201d says playwright Philip Kan Gotanda. \u201cEWP is where I developed the material for the play. Actors I met, actors I worked with, actors who became good friends. They and their hearts are all in there. The Bradleys, now Vincents. The Vincents, now mostly angels. All alive, living memories.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhilip Kan Gotanda is the author of one of the largest collections of Asian American-themed work and is a seminal figure in the field of Asian American drama. This will be East West Players\u2019 second time mounting Yankee Dawg You Die, which was first presented in 2001. Gotanda\u2019s other East West Players credits include The Avocado Kid, or Zen and the Art Of Guacamole (1979), The Dream of Kitamura (1983), A Song For A Nisei Fisherman (1984), Fish Head Soup (1993), in the dominion of night (1995), The Wash (2001), Sisters Matsumoto(2002), The Wind Cries Mary (2004), and Yohen, co-produced with the Robey Theatre Company in both 1999 and 2018.\n\nWives\n\nIn an era where marginalized voices are shaping mainstream consciousness like never before, Wives by Jaclyn Backhaus offers an ardent exploration of the power and resilience at the heart of women's stories. The laugh-out-loud comedy, featuring a South Asian and South Asian American cast, will have its Southern California premiere at EWP in March 2026. The play finds an immediate resonance after the recent national election, where the first South Asian American woman presidential candidate and the first South Asian American second lady found themselves in the spotlight of America\u2019s two major political parties. Wives takes the audience on a spellbinding journey from 16th-century France to 1920s India and 1960s Idaho, offering potent perspectives on the lives of history\u2019s influential men through the eyes of their equally formidable spouses. This work challenges the construction of historical narratives, framing them not as a series of events dominated by men, but as a tapestry woven by many hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis play offers its actors the opportunity to time travel, to play many characters, and to ultimately ask the question of what it means to be able to be fully seen for who they are, rather than who society supposes them to be,\u201d says playwright Jaclyn Backhaus. \u201cIt is a play about how women might support each other in a world run by tyrant men, a play about how community is built by sharing abundance in the face of scarcity.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaclyn Backhaus is a playwright, screenwriter, and educator hailing from Phoenix, Arizona. Her Off-Broadway plays include Out Of Time, Wives, India Pale Ale, Men On Boats, and You On The Moors Now. She has developed theater, film, and TV work with 1497 Features Lab, Sundance, Ojai Playwrights Conference, Berkeley Rep, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Manhattan Theater Club, Ars Nova, The Public Theater, and Two River Theater. She is currently a New Dramatists resident playwright, a core member of The Kilroys, and co-founder/creative director of Fresh Ground Pepper, an artistic process lab in NYC. Wives had its world premiere Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in September 2019.\n\nTheatre for Youth 202526 Tour\n\nIn Fall 2025, East West Players Arts Education will launch its annual Theatre for Youth tour. The company commissions playwrights to create original pieces about notable Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), responding to a STAATUS Index study reporting that many Americans are unable to name a prominent AAPI historical figure. Last year, Allison Minami was commissioned to write Patsy, exploring the life and legacy of Patsy Mink, the first woman of color to serve in Congress and the co-author of Title IX.\n\n\n\nTam Tran Goes to Washington by Elizabeth Wong, commissioned by EWP in 2017, will return as the 2025/26 Theatre for Youth touring production. The play is based on the true story of Tam Tran, a quiet UCLA senior who prefers life behind her camera, as she faces her biggest challenge yet. As an undocumented student, Tran unexpectedly becomes an activist alongside her outgoing Best Friend Cinthya Felix. When Congress invites Tam to testify for the DREAM Act in Washington DC, her world turns upside down. Despite her fears of public speaking and concerns for her family's safety, Tam finds the courage\u2014with help from her mother, teachers, and friends\u2014to stand before the Senate and fight for her right to dream.\n\n\n\nComments"

It stretches approximately 3,666 miles (5,900 km) in length, running parallel to the coasts of Peru and Chile.\n\nDuring the IDOOS exhibition, the specimens were collected with a special lander vehicle that carries scientific equipment, including baited traps, to and from the surface.\n\nThe newly discovered predator was found in the deepest part of the Atacama Trench. (Image credit: JohannaWeston, \u00a9Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution)\n\nFour individual specimens of the newly discovered species were collected, frozen, and later analysed genetically. DNA analysis revealed this tiny predator is not only a new species, but also a new genus (the taxonomic classification above species).\n\nThe discovery highlights the biodiversity in this extreme environment, which is characterized by intense pressure and darkness. The Atacama Trench sits beneath nutrient rich surface waters, and is far removed from other hadal environments, according to the statement. This means it has a wide variety of native species."

            "article_content": "In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the discovery of quantum mechanics, United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology.\n\nIf that milestone catches you off guard, don\u2019t be surprised, as much of the activity and focus around quantum computing happens with little fanfare. Progress is steadily being made with quantum research, but the day when somebody can truly \u201cmaster\u201d quantum mechanics and release its true potential has remained elusive.\n\nWhen that does happen, the good news is that quantum computers will potentially be able to solve in seconds extremely complex tasks that currently take years. The bad news is that quantum computers could also solve the data \u201cpuzzles\u201d that are at the heart of encryption protection, leaving all systems and data immediately vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe advent of quantum computing is a double-edged sword, offering unparalleled compute power while posing unprecedented cybersecurity challenges. The transition to post-quantum cryptography may seem daunting, but with the right resources, strategic planning, and trusted partnerships, enterprises can ensure the protection of sensitive data against future quantum cyberattacks,\u201d says Heather West, Ph.D., research manager, quantum computing research lead, IDC.\n\nWhere quantum development is, and is heading\n\nIn the meantime, the United Nations designation recognizes that the current state of quantum science has reached the point where the promise of quantum technology is moving out of the experimental phase and into the realm of practical applications.\n\n\u201cQuantum computing is at an exciting stage, where active collaboration between academia and industry is leading to rapid innovation,\u201d explains Mohit Pandey, a quantum computing scientist who has extensive experience using quantum computing for drug discovery while working in the biotechnology industry.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2010s, quantum computers were an exotic concept [and] were confined to the isolated academic discussions. But in the last 10 years, we have seen an accelerated pace of the use of quantum technology in business optimization problems, drug discovery, communication, and encryption,\u201d Pandey explains.\n\nThese advances have been made possible due to extensive availability of quantum computers to the public, Pandey says. There are now scores of quantum hardware companies, including large technology companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM and startups such as QuEra, IonQ, and Kipu Quantum.\n\nIn addition, many organizations can now access quantum computers through cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services\u2019 Amazon Braket, Pandey explains. This widespread access opens the opportunity for organizations to investigate the ways in which quantum computing can solve challenging problems.\n\nA campaign to make quantum better understood\n\nRather than commemorate a particular event or development in quantum research, the United Nations designation is more intended to make quantum science more approachable and understandable, explaining what quantum computing means for everyday life in simple terms, says Arthur Tisi, founder of Hunova and co-founder of BaseForge, an advanced technology advisory that deals with quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning strategies.\n\n\u201c\u2018Quantum for everyone\u2019 might be a tagline,\u201d Tisi says. \u201cThe campaign will promote how advancements in quantum require international cooperation \u2014 similar to climate change \u2014 showing that breakthroughs in this field could benefit the entire world, impacting entire industries, not just a few nations or corporations.\u201d\n\nThe UN messaging needs to be that quantum technology comes with lots of challenges still, but it can be a catalyst for helping solve previously insurmountable problems, Tisi says. Global challenges come with hard work and alignment around internet protocols, national security, and regulation \u2014 especially around ethics. But it could have a huge impact on such things as drug discovery, setting aside the bureaucracy within government agencies, he says.\n\nQuantum computers will potentially be able to solve problems that include enormous databases and complex algorithmic challenges and do it with lightning speed, says Thomas Vartanian, executive director of the Financial Technology & Cybersecurity Center. What is not clear is that they will be able to function any better in a lot of areas that computers function today.\n\nQuantum benefits aren\u2019t for every organization\n\nWhat will the full benefit be for organizations when the quantum challenge is resolved? For smaller organizations, probably not much. For large organizations, probably plenty, says Vartanian. Taking into account just the sector that he tracks \u2014 financial services \u2014 the impacts would be game-changing.\n\n\u201cThe G7 Cyber Expert Group [an intergovernmental group chaired by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bank of England] just put out a report basically highlighting the good, the bad, and the ugly of quantum computing,\u201d Vartanian says. \u201cThe good is it will exponentially change the speed at which financial institutions can do market trading. It will facilitate enormously alternative investment strategies. It will enhance risk management. It will provide them greater capabilities to make more reliable predictions. It will change payment processing throughout the world in very dynamic ways, and it will make communications different and more secure.\u201d\n\nThese promised benefits have led to an arms race, of sorts, as organizations \u2014 and even nations \u2014 try to be the first to break the quantum barrier.\n\n\u201cSupercomputing facilities and government entities worldwide are experimenting with the installation of a variety of quantum processing units to better identify the specifications needed for the integration of a gate-based quantum computer with a classical supercomputer. IBM specifically expects to deliver a quantum-centric supercomputer capable of executing 1 billion gates across 2,000 qubits by 2033,\u201d IDC\u2019s West says in her research report IBM Quantum: 156-Qubit Heron, Qiskit Functions, and the Future of Quantum Development.\n\nAlso driving the race is the potential to control the bad and the ugly of quantum. Data encryption is based on the need to solve extremely complex mathematical equations in order to get past the encrypted \u201cfirewall.\u201d The equations are so complex that a standard computer would need years to solve the puzzle. Being able to quickly do so could be a technological tipping point.\n\n\u201cThat depends on who gets quantum computing first and how they use it,\u201d Vartanian explains. \u201cEverything will either be more secure, or less secure.\u201d\n\nToward that eventuality, Vartanian says China is acquiring massive amounts of encrypted data for the time when it might be able to unencrypt it all and gain significant economic, military, and security advantages globally.\n\nWhy IT pros should pay attention to advancements in quantum technology\n\nOn an individual scale, why should IT professionals care about the United Nations quantum designation? For one thing, it serves as a wake-up call that quantum is closer to reality and may soon impact organizations in several industries.\n\n\n\nPerhaps more importantly: The biggest challenge in quantum computing \u2014 both in terms of the development of science and the assimilation by businesses \u2014 is the absence of experts in the field. This could be an exciting and lucrative field within IT.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the need of a massive retraining of IT professionals and the creation of folks who are experts in a field that don\u2019t exist today,\u201d Vartanian says. \u201cThere will be a generational shift in terms of computing power and computing capability, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of investment, particularly by large companies, to make this transition.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important for IT professionals to keep an eye on the rapid development of quantum computers, Pandey agrees. Like any emergent technology, it can be very risky to dismiss its potential. For example, 20 years ago, artificial intelligence was only relevant for researchers. Now it is making a real-world impact with the popularity of AI tools such as ChatGPT.\n\nLearn more about IDC\u2019s research for technology leaders OR subscribe today to receive industry-leading research directly to your inbox.\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the technology markets.

            "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : NASA Dust for planet formation\n\nA team of Indian astronomers has made an exciting discovery that could change our understanding of how planets are formed. Led by Liton Majumdar from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) in Odisha, the team studied a fascinating triple-star system known as GG Tau A, which is located 489 light-years away from Earth.\n\nWhat Makes GG Tau A Special?\n\nUnlike our Sun, which is a single star, GG Tau A has three stars that move around each other. This unusual arrangement is rare in the universe and studying it helps scientists learn more about how planets can form in complex star systems. GG Tau A is also quite young, only about 1 to 5 million years old, making it an excellent example for examining the early stages of planet formation. Surrounding the stars is a ring of gas and dust, which is where planets start to form.\n\nIn most star systems, planets form around just one star. However, in systems like GG Tau A with multiple stars, the gravitational forces between the stars can influence the behavior of the gas and dust. This is why researching GG Tau A is vital; it offers insight into how planets may form in these more complicated environments.\n\nThe Role of Cold and Icy Conditions\n\nTo learn more about planet formation in this system, the team used advanced radio telescopes in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. They focused on the coldest areas of the dust and gas ring, where temperatures can drop to around -261 degrees Fahrenheit (around the freezing point of carbon monoxide). In these chilly regions, molecules freeze into tiny particles of dust. These frozen molecules are essential because they help create the building blocks for forming planets.\n\nIn these extremely cold areas, the tiny dust particles begin to stick together, gradually forming larger clumps. Over time, these clumps can grow into planets as they gather more gas and dust. Understanding this process is crucial for scientists looking to understand how planets might form in distant, cold star systems.\n\nWhy Cold Temperatures Matter\n\nThe very low temperatures in these regions are vital for planet formation. At such cold temperatures, gas and dust particles can easily clump together. If it were warmer, it would be much harder for these particles to stick together, which would make planet formation more difficult. This discovery highlights just how important cold conditions are for the development of new planets.\n\nWhat Happens in Multi-Star Systems?\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of GG Tau A is its status as a multi-star system. While scientists know quite a bit about how planets form around a single star, there\u2019s still a lot to learn about how they form when there\u2019s more than one star involved. The interaction between the three stars in GG Tau A can change the way the surrounding dust and gas behave, making it challenging to predict how planets might form.\n\nThe influences among the stars can cause the gas and dust to act differently than in a system with only one star. This makes GG Tau A a perfect subject for studying how planets can develop in complex, multi-star environments.\n\nALSO READ: NASA's lunar mission timeline shifts: Artemis 2 delayed to 2026, Artemis 3 to mid-2027"

            "article_content": "Languages are typically taught by first exposing you to reading and writing, but native speakers always start learning languages by hearing and talking. Speak has built a platform to teach languages by focusing on how native speakers learn: Using AI, the startup generates audio conversations and listens to users\u2019 responses to improve their grasp of a language.\n\nNow, Speak is announcing a milestone fundraise that further bolsters its progress: a Series C of $78 million that catapults its valuation to $1 billion.\n\nThe funding round is being led by Accel, with previous backers OpenAI (via its Startup Fund), Khosla Ventures and Y Combinator also participating.\n\nThe fundraise is a major jump forward for the startup. Speak confirmed a Series B extension of $20 million at a $500 million valuation only six months ago.\n\nSome of this investment activity may well be down to the huge enthusiasm around generative AI and one of Speak\u2019s key investors. OpenAI, as you might have guessed, is not just a financial backer here. Speak is using the company\u2019s technology to power its platform, and the ChatGPT maker\u2019s also an early partner for the latest in its speech technology. By association, Speak is proving one of the commercial opportunities for GenAI.\n\n\u201cOur 2022 investment in Speak was driven by a shared vision of revolutionizing language learning with AI,\u201d said Ian Hathaway, a partner at OpenAI\u2019s Startup Fund, in a statement. \u201cWe\u02bcre thrilled to see their world class AI talent and unique product vision create transformative learning experiences for a rapidly growing userbase worldwide.\u201d\n\nOne of the primary aims for the funding will be to expand the number of target languages users can learn with Speak \u2014 and thus its customer base \u2014 starting with Spanish and French.\n\nSo far, eight-year-old Speak has been focusing on people studying just one language \u2014 English, the world\u2019s most popular language for learning. Speak provides learning and review materials designed around courses; the idea here is that it will complement what users may have studied elsewhere. Currently the company lists eight originating languages for learning English, based on the most popular language groups among English learners to date.\n\n\u201cFor the one and a half billion people out there trying to learn English, the vast majority of them have spent 15+ years learning intensely. They know vocabulary and grammar better than any of us. But the issue is that they have no ability to speak it,\u201d said CEO Connor Zwick, who co-founded the company with Andrew Hsu (CTO). \u201cFor us, our value proposition up until now has really been, let\u2019s teach people how to communicate in the language.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, that 1.5 billion figure is Speak\u2019s total addressable market, not its user number. It doesn\u2019t actually disclose how many active users it has. As a guide, Hsu said Speak\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 10 million times, and average usage is around 10-20 minutes/day, paying $20 per month, or $99 per year, typically a fraction of the price of hiring a human tutor to work on improving conversation.\n\nSpeak for Business, an enterprise tier, has over 200 customers, the company said.\n\nZwick describes Speak as part learning method and part tech platform that works in a three-step process.\n\nFirst, you are thrown into listening and talking \u2014 an interesting approach, considering that Hsu and Zwick met and started working together after going through a cohort as Thiel Fellows, where you are, in theory, thrown into building an enterprise rather than going through years of learning first.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to explain every single grammatical rule to you,\u201d Zwick said of the first step of its program.\n\nSecond, you are then asked to apply that new term or phrase over and over \u2014 \u201cbasically drills where you just practice saying it out loud with various other pieces of languages so that it becomes automatic, with no translation.\u201d\n\nThird, Speak then presents the phrase in \u201ca real-world context using AI\u2026 That\u2019s how you really anchor it,\u201d Zwick said.\n\nIronically, although the aim is to get its learners speaking a new language with humans, there are no humans in the loop. This is all crafted using speech recognition, natural language processing, generative AI and more to tailor the learning to the learner.\n\nDoes it work, though? For now, Speak doesn\u2019t have any integrations with any standardized language learning qualifications, if you believe in that particular metric. That is a route others in the online language learning space have taken, with Duolingo, for example, providing an English test that international students can use to prove their English competency for thousands of English-language universities.\n\n\u201cWe are explicitly trying not to be a test prep solution, frankly, because, unfortunately, all tests so far are imperfect,\u201d Zwick said. \u201cWhat ends up happening is that people end up gaming tests. They try to become good at taking that test. They\u2019re not trying to become good at actually being able to communicate and use the language in the real world. The only way to really have a proper assessment is to have an expert have a conversation with you. There are some tests like that. But how do we scale that to everyone?\u201d\n\nHsu hinted that this could be part of the company\u2019s plan in the long term, however. \u201cThis system we\u2019re building right now to quantify fluency and efficacy, I think [it] will be really useful for launching something like a true, actually accurate English fluency score or test,\u201d he said.\n\nGamification is also not an area that Speak has explored to date, sitting out one of the bigger trends in online learning in the last several years (for now, at least). Duolingo and companies like Kahoot have leaned into it though, turning the art of learning into something of a game. New services like Eleven Labs\u2019 multilingual AI agents launched in November will potentially open the field to more language-learning services also pursuing ways to encourage speaking that will take on features like gamification.\n\nSome of the funding might see more consumer-driven models like this introduced as well.\n\nNow with more staff, \u201cthere\u2019s room to bring more of those behavioral mechanisms into the app to result in positive change for the users,\u201d Zwick said. But that won\u2019t be at the expense of actually learning. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a tug of war between gamification and engagement and efficacy, we will pick efficacy 100% of the time,\u201d he said.\n\nBen Quazzo, a partner at Accel who led the investment round, will be joining Speak\u2019s board of directors. \u201cSpeak has emerged as a standout player in consumer AI, demonstrating exceptional growth and market potential,\u201d he said in a statement."

            "article_content": "Devs expect tech vendors to supply software development kits, or SDKs, alongside their products to make it easier to create apps using those products. But many vendors only offer APIs, which are simply protocols that enable software components to communicate with each other.\n\nAlex Rattray, the founder of Stainless, thinks AI can assist, here. Stainless uses a compiler to generate SDKs from APIs automatically, largely on the fly.\n\nAs Rattray explained to TechCrunch, without an SDK, API users are forced to read API docs and build everything themselves. Yet there isn\u2019t an easy way for vendors to create SDKs for their APIs at scale.\n\nStainless takes in an API spec and generates SDKs in a range of programming languages including Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, and Go. As APIs evolve and change, Stainless\u2019 platform pushes those updates with options for versioning and publishing changelogs.\n\nWhile a typical vendor might have in-house devs building libraries in various languages to connect to their API, Stainless uses AI to produce an initial config, which teams can then fine-tune to their API. Rattray asserts that this avoids problems like libraries becoming inconsistent or outdated, and can drive quicker upgrades and faster time to integration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quickly entering a world where everyone has access to an expert-level engineer in their pocket,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that shift, every company with a website will see their APIs grow from a power-user feature to a primary interface for all users, and companies without excellent APIs will become as anachronistic as a restaurant without a website.\u201d\n\nMuch of Stainless\u2019 functionality was informed by Rattray\u2019s experiences in the industry.\n\nImage Credits:Stainless\n\nRattray, an economics major, picked up programming on the side while at UPenn, which led to a job at Stripe as an engineer on the developer platform team. At Stripe, Rattray helped to revamp API documentation and launch the system that powers Stripe\u2019s API client SDK.\n\nStainless isn\u2019t the only API-to-SDK generator out there. There\u2019s LibLab and Speakeasy, to name a couple, plus longstanding open source projects such as the OpenAPI Generator.\n\nBut Rattray argues that Stainless delivers more \u201cpolish\u201d thanks to its compiler.\n\n\u201cWhile the OpenAPI Generator exists, many customers mention having tried it,\u201d Rattray said, \u201cand it having fallen extremely short on code quality in its outputs \u2014 often requiring much more work to edit the output and bring it up to snuff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps that polish that attracted tech giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to Stainless\u2019 platform, as well as Runway, Groq, Cerebras, Modern Treasury, and Cloudflare. Rattray claims that Stainless has \u201chundreds\u201d of paying customers today, and that its SDKs are being downloaded tens of millions of times every week.\n\nMost customers are paying for Stainless\u2019 enterprise tier, which comes with additional white-glove services and AI-specific functionality. Publishing a single SDK is free. But companies have to fork over between $250 a month and $30,000 a year for multiple SDKs spanning multiple programming languages.\n\nRattray has said the company\u2019s annual recurring revenue is hovering around $1 million, and that Stainless is nearing profitability. To grow, Stainless recently closed a $25 million Series A led by a16z with participation from Sequoia, The General Partnership, Felicis, Zapier, and MongoDB.\n\nBringing its total raised to ~$35 million, the new cash will go toward expanding New York-based Stainless\u2019 20-person team, Rattray said.\n\n\u201cThe business is very efficient, but we decided to raise to accelerate development toward our vision,\u201d he added. \u201cSDKs are just the first act \u2014 our vision is to build the comprehensive platform developers turn to for everything API-related.\u201d"

            "article_content": "QR codes have become standard for mobile payments, marketing, parking apps, and restaurants. And like any convenient, ubiquitous technology, cybercriminals have found a way to exploit them.\n\nLast year, the FTC issued a warning about scam QR codes, and the United States Postal Service did the same. Both organizations noted that the familiar barcodes were being used as part of a new type of phishing attack \u2014 dubbed \u201cquishing\u201d \u2014 to trick victims into giving up passwords, financial data, and other personal information.\n\nHow Quishing Attacks Work\n\nQuishing attacks come in a few varieties. Sometimes, they arrive as part of a traditional phishing email, luring victims to scan the code on their phones and sending them to fraudulent websites. In others, they may arrive as part of a PDF attachment. In some cases, criminals will paste the QR codes in public areas or near parking lots to trick pedestrians into scanning them. In England, for example, scammers are pasting these codes onto parking meters.\n\nAccording to Barracuda data, more than half a million phishing emails have been detected with QR codes embedded in PDF documents. From mid-June to mid-September this year, Barracuda found these QR codes in PDFs that leveraged brand impersonation and urgency to trick victims into responding. Previously, these codes tended to appear in the body of the email, so the shift to PDFs marks a change in tactics.\n\nMicrosoft was impersonated in over half of the attacks, followed by DocuSign and Adobe. The PDF documents include the QR code, but there are no other external links or embedded files. Recipients are instructed to scan the code with their mobile phone to see a file or sign a document, and they are then directed to a phishing website to steal login credentials.\n\nThis approach using QR codes is clever and difficult to detect since there are no suspicious links or attachments that traditional security solutions would typically spot, and victims use their personal phones (which are less protected than company-owned devices or desktop systems) to scan the code.\n\nBarracuda researchers also noted in their report that the quishing attacks increasingly target small to midsize businesses (SMBs) and companies in industries like finance, healthcare, and education (which deal in sensitive data).\n\nBest Practices for Protecting your Customers from Quishing Attacks\n\nQuishing is another attack variation that will impact clients across industries. IT solution providers should educate clients about the threat and help them implement best practices to prevent security breaches.\n\nFirst, ensure clients instruct employees to be careful about scanning QR codes they receive via email. They should be 100% certain that the code came from a legitimate source and verify this by checking the website links, email addresses, and phone numbers associated with these queries. End-user education is a critical first line of defense against these types of social engineering attacks. Ensure employees know how to spot these emails and that there is a clear process for reporting potential phishing attacks.\n\nEncourage clients to have employees boost the security of their personal phones \u2014 and discourage them from using those devices to scan QR codes from work emails. Phones should be updated with strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and the most recent operating system version. Companies should also institute clear policies around personal device use at work.\n\nInstall a holistic, multilayered email security solution to block phishing emails. Configure email filters to block or quarantine emails containing QR codes from unknown or untrusted sources. Customize rules to trigger additional scrutiny for emails with QR codes. Regularly audit email logs to identify trends in QR-code phishing attempts. Use these insights to enhance your detection rules and improve user education programs.\n\nLeverage artificial intelligence and other advanced technology to augment client security. Quishing emails are designed to bypass traditional email security. AI-based solutions will analyze the behavior of emails containing QR codes, such as unusual sender-recipient patterns or mismatched headers.\n\nEquip your team with post-delivery automated incident response to remediate malicious emails that bypass initial filters. This will ensure the rapid removal of phishing emails flagged after delivery.\n\nTo mitigate QR-code phishing risks, you should work with clients to implement strict controls over QR-code usage within their organizations. All QR codes used internally should be required to be pre-approved by IT or security teams to ensure they are tied to legitimate and secure URLs. Encourage clients to distribute these QR codes only through secure, authenticated channels like internal portals or encrypted email, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.\n\nQuishing is just the latest in a long line of phishing variations that take advantage of consumer technologies. Advanced security solutions and regular end-user education can help prevent QR code-based attacks from compromising credentials and putting sensitive data at risk."

Styling as well as drying your hair, the device is the ideal way to get salon-perfect hair from home. Right now, there\u2019s 15% off the Shark FlexFusion range when you buy direct from Sharkclean.com. All you have to do is use the code FUSION15 any time between now and December 31. That means you could get a Shark FlexFusion from just $280 depending on the model you choose. Sounds good, right? Let\u2019s take a look at the range.\n\nWhy you should buy a Shark FlexFusion\n\nParticularly for anyone with thick hair, buying one of the best hair dryers is a huge game changer. However, it\u2019s an even bigger deal if you combine drying with styling components. Many people love the Dyson Corrale for this role but it isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s much more expensive than the Shark FlexFusion. Going with Shark means you can budget for an extra gift or simply enjoy a considerable saving.\n\nOne of the best options is the with Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush. Down to $280 from $330 when you apply the code FUSION15, you get the perfect all-in-one tool for drying, curling, volumizing, smoothing, or straightening. There\u2019s no risk of heat damage from styling and you can even dry and style wet hair. It also has a scalp shield for protecting your scalp, and it\u2019s developed by dermatologists so you\u2019re all good here.\n\nWhen buying, you can choose two accessories such as a FrizzFighter, Oval Burhs, or auto-wrapper. It\u2019s perfect for personalizing your gift choice for your loved one. If you want to spend more, you can do so by investing in more accessories, or by adding on an air straightener. It\u2019s great to have such flexibility here as it feels much more like picking an individual gift for someone rather than just choosing an out-of-the-box solution.\n\nThe Shark FlexFusion range is now available with 15% off when you use the code FUSION15 at Sharkclean.com. The code works until December 31 but we think it\u2019d be great to buy now to gift to someone ahead of the holidays. Check out which bundle works best for you by tapping the link below and don\u2019t forget to apply the code!"

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nCybercriminals are also employing real-world physical attacks in addition to digital threats, US cybersecurity firm Fortinet finds\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 US cybersecurity firm Fortinet on Tuesday, December 10, presented to the media their annual threat predictions report for 2025.\n\nAs expected, artificial intelligence continues to generate buzz. In the cybersecurity industry, Fortinet describes an ongoing arms race between cybersecurity professionals and firms such as them, and threat actors.\n\nThreat actors have made use of artificial intelligence in the past year in order to make attacks more efficient, more prevalent, and more targeted. Through AI, threat actors or hackers can more easily, for example, craft more sophisticated phishing messages that may have a higher chance of reeling in a victim.\n\nAI has also been deployed by these hackers to much more easily modify code in order to evade security updates.\n\nThe technology has also lowered the barrier for entry for would-be hackers, much in the same way that people can now code programs with the help of large language models (LLMs). These are some of the threats being presented by AI, and Fortinet expects that such usage will only expand in the coming year.\n\nFor their part and the part of other cybersecurity vendors, they leverage AI for detecting danger patterns across whole swaths of network that manual monitoring just wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish. Fortifying their software solutions is also helped along with AI tools.\n\nIt has always been an arms race between attackers and cybersecurity vendors. The difference here is that AI scales up the speed, efficiency, and frequency of attacks, necessitating vendors to make use of similar technologies to maintain defenses.\n\nAside from AI, here are the key trends to expect:\n\nMore attack chain expertise emerges. In recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d Cloud-specific attacks to rise.

DNA analysis revealed this tiny predator is not only a new species, but also a new genus (the taxonomic classification above species).\n\nThe discovery highlights the biodiversity in this extreme environment, which is characterized by intense pressure and darkness. The Atacama Trench sits beneath nutrient rich surface waters, and is far removed from other hadal environments, according to the statement. This means it has a wide variety of native species."

This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nArtistic visualization of XLuminA's automated optical discovery process.

This represents how XLuminA explores vast experimental configurations to discover novel super-resolution microscopy techniques.

Credit: Long Huy Dao, Philipp Denghel\n\nFor human researchers, it takes many years of work to discover new super-resolution microscopy techniques. The number of possible optical configurations of a microscope\u2014for example, where to place mirrors or lenses\u2014is enormous.\n\nResearchers at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light (MPL) have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) framework which autonomously discovers new experimental designs in microscopy. The framework, called XLuminA, performs optimizations 10,000 times faster than well-established methods.\n\nThe researchers' work is published in Nature Communications.\n\nCurrently, optical microscopy is most widely used in the biological sciences. The ingenuity and creativity of human researchers have led to the discovery of super-resolution (SR) methods, which overcome the classical diffraction limit of light at about 250 nm and enable one to resolve the organization of the smallest functional units of cellular life.\n\nFinding new microscopy techniques has traditionally relied on human experience, intuition and creativity\u2014a challenging approach given the vast number of possible experimental optical configurations. For example, if an optical setup consists of just 10 elements, chosen from five different components such as mirrors, lenses, or beam splitters, there are already more than 100 million unique configurations.\n\nThe complexity of this space suggests that many powerful techniques may remain undiscovered, and human intuition alone might not be enough to find them.\n\nThis is where AI-based exploration techniques could be of enormous benefit, exploring this space in a fast and unbiased way.\n\n\"Experiments are our windows to the universe, into the large and small scales. Given the sheer enormously large number of possible experimental configurations, its questionable whether human researchers have already discovered all exceptional setups. This is precisely where artificial intelligence can help,\" explains Mario Krenn, head of the Artificial Scientist Lab at MPL.\n\nTo address this challenge, scientists from the Artificial Scientist Lab joined forces with Leonhard M\u00f6ckl, a domain expert in super-resolution microscopy and head of the Physical Glycoscience research group at MPL. Together, they developed XLuminA, an efficient open-source framework designed with the ultimate goal of discovering new optical design principles.\n\nThe researchers used its capabilities with a particular focus on SR microscopy. XLuminA operates as an AI-driven optics simulator which can explore the entire space of possible optical configurations automatically. What sets XLuminA apart is its efficiency: it leverages advanced computational techniques to evaluate potential designs 10,000 times faster than traditional computational methods.\n\n\"XLuminA is the first step towards bringing AI-assisted discovery and super-resolution microscopy together. Super-resolution microscopy has enabled revolutionary insights into fundamental processes in cell biology over the past decades\u2014and with XLuminA, I'm convinced that this story of success will be accelerated, bringing us new designs with unprecedented capabilities,\" adds Leonhard M\u00f6ckl, head of the Physical Glycoscience group at MPL.\n\nDr. Carla Rodr\u00edguez, scientist in the research group of Dr. Mario Krenn at MPL. Credit: Jan Olle\n\nThe first author of the work, Carla Rodr\u00edguez, together with the other members of the team, validate their approach by demonstrating that XLuminA could independently rediscover three foundational microscopy techniques.\n\nStarting with simple optical configurations, the framework successfully rediscovered a system used for image magnification. The researchers then tackled more complex challenges, successfully rediscovering the Nobel Prize-winning STED (stimulated emission depletion) microscopy and a method for achieving SR using optical vortices.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

The researchers asked the framework to find the best possible SR design given the available optical elements.\n\nThe framework independently discovered a way to integrate the underlying physical principles from the aforementioned SR techniques (STED microscopy and the optical vortex method) into a single, previously unreported experimental blueprint. The performance of this design exceeds the capabilities of each individual SR technique.\n\n\"When I saw the first optical designs that XLuminA had discovered, I knew we had successfully turned an exciting idea into a reality. XLuminA opens the path for exploring completely new territories in microscopy, achieving unprecedented speed in automated optical design,\" says Carla Rodr\u00edguez, the study's lead author and main developer of XLuminA.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud of our work, especially when thinking about how XLuminA could help in advancing our understanding of the world. The future of automated scientific discovery in optics is truly exciting.\"\n\nThe modular nature of the framework allows it to be easily adapted for different types of microscopy and imaging techniques. Looking forward, the team aims to include nonlinear interactions, light scattering and time information which would enable the simulation of systems such as iSCAT (interferometric scattering microscopy), structured illumination and localization microscopy, among many others.\n\nThe framework can be used by other research groups and customized to their needs, which would be of great advantage for interdisciplinary research collaborations.\n\nMore information: Carla Rodr\u00edguez et al, Automated discovery of experimental designs in super-resolution microscopy with XLuminA, Nature Communications (2024).

            "article_content": "In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the discovery of quantum mechanics, United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology.\n\nIf that milestone catches you off guard, don\u2019t be surprised, as much of the activity and focus around quantum computing happens with little fanfare. Progress is steadily being made with quantum research, but the day when somebody can truly \u201cmaster\u201d quantum mechanics and release its true potential has remained elusive.\n\nWhen that does happen, the good news is that quantum computers will potentially be able to solve in seconds extremely complex tasks that currently take years. The bad news is that quantum computers could also solve the data \u201cpuzzles\u201d that are at the heart of encryption protection, leaving all systems and data immediately vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe advent of quantum computing is a double-edged sword, offering unparalleled compute power while posing unprecedented cybersecurity challenges. The transition to post-quantum cryptography may seem daunting, but with the right resources, strategic planning, and trusted partnerships, enterprises can ensure the protection of sensitive data against future quantum cyberattacks,\u201d says Heather West, Ph.D., research manager, quantum computing research lead, IDC.\n\nWhere quantum development is, and is heading\n\nIn the meantime, the United Nations designation recognizes that the current state of quantum science has reached the point where the promise of quantum technology is moving out of the experimental phase and into the realm of practical applications.\n\n\u201cQuantum computing is at an exciting stage, where active collaboration between academia and industry is leading to rapid innovation,\u201d explains Mohit Pandey, a quantum computing scientist who has extensive experience using quantum computing for drug discovery while working in the biotechnology industry.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2010s, quantum computers were an exotic concept [and] were confined to the isolated academic discussions. But in the last 10 years, we have seen an accelerated pace of the use of quantum technology in business optimization problems, drug discovery, communication, and encryption,\u201d Pandey explains.\n\nThese advances have been made possible due to extensive availability of quantum computers to the public, Pandey says. There are now scores of quantum hardware companies, including large technology companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM and startups such as QuEra, IonQ, and Kipu Quantum.\n\nIn addition, many organizations can now access quantum computers through cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services\u2019 Amazon Braket, Pandey explains. This widespread access opens the opportunity for organizations to investigate the ways in which quantum computing can solve challenging problems.\n\nA campaign to make quantum better understood\n\nRather than commemorate a particular event or development in quantum research, the United Nations designation is more intended to make quantum science more approachable and understandable, explaining what quantum computing means for everyday life in simple terms, says Arthur Tisi, founder of Hunova and co-founder of BaseForge, an advanced technology advisory that deals with quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning strategies.\n\n\u201c\u2018Quantum for everyone\u2019 might be a tagline,\u201d Tisi says. \u201cThe campaign will promote how advancements in quantum require international cooperation \u2014 similar to climate change \u2014 showing that breakthroughs in this field could benefit the entire world, impacting entire industries, not just a few nations or corporations.\u201d\n\nThe UN messaging needs to be that quantum technology comes with lots of challenges still, but it can be a catalyst for helping solve previously insurmountable problems, Tisi says. Global challenges come with hard work and alignment around internet protocols, national security, and regulation \u2014 especially around ethics. But it could have a huge impact on such things as drug discovery, setting aside the bureaucracy within government agencies, he says.\n\nQuantum computers will potentially be able to solve problems that include enormous databases and complex algorithmic challenges and do it with lightning speed, says Thomas Vartanian, executive director of the Financial Technology & Cybersecurity Center. What is not clear is that they will be able to function any better in a lot of areas that computers function today.\n\nQuantum benefits aren\u2019t for every organization\n\nWhat will the full benefit be for organizations when the quantum challenge is resolved? For smaller organizations, probably not much. For large organizations, probably plenty, says Vartanian. Taking into account just the sector that he tracks \u2014 financial services \u2014 the impacts would be game-changing.\n\n\u201cThe G7 Cyber Expert Group [an intergovernmental group chaired by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bank of England] just put out a report basically highlighting the good, the bad, and the ugly of quantum computing,\u201d Vartanian says. \u201cThe good is it will exponentially change the speed at which financial institutions can do market trading. It will facilitate enormously alternative investment strategies. It will enhance risk management. It will provide them greater capabilities to make more reliable predictions. It will change payment processing throughout the world in very dynamic ways, and it will make communications different and more secure.\u201d\n\nThese promised benefits have led to an arms race, of sorts, as organizations \u2014 and even nations \u2014 try to be the first to break the quantum barrier.\n\n\u201cSupercomputing facilities and government entities worldwide are experimenting with the installation of a variety of quantum processing units to better identify the specifications needed for the integration of a gate-based quantum computer with a classical supercomputer. IBM specifically expects to deliver a quantum-centric supercomputer capable of executing 1 billion gates across 2,000 qubits by 2033,\u201d IDC\u2019s West says in her research report IBM Quantum: 156-Qubit Heron, Qiskit Functions, and the Future of Quantum Development.\n\nAlso driving the race is the potential to control the bad and the ugly of quantum. Data encryption is based on the need to solve extremely complex mathematical equations in order to get past the encrypted \u201cfirewall.\u201d The equations are so complex that a standard computer would need years to solve the puzzle. Being able to quickly do so could be a technological tipping point.\n\n\u201cThat depends on who gets quantum computing first and how they use it,\u201d Vartanian explains. \u201cEverything will either be more secure, or less secure.\u201d\n\nToward that eventuality, Vartanian says China is acquiring massive amounts of encrypted data for the time when it might be able to unencrypt it all and gain significant economic, military, and security advantages globally.\n\nWhy IT pros should pay attention to advancements in quantum technology\n\nOn an individual scale, why should IT professionals care about the United Nations quantum designation? For one thing, it serves as a wake-up call that quantum is closer to reality and may soon impact organizations in several industries.\n\n\n\nPerhaps more importantly: The biggest challenge in quantum computing \u2014 both in terms of the development of science and the assimilation by businesses \u2014 is the absence of experts in the field. This could be an exciting and lucrative field within IT.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the need of a massive retraining of IT professionals and the creation of folks who are experts in a field that don\u2019t exist today,\u201d Vartanian says. \u201cThere will be a generational shift in terms of computing power and computing capability, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of investment, particularly by large companies, to make this transition.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important for IT professionals to keep an eye on the rapid development of quantum computers, Pandey agrees. Like any emergent technology, it can be very risky to dismiss its potential. For example, 20 years ago, artificial intelligence was only relevant for researchers. Now it is making a real-world impact with the popularity of AI tools such as ChatGPT.\n\nLearn more about IDC\u2019s research for technology leaders OR subscribe today to receive industry-leading research directly to your inbox.\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the technology markets.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA mineral trapped within a Martian meteorite that fell to Earth has revealed traces of water on Mars that date back 4.45 billion years, according to new research. The zircon grain may contain the oldest direct evidence of ancient hot water on the red planet, which may have provided environments such as hot springs that are associated with life on Earth.\n\nThe discovery opens up new ways of understanding whether Mars was ever habitable in its ancient past. It also adds more support to observations already gathered by the fleet of spacecraft orbiting and roaming the red planet, which have spotted evidence of where rivers and lakes once existed on the Martian surface.\n\nBut key questions remain about when exactly water first appeared on Mars and how it evolved \u2014 and disappeared \u2014 over time.\n\nScientists analyzed a sample from the \u201cBlack Beauty\u201d meteorite, also known as NWA 7034, that was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011. The meteorite was ejected from the Martian surface after another celestial object hit the planet between 5 million and 10 million years ago, and fragments of it have served as a key source of studying ancient Mars for years.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Science Advances on November 22, focused on a single grain of the mineral zircon spotted within the meteorite. The team\u2019s analysis shows that water was present just 100 million years after the planet formed, which suggests that Mars may have been able to support life at some point in its history.\n\n\u201cOur data suggests the presence of water in the crust of Mars at a comparable time to the earliest evidence for water on Earth\u2019s surface, around 4.4 billion years ago,\u201d said lead study author Jack Gillespie, researcher at the University of Lausanne\u2019s Faculty of Geosciences and Environment in Switzerland, in a statement. \u201cThis discovery provides new evidence for understanding the planetary evolution of Mars, the processes that took place on it and its potential to have harboured life.\u201d\n\nMinerals as time capsules\n\nRocks may hold the answers to some of the biggest remaining questions about Mars, including how much water was present and whether life ever existed on the planet. That\u2019s why meteorites like Black Beauty are of such interest to scientists. Carl Agee, a professor and director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, first presented the space rock to the scientific community in 2013.\n\n\u201c(The Black Beauty meteorite) contains hundreds of rock and mineral fragments, each with a different part of the 4.5 billion years of Martian history,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Aaron Cavosie, a planetary scientist and senior lecturer the Space Science and Technology Centre at Curtin University, in an email. \u201c(It) is the only source of pieces for the geological puzzle of pre-Noachian Mars.\u201d\n\nThe Noachian period occurred from 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, and little is known from direct measurements dating to the pre-Noachian period on Mars, between 4.5 billion and 4.1 billion years ago, though it\u2019s crucial to understand because it serves as the first page in the Mars history book, Cavosie said.\n\nBut Black Beauty has revealed some of its secrets. Many of the rock fragments the meteorite contains show that the Martian crust endured a number of impacts, causing a massive amount of upheaval on the planet\u2019s surface, he said.\n\nThe space rock also contains the oldest known pieces of Mars, including the oldest zircons, Cavosie said.\n\nZircon, used in products such as jewelry, ceramic tiles and medical implants, is a hardy mineral that can help scientists peer into the past and determine the conditions present when it crystallized, including the temperature at the time and whether the mineral interacted with water.\n\n\u201cZircon contains traces of uranium, an element that acts as a natural clock,\u201d said Gillespie, who was a postdoctoral research associate at Curtin University\u2019s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the time of the study. \u201cThis element decays to lead over time at a precisely known rate. By comparing the ratio of uranium to lead, we can calculate the age of crystal formation.\u201d\n\nThe zircon in Black Beauty was unaltered by its trip to Earth and fiery entrance into our planet\u2019s atmosphere before crashing down in the Sahara because it was protected by its location within the meteorite\u2019s interior, Cavosie said.\n\nDuring the analysis of the zircon grain, the study team detected unusual amounts of iron, sodium and aluminum, suggesting that water-rich fluids left these traces on the zircon as it formed 4.45 billion years ago. Such elements aren\u2019t usually found in crystalline zircon, but the researchers\u2019 atom-scale studies of the zircon showed the elements incorporated into the crystal structure and lined up like fruit stands in a market, Cavosie said.\n\n\u201cWe could tell by the patterns of how the (iron, aluminum and sodium) are found inside the zircon that they were incorporated into the grain as it grew, like layers in an onion,\u201d Cavosie said.\n\nOn Earth, zircons from hydrothermal systems \u2014 which form when water is heated by subsurface volcanic activity like the upward flow of hot magma \u2014 have similar patterns to those found in Black Beauty.\n\nIf hydrothermal systems existed in the Martian crust 4.45 billion years ago, liquid water likely made its way to the surface.\n\n\u201cOur experience on Earth shows that water is critical for habitats capable of supporting life,\u201d Cavosie said. \u201cMany environments on Earth host life in hot water systems, including hot springs, and hydrothermal vents. Such environments may have given rise to the earliest life forms on Earth. Our new study shows that the crust of Mars was warm and wet in the pre-Noachian period, meaning that habitable environments may have existed at that time.\u201d\n\nGetting up close with Mars\n\nCavosie is curious to determine whether hydrothermal systems like hot springs were prevalent when magma was helping form the red planet\u2019s crust between 4.48 billion and 4.43 billion years ago or if they were more episodic.\n\n\u201cIf hydrothermal systems were a stable feature on early Mars, it would indicate habitable conditions may have persisted over a considerable time span,\u201d Cavosie said. \u201cThis is now a testable hypothesis that can be addressed by collecting more data from Martian zircons.\u201d\n\nUntil samples can be returned directly from Mars, the Black Beauty meteorite is one of the best windows into how the Martian crust formed and what the early surface of Mars was like, said Briony Horgan, co-investigator on the Perseverance rover mission and professor of planetary science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Horgan was not involved in this study.\n\nFinding evidence of hydrothermal systems within the subsurface from one tiny grain of zircon aligns with scientific theories on the amount of water and volcanic activity that existed on ancient Mars, she said. And these earliest potentially habitable environments would have been shielded from radiation by a strong planetary magnetic field, which Mars lacks today, Horgan added. Scientists are still trying to explain how the red planet lost its protective magnetic field.\n\nCurrently, the Perseverance rover is climbing the rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, an ancient lake once filled with water 3.7 billion years ago. Some of the rocks the rover has encountered may have been formed by hydrothermal systems, Horgan said.\n\nThe rover will take samples from the rocks because they could preserve evidence of ancient microbial life.\n\n\u201cAs much as the meteorites can tell us, we can do even better with a carefully selected and intact rock sample from a known location on Mars with good geologic context,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cSo this paper is a great motivation for bringing our Mars samples back to Earth to study with the same level of detail for years to come.\u201d"

            "article_content": "LambdaTest, a cloud-based software testing platform, has raised $38 million in a Series D funding round as it looks to expand its presence in existing markets and improve its AI capabilities.\n\nThe Series D was led by Avataar Ventures, and saw participation from Qualcomm Ventures. It brings LambdaTest\u2019s total funding raised to $108 million.\n\nLambdaTest provides infrastructure that lets companies test their applications across more than 5,000 browser and operating system combinations. Instead of setting up and maintaining expensive testing suites, companies can use LambdaTest\u2019s cloud platform to see if their software runs as intended across different environments. LambdaTest also maintains labs with thousands of devices for testing.\n\nThe investment comes as software testing faces mounting pressure from the rise of AI-generated code. According to LambdaTest\u2019s survey of over 1,600 enterprise teams, only 23% of testing bandwidth is spent on test authoring and planning, and significant time is consumed by maintenance and operational tasks like fixing broken tests, triaging and debugging, and setting up test environments.\n\nThe startup recently launched the KaneAI platform, which it describes as an \u201cAI Native QA Agent-as-a-Service,\u201d aiming to automate many such tedious testing tasks. The system, LambdaTest claims, can reduce manual effort in test script generation by 40%-70%.\n\n\u201cKaneAI is more than a tool \u2014 it\u2019s a transformative approach to QA, empowering teams to test smarter and faster, with less manual effort,\u201d said Asad Khan, CEO and co-founder of LambdaTest. \u201cOur foundation in LambdaTest\u2019s cloud-based platform gives us an edge in delivering this solution at scale.\u201d\n\nThe company also claims its HyperExecute platform lets teams run tests up to 70% faster than traditional cloud grids, with 2.5x faster test resolution and 60% quicker error detection.\n\nThe startup has also developed features like flaky test identification, which PWC reports helped reduce time spent on error reporting and analysis by 40%. Its test intelligence system offers auto error categorization and smart analytics, along with automatic retries of failed tests and reordering of tests for faster feedback, LambdaTest said.\n\n\u201cAs AI applications on the cloud and on devices become more prevalent, continuous testing with AI-driven automation is essential for accelerating release cycles and improving CI/CD pipeline efficiency,\u201d said Quinn Li, Senior Vice President, Qualcomm and Global Head of Qualcomm Ventures. \u201cLambdaTest\u2019s comprehensive product suite is transforming software quality assurance with AI-driven autonomous testing systems. We are excited to support their journey.\u201d\n\nThe startup, which competes with firms like BrowserStack and SauceLabs, plans to deploy the fresh capital to make deeper inroads in its existing markets and broaden its technology stack.\n\n\u201cAsad & team are a force of nature to be reckoned with \u2014 in a short period of time they have disrupted the entire market,\u201d Nishant Rao, Avataar Ventures\u2019 founding partner, said in a statement. \u201cFrom creating the first AI-native, no-code QA solution to launching the only truly e2e Enterprise grade, secure test orchestration platform, they have totally changed the game.\u201d\n\nLambdaTest, which counts Premji Invest, Peak XV Partners and Blume Ventures among its backers, says it serves over 15,000 customers, including Fortune 500 and G2000 enterprises across financial services, insurance, travel, retail and healthcare. Since its inception in 2017, users have executed more than 1.2 billion tests on the platform to date, the company said.\n\nAvendus advised LambdaTest for the new financing round."

Police also told the NYT that Mangione is now considered a \"strong person of interest\" in light of the new evidence.\n\nMangione, a prep school valedictorian and Ivy League graduate, was captured by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania earlier on Monday. His arrest followed a days-long manhunt for Thompson's suspected assassin that included the deployment of drones, scuba divers, and K-9 units.\n\nAs digital sleuths discovered soon after Mangione's name was released, the young man's social media accounts contain a wealth of information about his worldview, which seems to have morphed from disgruntled academic to angry manarchist over the course of this year \u2014 before dropping off completely months before the killing.\n\nThis entire debacle has been incredibly dramatic \u2014 and as we learn more about law enforcement's primary suspect, we're likely in for a few more shocks.\n\nMore on the murder of Brian Thompson: Bill Burr: Murdered Insurance CEO Was a \"Gangster\""

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Building an integrated system to manage businesses The profitability simulator module What else can the coAmplifi suite do?\n\nRunning a consulting business is no easy task. Aside from identifying a niche and bringing the right mix of generalist and specialist talent on board, numerous operational matters need attention before the firm can run smoothly \u2013 which means being able to serve clients\u2019 needs effectively while capturing all possible revenue opportunities.\n\nDoing all these tasks manually can be incredibly complicated and consume a lot of manpower, time, and resources. While many software programs on the market accomplish specific tasks, such as time tracking, payroll, and project management, using separate software introduces a whole new set of problems. These software rarely \u2018communicate\u2019 with each other, making it difficult to coordinate across different functions. In the end, significant manual effort is still needed, which somewhat defeats the purpose of using software.\n\nBuilding an integrated system to manage businesses\n\nAccording to Mark Parinas, CEO and Founder of California-based software developer CuraeSoft, consultancy firms of all sizes \u2013 from global giants to independent firms with a handful of staff \u2013 lack an integrated system to manage their businesses. Various functions, including timekeeping, billing, project management, planning, resource allocation, and profitability calculations, are being done on separate platforms, resulting in inefficiencies and frustration among the staff. Research from CuraeSoft shows that 82% of projects overshoot their original timelines due to project management hurdles, and efficiency decreases by 30% when using manual processes and disjointed systems.\n\nCuraeSoft\u2019s flagship product is coAmplifi, a workforce management software platform that combines all the functions needed to run a modern business into a single package. Parinas says that coAmplifi can give consulting businesses a financial edge by providing a clearer look at their bottom line and how it is affected by various actions and factors.\n\nOne of coAmplifi\u2019s features is the time-tracking module, which captures all billable hours, solving one of the largest pain points of the consulting industry. Oftentimes, billable time can fall through the cracks, resulting in lost revenue. coAmplifi\u2019s time-tracking module automates the process with each completed billable action automatically attributed to a client and registered for billing. The module also allows consultancies to plan and organize their time accordingly, helping with resource allocation and management. Consultants can easily plan out their schedule on the platform, and managers can easily see who\u2019s booked and who\u2019s available to work on a particular task.\n\nThe profitability simulator module\n\nAnother major boost for consulting firms is the profitability simulator module, which minimizes trial and error on their end. Before signing a contract with a client, they can calculate the potential project\u2019s profitability on coAmplifi\u2019s system. This eliminates guesswork and reduces the chance of having to adjust mid-engagement for things that were unaccounted for. For example, setting the wrong rate for a service can have a huge negative financial impact on the company, and coming back to the client and asking for a higher price is incredibly damaging to the client relationship and the consultancy\u2019s reputation.\n\n\u201cThe profitability calculator module allows you to do modeling internally, whether before, during, or after an engagement,\u201d Parinas says. \u201cIt takes into account various scenarios to help users determine how to make a particular project profitable, as well as which resources should be allocated to it \u2013 whether time, financial, material, or human.\u201d\n\nWhat else can the coAmplifi suite do?\n\nThe coAmplifi suite also includes various functions required by all businesses, such as payroll, project management, and business intelligence. By providing an all-in-one and centralized business software solution, the coAmplifi VOHQ (coAmplifi virtual operating headquarters), enables consulting firms to have a remote or hybrid workforce while maintaining accountability. In turn, this allows firms to recruit and retain talent from a wider pool.\n\nAccording to Parinas, having all these functions rolled into a single platform provides cost savings for businesses, as they no longer have to pay for multiple licenses. In line with its ethos of accountability and transparency, coAmplifi can track the whole consulting process, allowing the consultant to share with the client how each engagement is conducted and billed.\n\n\u201cBecause everything is tracked within coAmplifi, it\u2019s easy to generate a report about the entire engagement, which lets the client know exactly what they\u2019re paying for, down to which staff member did a particular task,\u201d Parinas says. \u201cThis eliminates any ambiguity regarding the billing, building trust and a better business relationship between consultancy and client.\u201d\n\nDigital Trends partners with external contributors.

The AirGo Vision is available now starting at $299 \u2014 the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta eyewear tech \u2014 and features integration with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o AI model to identify and answer questions about the people, objects, and text seen by the camera.\n\nThat allows the AirGo Vision to do things like translate text into different languages, provide directions to nearby locations or landmarks, and give the wearer more information about what they\u2019re looking at. Solos says the glasses can also be integrated with other AI models like Google Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, something the company previously teased when it announced the AirGo Vision in June.\n\nLike the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, the AirGo Vision camera can capture photos on demand. A swappable frame system means that you can wear the glasses with or without the camera \u2014 the battery and touch sensors used to control the device are housed in the frame\u2019s USB-C chargeable hinges, providing an audio-only option when paired with the standard, no-camera-included AirGo frames.\n\n\u201cOne thing we promised to deliver on was allowing consumers to have control of their experience with AI and smart technology, particularly with privacy options in mind,\u201d Solos co-founder Kenneth Fan said in the announcement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we developed frames that can easily be changed to decide when and where a camera may be appropriate without sacrificing any of the fun features.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a frontal view of the Krypton 1 frame style...

The ability for AI-driven software and systems to become more efficient at their assigned tasks, as well as evolve to learn new skills over time, gives this game-changing technology a virtually limitless ceiling.\n\nDespite an awe-inspiring addressable market of $15.7 trillion by 2030, based on estimates from PwC in Sizing the Prize, not all Wall Street analysts are necessarily bullish on the companies leading the AI charge. Keeping in mind that analyst price targets are fluid and often reactive rather than proactive, two seemingly unstoppable AI stocks can plunge by up to 94% in 2025, based on the price targets of select Wall Street analysts.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop?

These outsized returns are a function of its AI-driven Gotham platform and AI- and machine learning-powered Foundry platform, being unique at scale.\n\nGotham is a service that federal governments use for mission planning and execution, as well as gathering data. Since these contracts typically stretch for four or five years and are with the U.S. government and its immediate allies, Palantir is able to generate predictable operating cash flow, with little concerns about being paid.\n\nMeanwhile, Foundry is geared at helping businesses better understand their data in order to streamline their operations and improve profitability. This segment is still very early in its expansion, with Foundry's commercial customer count rocketing higher by 51% to 498 during the September-ended quarter from the prior-year period.\n\nYet in spite of this seemingly perfect positioning for Palantir, RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria believes shares of the company are worth (drum roll) $9, which would represent an astounding 88% decline from where shares closed on Dec. 6. Said Jaluria in a recent investor note,\n\nWe cannot rationalize why Palantir is the most expensive name in software... Absent a substantial beat-and-raise quarter elevating the near-term growth trajectory, valuation seems unsustainable.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The economy in rural America starts and stops with the American farmer.\n\nAmid the deafening noise inside political echo chambers and ceaseless squabbling of Congress is one truth that we cannot ignore- we are a nation united in reliance on our farmers.\n\nWithout the American farmer, there is no adequate tax base for our school systems, local municipalities, or any services that rural Americans need to live and prosper in this country.\n\nEverybody eats, and we all need the food and fiber that our farmers produce to live. No one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of food, just like no one wants to be dependent on foreign sources of energy. Right now, our farmers need our help.\n\nHurricane Helene caused a devastating blow to Georgia's No. 1 industry, with over $6.4 billion in agricultural economic loss alone.\n\nIf we fail to provide agriculture-specific appropriations to help our farmers before the end of the year, we will see widespread, lasting economic loss across all of rural southeast America, especially in Georgia.\n\nAs I traveled across Georgia's 8th Congressional District in the immediate aftermath of Helene, I saw the devastation to our farms firsthand. From hundreds of demolished poultry houses and cotton fields in Coffee County to decimated pecan orchards in Berrien and Lowndes counties and vegetable rows and fruit bushes in ruins across Clinch County, it is clear that our farmers need immediate assistance.\n\nCongress cannot stop a hurricane, but we can fix the unnatural disasters that our farmers face to aid their recovery.\n\nHouse Agriculture Chairman Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, R-Pa., Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., visited Georgia's 8th District with me recently to survey the damage after Helene across south Georgia and north Florida. Our farmers need help, and I appreciate the chairman and others taking the time to meet with them firsthand so we can better work together for relief.\n\nUnfortunately, trouble for our nation's farmers began far before Hurricane Helene. Since the last farm bill was passed in 2018, our farmers and nation have experienced excessively challenging events that have changed the political landscape in which we need to navigate to properly support the best stewards of our land.\n\nRelated Articles Opinion: The dire state of the American farm economy\n\nWith rising input costs, including the increased cost of labor, diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed, farming is more expensive than it has ever been in our country.\n\nGeorgia's farmers were also horribly impacted by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which caused more than $2.5 billion in losses to the state's agriculture industry. It took approximately 24 months for our farmers to get relief after Hurricane Michael, and I can assure you that the majority of producers and rural communities that Helene hit cannot survive another 24 months without something being done.\n\nAmerica's farmers are also suffering from the unnaturally disastrous policies of the Biden-Harris administration, which have contributed to record inflation and the rising cost of energy and food production.\n\nThere has to be a strong safety net to keep good farmers farming through bad years like this one. If you are an American who eats, you should deeply care about the passage of a comprehensive farm bill that prioritizes production agriculture.\n\nEarlier this year, the House Agriculture Committee passed the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (the farm bill). This legislation includes critical updates to reference prices and several of my priorities to ensure a strong farm safety net by expanding crop insurance options to specialty crops, all of which would greatly assist producers in times of natural disaster.\n\nHowever, this bill is stalled in Congress, and the Senate Democrats just released a half-baked last-minute \"farm bill\" just to look like they did something, further fueling the fear of the forgotten farmer as they struggle to feed us.\n\nWhen the American farmer stops farming, rural communities collapse because their core and main economic driver is gone. We need to give farmers the support they need to keep farming with the confidence to know they are not forgotten.\n\nIt is my hope that Congress passes both the Farm, Food, and National Security Act and an agriculture-specific disaster relief appropriations package before the end of the year so that our farmers can continue feeding our nation and supporting our rural communities.\n\nRepublican Rep. Austin Scott represents the 8th District of Georgia and is a member of the House Agriculture Committee."

            "article_content": "Progressives have suddenly found themselves lost in the political wilderness, caught in a self-inflicted trap of anger and fear. From the sound of their fury, they could be there for a long while. (Thoughts and prayers.)\n\nWith Democrats now irrelevant, the second Trump administration has four years to take a wrecking ball to the Washington establishment, including deep cuts to federal spending and an overhaul of the bloated bureaucracy.\n\nTo understand why the wrecking ball is needed, look at the annual budget deficit \u2212 $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. In a time of relative peace and prosperity, the deficit grew 8% in one year, even though federal revenue increased by 11%. In other words, the Biden-Harris administration collected significantly more money from taxpayers in the last fiscal year but still managed to blow up the deficit by an additional $138 billion. That's simply unsustainable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter President-elect Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMusk operates at another level, building the most valuable automaker in the world in Tesla and the most important entity (public or private) in space travel and satellite communications with SpaceX.\n\nCan Musk succeed where Obama's Simpson-Bowles failed?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump joins SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to view the launching of the aerospace company's Starship rocket on Nov. 19, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nIf Musk and Ramaswamy are able to accomplish even a portion of what they envision \u2212 cutting $2 trillion in government spending \u2012 it could provide a remarkable boost for our economy.\n\n\"They're going to need inside Washington budget experts like ex-Capitol Hill staffers and the like,\" Chris Edwards, a Cato Institute economist who specializes in government spending, told me. \"People (who) used to be on the budget committees on Capitol Hill and used to work for the (Office of Management and Budget). They're going to need those sorts of people to tell them exactly how and what they can cut.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn't the first attempt to cut government spending. In 2010, President Barack Obama created the Simpson-Bowles commission to recommend budget cuts that would trim the deficit over a 10-year period.\n\nThe commission's recommendations failed to gain traction in Congress. In fact, the federal government has added about $16 trillion to the national debt since Simpson-Bowles was created. So there's reason for cynicism. Trump and Congress will need to actually cut the programs Musk and Ramaswamy recommend, even if the president needs to use his veto power to do it.\n\nOpinion: Trump can fix what Biden broke. But he needs to seize the moment and stay on task.\n\nEdwards said Republicans need to be serious about deficit reduction starting next year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"(Republicans) need to at least show deficits kind of on a downward path,\" the Cato economist told me. \"They don't have to do a massive spending cut next year, but they've got to show financial markets and the Federal Reserve that the deficits are on a downward path.\"\n\nIt's a misconception that the executive branch doesn't play an important role in how the economy functions. The massive federal deficit helps fuel inflation. And as Edwards noted, \"The deficits and debt are so large now we're in uncharted financial territory for this country.\"\n\nDOGE should cut this department first\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy endorses former President Donald Trump's reelection campaign in Atkinson, N.H., on Jan. 16, 2024.\n\nThe Cato economist said DOGE could start to deliver better efficiency by initially focusing on a popular but underperforming section of the budget. A proposal to target federal spending on K-12 education might seem radical, but it also would signal that Musk and Ramaswamy are serious.\n\n\"K-12 schools is easily the biggest and most attractive opportunity for Trump and his team to cut,\" Edwards said. \"George W. Bush made a big show of signing the No Child Left Behind legislation ... and greatly increased federal subsidies and federal intrusion into the schools. That obviously failed. Test scores are down. I think today's Republican Party has completely changed on education. ... There's been the huge success of school choice.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion: Voters strongly rebuke Democrats by electing Trump. But will progressives listen?\n\nI second Edwards' suggestion.\n\nWhile public schools are necessary, more and more spending hasn't led to better results.\n\nThe Department of Education's budget for this fiscal year is almost $80 billion \u2012 nearly $10 billion more than the enacted budget only five years ago.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

Michel published an article that recommended $4.8 trillion in specific cuts over the next 10 years, including selling off Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and transforming Medicaid funding by sending block grants to the states.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDemocrats are sure to whine about those ideas and others. Republicans should ignore them and focus instead on saving taxpayers' money, getting the deficit under control and saving America from an economic disaster that will hit if the nation stays on its current course.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

            "article_content": "The Meta Quest 3 is confidently the best VR headset out there right now but a report suggests it may cede its top spot to other headset manufacturers while allowing them to use its OS and store.\n\nA report was recent published by The Information (via OC3D) citing an employee at Goertek, the Chinese manufacturer who produces and tests Quests, and two employees at Meta. In this, it is claimed Meta hopes that Goertek and other manufacturers will take on a bigger role in designing and creating headsets by 2030, potentially fully developing them.\n\nTaking a step back from production is said to be a way to allow Meta to focus on software, which is a much more profitable section of the business.\n\nOften times, hardware, specifically cheap and accessible hardware like Meta's budget headset are sold at a loss or barely breaking even, in order to make money back on the software.\n\nWe've seen time and time again the massive costs of Meta's VR and AR division, Reality Labs. It has often spent upwards of a billion dollars per month.\n\nInstead of putting out headsets, Meta could essentially loan the use of its OS and Meta Quest storefront for non-Meta headsets to use.\n\nOf course, coming from just a handful of employees, it's important to note that plans for moving hardware manufacturing away from Meta itself is reported for some time in the future. Meta could always change course over the next few years, especially as the VR market continues to develop.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nHaving just bought a Meta Quest 3 myself, one of the things I'm most pleasantly surprised by is how intuitive that OS is. Everything slots together well and is easy to explore. The idea of Meta essentially loaning its software doesn't seem like a bad idea in theory, especially when it's one of the few things holding back rivals like the Pico 4 Ultra.\n\nNot only does Meta have a big install base but its OS has wider brand recognisability, which is part of why Android is popular today. An Android user can easily swap to almost any Android phone with little problems, which makes it easier for new names to enter the market.\n\nThis is all before mentioning the rather stellar section of titles available on the Meta storefront. Throw in a Meta Quest + Subscription, and access to some of the bigger titles like Asgard's Wrath 2 and Batman Arkham Shadow, and you have an impressive selection to play through.\n\nIn that same article, The Information's report says that Meta is aiming move up to half of the production of its headset to Vietnam, diversifying what has otherwise been predominantly Chinese manufacturing.\n\nThis appears to be an effort to avoid the huge penalties on Chinese imports that will come as a result of the tariffs, proposed by soon-to-be president Donald Trump.\n\nVirtual reality (Image credit: Valve) Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?\n\nBest graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR\n\nBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR\n\nThat production change from China to Vietnam being assisted by Goertek is a further strengthening of Meta's relationship with the Chinese manufacturing company, and one that signals that grander business plan, according to the previously mentioned employees.\n\nAs of right now, Goertek is an essential part of the production and testing of Meta Quest headsets but Meta is said to be encouraging Goertek to also work on designing components like lenses and displays.\n\nMeta has cemented a name for itself in the VR market with great well-priced hardware and it might actually see a greater return on all that digital real estate in the next decade."

            "article_content": "For many years, OnePlus has attempted to challenge Samsung's supremacy as the top manufacturer of Android smartphones. Although OnePlus phones have come very close to being the greatest Android smartphones available, they still need to catch up in several crucial areas. For example, the OnePlus 12, which was released at the beginning of this year, included:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAn optical in-display fingerprint scanner.\n\nAn IP64 rating.\n\nFour years of OS upgrades.\n\nWith the OnePlus 13, which may be the Chinese smartphone manufacturer's first actual flagship phone and could eventually compete with Samsung's top-tier models, OnePlus has addressed many of these problems. Let's compare the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13 and learn the main differences between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePuls 13 smartphones.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Design\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Known for its high-end construction, the S25 Ultra is anticipated to have a titanium frame with a rounded shape, increasing durability while preserving a stylish appearance. For consumers who value productivity, the S Pen's addition offers utility.\n\nOnePlus 13: With an aluminum frame and a circular camera module, the OnePlus 13 takes on a more contemporary appearance. It might be better made than the S25 Ultra, but it still has a fashionable and functional design.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Display\n\nAdvertisment\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Featuring a 6.8-inch QHD+ display with a resolution of 3088 x 1440 pixels , this model is expected to support a refresh rate of 144Hz , ensuring smooth visuals and an immersive experience.\n\nOnePlus 13 also sports a 6.8-inch display with a slightly higher resolution at 3168 x 1440 pixels. However, it is rumored to have a refresh rate of 120Hz, which is still impressive but may not match the ultra-smooth experience of the S25 Ultra.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Camera\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : With a powerful 200 MP primary camera and extra sensors for telephoto and ultra-wide photos, this phone promises to be an excellent photographer, especially in low light.\n\nOnePlus 13: With two extra 50 MP sensors for telephoto and ultra-wide photography, the OnePlus 13 boasts a multipurpose camera configuration. Its camera system is made for versatility and high-quality photos, even though it might not have as many megapixels is the S25 Ultra.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Battery Life\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Expected to house a 5,000 mAh battery , which may be optimized through software improvements like Battery AI to enhance longevity during intensive use.\n\nOnePlus 13: It boasts a larger 6,000 mAh battery, promising extended usage times, which is especially beneficial for heavy users who prioritize battery life.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Charging Speeds\n\nAdvertisment\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra : Anticipated to support up to 45W wired charging and potentially increase wireless charging speeds from 15W to 25W.\n\nOnePlus 13: This model is set to offer rapid charging capabilities with up to 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging, making it one of the fastest charging options available.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs OnePuls 13: Pricing\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is projected to be priced around \u20b91,24,990.\n\nIn contrast, the OnePlus 13 offers an attractive price point starting at \u20b964,990, making it a more budget-friendly option without compromising essential features.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nComparing the prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the OnePlus 13\n\nApple had drastically lowered the pricing of its iPhone 16 Pro lineup due to the Indian government lowering import taxes on handsets and associated parts. Nevertheless, it is still being determined whether Samsung will maintain the Galaxy S25 Ultra's prices from the previous year or decrease. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra started for \u20b91,29,999 in India last year. By contrast, the OnePlus 12 started at \u20b964,999 in the nation. While the OnePlus 13's price is anticipated to increase, it should still be significantly less expensive than the Samsung substitute and have many of the same features. Limited software support and the absence of a 5x telephoto lens are two areas where the OnePlus 13 might fall short of the S25 Ultra.\n\nOnePlus 13: Specifications\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAccording to the China specifications, the OnePlus 13 is anticipated to include a 6.82-inch BOE X2 2K+ AMOLED screen with a maximum brightness of 4,500 nits, 2160Hz PWM dimming, and the first DisplayMate A++ certification in history.\n\nA 50MP Sony LYT 808 primary sensor, a 50MP Sony LYT600 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP Samsung JN1 ultra-wide angle lens make up the triple camera configuration on the rear of the OnePlus 13. There is a 32MP Sony IMX612 front-facing camera for taking selfies and making video calls.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which has a fantastic AnTuTu score of 3.18 million, powers the OnePlus 13, as was previously announced. The device supports up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage and 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM. The OnePlus 13 has IP68 and IP69 ratings to protect against dust and water. Additionally, it has an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which is an improvement over the OnePlus 12's optical sensor.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Specifications\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to keep its titanium frame from the previous model year, making it one of the most robust phones available. In contrast, the OnePlus 13 will probably have an aluminum frame, which is sturdy but pales compared to titanium.\n\nCompared to the OnePlus 13, the phone is anticipated to have a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with Gorilla Glass Armor protection, making the screen less reflective and more resilient. The Samsung phone may have an advantage due to its higher transfer speed, even though the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra should have at least 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. According to rumors, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will include UFS 4.04, which might double transfer rates above the OnePlus 13's UFS 4.0 storage.\n\nA 200MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x zoom, and a 50MP periscope lens with 5x magnification are all part of the triple camera arrangement that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to have. There ought to be a 12MP selfie camera on the front.\n\nWith a 50MP 5x periscope camera, the Galaxy S25 Ultra considerably outperforms the OnePlus 13 despite having a higher resolution ultra-wide angle lens. However, Samsung is unlikely to go to quicker charging speeds, and the S25 Ulta will probably have the same 45W wired and 25W wireless charging capabilities. With faster wired and wireless charging and support for magnetic charging, OnePlus leads the field in this area.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is exceptional in its high-end construction, cutting-edge camera technology, and valuable tools like the S Pen. In contrast, the OnePlus 13 distinguishes itself by its competitive cost, faster charging options, and greater battery capacity. Whether you favor value-driven performance or luxury features will determine which option best suits your needs."

            "article_content": "It's a fish story with a big, unexpected plot twist.\n\nA native Great Lakes whitefish thought extinct for nearly 40 years has been rediscovered by scientists \u2014 in the wrong Great Lake.\n\nThe Shortnose Cisco was once abundant on the Great Lakes, but overfishing and invasive species such as sea lamprey, zebra and quagga mussels, alewives and round gobies dwindled the fish's numbers and disrupted its habitat. A 2016 Great Lakes Fishery Commission report on ciscoes of the Great Lakes described the Shortnose's historic waters as Great Lakes Michigan, Huron and Ontario.\n\n\"Despite more recent sampling using appropriate gear at suitable locations and depths, (the Shortnose Cisco) was last recorded in Lake Ontario in 1964, Lake Michigan in 1982, and Lake Huron in 1985 and is currently believed to be extinct,\" the report stated.\n\n'Nobody was expecting us to find this'\n\nNot so fast. In 2022, Shortnose Cisco were discovered in scientists' fish surveys on Lake Superior \u2014 a lake in which scientists did not believe the fish lived.\n\nUSGS scientists have declined to discuss the Shortnose Cisco find with the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, citing an agency policy of waiting until peer-reviewed research is published on the topic. But they've discussed it among themselves and their fellow fishery scientists, including in emails obtained by the Free Press.\n\nThe Shortnose Cisco \"had not been seen\" before by any modern scientists on Lake Superior, Owen Gorman, a research fisheries biologist with U.S. Geological Survey's Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, said during a panel presentation earlier this year before the Lake Superior Technical Committee, a scientific body helping inform the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.\n\n\"It was assumed to be extinct for nearly 40 years on the Great Lakes, so nobody was expecting us to find this,\" he said. \"But apparently, there it is.\"\n\nThe Shortnose Cisco belongs to a class of fish known as coregonines, including as many as 11 species of cisco and whitefish native to the Great Lakes. According to the Fishery Commission, coregonines were abundant in each lake a century ago, occupying diverse habitats \u2014 rivers, bays and the deepest parts of the lakes. Some species were key prey for lake trout and burbot, supporting a Great Lakes fishery now valued at $7 billion annually.\n\nAmong the coregonines, different species of ciscoes declined dramatically between the 1920s and 1970s due to overfishing, invasive species and habitat loss. At least two species were considered extinct \u2014 including the just-rediscovered Shortnose \u2014 and several other species no longer appear in several lakes. The whitefish species have been more resilient, but have been undergoing their own declines in the past 20 years, fishery commission officials said.\n\nUSGS, working with state and provincial fisheries managers, has undertaken efforts to better understand the various coregonine species and how they live. Using trawler nets along the lake bottom and gill nets farther up the water column, researchers on Lake Superior have been catching coregonines over the past several years, studying both their morphology \u2014 the shapes, measurements and characteristics of their bodies \u2014 and utilizing advancements in genetics research to better understand just what cisco species are in the lake.\n\nIt was during those missions, in July 2022, that three young Shortnose Cisco were identified among the fish collected in trawl nets near the Keweenaw Peninsula.\n\nMore:Climate change transforming where fish in the Great Lakes region live\n\nMore:Eating locally caught freshwater fish can put PFAS in human blood, study says\n\nIn the emails obtained by the Free Press through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request, scientists expressed surprise at the discovery.\n\n\"The fabled Lake Superior Shortnose collected July 12-13, 2022,\" USGS fishery biologist Mark Vinson emailed to USGS colleagues on Feb. 14, 2023, attaching a photo of three small, silvery fish in labeled plastic bags.\n\n\"Wow! Age-0 Shortnose cisco caught!!!!\" replied USGS fishery biologist David \"Bo\" Bunnell.\n\nFurther study on Lake Superior found even more Shortnose Cisco, this time adults.\n\nAn early fishery researcher is vindicated\n\nBetween 2006 and 2021, USGS collected 602 adult fish, from which they could extract genetic material, from around Lake Superior. Morphological characteristics of the fish were measured \u2014 the size of their eyes; aspects of their gillrakers, cartilaginous appendages fish use to capture tiny invertebrates; fin lengths, jaw shapes, and more. Simultaneously but separately, researchers also tested the genetics of the caught fish. Their goal: to see if they could find any clusters of particular species in the Lake Superior coregonines, or just an undifferentiated mix of unidentifiable fish.\n\nBoth the body characteristics studies and the genetic testing revealed four distinct coregonine species among the Lake Superior fish: Cisco, Bloater, Kiyi and, most surprisingly, Shortnose. The two studies matched the findings of one another \"to the 97th percentile,\" Gorman told fellow fisheries scientists at the Lake Superior Technical Committee.\n\nThe work provided some vindication to one of the forefathers of coregonine research, Walter Koeltz. A whitefish researcher at the University of Michigan's Institute for Fisheries Research in the 1920s, Koeltz published the seminal \"Coregonid Fishes of the Great Lakes\" in 1929, based on his observations.\n\n\"Anyone who is a student of ciscoes becomes a student of Koeltz,\" Gorman said. \"Koeltz's book on the Great Lakes coregonid fishes is kind of like a bible; you can talk about chapter and verse. You have to go back over and over to this work.\"\n\nBut among the coregonids Koeltz identified on Lake Superior was the Shortnose Cisco. When subsequent researchers, over decades, did not make similar findings, it was presumed Koeltz got it wrong.\n\nThe confirmed genetic and morphologic findings of Shortnose Cisco, some 100 years after Koeltz said they were there, means, \"in a sense, we have rediscovered Shortnose Cisco in Lake Superior,\" Gorman said.\n\nRestoring ciscoes points to Great Lakes health\n\nRestoring native cisco species to the Great Lakes may help turn the tide on a Great Lakes ecosystem disrupted over generations by significant invasive species, changing nutrient dynamics and other stresses, said Randall Claramunt, fisheries chief for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe DNR since 2018 has collected gametes \u2014 fertilized eggs \u2014 from a remaining population of wild cisco near Drummond Island in far northern Lake Huron, raised the fish at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hatchery on the Jordan River in Antrim County, and then released 1 million young fish in the spring and fall into Saginaw Bay \u2014 a place where the cisco long ago thrived but were wiped out.\n\n\"We know if you catch a cisco in Saginaw Bay, it's likely from the stocking,\" Claramunt said.\n\n\"To see survival has been huge, because people thought, there's a lot of walleye in Saginaw Bay; there are a lot of predators on Lake Huron; and there are not a lot of prey fish.\"\n\nBut DNR officials have seen young, stocked cisco fish surviving, reaching adulthood, finding habitat.\n\n\"We are waiting for the last piece, which is: Are they successfully reproducing?\" Claramunt said. \"The next couple of years will be key to being able to detect successful reproduction.\"\n\nThe DNR considered a similar assist to cisco populations on the Lake Michigan side, he said. But in a surprise, the populations there have adapted to alewives and other invasive species and habitat changes and have begun a recovery on their own.\n\n\"They have just learned to adapt their life history to coexist with alewife,\" Claramunt said.\n\nFisheries managers around the Great Lakes have undertaken similar coregonine restoration efforts. In New York, state and federal researchers are attempting to restore Bloater, using eggs collected from northern Lake Michigan. Next year, cisco will also be experimentally reintroduced in the New York waters of Lake Erie, where the fish was once abundant but has since been wiped out.\n\nWhile some anglers grumble that they would like to see more effort placed on prized sports fish over ciscoes, Claramunt said the effort complements the Great Lakes' vital sports fishery.\n\n\"The Great Lakes will never go back to what they were 200 years ago,\" he said. \"After 60 or 70 years of trying to control sea lamprey, we control them every year but we still haven't eradicated them, along with the other invasive species.\n\n\"The idea is these native fish are very flexible; they occupy all of these different habitats and these different life strategies. Bringing them back now strategically will provide more stability for the Great Lakes in the future, and more resilience to future threats.\"\n\nContact Keith Matheny: kmatheny@freepress.com."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. Credit: Doug Bowman, CC BY\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe\u2014life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy\u2014or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \"self-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\" That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter\u2014daily or weekly.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution is the process of change in systems. It can describe how a group of something becomes more complex \u2013 or even just different \u2013 over time.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe\u2014biological or not\u2014to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules\u2014at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it\u2014for life as we don't know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

This is why Dr. Joseph Sang-II Kwon is trying to make hypotheses in a generalizable and systematic manner.\n\nKwon, an associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, published his work on blending traditional physics-based scientific models with experimental data to accurately predict hypotheses in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering.\n\nKwon's research extends beyond the realm of traditional chemical engineering. By connecting physical laws with machine learning, his work could impact renewable energy, smart manufacturing, and health care, outlined in his recent paper, \"Adding big data into the equation.\"\n\nDeriving hypotheses for experimental observations typically involves a trial-and-error process. Kwon has developed a systematic framework that integrates specialized knowledge with experimental data to create a more efficient process.\n\n\"The most impactful aspect of this research is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexity, creating a versatile framework to solve intricate problems,\" Kwon said. \"This versatility means that the potential benefits could reach a wide range of industries and significantly impact daily life.\"\n\nThis research could lead to new drug discovery by incorporating experimental data into these models, Kwon said. This hybrid modeling approach integrates biological knowledge with data to accelerate drug predictions.\n\n\"Developing new drugs is expensive and time-consuming,\" Kwon said. \"But with more advanced models, we can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing processes. Leveraging simulations and machine learning reduces the need for costly lab experiments, saving time and speeding up the discovery of new treatments.\"\n\nHis approach combines physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven components that can adapt and correct predictions based on real-world experimental data.\n\nKwon plans to use these models as a backbone to simulate complex systems and capture underlying physical phenomena that traditional physics-based models cannot capture alone.\n\n\"This methodology allows us to continuously estimate process parameters alongside the hyperparameters of the data-driven component,\" Kwon said. \"By doing so, we ensure that the models are applicable to a wider range of conditions, making them more versatile and better suited to handle new and varied scenarios.\"\n\n\"Purely data-driven models fall short when it comes to capturing the intricacies of these systems,\" Kwon said. \"By blending the two approaches, we can improve the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes that are critical to producing everyday essentials such as energy, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\"\n\nMore information: Joseph Sang-Il Kwon, Adding big data into the equation, Nature Chemical Engineering (2024).

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nConnections between knowledge areas, introduced by Alena Tensor. Credit: Piotr Ogonowski (created with the support of AI tools)\n\nThe search for quantum gravity has gone on for 100 years, but it is not the only unification challenge in physics. Many of us believe that one day there will be a unification theory\u2014a theory that will reconcile many divergent physical theories.\n\nOur new article published in Physica Scripta brings new hope that such a theory exists. It demonstrates that the use of a certain mathematical object called Alena Tensor reconciles various physical theories, including general relativity, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and continuum mechanics. Will this finally allow scientists to unify descriptions used in physics?\n\nWhat is Alena Tensor?\n\nAny movement under the influence of forces can be mathematically represented as movement along a curved path. Using differential geometry, one may equally well assume that the trajectory was straight, while the space in which the move took place is curved. It may sound complicated, but it can be assumed that there is a mathematical transformation that allows us to describe curved space-time equivalently as flat space-time where certain forces act.\n\nIt has long been suspected that such a transformation exists, although opinions on this matter are divided. Some physicists believe that the metric tensor, a mathematical object describing the curvature of space-time, is simply a feature of space-time. Some physicists, most often mathematical physicists, are of the opinion that such a transformation should exist.\n\nAlena Tensor provides just such a transformation. In short, Alena Tensor can straighten curved space-time while preserving all conclusions from general relativity. This property alone makes Alena Tensor an extremely valuable tool, but this is just the beginning.\n\nAlena Tensor in flat and curved space-time\n\nWe used Alena Tensor to describe a system with an electromagnetic field, obtaining three forces in flat space-time: electromagnetism (which is not surprising), \"against gravity,\" and radiation reaction force.\n\nThe radiation reaction force is already known in physics. It safeguards the principle of conservation of energy and ensures that the energy of an accelerating body does not exceed the energy available in the physical system.\n\nThe \"against gravity\" force generalizes classical Newton's equation for gravity, providing a relativistic description of gravity in flat space-time, fully consistent with general relativity:\n\nIt faithfully reproduces the motion described in curved space-time.\n\nThis force does not act in freefall, respecting the equivalence principle.\n\nGravity in this description is not a force but the counteraction to gravity is.\n\nThe Alena Tensor allows for a smooth transition to the description used in the electromagnetic theory and then it turns out that:\n\nCharged particles cannot remain at complete rest and should have spin, which agrees with quantum mechanics.\n\nThe reason for the existence of mass (and energy) of charged particles is the magnetic moment.\n\nThe above result basically explains what matter is, although so far it only applies to charged elementary particles and requires generalization to other fields.\n\nThe Alena Tensor also allows a smooth transition to the equations of general relativity. The obtained results provide some answers to the questions that have long puzzled physicists, concerning, e.g., singularities of black holes, cosmological constant, dark energy and dark matter.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Alena Tensor completely reverses this approach. It is much easier now to describe gravity in flat space-time in a way that mathematically reproduces general relativity and then uses the known tools of quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, in the article we derived quantum equations describing the entire physical system with all previously mentioned forces. It turns out that these are three currently known main quantum equations. This leads to the completely surprising conclusion: It would mean that gravity has been present in quantum mechanics from the very beginning. It must be admitted that probably no one expected such a solution to the puzzle. In the article we also explain why it was so hard to spot gravity in quantum equations.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere are interesting times ahead, but no one should expect an immediate revolution. Science does not develop at the pace of messages on social networks. It will take several months for this research paper to get noticed, several months before researchers take an interest in it, read it and use its results. It also takes many months to conduct and describe research using the new mathematical apparatus, then go through the peer review process and publish it.\n\nIn the first articles, we should expect attempts to falsify Alena Tensor, because in physics, like in all science, we need to be sure that our next steps lead in the right direction. If falsification deceives and further research and experiments confirm the results obtained from Alena Tensor, we may hope that in the next three to 10 years, this will lead to the unification and reconciliation of many descriptions currently used in physics.\n\nIt is also entirely possible that the article will go unnoticed or no one will pursue further research, as has happened many times before with innovations in science. Contrary to popular belief, for most readers, the innovation of the article is a disadvantage\u2014it is harder to read, understand and accept. The difficulties during the long publication process also indicate that many scientific journals see too much risk in publishing innovative research, especially if its authors are not widely known scientists.\n\nFortunately, this article was eventually published by a highly respected and inclusive journal that assesses the scientific value higher than non-meritorious criteria, for which I would like to publicly express my highest respect. The editor and reviewers provided constructive criticism, and their substantive comments helped to significantly improve the article, exactly the way science should function. However, it seems that research on non-mainstream methods of unifying physics (and Alena Tensor is one) may require much more time and perseverance.\n\nThe hope remains that future generations of physicists will complete the development of this method despite the obstacles, and in 20 to 40 years, Alena Tensor will inspire the scientific community to unify physics.\n\nThis story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

            "article_content": "Google has unveiled a new quantum computer called Willow that excels at a benchmarking problem, but it still isn't clear whether these machines can serve a practical purpose\n\nGoogle says its new quantum chip is its most powerful yet Google Quantum AI\n\nGoogle has unveiled a new quantum computer and is once more claiming to have pulled ahead in the race to show that these exotic machines can beat even the world\u2019s best conventional supercomputers \u2013 so does that mean useful quantum computers are finally here?\n\nResearchers at the tech giant were the first in the world to demonstrate this feat, known as quantum supremacy, with the announcement of the Sycamore quantum computing chip in 2019. But since then, supercomputers have caught up, leaving Sycamore behind. Now, Google has produced a new quantum chip, called Willow, which Julian Kelly at Google Quantum AI says is the firm\u2019s best yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou can think of this as having all the advantages of Sycamore, but if you were to look under the hood, we changed the geometry\u2026 we reimagined the processor,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile the most advanced version of Sycamore boasted 67 qubits, or quantum bits, to process information, Willow has been upgraded to 105. Ideally, larger quantum computers should also be more powerful, but researchers have found that the qubits in larger devices struggle to remain coherent, losing their quantumness. This has also been seen by competitors IBM and California-based start-up Atom Computing, which both recently debuted quantum computers with more than 1000 qubits.\n\nKelly says that because of this, qubit quality has been a big focus for the team, and that Willow\u2019s qubits can preserve their intricate quantum states \u2013 and therefore reliably encode information \u2013 more than five times longer than Sycamore\u2019s can.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nGoogle uses a specific benchmarking task called RCS to assess its quantum computers\u2019 performance, which Willow excelled at, says Hartmut Neven, also at Google Quantum AI. The task involves verifying that a sample of numbers output by a program run on the chip have as random a distribution as possible. For several years, Sycamore could do this faster than the world\u2019s best supercomputers, but in 2022, and then again in 2024, new records were set by conventional computers.\n\nGoogle says Willow has again widened the gap between quantum and traditional machines, as the task took 5 minutes on the chip, while the firm estimates that it would take 10 septillion years, or much more than the age of the universe squared, on a leading supercomputer.\n\nIn this comparison, the researchers modelled a version of the Frontier supercomputer (which was recently downgraded to only the second-most powerful supercomputer in the world) with more memory than it is currently able to use, which only underscores the computational power of Willow, says Neven. While Sycamore\u2019s records were broken, he is confident that Willow will maintain its champion status for much longer as conventional computing methods reach their limits.\n\nWhat still isn\u2019t clear is whether Willow can actually do anything useful, given the RCS benchmarking test has no practical application. Kelly says succeeding at the benchmark is a \u201cnecessary but not sufficient\u201d condition for the usefulness of a quantum computer, though any chip that fails to be great at RCS doesn\u2019t stand a chance of being practical later.\n\nBut the Google team has another reason to believe in Willow\u2019s bright future \u2013 it is very good at correcting its own errors. The propensity of quantum computers to make errors is one of the biggest issues currently preventing them from delivering on the promise of being more powerful than any other type of computer. To improve this, researchers, including Google\u2019s team, group physical qubits together to form \u201clogical qubits\u201d, which are much more resilient to errors.\n\nWith Willow, the team showed that as the logical qubits were made larger, they got better at preventing errors, making around half as many errors as the physical qubits that comprised them. What\u2019s more, that error rate further halved when the logical qubits were roughly doubled in size. In this way, the Google researchers reached a threshold where they believe they can keep increasing the number of qubits \u2013 making larger and larger quantum computers \u2013 and have them get better and better at running calculations, which hasn\u2019t been a trend so far.\n\n\u201cThis is, in my opinion, a signature result, and while we are still a long way from demonstrating a practical quantum computer, it is an important and necessary step towards that goal,\u201d says Andrew Cleland at the University of Chicago.\n\nMartin Weides at the University of Glasgow, UK, says that the new work sets out a route towards building \u201cfault-tolerant\u201d quantum computers \u2013 those that could catch and correct all of their errors. Challenges remain, but these advancements pave the way for transformative applications in quantum chemistry, such as drug discovery and materials design, he says, as well as in cryptography and machine learning.\n\nThe focus on error correction across academic labs and the burgeoning quantum computing industry has made advances in logical qubits an important point of comparison between today\u2019s best quantum computers. In 2023, a team of researchers at Harvard University and start-up QuEra used qubits made from extremely cold rubidium atoms to set the record for the most logical qubits ever created. Earlier this year, researchers at Microsoft and Atom Computing linked a record-breaking number of logical qubits through quantum entanglement.\n\nGoogle\u2019s approach is different because it focuses on making single logical qubits larger and larger, as well as better and better, instead of maximising their number. \u201cWe could divide our chip into smaller and smaller logical qubits and run algorithms, but we really wanted to get to this threshold. This is where all the underlying challenges with science and engineering [of quantum computing] are,\u201d says Kelly.\n\nUltimately, however, the biggest test of Willow\u2019s impact will be whether it can meet the goal that all other quantum computers are also chasing \u2013 to reliably compute something that is useful but not possible on any conventional computer. Neven says Sycamore had already been used to make scientific discoveries, such as in quantum physics, but the team is setting its sights on more real-world applications with Willow. \u201cWe are moving towards new calculations and simulations that classical computers could not do.\u201d"

This was ChatGPT \u2014 an artificial intelligence chatbot that could write poetry, debug code, and summarize hundred-page novels with unnerving ease. It attracted a jaw-dropping 100 million users within weeks, breaking records for the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Investors, with visions of a technological revolution shimmering in their eyes (and dollar signs for pupils), began pouring fortunes into anything that bore the acronym \u201cAI.\u201d The future, it seemed, was already here.\n\nBut, as history reminds us with a wry smile, the future doesn\u2019t always arrive as advertised. As the markets ride a wave of AI-induced euphoria, voices of caution are growing louder. Is AI a transformative technology poised to rewrite our lives, or is it the scaffolding for the next catastrophic bubble \u2014 a modern-day echo of the dot-com collapse?\n\nEchoes of 1999\n\nThe numbers are staggering. In 2024, the S&P 500 is on track to close with a 27% gain, building on a 24% surge the year before. We haven\u2019t seen this kind of back-to-back bull run since the halcyon days of the late 1990s, when dot-com stocks inflated to absurd heights. For a brief moment, it seemed every startup with a \u201c.com\u201d in its name was a ticket to unimaginable wealth. But by early 2000, that story turned dark. The bubble popped, and what followed was a painful recession that many would rather forget. By 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion. Today, a similar stock market wipeout could be much more dire.\n\nFor instance, at the peak of the dot-com frenzy, Pets.com seemed to embody the future of commerce. Who wouldn\u2019t want pet supplies delivered with just a few clicks? The company launched in 1998, armed with an irresistible mascot: a wide-eyed sock puppet with a penchant for witty banter. The puppet became a minor celebrity, starring in a $1.2 million Super Bowl ad and even appearing on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBut beneath the charm lay a fragile business model. Shipping bulky bags of dog food wasn\u2019t cheap, and Pets.com sold products at a loss just to attract customers. Investors still believed in the vision, pumping $82.5 million into its IPO in February 2000. Nine months later, the company collapsed. The sock puppet, once a symbol of internet-age optimism, became the unwitting face of dot-com hubris.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, the undisputed titan of AI hardware, have seen their market value soar to over $3 trillion. In just two years, Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged eightfold. Super Micro Computer, which provides the servers powering AI\u2019s voracious data needs, has followed a similar trajectory. The technology that underpins this growth is genuinely astounding. Yet, as the Associated Press notes, it\u2019s hard to ignore how similar these patterns feel to the 1999 bubble \u2014 a time when investors believed the early internet would mint millionaires out of thin air.\n\nEven the European Central Bank has begun sounding the alarm. In a recent financial review, the ECB warned of an AI stock bubble, suggesting that if AI firms don\u2019t start producing tangible profits, panic could ripple through the global economy. The more feverish the hype, the harder the fall if reality fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cThis concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble,\u201d the ECB said. \u201cAlso, in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments,\u201d the ECB said.\n\nAt the moment, there\u2019s just too much optimism and not enough recognition of what could derail stock momentum, experts seem to warn.\n\nIs This The World\u2019s Most Expensive Gamble?\n\nAnd yet, despite the red flags, the AI juggernaut barrels forward. According to estimates, spending on AI data centers from 2024 to 2027 will exceed $1.4 trillion. These facilities, filled with server racks humming under the weight of immense computation, are the new temples of progress. But as impressive as this investment sounds, only a sliver of American businesses \u2014 about 5% \u2014 have incorporated AI into their services.\n\nThe disparity between investor enthusiasm and business adoption is becoming hard to ignore. While ChatGPT dazzled millions, the electricity needed to train its underlying model, GPT-4, could have powered over three million electric vehicles for an entire year. OpenAI\u2019s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023 \u2014 but it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses.\n\nEach new leap in AI capability requires ever more data, ever more energy, and ever more money. It\u2019s a cycle that feels less like a virtuous circle and more like an arms race, spiraling toward a point of diminishing returns.\n\nSome of these constraints are fueling an industry-wide scramble for efficiency. Companies are developing specialized chips and streamlined models to mitigate AI\u2019s insatiable hunger for resources. Yet, as of now, the promises are still largely theoretical.\n\nWhat happens if the money \u2014 and patience \u2014 runs out before the solutions arrive?\n\nThe Silent Revolution in the Office Cubicle\n\nCuriously, while corporations debate the merits of AI, employees are embracing it in secret. Studies suggest that a third of American workers use AI at least once a week, often without their bosses\u2019 knowledge. In some sectors, like software engineering, that figure climbs to nearly 80%. Employees are quietly deploying AI to write reports, debug code, and streamline tedious tasks, but they\u2019re keeping it under wraps, fearful that transparency could lead to heavier workloads or job losses. After all, why are you getting paid if most of your job can be done with the help of AI?\n\nThis clandestine adoption hints at a peculiar paradox: AI may be more disruptive than we realize, but the disruption is happening quietly, in the shadows of office cubicles. This isn\u2019t the AI revolution the hype trains promised. It\u2019s a whisper, not a roar.\n\nFor businesses, this means AI adoption is as much about culture as it is about technology. Companies that foster openness and experimentation could harness AI\u2019s full potential, while those clinging to old management styles might miss the boat entirely.\n\nThe Year of Reckoning?\n\nSo, what happens next? 2025 looms large. It could be the year AI makes good on its promise, with breakthroughs in fields as diverse as drug discovery and military defense. Or it could be the year the bubble finally bursts under the weight of unmet expectations.\n\nHistory offers no certainties, but it does offer patterns. The dot-com bubble wasn\u2019t just a story of irrational exuberance; it was also a story of real innovation that eventually found its footing. The internet did transform the world \u2014 just not in the exponential, uninterrupted path investors had hoped for. Perhaps AI is in for a similar treatment: a cataclysmic stock market crash that would hamper progress for a few years while at the same time sanitizing the industry by removing inefficient companies; then, only after a recovery, perhaps will AI make good on its many promises. Just like Pets.com was ahead of its time, so too maybe is the current AI hype train.\n\nThe hype may fade. Stocks may tumble. But beneath the surface, the technology could continue to mature, slowly and steadily finding its place in our lives. As the frenzy quiets down, we may discover that the most profound changes often happen in the spaces between bubbles \u2014 not with a pop, but with a quiet breath of reality."

            "article_content": "A pro-Palestine essay has cost Prahlad Iyengar his career at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nHe was pursuing a PhD from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but his five-year National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship will be terminated now.\n\nMIT has barred the Indian-origin student from entering the college premises over the essay, written in the college magazine last month, that the institute found calling for violence.\n\nWritten Revolution is a multidisciplinary student magazine, about the pro-Palestine movement, that published Iyengar's essay. It has also been banned.\n\nThe essay that Iyengar wrote is called 'On Pacifism'. As stated by The Commune Magazine, although not directly calling for violent resistance, the essay speaks that pacifist tactics might not be the best recourse for Palestine.\n\nThe essay features a logo of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organisation according to the US State Department. However, Iyengar said that the charges of terrorism on him are only because of the photos in the essay which were not provided by him.\n\n\"The administration accuses me of supporting 'terrorism', because the edition in which my article appears includes images of posters from the Popular Front for the Liberation and of containing violent imagery in the publication,\" his statement said, which was shared by his lawyer Eric Lee on X.\n\nAccording to the college, the essay had language that \"could be interpreted as a call for more violent or destructive forms of protests at MIT\". The MIT Dean of Student Life, David Warren Randall emailed this to the magazine's editors.\n\nIyengar has raised an issue of the lack of freedom of speech in American campuses. But this is not the first time he has been suspended.\n\nHe was suspended last year after the pro-Palestine demonstrations.\n\nAn \"extraordinary action\" is what he believes his suspension is.\n\n\"These extraordinary actions should concern everyone on camp,\" he says in the statement. \"Expelling me and banning Written Revolution from campus as a result of this article would mark an unprecedented attack on the rights of the entire student body and faculty. Consider the precedent MIT has set.\"\n\nThe MIT Coalition Against Apartheid has started a protest against MIT's decision. \"Prahlad is now appealing his case with the Chancellor to reduce the unjust sanctions against him. We have launched a campaign to put pressure on MIT's administration to stop criminalising students who stand on the right side of history. We call on all organisations and institutions of conscience to sign up and stand up to MIT's repression,\" said the coalition in a statement.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 MIT is effectively expelling PhD student Prahlad Iyengar for Palestine activism on campus. \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RALLY: Cambridge City Hall, Monday, 12/9 at 5:30pm. Org sign-on to letter: https://t.co/tCOrOLTeNy pic.twitter.com/7cAYrvn5ad \u2014 MIT Coalition Against Apartheid (@mit_caa) December 8, 2024\n\nAs per a report in The Boston Globe, the president of MIT Graduate Student Union, Sophie Coppieters 't Wallant said, \"The fact that MIT is choosing to threaten student livelihood and careers simply because they don't agree with what students are speaking up and protesting for is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe coalition held a rally supporting Iyengar at Cambridge City Hall on December 9."
