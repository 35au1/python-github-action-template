            "article_content": "\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\nCities with the most UFO sightings in Texas\n\nWhen pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \u201cflying saucer.\u201d\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Texas using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nYou may also like: Cities with the fastest-growing home prices in Texas\n\n\n\nPeopleImages.com \u2013 Yuri A // Shutterstock\n\n#9.

            "article_content": "There\u2019s been a recent surge in authentic depictions of Native American people and stories in pop culture. And it\u2019s not isolated to acclaimed series like Reservation Dogs or movies like Killers of the Flower Moon or Rez Ball, to name a few. The literary world is changing too. Take Shutter, about a Navajo woman who solves paranormal crimes as a forensic photographer, which was longlisted for the 2022 National Book Award for fiction. In honor of Native American Heritage Month, KUNM discussed this shift with its author Ramona Emerson, and the struggle she faced as a Din\u00e9 writer to get her debut novel published.\n\nRAMONA EMERSON: It took a good eight years to get the book published. And we just kept getting rejection letters. They didn't like my story structure going in a circle, which it kind of did. It went from the beginning all the way back around and then back home. But I don\u2019t think they also understood that that's how a lot of Natives tell stories. And so, they didn't overtly say, \u2018I don't like this book because it's Native or because we don't think that we can sell Navajo stories.\u2019 But they don't understand Navajo story structure. So, I think we're still kind of limited by what people think they want to see from Native people.\n\nKUNM: Who do you write for?\n\nEMERSON: I write for my community. I'm writing about things that only they will understand. And sometimes they recognize the way people speak to each other on the rez or the different places I visit \u2014 different locations, and different places that aren't around anymore, you know, things like that. People outside of my community don't get those nuances. But I have to say that, when I was getting my MFA, I had a mentor in workshop one semester \u2014 and I won\u2019t call him out \u2014 but he said to us that we're not writing for our communities. He said, \u201cWe're writing for white readers, mostly.\u201dAnd he says, \u201cWell, our communities don't read.\u201d And I kind of just was kind of floored by what he said. And, in my heart, I was like, \u201cYeah, we do. I know my community reads. They just don't have anything to read that's about them. They just have outsider literature. That's all. And they're waiting. They're waiting for us.\u201d\n\nKUNM: There's been a recent spike with Indigenous stories, especially in pop culture. Do you think this is a trend, or do you think it's something that's more long lasting?\n\nEMERSON: Well, we always seem to go into these 20-year trends, right? So, it was like Dances with Wolves and now here we are, kind of having another flood of Native content. Whereas that last one kind of lasted maybe one or two years of people being kind of vaguely interested in Native culture \u2014 as portrayed by Kevin Costner \u2014 what's different about this is that I think Natives are having their voice heard on several different fronts, not just in film, but also in literature and in television, music.\n\nI mean, I think supporting Native voices \u2014 like we know, when you write a book, if you can get it optioned and you get that kind of stuff, then you should be using young Native people to fill those roles. You should be talking to Native musicians who don't have record deals yet, or who are doing grassroots kind of music, and put their music into your projects. Like, elevate those voices, then we won't lose this momentum that we have.\n\nKUNM: So, I want to ask this, but I think I already know the answer. Despite all the TV [shows] and movies and books that we have right now, do you think there are more Indigenous stories to be told?\n\nEMERSON: Oh my gosh, yes. I'm really hoping that we can push past where we are right now. I mean, like, let's get off the reservation, guys. You know? We don't have to make movies about fry bread and pow wows and basketball. You know? We're all more than that, everybody. Like, where's our stories about Indigenous attorneys and lawyers? And where's our rom-coms? You know what I mean? Where's that? Then, I think we're starting to touch a bit on horror. I can't wait for there to be some real Indigenous horror films. You know? Like, come on, Jordan Peele. You better start a Native wing. We've got stories waiting in the wing, directors to direct. That's what I'm talking about.\n\nLike contemporary stories about us in the cities, like how we really live our lives. You know? We don't play basketball, we don't eat fry bread every day, we don't go to the powwow. Some of us can't speak our language. Some of us have these issues. We don't talk about them in our stories. Like, those are the things that we need to talk about because that's the thing that most of us can relate to and understand.\n\nKUNM: What kind of advice would you give up-and-coming Indigenous creatives?\n\nEMERSON: Well, I will tell you this: It's not gonna be easy. People are going to tell you you're crazy. Ninety percent of the time, you're going to get rejection letters. In my 50-some years, I've only had a handful of yeses. Really. So, always learn and better yourself and get it back out there and don't give up, because that's how it is. And you'll look back on all of the hardship you had, and you'll realize that you wouldn't be where you are unless you went through all of that. All of that is building your artistic character. It's giving you stories. You just have to let it happen and it'll happen. And I hope for all of your sake it happens faster than it happened for me.\n\nSupport from the coverage comes from the Thornburg Foundation."

Upon reaching the site, they found the mutilated carcasses of her two cubs, ending earlier confusion regarding the number of cubs she birthed. There had been initial reports suggesting four cubs were born, but this was soon corrected. All other cheetahs at the park are reported to be in good health.\n\nSamples from the deceased cubs are undergoing examination to determine the cause of death, while Neerva remains in healthy condition. The incident has raised concerns about wildlife safety and monitoring in protected areas.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

Here's what you need to know, according to Nasa... Asteroid: An asteroid is a small rocky body that orbits the Sun. Most are found in the asteroid belt (between Mars and Jupiter) but they can be found anywhere (including in a path that can impact Earth)\n\nAn asteroid is a small rocky body that orbits the Sun.

At that point, it becomes a meteorite Comet: Like asteroids, a comet orbits the Sun. However rather than being made mostly of rock, a comet contains lots of ice and gas, which can result in amazing tails forming behind them (thanks to the ice and dust vaporizing)\n\nThe Hayabusa2 spacecraft collected the samples in February 2019, and delivered them to Earth in December 2020.\n\nThe rocky grains were extracted in Japan in July 2021 and analysed at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre later that same year.\n\nA small amount of sample - 30mg or roughly 0.001 ounce - was allocated for the international soluble organic analysis team.\n\nThe sample was extracted like tea, according to Nasa, in many different solvents in Japan and analysed in labs in Japan, Goddard, and Europe.\n\nThe Ryugu samples will be studied for years, alongside crumbles of asteroid Bennu that were collected by Nasa's OSIRIS-REx mission.\n\nLaunched in 2016, the OSIRIS-REx mission's target was Bennu, a \u201cnear-Earth\u201d asteroid thought to have formed during the solar system\u2019s first 10million years.\n\nThe Bennu samples were returned to Earth in 2023, and eventually opened in January 2024 after some struggle opening the container they were stored in.\n\n6 After the container is successfully opened, scientists will document the asteroid samples with ultra-high-resolution photographs before weighing them Credit: SWNS"
