            "article_content": "OpenAI says Chinese rivals using its work for their AI apps\n\nThe maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has complained that rivals, including those in China, are using its work to make rapid advances in developing their own artificial intelligence (AI) tools.\n\nThe status of OpenAI - and other US firms - as the world leaders in AI has been dramatically undermined this week by the sudden emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese app that can emulate the performance of ChatGPT, apparently at a fraction of the cost.\n\nBloomberg has reported that Microsoft is investigating whether data belonging to OpenAI - which it is a major investor in - has been used in an unauthorised way.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Microsoft and DeepSeek for comment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOpenAI's concerns have been echoed by the recently appointed White House \"AI and crypto czar\", David Sacks.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News, he suggested that DeepSeek may have used the models developed by OpenAI to get better, a process called knowledge distillation.\n\n\"There's substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI's models,\" Mr Sacks said.\n\n\"I think one of the things you're going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation... That would definitely slow down some of these copycat models.\"\n\nIn a statement, OpenAI said Chinese and other companies were \"constantly trying to distil the models of leading US AI companies\".\n\n\"As we go forward... it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models,\" it added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'Deceptive' claims\n\nNaomi Haefner, assistant professor of technology management at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, said the question of distillation could throw the notion that DeepSeek created its product for a fraction of the cost into doubt.\n\n\"It is unclear whether DeepSeek really trained its models from scratch,\" she said.\n\n\"OpenAI have stated that they believe DeepSeek may have misappropriated large amounts of data from them.\n\n\"If this is the case, then the claims about training the model very cheaply are deceptive. Until someone replicates the training approach we won't know for sure whether such cost-efficient training is really possible.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrystal van Oosterom, AI Venture Partner at OpenOcean, agreed that \"DeepSeek has clearly built upon publicly available research from major American and European institutions and companies\".\n\nHowever, it is not clear how problematic the idea of \"building on\" the work of others is.\n\nThis is especially true in AI, where the accusation of disrespecting intellectual property rights has been frequently levelled at major US AI firms.\n\nSecurity and ethics\n\nUS officials are also considering the national security implications of DeepSeek's emergence, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"I spoke with [the National Security Council] this morning, they are looking into what [the national security implications] may be,\" said Ms Leavitt, who also restated US President Donald Trump's remarks a day earlier that DeepSeek should be a wake-up call for the US tech industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe announcement comes after the US navy reportedly banned its members from using DeepSeek's apps due to \"potential security and ethical concerns\".\n\nAccording to CNBC, the US navy has sent an email to its staff warning them not to use the DeepSeek app due to \"potential security and ethical concerns associated with the model's origin and usage\".\n\nThe Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.\n\nCyber attacks on Chinese firm come as US officials looking into national security implications of DeepSeek AI [DeepSeek]\n\nData safety experts have warned users to be careful with the tool, given it collects large amounts of personal data and stores it in servers in China.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek says it has been the target of cyber attacks. On Monday it said it would temporarily limit registrations because of \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its software.\n\nA banner showing on the company's website says registration may be busy as a result of the attacks.\n\nAdditional reporting from Fan Wang\n\n[BBC]\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

            "article_content": "The emergence of DeepSeek sent some tech stocks tumbling.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek? The AI chatbot is topping app store charts\n\nChina-based AI app DeepSeek, which sits atop the app store charts, made its presence widely known Monday by triggering a sharp drop in share prices for some tech giants.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the top AI chipmaker, plunged more than 17% in early trading on Monday, losing nearly $590 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3.5%.\n\nThe DeepSeek chatbot, known as R1, responds to user queries just like its U.S.-based counterparts. Early testing released by DeepSeek suggests that its quality rivals that of other AI products, while the company says it costs less and uses far fewer specialized chips than do its competitors.\n\nThe product could upend the AI industry, putting pressure on other firms to lower their costs while intensifying competition between U.S. and Chinese companies, analysts told ABC News.\n\nConcerns about data security and censorship also may expose DeepSeek to the type of scrutiny endured by social media platform TikTok, the experts added.\n\n\"This is a big moment,\" Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, who specializes in AI, told ABC News.\n\nDeepSeek did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nHere's what to know about DeepSeek, and its implications for the future of AI.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is a chatbot fueled by an algorithm that selects words based on lessons learned from scanning billions of pieces of text across the internet.\n\nWhile made in China, the app is available in multiple languages, including English. DeepSeek soared to the top of Apple's App Store chart over the weekend and remained there as of Monday.\n\nThe company said it experienced some outages on Monday affecting user signups. \"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" DeepSeek said in a statement.\n\nDeepSeek is fully available to users free of charge. By contrast, ChatGPT retains a version available for free, but offers paid monthly tiers of $20 and $200 to access additional capabilities.\n\nDevelopers of the system powering the DeepSeek AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published a research paper indicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors do.\n\nDeepSeek also says that it developed the chatbot for only $5.6 million, which if true is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by U.S. companies in the sector.\n\n\"The lower cost to train DeepSeek means it can be offered at a lower cost,\" Oren Etzioni, founder of the nonprofit TrueMedia.org and a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Washington, told ABC News. \"That puts pressure on other companies to lower their prices.\"\n\nDeepSeek's developers opted to release it as an open-source product, meaning the code that underlies the AI system is publicly available for other companies to adapt and build upon.\n\nLlama, the AI model released by Meta in 2017, is also open source. By contrast, ChatGPT as well as Alphabet's Gemini are closed-source models.\n\nProponents of open source say that publicly available code allows a wide community of AI engineers to identify and fix flaws in a system, or tailor it for a purpose separate from its originally intended function.\n\nSupporters of closed source argue that the best way to safeguard AI is to keep the computer code private so it stays out of the hands of bad actors who might repurpose it for malicious ends.\n\nIn a June 5, 2023 file photo, Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT creator takes part in a talk at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel. Amir Cohen/Reuters\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek flexes the strength of the Chinese tech sector in an industry previously viewed by many analysts as one dominated by U.S. firms, experts said.\n\nFor some, the sudden arrival of a top China-based competitor raises concerns about data security and content manipulation similar to those leveled at TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.\n\nRegarding the former users on social media have posted numerous examples of DeepSeek choosing to forego answers on topics potentially sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of anti-government protestors.\n\n\"It's clear that there's some censorship built into the system,\" Marcus said. \"We don't want governments in control of what people can say.\"\n\nBoth foreign-owned and U.S.-based AI chatbots pose data concerns, however, since users sometimes enter personal or intimate information, which in turn could be used for commercial purposes, Marcus added.\n\n\"You have to assume that anything you type into a large language model could be seen by someone else,\" Marcus said.\n\nStill, DeepSeek's low-cost technological advance using outdated chips marks a major new entry into the AI market, Sosnick said, in turn forcing people to \"rethink assumptions that they had.\"\n\nThe emergence of a relatively cost-efficient alternative to other AI chatbots helps explain Monday's dip in the share value of Nvidia, which premises future growth on increased demand for new, expensive chips, Etzioni said.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Nvidia described DeepSeek as \"an excellent AI advancement,\" noting how the firm leveraged \"widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant\" \u2013 the latter apparently referring to controls put in place by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China.\n\nEtzioni said the open-source nature of DeepSeek also could challenge the profitability of other AI firms aiming to charge third parties for access to their products.\n\n\"We're soon going to see many models built on DeepSeek,\" Etzioni said."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant made big waves on Monday, becoming the top-rated app in Apple\u2019s App Store and sending tech stocks into a downward tumble. What\u2019s all the fuss about?\n\nDeepSeek, a Chinese start-up, surprised the tech industry with a new model that rivals the abilities of OpenAI\u2019s most recent one\u2014with far less investment and reduced-capacity chips. The U.S. bans exports of state-of-the-art computer chips to China and limits sales of chip-making equipment. DeepSeek, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, reportedly had a stockpile of high-performance Nvidia A100 chips that it had acquired prior to the ban\u2014so its engineers could have used those chips to develop the model. But in a key breakthrough, the start-up says it instead used much lower-powered Nvidia H800 chips to train the new model, dubbed DeepSeek-R1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen, up to now, that the success of large tech companies working in AI was measured in how much money they raised, not necessarily in what the technology actually was,\u201d says Ashlesha Nesarikar, CEO of the AI company Plano Intelligence. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be paying a lot more attention to what tech is underpinning these companies\u2019 different products.\u201d\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nOn common AI tests in mathematics and coding, DeepSeek-R1 matched the scores of Open AI\u2019s o1 model, according to VentureBeat. U.S. companies don\u2019t disclose the cost of training their own large language models (LLMs), the systems that undergird popular chatbots such as ChatGPT. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2023 that training the company\u2019s LLM GPT-4 cost more than $100 million. In contrast, DeepSeek says it made its new model for less than $6 million. DeepSeek-R1 is free for users to download, while the comparable version of ChatGPT costs $200 a month.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s $6-million number doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect how much money would have been needed to build such an LLM from scratch, Nesarikar says. The reported cost of DeepSeek-R1 may represent a fine-tuning of its latest version. Nevertheless, she says, the model\u2019s improved energy efficiency would make AI more accessible to more people in more industries. The increase in efficiency could be good news when it comes to AI\u2019s environmental impact because the computational cost of generating new data with an LLM is four to five times higher than a typical search engine query.\n\nBecause it requires less computational power, the cost of running DeepSeek-R1 is a tenth of that of similar competitors, says Hancheng Cao, an incoming assistant professor of information systems and operations management at Emory University. \u201cFor academic researchers or start-ups, this difference in the cost really means a lot,\u201d Cao says.\n\nDeepSeek achieved its model\u2019s efficiency in several ways, says Anil Ananthaswamy, author of Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math behind Modern AI. DeepSeek-R1 has about 670 billion parameters, or variables it learns from during training, making it the largest open-source LLM yet, Ananthaswamy explains. But the model uses an architecture called \u201cmixture of experts\u201d so that only a relevant fraction of these parameters\u2014tens of billions instead of hundreds of billions\u2014are activated for any given query. This cuts down on computing costs. The DeepSeek LLM also uses a method called multihead latent attention to boost the efficiency of its inferences. And instead of predicting an answer word by word, it generates multiple words at once.\n\nThe model further differs from others such as o1 in how it reinforces learning during training. While many LLMs have an external \u201ccritic\u201d model that runs alongside them, correcting errors and nudging the LLM toward verified answers, DeepSeek-R1 uses a set of rules that are internal to the model to teach it which of the possible answers it generates is best. \u201cDeepSeek has streamlined that process,\u201d Ananthaswamy says.\n\nAnother important aspect of DeepSeek-R1 is that the company has made the code behind the product open-source, Ananthaswamy says. (The training data remain proprietary.) This means that the company\u2019s claims can be checked. If the model is as computationally efficient as DeepSeek claims, he says, it will probably open up new avenues for researchers who use AI in their work to do so more quickly and cheaply. It will also enable more research into the inner workings of LLMs themselves.\n\n\u201cOne of the big things has been this divide that has opened up between academia and industry because academia has been unable to work with these really large models or do research in any meaningful way,\u201d Ananthaswamy says. \u201cBut something like this, it\u2019s within the reach of academia now, because you have the code.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note (1/28/25): This article was edited after posting to correct Hancheng Cao\u2019s given name and the name of Apple\u2019s App Store and to better clarify the figures for DeepSeek-R1\u2019s reported cost and total parameters."

Yet another hotline thriller focusing on a person answering a phone - this night he receives an odd, paranormal call. There have been a few of these recently - including The Guilty with Jake Gyllenhaal or Tessa Thompson's The Listener. In Lifeline, a suicide hotline operator gets a late-night call from someone who claims to be him, knowing private details only he would know, and threatening to end his life in an hour. The operator must race against time to stop \"himself\" from suicide. Josh Stewart stars as Steven Thomas, along with August Maturo, Charlene Amoia, Jocelyn Ayanna, Nicole Santiago, Jill Awbrey, & Brecken Merrill. This also reminds me of the film Frequency (2000) about a father and son connecting across time through the phone. Lifeline looks much better than it sounds.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Feras Alfuqaha's film Lifeline, direct from YouTube:\n\nA late-night suicide hotline operator named Steven Thomas (starring Josh Stewart) receives a disturbing call from someone claiming to be him, knowing personal details only he would know. The caller threatens to end his life within the hour, forcing the operator into a tense, emotional race against time. As the clock ticks down, he must confront his deepest fears and uncover the truth before it's too late to save \"himself.\" Lifeline is directed by the indie producer / filmmaker Feras Alfuqaha, now making his feature directorial debut after producing a number of other projects as well. The screenplay is written by Brady Morell and Brian Price. Produced by Feras Alfuqaha and Leal Naim. Dark Sky Films will debut Alfuqaha's Lifeline film in select US theaters + on VOD starting on February 21st, 2025 coming soon. Who wants to watch this?"

            "article_content": "Isolated installations, mysterious menaces, possible paranormal phenomena... where have we seen/heard it all before? Everywhere, from the amazing John Carpenter's The Thing to The Abyss to the more recent Kristen Stewart horror-thriller Underwater (which achieved the distinction of actually bringing HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu to the screen without any fanfare).\n\nThe Rig, an ecological-themed SF mystery-suspense-adventure offering, offered up a similar combination and atmosphere when it made its debut in early 2023.\n\nAfter its initial six episodes culminated in a cliffhanger of sorts, and it faded from view, few would have blamed us for thinking it had gone the way of so many other streaming series \u2013 one season and prematurely done.\n\nYet, almost two years later, Season Two is upon us, and most of the cast is back. But let's rewind things a bit.\n\nSo, Season One of The Rig (for those who have yet to check it out) is set on the Kinlock Bravo, a remote oil rig in Scottish waters. Suddenly cut off from the mainland by a strange fog and affected by bizarre phenomena, the crew struggles to figure out what's going on while racing to avoid a potential ecological disaster.\n\nLed by stalwart site manager Magnus (Game Of Thrones and Silo's Iain Glen), the crew consists of folks like scientist and oil company rep Rose (Emily Hampshire, Schitt's Creek), comms officer Fulmer (Martin Compston, Line Of Duty), medic Cat Braithwaite (Rochena Sandall, Line Of Duty Series Five), rookie Baz (Calvin Demba, Supacell), divisive veteran Hutton (Owen Teale, GOT's Jon Snow tormentor Ser Alliser Thorne), and the wise, well-read Alwyn (Mark Bonnar, Napoleon).\n\nTensions rise as strange occurrences terrify all on board, leading to a big reveal that, I'll give the show, is somewhat unexpected (I just can't say more about it since, apparently, the spoiler statute of limitations is five years; kidding, but why spoil your fun?).\n\n'You can stick your corporate doubletalk, pal... all we want to know is, when will the plumbing be working again?'\n\nSeason Two sees the scene shift slightly, though a \"rig\" of some sort is still involved, as is a remote location.\n\nNot all the crew members from the debut season make it this far, but Mark Addy's (hey, it's a veritable GOT reunion) arrogant executive Coake, from Pictor \u2013 the monolithic oil company that owns the Bravo \u2013 comes along for the ride.\n\nAlso aboard for the sophomore year are Pictor CEO Morgan Lennox (Alice Krige, Star Trek: First Contact), and assorted personnel from this new rig including scientist Askel (Johannes Roaldsen Furst) who might as well be renamed Deus Ex Machina for the number of out-of-the-blue \"saves\" he performs.\n\nMost of the human drama comes from the central trio of Glen, Hampshire and Compston, as their personalities clash while Fulmer and Rose's romance develops. There are corporate shenanigans and intrigue aplenty as Coake, Lennox and those Bravo crew members they pick as pawns navigate hard questions from an angry public.\n\n'I'm a bit worried. The last time anyone saw canisters like these, there were Facehuggers in them.'\n\nAnd, for sure, large amounts of suspense and the occasional burst of violence as hidden agendas boil over and moves are made against the (ahem) entity or such at the heart of the mystery.\n\nThere are rousing moments of high adventure as our intrepid oil rig workers and their newfound associates hesitantly venture forth into the strange and dangerous new world hidden below the surface.\n\nAs the ever-astute Askel puts it, that's 95% of the world's habitable area and we're just exploring it by candlelight.\n\nThat sort of sums up The Rig, too, which has an intriguing premise but takes its time developing its central mystery to the point that it can seem laggardly and in dire need of some urgency. After all, with so many precedents established in entertainment, these aspects of storytelling certainly don't need to be explored by candlelight.\n\nOverall, this will still appeal to fans of undersea mysteries and ecological thrillers, and the sluggish bits are buoyed by strong performances from the ensemble. While a third season has yet to be greenlit, the second ends with enough compelling questions raised for hopeful viewers to... keep a candle burning in the window, as it were.\n\nTwo six-episode seasons of The Rig are available to stream on Prime Video."

            "article_content": "It took a while for scientists to gain access to the samples that NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission took from the asteroid Bennu, but the wait is proving to be worth it. A new study published January 29 in Nature describes an unexpected discovery in the material delivered by OSIRIS-REx: residues of compounds left over by the evaporation of liquid water.\n\nTim McCoy, the paper\u2019s lead author, tells Popular Science that the presence of these compounds was completely unexpected. \u201c[Finding them] was a complete surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectively, the team that wrote this paper has hundreds of years of experience examining meteorites and none of us\u2014in fact, nobody\u2014had ever seen some of these minerals.\u201d\n\nOREX-800044-101, the sample that was analysed by the Japanese members of the OSIRIS-REx sample analysis team. Credit: Yasuhiro Oba\n\nOne of the reasons that the discovery is so significant is that the compounds must have precipitated from the evaporation of brine solutions\u2013solutions of liquid water with high concentrations of dissolved salts. \u201cWe know this,\u201d McCoy explains, \u201cboth because some of these minerals \u2026 actually have water in their crystal structure, and because we know the most abundant fluid [in the universe] is water. There could have been a small component of other ices, like carbon dioxide, but it was mostly water.\u201d\n\n[ Related: This is what\u2019s inside NASA\u2019s previously stuck asteroid sampler ]\n\nThe presence of these compounds therefore implies the presence of liquid water at some point in Bennu\u2019s history\u2014or, more accurately, in the history of the ancient asteroid from which Bennu originated. That parent asteroid was a larger object that broke up into smaller pieces at some point during the last 65 million years. McCoy explains that the parent asteroid was formed partly of ice, and over the millennia, this ice was melted by heat from the decay of radioactive elements in the asteroid\u2019s regolith.\n\nMcCoy says that this water \u201clikely existed not on the surface, but as a vein or pocket under the surface of the asteroid.\u201d This prolonged its existence in a liquid state, most likely, as McCoy says, at \u201cabout room temperature.\u201d The dissolved minerals may also have allowed the solution to remain liquid for longer: brine solutions generally have lower freezing points than pure water. (This is why roads are salted during snowy weather.)\n\nIn any case, when the water did eventually evaporate, it left behind the concentrated precipitates that proved such a surprise to McCoy and his team\u2014and when the parent asteroid broke up, those compounds were passed onto its successors, including Bennu. The first compound the team discovered in the Bennu sample was sodium carbonate, which had never been observed before in any other asteroid or meteorite. As it incorporates water into its crystal structure, its presence prompted McCoy and other teams around the world to search samples of other water-soluble compounds. They found 11 such compounds in total, all of which had been concentrated in a brine solution and then precipitated as the water evaporated.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Brines of the sort that apparently formed in the pockets of liquid water on Bennu\u2019s ancestor provide a favorable environment for the development of complex organic compounds. In a statement accompanying the release of the paper, McCoy said, \u201cWe now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu\u2019s parent body.\u201d The paper also speculates that similar brines may exist today in the interior of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Mars\u2019s moon Ceres.\n\nA mosaic image of asteroid Bennu, composed of 12 PolyCam images collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from a range of 24 kilometers. Credit: NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona\n\nEither way, McCoy says the apparent presence of liquid water in Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid also tells us something important about that asteroid: \u201cThe fact Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid incorporated ice means it had to form beyond the Solar System\u2019s snow line.\u201d This line marks the distance from a star at which the temperature falls below water\u2019s freezing point. (In 2016, NASA captured an image of this phenomenon in a young solar system.)\n\nThe snow line is particularly important in the early days of a solar system, as the cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a nascent star begins to coalesce into the protoplanetary disk from which the system\u2019s planets and other orbiting bodies will eventually form. Beyond the snow line, water is solid and aggregates readily into nascent planets and asteroids, whereas within the line, water remains gaseous and is harder to capture.\n\n[ Related: 10 chaotic space-related mishaps of 2024 ]\n\nThis means that objects formed beyond the snow line are relatively rich in water, and one leading theory about the origin of the water on Earth is that it was acquired by the capture of such water-rich objects. And if those objects contained brine solutions rich in organic compounds, it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that life may have already been evolving in those environments before their arrival on Earth.\n\nSuch theoretical possibilities aside, McCoy says the discovery of brine compounds shows the value of OSIRIS-REx having been able to take direct physical samples from Bennu. \u201cThese are incredibly rare minerals, so they can\u2019t be detected from Earth.\u201d In addition, he says, \u201cMany of these minerals are unstable in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Without the controlled return by a spacecraft mission and very careful curation in nitrogen to isolate them from the atmosphere, we would have never found [them] in the first place.\u201d"

            "article_content": "\n\n\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2024, an international team of scientists reported the presence of dark oxygen along the ocean floor and theorized that polymetallic nodules may have created this gas via seawater electrolysis.\n\nA flurry of criticism followed the article\u2019s publication, including from the deep-sea mining company that funded the study, and challenged the scientists\u2019 conclusions.\n\nNow, the researchers will once again return to the deep sea specifically to study dark oxygen production and hopefully settle this scientific disagreement once and for all.\n\nMost oxygen on Earth is produced by photosynthesis, as plants and plankton gobble sunlight for food and produce that oh-so-wonderful, life-giving O 2 . However, that\u2019s not the only way oxygen can be produced. Enter \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d a process that isn\u2019t as nefarious as it sounds. Simply put, it refers to oxygen produced without sunlight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlthough a couple examples of dark oxygen exist, a new potential source\u2014discovered at the dark depths of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), nestled between Hawaii and the western coast of Mexico\u2014has created a firestorm of interest. It\u2019s also sparked significant controversy, as the source of this new dark oxygen could be polymetallic nodules, which are mineral-rich objects that are the prize of deep sea mining companies like The Metals Company.\n\nIn July of 2024, an international team of scientists published a paper in the journal Nature Geoscience claiming that these polymetallic nodules (also known as manganese nodules) could be producing oxygen via electrolysis. As millions of years of metallic layers built up in the nodules\u2014similar to a voltaic pile\u2014the differing electric potential could theoretically produce enough energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. Almost immediately upon publication, The Metals Company (who helped fund the research) disagreed with the results, and other doubts in the academic community (none of which have been peer reviewed) began to surface.\n\nAndrew Sweetman\u2014lead author of the study and a deep-sea ecologist at the U.K.\u2019s Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS)\u2014and his colleagues have stood by the results.\n\n\u201cWhat if you\u2019re getting millions of these little tiny batteries on manganese oxide particles in the nodules [\u2026] and there\u2019s electrons flowing through the internal layer structure of the manganese oxide?,\u201d Sweetman told Popular Mechanics back in September of 2024. \u201cI was the worst critic of this paper for 10 years. I said \u2018no, this is not possible\u2019 until I couldn\u2019t say no anymore.\u201d\n\nNow, Sweetman\u2014backed by funding from a Japanese charity called The Nippon Foundation\u2014will venture once more to the CCZ to specifically test nodules from the sea floor and hopefully put these criticisms to rest. According to New Scientist, the team will use custom-built landers that can descend up to 12,000 meters below sea level, which is twice the required depth needed to study the nodules. The researchers will also search for the presence of hydrogen, which was not specifically tested in previous research, to further confirm that electrolysis is taking place. The first of three research expeditions will set sail in January of 2026 from San Diego, California, and Sweetman remains confident of the outcome.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis research comes at a sensitive time, as the International Seabed Authority (the global governing body that presides over the CCZ) is still determining the rules and regulations of mining these resource-rich nodules. If these hunks of metal are producing trace amounts of oxygen vis seawater electrolysis, the damage to this already sensitive area could be severe\u2014and conservation groups have taken notice.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent example of what it means to have the deep ocean as a frontier, a relatively unexplored part of our planet,\u201d Oceanographer Lisa Levin told the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition at the time of the initial paper\u2019s publication. \u201cThere are still new processes to discover that challenge what we know about life in our ocean.\u201d\n\nThis will be the first research expedition undertaken with the express purpose of searching for dark oxygen. Previous research on this discovery was part of a more general research expedition investigating ocean respiration. Although Sweetman has faced mounting criticism\u2014which he admits has taken a personal toll\u2014he remains confident of this future expedition\u2019s outcome, as he\u2019s seen evidence of this inexplicable oxygen show up in his work for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cI know [dark oxygen production] is happening. We have found this now in six places,\u201d Sweetman told New Scientist. \u201cI know we are going to find it.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "OpenAI says Chinese rivals using its work for their AI apps\n\nThe maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has complained that rivals, including those in China, are using its work to make rapid advances in developing their own artificial intelligence (AI) tools.\n\nThe status of OpenAI - and other US firms - as the world leaders in AI has been dramatically undermined this week by the sudden emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese app that can emulate the performance of ChatGPT, apparently at a fraction of the cost.\n\nBloomberg has reported that Microsoft is investigating whether data belonging to OpenAI - which it is a major investor in - has been used in an unauthorised way.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Microsoft and DeepSeek for comment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOpenAI's concerns have been echoed by the recently appointed White House \"AI and crypto czar\", David Sacks.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News, he suggested that DeepSeek may have used the models developed by OpenAI to get better, a process called knowledge distillation.\n\n\"There's substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI's models,\" Mr Sacks said.\n\n\"I think one of the things you're going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation... That would definitely slow down some of these copycat models.\"\n\nIn a statement, OpenAI said Chinese and other companies were \"constantly trying to distil the models of leading US AI companies\".\n\n\"As we go forward... it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models,\" it added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'Deceptive' claims\n\nNaomi Haefner, assistant professor of technology management at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, said the question of distillation could throw the notion that DeepSeek created its product for a fraction of the cost into doubt.\n\n\"It is unclear whether DeepSeek really trained its models from scratch,\" she said.\n\n\"OpenAI have stated that they believe DeepSeek may have misappropriated large amounts of data from them.\n\n\"If this is the case, then the claims about training the model very cheaply are deceptive. Until someone replicates the training approach we won't know for sure whether such cost-efficient training is really possible.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrystal van Oosterom, AI Venture Partner at OpenOcean, agreed that \"DeepSeek has clearly built upon publicly available research from major American and European institutions and companies\".\n\nHowever, it is not clear how problematic the idea of \"building on\" the work of others is.\n\nThis is especially true in AI, where the accusation of disrespecting intellectual property rights has been frequently levelled at major US AI firms.\n\nSecurity and ethics\n\nUS officials are also considering the national security implications of DeepSeek's emergence, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"I spoke with [the National Security Council] this morning, they are looking into what [the national security implications] may be,\" said Ms Leavitt, who also restated US President Donald Trump's remarks a day earlier that DeepSeek should be a wake-up call for the US tech industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe announcement comes after the US navy reportedly banned its members from using DeepSeek's apps due to \"potential security and ethical concerns\".\n\nAccording to CNBC, the US navy has sent an email to its staff warning them not to use the DeepSeek app due to \"potential security and ethical concerns associated with the model's origin and usage\".\n\nThe Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.\n\nCyber attacks on Chinese firm come as US officials looking into national security implications of DeepSeek AI [DeepSeek]\n\nData safety experts have warned users to be careful with the tool, given it collects large amounts of personal data and stores it in servers in China.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek says it has been the target of cyber attacks. On Monday it said it would temporarily limit registrations because of \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its software.\n\nA banner showing on the company's website says registration may be busy as a result of the attacks.\n\nAdditional reporting from Fan Wang\n\n[BBC]\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

            "article_content": "As sustainability continues to dominate the packaging industry, 2025 is set to bring groundbreaking changes in eco-packaging. /Credit: Skorzewiak via Shutterstock\n\nThe shift towards eco-friendly packaging is set to accelerate in 2025, with sustainable materials taking centre stage. Consumer awareness of environmental concerns has never been higher, and businesses are responding with packaging innovations that reduce waste, lower carbon emissions, and enhance recyclability.\n\nOne of the most notable trends is the rise of bio-based materials. Plant-based plastics, algae-derived films, and mushroom-based packaging are gaining traction as viable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based plastics.\n\nThese materials not only decompose naturally but also reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nRecycled materials are also playing a crucial role in the sustainable packaging movement. Brands are increasingly using post-consumer recycled (PCR) content in their packaging, reducing the demand for virgin materials.\n\nPaper and cardboard packaging, often sourced from sustainably managed forests, continue to be popular due to their recyclability and consumer-friendly appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, biodegradable and compostable packaging options are evolving to meet both environmental and functional demands. Companies are investing in materials that break down efficiently under industrial composting conditions while maintaining durability for product protection.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

In the UK and EU, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies are becoming more stringent, making producers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their packaging.\n\nThe upcoming Plastic Packaging Tax revisions are expected to place further financial pressure on businesses that fail to incorporate recycled content.\n\nAs regulations become more rigorous, businesses are investing in innovation to stay ahead. Smart packaging solutions, such as QR codes that guide consumers on proper disposal methods, are becoming increasingly common.\n\nThese digital integrations not only improve sustainability efforts but also enhance customer engagement by offering transparency about packaging materials and their environmental impact.\n\nMoreover, refillable and reusable packaging systems are gaining popularity. Major brands are exploring circular packaging models where consumers can return containers for reuse.\n\nSupermarkets are introducing refill stations for products like detergents, personal care items, and dry foods, reducing reliance on single-use plastics. Such initiatives align with both regulatory requirements and consumer demand for waste reduction.\n\nConsumer demand shapes packaging strategies\n\nConsumer preferences are significantly influencing the direction of eco-friendly packaging trends in 2025. Shoppers are actively seeking brands that prioritise sustainability, and companies that fail to adapt risk losing market share.\n\nA growing number of consumers are scrutinising packaging labels, looking for certifications such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and plastic-free seals.\n\nMinimalist packaging is another rising trend, driven by the preference for less material usage and a cleaner aesthetic. Excessive packaging is increasingly seen as wasteful, prompting brands to adopt streamlined designs with fewer layers.\n\nPackaging that serves multiple functions, such as being repurposed for storage or converted into another useful item, is also gaining traction.\n\nTransparency is now a key factor in packaging design. Brands are openly communicating their sustainability commitments, providing clear information on materials used and their environmental impact.\n\nDigital packaging innovations, such as augmented reality (AR), allow consumers to scan packaging for deeper insights into sourcing, production, and disposal methods.\n\nLooking ahead, eco-friendly packaging will continue to evolve as businesses refine their strategies to meet environmental targets and consumer expectations.\n\nThe industry is on the cusp of transformative change, and those embracing sustainable innovations will not only enhance their brand reputation but also contribute to a more circular economy.\n\nAs 2025 approaches, the message is clear\u2014eco-packaging is not just a trend but a fundamental shift shaping the future of the industry."

            "article_content": "It took a while for scientists to gain access to the samples that NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission took from the asteroid Bennu, but the wait is proving to be worth it. A new study published January 29 in Nature describes an unexpected discovery in the material delivered by OSIRIS-REx: residues of compounds left over by the evaporation of liquid water.\n\nTim McCoy, the paper\u2019s lead author, tells Popular Science that the presence of these compounds was completely unexpected. \u201c[Finding them] was a complete surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectively, the team that wrote this paper has hundreds of years of experience examining meteorites and none of us\u2014in fact, nobody\u2014had ever seen some of these minerals.\u201d\n\nOREX-800044-101, the sample that was analysed by the Japanese members of the OSIRIS-REx sample analysis team. Credit: Yasuhiro Oba\n\nOne of the reasons that the discovery is so significant is that the compounds must have precipitated from the evaporation of brine solutions\u2013solutions of liquid water with high concentrations of dissolved salts. \u201cWe know this,\u201d McCoy explains, \u201cboth because some of these minerals \u2026 actually have water in their crystal structure, and because we know the most abundant fluid [in the universe] is water. There could have been a small component of other ices, like carbon dioxide, but it was mostly water.\u201d\n\n[ Related: This is what\u2019s inside NASA\u2019s previously stuck asteroid sampler ]\n\nThe presence of these compounds therefore implies the presence of liquid water at some point in Bennu\u2019s history\u2014or, more accurately, in the history of the ancient asteroid from which Bennu originated. That parent asteroid was a larger object that broke up into smaller pieces at some point during the last 65 million years. McCoy explains that the parent asteroid was formed partly of ice, and over the millennia, this ice was melted by heat from the decay of radioactive elements in the asteroid\u2019s regolith.\n\nMcCoy says that this water \u201clikely existed not on the surface, but as a vein or pocket under the surface of the asteroid.\u201d This prolonged its existence in a liquid state, most likely, as McCoy says, at \u201cabout room temperature.\u201d The dissolved minerals may also have allowed the solution to remain liquid for longer: brine solutions generally have lower freezing points than pure water. (This is why roads are salted during snowy weather.)\n\nIn any case, when the water did eventually evaporate, it left behind the concentrated precipitates that proved such a surprise to McCoy and his team\u2014and when the parent asteroid broke up, those compounds were passed onto its successors, including Bennu. The first compound the team discovered in the Bennu sample was sodium carbonate, which had never been observed before in any other asteroid or meteorite. As it incorporates water into its crystal structure, its presence prompted McCoy and other teams around the world to search samples of other water-soluble compounds. They found 11 such compounds in total, all of which had been concentrated in a brine solution and then precipitated as the water evaporated.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Brines of the sort that apparently formed in the pockets of liquid water on Bennu\u2019s ancestor provide a favorable environment for the development of complex organic compounds. In a statement accompanying the release of the paper, McCoy said, \u201cWe now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu\u2019s parent body.\u201d The paper also speculates that similar brines may exist today in the interior of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Mars\u2019s moon Ceres.\n\nA mosaic image of asteroid Bennu, composed of 12 PolyCam images collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from a range of 24 kilometers. Credit: NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona\n\nEither way, McCoy says the apparent presence of liquid water in Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid also tells us something important about that asteroid: \u201cThe fact Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid incorporated ice means it had to form beyond the Solar System\u2019s snow line.\u201d This line marks the distance from a star at which the temperature falls below water\u2019s freezing point. (In 2016, NASA captured an image of this phenomenon in a young solar system.)\n\nThe snow line is particularly important in the early days of a solar system, as the cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a nascent star begins to coalesce into the protoplanetary disk from which the system\u2019s planets and other orbiting bodies will eventually form. Beyond the snow line, water is solid and aggregates readily into nascent planets and asteroids, whereas within the line, water remains gaseous and is harder to capture.\n\n[ Related: 10 chaotic space-related mishaps of 2024 ]\n\nThis means that objects formed beyond the snow line are relatively rich in water, and one leading theory about the origin of the water on Earth is that it was acquired by the capture of such water-rich objects. And if those objects contained brine solutions rich in organic compounds, it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that life may have already been evolving in those environments before their arrival on Earth.\n\nSuch theoretical possibilities aside, McCoy says the discovery of brine compounds shows the value of OSIRIS-REx having been able to take direct physical samples from Bennu. \u201cThese are incredibly rare minerals, so they can\u2019t be detected from Earth.\u201d In addition, he says, \u201cMany of these minerals are unstable in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Without the controlled return by a spacecraft mission and very careful curation in nitrogen to isolate them from the atmosphere, we would have never found [them] in the first place.\u201d"

Credit: Constance Sartor, shared with permission\n\nRising mountain peaks and sharp rock formations cover the ocean floor, with corals, sponges, fish, and tons of sea creatures clinging to their sides. Unlike mountains on land that dare climbers and hikers to brave their peaks, underwater mountains, called seamounts, are vastly underexplored. Submerged at often unfathomable depths, many are inaccessible to even the most experienced divers.\n\nBut now, a Boston University\u2013led team of scientists has made it possible to view a deep-sea mountain\u2014to study its geographic features and biodiversity\u2014without even getting wet. It's the first time a single seamount in the Pacific Ocean has been artistically visualized with this level of precision.\n\nThe team mapped a seamount located on the edge of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone in the central Pacific, producing a stunning illustration depicting corals and deep-sea organisms that live among complex ocean currents. The mountain, which sits a couple thousand miles southeast of Hawaii and is also on the border of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, was brought to life using data collected during an expedition led by Randi Rotjan, a BU College of Arts & Sciences research associate professor of biology.\n\nTo do so, Rotjan and her team used a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which scaled the seamount four times to illuminate the abundance of corals and deep-sea organisms that call it home at different depths. They then leveraged that data to inform an artistic rendering in the style of Alexander von Humboldt, a revered 19th-century naturalist who was one of the first to depict complex natural systems artistically. Rotjan says that Humboldt's legacy inspired her and the scientists to commission Constance Sartor, artist-at-sea and marine scientist at Schmidt Ocean Institute.\n\n\"The deep sea is a dark, impenetrable place where you can't take satellite views or landscape images,\" says Rotjan. \"We need art to help us visualize the deep sea, and we drew inspiration for this piece directly from Alexander von Humboldt.\"\n\nThe seamount is part of an ancient system of underwater volcanoes dating back over 60 million years. Most of the mountain is shrouded in darkness, but the top sits 196 meters (643 feet) below the surface within the mesophotic zone\u2014also known as the ocean \"twilight zone,\" where a small amount of sunlight allows corals and algae to photosynthesize. Below the twilight zone, deep-ocean corals don't need light to thrive.\n\nThe team collected ROV data from the top down to 1,500 meters (4,921 feet) deep, documenting over 100 different types of coral living on all sides of the seamount. The base is about 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) below the surface, making it about two and half times the size of Mount Washington, the tallest peak in New England. The team published their findings, and the artistic rendering, in Scientific Reports.\n\n\"There's very little work that's been done to explore the deep sea. Less than 1 percent of the ocean seafloor has actually been imaged globally,\" says Brian Kennedy (CAS'23), who earned his Ph.D. in the Rotjan Lab and is lead author of the study. The paper was first published as a chapter in his Ph.D. dissertation. He is now the chief scientist at the Ocean Discovery League, a nonprofit focused on expanding deep-sea science.\n\nThe ROV spotted many types of biologically diverse organisms on the seamount, including these three eels.

For this study, we wanted to get a sense of the ecological rules that govern underwater mountain biology. On land, the patterns on a mountain are obvious\u2014the top has low tree cover, then there's a conifer zone, and then the deciduous zone. But in the deep sea, we don't know any of this because we haven't seen most of the deep sea.\n\nKennedy: When we think about deep-sea science, a lot of the questions we're asking about the deep ocean are the same questions many great explorers and natural historians were asking about nature centuries ago. Thinking about seamounts, and how analogous they are to terrestrial mountains, we don't understand the processes that control the distribution of life the same way we do on land. This work was inspired by trying to get a better understanding of the bigger picture of what shapes biodiversity and community composition on seamounts. We wanted to take a deeper dive on a seamount that was unexplored.\n\nWhat was it like to document a previously unexplored area in such a remote part of the world?\n\nKennedy: In the beginning, there was some uncertainty around this project since it [started] right after COVID, and we really weren't sure it was going to happen. In some ways, it was a miracle we pulled this expedition off at all. We went to sea with less of a rigid cruise plan than normal. Once we mapped this area using multibeam sonar, we realized it was a great candidate. The summit of the seamount reaches the mesophotic zone, meaning that it receives enough light for photosynthesis to occur. It's also relatively symmetrical, and exists in some really complex equatorial current structures. There are really strong currents at different depths that change direction.\n\nRotjan: It was the perfect seamount for what we were looking for. We decided in real time as a team to perform four [ROV] dives at the seamount, which is no small thing. Each dive takes a lot of time and resources, and are each 24 to 36 hours long, so spending that much time and attention on one seamount is rare. We had our artist, Constance, onboard the vessel with us.\n\nThe ROV spotted many types of biologically diverse organisms on the seamount, including a yet-to-be identified brittle star living on a coral. Credit: Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nHow do the ocean currents influence the seamount and the life that exists there?\n\nKennedy: In the deep sea, we don't understand the full relationship, but we have some ideas. The assumption is that [ocean] currents are better for deep-sea coral diversity. On the equator, there are complex current systems that change at different depths and vary dramatically in direction and speed. The summit of this seamount reaches the equatorial undercurrent, which is one of the most powerful currents in this region of the Pacific.\n\nWe saw four distinct current systems on the seamount: a very strong west to east, a weaker west to east, a reverse east to west, and at the deepest depths, we saw a south to north flow. We hypothesized that each one would host different communities\u2014but, of course, the answer was more nuanced than we were expecting. Corals were pretty consistent on all sides\u2014some were affiliated to currents, but others didn't match the current patterns.\n\nRotjan: Once we start to understand some of these patterns and answer these questions, scientists can know if an abundant coral on the north side, like Swiftia, is found in any unusual spots that would be noteworthy. We can start to unpack the biodiversity. Since we haven't been able to do this before at this scale, this is so exciting.\n\nI know another important factor is oxygen, and you were able to document the oxygen minimum zone, or OMZ\u2014pockets where there is less oxygen available than the surrounding water\u2014on the seamount. Can you explain the significance of that?\n\nKennedy: Oxygen minimum zones exist in every ocean, which is where oxygen is lower than the rest of the water column. One of the cool things about this particular seamount is that there are two minimum zones\u2014one at 200 to 300 meters, and another one around 500 to 600 meters.\n\nStudying oxygen minimum zones is important because climate change is going to have a really major effect on oxygen distribution. A lot of the climate modeling indicates that oxygen concentrations in the deep ocean are going to decrease, and oxygen zones are going to expand dramatically in some parts of the world. We have to understand how sensitive different corals are to low oxygen states and how long they can sustain in a lower oxygen state before they start dying.\n\nRotjan: Even though there are oxygen minimum zones all over the ocean, this particular finding shows the stability of the zone on this seamount, because if it changed frequently, these corals would have a much bigger gap between them. These species are able to live on either side of the divide, but not in it, which begs all kinds of questions, like, is it the same population above and below the OMZ? Can coral larvae move through the oxygen minimum zone? We know climate change can also slow down or disrupt ocean currents, which can change the oxygen minimum zones and current dynamics, so disrupting the currents disrupts all of those systems.\n\nImage plate of example of vertical zonation along the flanks of the seamount. While there were numerous differences between the sides of the feature, four basic zones remained the same on all sides. (A) The top of the seamount was predominantly carbonate pavement with sediment filled depressions that hosted cup corals species. CCA commonly encrusted the carbonate (B) between 235 and 430 m depth on all sides there was a high density community of Aphrocallistes cf. beatrix sponges with tufts of Phyllochaetopterus limicolus worms living among the sponges. (C) Starting at 430 m down to 600 m, smaller encrusting sponges that were predominantly found on vertical or overhung faces dominated the benthic community. (D) the deeper depths (600\u20131500 m) were a mix of sponges and octocorals taxa made up the comparatively thinly populated patchy community. Credit: Scientific Reports (2025). DOI: 10.1038/s41598-025-86163-z\n\nWhy is it important to learn more about deep-sea corals?\n\nKennedy: Deep-sea corals and sponges are ecosystem engineers in the environment. Deep-sea communities play an important role in increasing nutrients concentration in deep water, which is one of the reasons upwelling areas are so productive. That water becomes nutrient-rich during its time in the deep sea by bacterial processes that corals and sponges have a heavy effect on modifying. The ocean around the world is changing very fast, and we need to know how to understand the impacts of climate change and human activities.\n\nRotjan: There is incredibly high biodiversity in seamounts, and these equatorial seamounts have some of the highest seamount biodiversity there is. One of the other key pieces about these corals is that they grow very slowly. These corals can be 4,000 years old\u2014they're old on a different level. They've lived through thousands of years of human history. Are we going to let them die on our watch? No.\n\nHow do you hope that this discovery can steer the conversations about deep-ocean conservation?\n\nRotjan: This seamount is right on the edge of the US Exclusive Economic Zone, in an unprotected area just outside of the recently renamed Pacific Remote Islands\u2014now the Pacific Islands Heritage\u2014Marine National Monument. There have been calls to expand protections in these US waters to include this seamount, and the many others in the area. Protecting oceans should be a bipartisan issue, and there has been historic bipartisan support for protecting these special, yet vulnerable, places.\n\nKennedy: We need to think about individual seamounts as much more complex entities than we have done previously. Seamounts that host photosynthetic communities\u2014but don't break the surface\u2014are very rare globally. I hope this paper opens the door to more people recognizing how special these oceanic features are.\n\nMore information: Brian RC Kennedy et al, Multi-faceted examination of a deepwater seamount reveals ecological patterns among coral and sponge communities in the equatorial Pacific, Scientific Reports (2025).

            "article_content": "The painful sell-off in stocks on Monday doesn't signal the start of a bear market, Goldman said.\n\nStrong macroeconomic conditions will hold up the market.\n\nMonday's retreat was a rethinking of high valuations among tech stocks, not weak fundamentals.\n\nThe market's dramatic free fall on Monday may have spooked investors this week, but the event was not a prelude to a deeper wipeout, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe market sold off to start the week as investors reacted to the jarring debut of DeepSeek, an AI app from a Chinese startup that challenged some of the core tenets of the market's bull thesis.\n\nBut to Goldman analysts, the event doesn't portend more pain to come.\n\n\"In our view this is a correction and not the start of a sustained bear market,\" analysts led by Peter Oppenheimer wrote on Wednesday.\n\nWith $1 trillion in market capped wiped out in a day, fears that the market was reaching a bearish inflection point likely seemed warranted to investors. However, Goldman argued that bear markets strike when profits fall on recession fears.\n\nWhile DeepSeek created ripples in the AI narrative, it did nothing to disrupt strong macroeconomic conditions. The analysts said they see a 15% chance that recession hits in the next 12 months, and are also betting on moderate interest rate cuts this year as inflation continues to ebb.\n\nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\nInstead of signaling the start of a possible bear market, the sell-off reflected that leading US tech stocks were \"priced to perfection,\" meaning that their valuations had climbed to levels that made them sensitive to disappointments.\n\nThe tech sector's heavy concentration in the S&P 500 \u2014 in which the top seven mega-cap firms account for around a third of the benchmark's value \u2014 only added to the problem.\n\nYet Goldman says these factors are the side-effects of strong fundamentals and not the result of massive speculation.\n\n\"The growing influence of technology on market returns reflects the significant outpacing of technology profits relative to other industries,\" the note said. In other words, there's no bubble.\n\nSince Monday, investors have returned to the idea that US tech is attractive, and could even benefit from DeepSeek's disruptive AI model. Benchmark indexes briefly surged on Tuesday, though trading has since been mixed.\n\nOther commentators disagree with Goldman's take.\n\n\"The Black Swan\" author Nassim Taleb warned that Monday's decline could be the start of deeper pullbacks to come.\n\n\"This is the beginning,\" Taleb told Bloomberg on Tuesday. \"Beginning of an adjustment of people to reality, because now they realize, now, it's no longer flawless.\"\n\nGoldman advised that investors try and diversify without giving up on tech. That includes adding exposure to bonds, focusing on the equal-weight S&P 500, and favoring global growth compounders beyond the tech sector."

            "article_content": "By ALEX VEIGA AP Business Writer\n\nEconomic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.\n\nDamage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.\n\nInsured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022.\n\nHurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.\n\n\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"\n\nAt least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.\n\nIn addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.\n\nIn a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history."

I'll never forget that sight as long as I live,\" Ogden added.\n\nAsked whether he feared death while he was hanging out of the cockpit, Lancaster told reporters: \"It did cross my mind. For a moment or two.\"\n\nIn the 2005 documentary Mayday, he also explained: \"What I remember most clearly was the fact that I couldn't breathe because I was facing into the airflow.\"\n\nAn investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) later found that bolts belonging to the windshield had been replaced with slightly smaller ones, which proved to be a lot less secure.\n\nLancaster returned to work after less than five months, but left British Airways in 2003.\n\nHe went on to fly planes for EasyJet until 2008, when he retired from commercial piloting - as I'm sure he'd seen more than enough of the skies by that point."

His discussions about controversial topics and conspiracy theories have captured the likes of millions since he debuted JRE in 2009 on Ustream.\n\nRogan\u2019s fanbase skyrocketed even more after Spotify purchased the rights to air JRE in May 2020.\n\nWith so much competition in the podcast realm, like Theo Von\u2019s \u2018This Past Weekend\u2019 and Alex Cooper\u2019s \u2018Call Her Daddy,\u2019 JRE has had to produce mind-bending discussions to keep listeners tuned in \u2014 which he\u2019s done seamlessly.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nInstagram: joerogan Joe Rogan pictured with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg.\n\nFrom his theories on an alien invasion to flying dragons, Rogan\u2019s topics have enthralled his fans, making JRE stay at the top of Spotify\u2019s rankings for the most-listened-to podcast.\n\nHowever, Rogan\u2019s podcast has seen an occasional drop on Spotify\u2019s The Podcast Charts, giving way for other hosts to reign victorious \u2014 which is exactly what just happened.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nJRE dethroned by The Mel Robbins Podcast on Spotify\n\nAt the time of writing, JRE has been surpassed as Spotify\u2019s number-one podcast in the US by The Mel Robbins Podcast.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nMel Robbins is a New York Times bestselling author and a motivational speaker. On her podcast, she discusses how to cultivate positivity for your well-being as well as health tips and facts.\n\n\u201cYou can change your life and Mel Robbins will show you how,\u201d her podcast bio reads. \u201cEvery episode is packed with deeply relatable topics, tactical advice, hilarious screwups, compelling conversations, and the tools and inspiration you need to create a better life.\u201d\n\nRogan previously saw a drop in his JRE stats in December 2024 when Kylie Kelce\u2019s \u2018Not Gonna Lie\u2019 debuted. In the same month, \u2018The Telepathy Tapes\u2019 podcast also toppled JRE as the most popular show.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nWhile JRE might currently be number two on Spotify\u2019s charts, the rankings tend to change quickly, resulting in Rogan\u2019s podcast likely being number one, once more, in little to no time."

            "article_content": "It took a while for scientists to gain access to the samples that NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission took from the asteroid Bennu, but the wait is proving to be worth it. A new study published January 29 in Nature describes an unexpected discovery in the material delivered by OSIRIS-REx: residues of compounds left over by the evaporation of liquid water.\n\nTim McCoy, the paper\u2019s lead author, tells Popular Science that the presence of these compounds was completely unexpected. \u201c[Finding them] was a complete surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cCollectively, the team that wrote this paper has hundreds of years of experience examining meteorites and none of us\u2014in fact, nobody\u2014had ever seen some of these minerals.\u201d\n\nOREX-800044-101, the sample that was analysed by the Japanese members of the OSIRIS-REx sample analysis team. Credit: Yasuhiro Oba\n\nOne of the reasons that the discovery is so significant is that the compounds must have precipitated from the evaporation of brine solutions\u2013solutions of liquid water with high concentrations of dissolved salts. \u201cWe know this,\u201d McCoy explains, \u201cboth because some of these minerals \u2026 actually have water in their crystal structure, and because we know the most abundant fluid [in the universe] is water. There could have been a small component of other ices, like carbon dioxide, but it was mostly water.\u201d\n\n[ Related: This is what\u2019s inside NASA\u2019s previously stuck asteroid sampler ]\n\nThe presence of these compounds therefore implies the presence of liquid water at some point in Bennu\u2019s history\u2014or, more accurately, in the history of the ancient asteroid from which Bennu originated. That parent asteroid was a larger object that broke up into smaller pieces at some point during the last 65 million years. McCoy explains that the parent asteroid was formed partly of ice, and over the millennia, this ice was melted by heat from the decay of radioactive elements in the asteroid\u2019s regolith.\n\nMcCoy says that this water \u201clikely existed not on the surface, but as a vein or pocket under the surface of the asteroid.\u201d This prolonged its existence in a liquid state, most likely, as McCoy says, at \u201cabout room temperature.\u201d The dissolved minerals may also have allowed the solution to remain liquid for longer: brine solutions generally have lower freezing points than pure water. (This is why roads are salted during snowy weather.)\n\nIn any case, when the water did eventually evaporate, it left behind the concentrated precipitates that proved such a surprise to McCoy and his team\u2014and when the parent asteroid broke up, those compounds were passed onto its successors, including Bennu. The first compound the team discovered in the Bennu sample was sodium carbonate, which had never been observed before in any other asteroid or meteorite. As it incorporates water into its crystal structure, its presence prompted McCoy and other teams around the world to search samples of other water-soluble compounds. They found 11 such compounds in total, all of which had been concentrated in a brine solution and then precipitated as the water evaporated.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Brines of the sort that apparently formed in the pockets of liquid water on Bennu\u2019s ancestor provide a favorable environment for the development of complex organic compounds. In a statement accompanying the release of the paper, McCoy said, \u201cWe now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu\u2019s parent body.\u201d The paper also speculates that similar brines may exist today in the interior of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Mars\u2019s moon Ceres.\n\nA mosaic image of asteroid Bennu, composed of 12 PolyCam images collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from a range of 24 kilometers. Credit: NASA/Goddard/University of Arizona\n\nEither way, McCoy says the apparent presence of liquid water in Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid also tells us something important about that asteroid: \u201cThe fact Bennu\u2019s parent asteroid incorporated ice means it had to form beyond the Solar System\u2019s snow line.\u201d This line marks the distance from a star at which the temperature falls below water\u2019s freezing point. (In 2016, NASA captured an image of this phenomenon in a young solar system.)\n\nThe snow line is particularly important in the early days of a solar system, as the cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a nascent star begins to coalesce into the protoplanetary disk from which the system\u2019s planets and other orbiting bodies will eventually form. Beyond the snow line, water is solid and aggregates readily into nascent planets and asteroids, whereas within the line, water remains gaseous and is harder to capture.\n\n[ Related: 10 chaotic space-related mishaps of 2024 ]\n\nThis means that objects formed beyond the snow line are relatively rich in water, and one leading theory about the origin of the water on Earth is that it was acquired by the capture of such water-rich objects. And if those objects contained brine solutions rich in organic compounds, it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that life may have already been evolving in those environments before their arrival on Earth.\n\nSuch theoretical possibilities aside, McCoy says the discovery of brine compounds shows the value of OSIRIS-REx having been able to take direct physical samples from Bennu. \u201cThese are incredibly rare minerals, so they can\u2019t be detected from Earth.\u201d In addition, he says, \u201cMany of these minerals are unstable in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Without the controlled return by a spacecraft mission and very careful curation in nitrogen to isolate them from the atmosphere, we would have never found [them] in the first place.\u201d"
