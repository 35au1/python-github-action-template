        "article_content": "Familia.AI Launches Revolutionary AI-Powered Family App\n\nSan Francisco, California--(Newsfile Corp. - October 11, 2024) - Familia.AI (familia.ai) today unveiled its groundbreaking AI family app, allowing users to create and interact with AI-powered family members, preserving family legacies, and enhancing family dynamics through digital connections that span generations.\n\nFamilia.AI - Creating AI Family App\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10373/226387_e29ed86cb4d098f7_001full.jpg\n\n\"Familia AI empowers users to both create and interact with AI-powered family members they may not have had in real life, offering emotional support as well as creating AI family members from aging or passed real family members,\" said Rohan Sinclair Luvaglio, Familia AI's first investor and serial tech entrepreneur.\n\nThe Familia.AI app tackles three key areas of family dynamics and support:\n\nAI-Powered Family Members for Emotional Support\n\nFamilia AI offers a lifeline to individuals who have experienced family-related challenges, including those from single-parent homes, those who lacked a supportive family environment, lost family members early, or endured other types of family trauma.\n\nDr. Emily Chen Ph.D., Familia.AI advisor and renowned psychologist specializing in family dynamics, commented: \"Familia AI offers a unique opportunity for individuals to experience the kind of nurturing family interactions they may have missed, potentially helping to heal emotional wounds and family trauma.\"\n\nFamilia.AI App - Creating AI Family Personality\n\n\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10373/226387_e29ed86cb4d098f7_002full.jpg\n\nPreserving Family Legacies for Future Generations\n\nServing as a digital family heirloom, Familia AI captures the essence, wisdom, and memories of real family members.\n\nBringing Lost Loved Ones to Life for Future Generations\n\nFamilia.AI can recreate the essence of family members that have passed, using old photos, video footage, and family anecdotes.\n\nFamilia.AI uses artificial intelligence to restore family photos, videos, written text, and even audio. This data is then used to create highly personalized AI family members that can engage in regular video messages, text messaging, voice calls and even participate in video calls. \"Familia.AI's goal isn't to replace human connections, but to enhance where possible and preserve them,\" Luvaglio emphasized. \"Familia.AI is using AI technology that allows families to bridge gaps of time and distance, offering support, preserving memories, and strengthening bonds across generations.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLink Between Family Trauma & Loneliness\n\nThe launch of Familia.AI comes at a time when studies show an increasing need for emotional support and family connection:\n\n67% of young adults report that problems at home or with parents have affected their mental health in later life [1].\n\n42% of individuals attribute their struggles with forming healthy relationships to difficult family dynamics during childhood [2].\n\n78% of therapy patients discuss family-related issues as a significant factor in their emotional challenges [3].\n\nRecent research has highlighted the strong connection between family trauma and loneliness. A 2024 study found that individuals who experienced family trauma were 3.5 times more likely to report chronic loneliness in adulthood [4]. This loneliness has been linked to a range of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of depression, anxiety, and even physical health problems [5].\n\nDr. Chen elaborates, \"Family trauma doesn't just affect our relationships with family members; it can fundamentally alter how we connect with others throughout our lives. Many individuals who've experienced family trauma struggle with trust, intimacy, and self-worth, which can lead to profound and persistent feelings of loneliness.\"\n\nFamilia.AI aims to address these challenges by providing a safe, supportive environment where users can experience positive family interactions, preserve cherished memories, and maintain connections with loved ones past and present. By doing so, the company is actively working to break cycles of family trauma, combat loneliness, and foster healthier emotional development across generations.\n\nAs the company looks to build on its unique AI family service, it remains committed to ethical AI development and user safety. \"I believe Familia.AI is pioneering new territory in AI and I'm happy to support the business,\" says Luvaglio.\n\nAbout Familia.AI\n\nFamilia.AI is an AI-powered app creating personalized digital family members that fill the gaps in family networks and preserve cherished family memories for future generations. By offering personalized family AI companions, Familia.AI's mission is to support and preserve human connections in an age where technology can be a force for emotional well-being.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Johnson, A. et al.

Courtesy/Jorge Vasquez\n\nThe Border Heritage Museum is partnering with NeverDead Entertainment and the Laredo Paranormal Research Society to publicly showcase local haunted artifacts for the first time.\n\nFor a little over three weeks, the museum will host the Strange Possessions Exhibit, which will house 20 relics with haunting backstories. The exhibit officially opened Friday at the Villa Antigua Border Heritage Museum, located at 810 Zaragoza St.\n\nThe Strange Possessions Exhibit opens Friday, showcasing \"haunted artifacts\" at the Border Heritage Museum through a partnership with NeverDead Entertainment and the Laredo Paranormal Research Society. Courtesy/Laredo Paranormal Research Society\n\nNeverDead Entertainment founder Jesus Moreno says Laredo Paranormal Research Society founder Ismael Cuellar agreed to lend the relics from a collection of more than 200 items, which some believe to be cursed or possessed, that the society gathered over 30 years.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe paranormal, or stories of the paranormal, is such a huge part of our culture. These items even more so because they\u2019re taken from homes here in Laredo,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cSome of these are from the historic Saint Peter\u2019s area or other historic homes in Laredo.\u201d\n\nCuellar said all except one item publicly debuted on Friday. The LPRS's well-known item, Emma \u2014 a plastic hillside doll with counter-weight eyes in a Victorian-era baby\u2019s gown and hood \u2014 is making another appearance.\n\nThe doll came into the LPRS's possession in 2006 after an antique doll and curiosity collector complained of unexplained noises and occurrences in their home. After the society conducted an investigation, the LPRS said Emma appeared to blink and close its left eye after sitting in an isolated room for more than 40 hours.\n\nCuellar said he has presented Emma in public, with the LPRS later being asked to no longer bring her due to reports of flickering lights and strange sounds when she was present.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nRaggedy Andy, the possessed doll who doesn't enjoy being separate from its counterpart, Raggedy Ann.

That was a big scare.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nEach artifact on display will showcase its background and the local stories or history that connect it to the area.\n\n\u201cThe stories are very, very unique,\u201d Cuellar said.\n\nPictured is the Border Heritage Museum, located at 810 Zaragoza St. in Laredo, Texas in 2023. Courtesy/WCHF\n\nMoreno said that being able to display these items is an honor. \u201cFor (Cuellar) to trust us in displaying these artifacts and sharing the history, it\u2019s a huge honor,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the point of research. We want to share what we found.

        "article_content": "Since the Nobel Prizes were created in 1901, just 24 women have received awards in the sciences. This year, that number stayed the same: All seven laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine were men.\n\nSome scientists have expressed frustration about the lack of women among this year\u2019s awardees, particularly the omission of two women who contributed to the work honored for the prize in physiology or medicine. Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address.

You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."

This plays a vital role in how complex life forms grow and function.\n\nGary Ruvkun is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. He spoke with Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald about his life-changing discovery, and how he hopes to use RNA to find life on other planets. Here is part of that conversation.\n\nWhat was it like to get that call from Stockholm?\n\nIt's been sort of in play for about 20 years. And so at four in the morning when the phone rings, it sort of took a minute to register, and my wife answered it and she said, \"He has a Swedish accent!\" Then it was like, \"Oh!\"\n\nTell me the story of how we started to understand how genes get turned on and off, [which] led to your work on microRNA.\n\nSo this emerged from doing genetic analysis in this little [worm called a] nematode. So the nematode is a big part of the ecosystem in soils, and it's so simple, it has 959 cells and every cell has a name. So I started to work in 1982, as did Victor Ambros, and we worked together on the pedigree of cells that generates the animal.\n\nHow did that lead to the discovery of the role of microRNA?\n\nWhen we figured out what these genes were, it turned out one of them encoded a product that was about five times smaller than any gene had ever been seen to be. It was only 25 nucleotides (the building blocks of RNA and DNA) long. And that was a new phenomenon, and it was considered kind of a quirk, and it wasn't clear what it really meant.\n\nNobel Committee Secretary General Thomas Perlmann speaks to the media in front of a picture of this year's laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun during the announcement of the winners of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (Jonathan Nackstrand/Getty Images)\n\nWhen did you realize that this was a brand new genetic molecule?\n\nThis is early days. We didn't have any genomes at this point but within five years, genomes were emerging. The way we figured out that [microRNA was present in the human genome] was we got a second one of these microRNAs, these very small genes, and that one had a human [equivalent], and got an answer by comparing the worm genome with its 25 letters, and there were those same 25 letters in the human genome.\n\nWhat do these microRNAs actually do?\n\nThey regulate other target genes, and they do all kinds of different processes, and they are used in essentially every animal and every plant. So they're as ancient as the divergence of plants and animals, which is, you know, a billion years ago. And have been implicated in, for example, the domestication of corn 5000 years ago.\n\nThese mutations are what the Indigenous peoples selected for. They didn't know they were doing that, but they got what are called heterochronic mutants, mutants that do things differently when they're developing. And that's what makes bigger corn cobs.\n\nI understand that more recently, you've been applying your knowledge for the search for microbial life outside of our solar system. Tell me about that.\n\nYeah, that's been a passion. So we sort of dove into the richness of RNA biology, and there's a long tradition of people trying to figure out how the ribosome works, for example.\n\nAnd the ribosome is the tiny machine in all of our cells that takes messenger RNA and translates them into proteins, and it turns out that the key element of the ribosome is an RNA that probably existed before proteins even evolved.\n\nThat RNA is the most conserved thing on Earth, and it's how biologists all over the world go to bizarre ecosystems like snow and ice, or ponds, or deep in the ocean, or human feces, you name it. You can look for who's in there by looking for the DNA segments that are present in the ribosome.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun speak onstage during the Breakthrough Prize Awards Ceremony in 2014. Their discovery of microRNA in 1993 has completely transformed what we know about how cells work. (Steve Jennings/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize)\n\nAnd so I've been trying to convince NASA that that's how they should look for life on Mars, and their response is always, \"Well, yes, but that's a very Earth centred view of looking for life. Are you stupid?\" And my response is, it'd be stupid to not first look for that.\n\nIf you think that Mars is going to have independently evolved life, that's stupid, because of course it's going to spread between Earth and Mars. They're right near each other, and there's meteoritic exchange between the two. We have Martian meteorites on Earth, not a lot of them, but you don't need a lot to have bacteria move between planetary systems.\n\nAre there any future applications of microRNA research that you're hoping to see?\n\nYeah. I mean, we're going to continue to work on sort of, what are the pathways right now. One of the big things we do is we now know a lot about what are the proteins that are involved in presenting these tiny RNAs to their targets.\n\nAnd we know that some of those proteins, they're not present in humans or most of the animal kingdom, but the worm has them, ticks and spiders have them, coral has them, and these are the organisms that do antiviral defence way better than we do.\n\nSo we're trying to figure out why so many of the animals like most insects, all of the vertebrates, essentially dumped their very ancient antiviral pathway to develop what's called the interferon pathway, which is how we fight viruses. And my view is that we don't do such a good job in comparison."

        "article_content": "The fintech industry has significantly transformed over the past decade, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. The need for robust security measures for fintech companies has never been more critical. Fintech companies continue to innovate making data security a top priority.\n\nOver the years, fintech security has evolved to include various technologies and practices, including virtual data room solutions. Today, these technologies develop, offering new ways to protect financial transactions and sensitive data. This article will explore the future of data security in fintech from the data room perspective.\n\nUnderstanding fintech and the role of data security\n\nFintech, meaning financial technology, refers to technology integration into financial services to improve the delivery of financial products. Fintech companies needed advanced security measures to protect their customers\u2019 sensitive data. The transformation of fintech security has been forced by the need to stay ahead of cybercriminals while providing compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nData security in the fintech sector involves technologies, processes, and best practices for protecting sensitive financial data. It includes data security protocols, compliance with regulations, and ongoing security risk monitoring. The main goal of data security is to prevent unauthorised access and safeguard against data breaches and other cyber attacks.\n\nVirtual data room software for fintech data security\n\nA virtual data room (VDR) is a digital space where important documents and information are stored and shared. It lets authorised users access and work together on files for business activities. Maintaining security is paramount because of the nature of the data stored in VDRs. Data breaches can lead to a competitive edge, legal repercussions, and harm to reputation.\n\nSecurity measures are crucial for safeguarding data and upholding compliance standards within virtual data rooms. For enhanced protection, dataroom software employs security functionalities such as encryption, access controls, audit trails, and device restrictions. The important and sensitive data stored in VDRs needs security to stop cyber threats. Ensuring security in VDRs is crucial for keeping things private following the rules and avoiding problems.\n\n\u201cInvesting in a secure data storage place will reap the rewards in many ways,\u201d says Gilbert Waters, Co-founder and marketing specialist at data-rooms.org. The organization of VDR security starts with choosing among data room providers known for data protection. Ensure they hold security certifications such as ISO 27001 and undergo independent audits. Avoid providers that don\u2019t specify their security architecture or protocols.\n\nKey VDR security elements\n\nVirtual data rooms utilise a layered approach to security, with multiple critical elements working together to protect sensitive data. Some of the key elements include:\n\nData encryption . It is crucial for all data stored and sent via a data room to be encrypted using recognised methods, like AES 256-bit encryption . This process transforms data into a code that can only be decoded with the encryption key. Multi-factor authentication . It mandates users to present two or more credentials for access, such as a password paired with a one-time code or biometric verification. This strategy safeguards against password compromise and unauthorised entry. Advanced virtual data rooms support MFA techniques like SMS codes, authenticator apps, and biometric identifiers. Access controls . Granular user permissions allow tight control over document storage and access. Admins can restrict viewing, downloading, printing, watermarking, and other actions on a user and document group basis. Complex access regulations based on user attributes can be configured. Audit trails track all user activity.\n\nFintech data security trends\n\nTechnology integration transforms and reshapes data security management and how financial institutions operate. Here are the main trends that influence and shape data security:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) . They have changed financial services, helping in fraud detection, threat intelligence, and transaction analysis. Artificial intelligence technologies leverage algorithms to analyse data and identify patterns and potential security threats that might go unnoticed by traditional methods.\n\nBiometric technologies . It includes facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, which are increasingly used in fintech applications to enhance security. These technologies provide a higher level of protection compared to traditional methods. Biometric authentication enhances data privacy by ensuring access to financial accounts only to authorised users.\n\nBlockchain technology . Blockchain uses a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of nodes. Each transaction is secured cryptographically and linked to the previous one, forming a chain resistant to tampering. This immutability is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nCloud technology . Cloud computing enhances data privacy in several ways. It uses advanced encryption techniques to secure data at rest and in transit. Strict access controls allow companies to define who can access specific data and under what conditions, further bolstering privacy. Advanced threat detection and response mechanisms are integral to cloud services, helping identify security breaches.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the fintech landscape evolves, ensuring robust security measures is more crucial than ever. Fintech security is a critical element in the fintech industry, as the sector faces many challenges. By adopting innovative technologies financial institutions can protect sensitive customer data, mitigate risks, and build trust with their customers. Using data rooms, in particular, can provide a relevant tool for maintaining data security and compliance in the fintech sector. Leveraging virtual data rooms for sensitive data companies must partner with providers who actively invest in the latest security innovations and stay ahead of emerging risks."

Scammers may request personal information, financial details, or even demand payments to avoid further consequences. Victims may be coerced into staying connected for extended periods, effectively holding them hostage to the scammer\u2019s demands.\n\nIt is important to be aware of the tactics used by scammers in digital arrests. By understanding the common techniques employed, individuals can better protect themselves from falling victim to these scams.\n\nKey Points\n\nDigital arrests involve tricking victims into believing they are under a virtual arrest.\n\nScammers use video conferencing software and deepfake technology to create a convincing facade.\n\nVictims are coerced into staying connected and revealing sensitive information.\n\nIt is crucial to be aware of these scams and take precautions to protect yourself."
