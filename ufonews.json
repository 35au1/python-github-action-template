        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Unsolved Mysteries: The Roswell UFO Incident\u2019 sheds light on the controversial Roswell UFO crash incident of 1947. On one hand, the government allegedly covered up the truth by claiming that it was an experimental balloon aircraft that crashed. On the other hand, UFO enthusiasts believed that in addition to the crashing of an actual UFO, bodies of aliens were also recovered. The episode consists of in-depth interviews with some of the experts in the field, including Donald Schmitt, who shared his opinion on the subject.\n\nDonald Schmitt Has Made Significant Contributions to UFO Research\n\nDonald Raymond Schmitt\u2019s journey to success was not short or easy. After graduating from Hartford Union High School, he earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree from Concordia University Wisconsin. He also attended Milwaukee Area Technical College for higher studies. Given his interest in UFOs and related subjects, he organized five archaeological dig projects at the 1947 Rowell crash site, with the first one in 1989. The next two digs came after more than a decade, in 2002, followed by 2006. The previous two digs were conducted in 2013 and 2016. His efforts were so impressive that the central theme of \u2018The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evidence\u2019 was based on the second dig.\n\nIn the 1970s, Donald used to work as a special investigator for the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the art director for the International UFO Reporter and the scientific consultant to the Air Force Project Blue Book. So, when the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in Chicago was founded, he became the Director of Special Investigations and retired from the post after serving for a decade. Apart from being a member of Holy Hill Basilica Choir, he was also the president of Hartford Community Chorus at some point. Donald was also employed at Bloom and Associates as an art director/consultant and at Stellar Productions. Formerly, he was also the Wisconsin State Director of MUFON.\n\nInterestingly, he also co-produced the 2020 documentary \u2018The Phenomenon,\u2019 which centers on the unidentified aerial phenomenon. Starting in 2019, he is a co-founder of the International Coalition on Extraterrestrial Research (ICER), where he serves as the North American Representative. Furthermore, he is currently the co-founder of the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. There, he is appointed as a board advisor and a lead investigator.\n\nThe Best-Selling Author\u2019s Debut Book is Now a Golden Globe-Nominated Movie\n\nDonald R. Schmitt has also dabbled in the field of writing and has authored several books. The former special investigator published his debut book, \u2018UFO Crash at Roswell\u2019 in 1991, sharing the title of co-author with Kevin D. Randle. Chronicling the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, the book garnered several eyeballs and ended up getting adapted into a movie for the screen by Arthur L. Kopit and Jeremy Kagan for the latter\u2019s movie, \u2018Roswell.\u2019 Starring Kyle MacLachlan and Martin Sheen in pivotal roles, the 1994 film also earned a nomination for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television at the Golden Globes in 1995. Interestingly, the Golden Globe nod is what Donald considers his most remarkable accomplishment in life.\n\nOver the years, he has made great strides in the world of writing by not only penning his observations in articles but also full-fledged books. Another of his books, \u2018Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up,\u2019 which he co-authored with Thomas J. Carey, sat on the throne of the top-selling UFO-themed book across the globe for two years \u2014 2007 and 2008. According to reports, Stellar Productions has optioned the book for the movie, \u2018Majic Men.\u2019 Donald has earned the title of best-selling author not once nor twice but seven times (author/co-author) for many of his titles, such as \u2018The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell,\u2019 \u2018Roswell: The Chronological Pictorial,\u2019 \u2018The Children of Roswell,\u2019 and \u2018Inside the Real Area 51.\u2019 Not just that, Donald has also graced the television screens to share his insight on all things UFO by featuring on \u2018Oprah,\u2019 \u2018CBS 48 Hours,\u2019 \u2018Larry King Live,\u2019 and many more.\n\nDonald Schmitt and His Wife Lead a Private Yet Fulfilling Married Life\n\nThough the professional life of Donald R Schmitt is in the public eye, the personal aspects are something he prefers to keep private. He has been blessed with the companionship of his lovely wife of many years, Marie, and together they have weaved a beautiful life with love, compassion, and understanding. The investigative author has never hesitated to profess his affection and gratitude for his wife for all the support and faith she has shown for and in him since they tied the knot.\n\nIn fact, a testament to that would be the heartwarming shout-out he gave the love of his life in the Acknowledgement section of his 2017 book, titled \u2018Cover-Up at Roswell: Exposing the 70-Year Conspiracy to Suppress the Truth.\u2019 It read: \u201cAnd finally, I will shout it from the highest roof that I am truly blessed with a wife who loves me for being me.\u201d Apart from the fact that his father passed on before his mother, Viola, not much is known about his familial life. As of writing, Donald and his wife seemingly reside in their peaceful ranch in the small community of Hubertus in Washington County, Wisconsin.\n\nRead More: Kevin Randle: Where is the Ufologist Now?"

The second light then disappears, only to reappear to the left of the first light.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s three, there\u2019s three!\u201d a child says.\n\n\u201cFour!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d an excited voice adds.\n\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d\n\nThe video switches to a night vision camera, which makes the lights\u2019 disappearance and reappearance even more phenomenal.\n\nPlay Video UFOs captured in the skies over White Hills south of Perth UFOs captured in the skies over White Hills south of Perth\n\nThe video\u2019s owner noted that: \u201cThis was witnessed by many people along the West Coast of Australia\u201d.\n\nIt was posted on the Perth UFO sightings earlier this week and attracted more than 100 comments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who has been into astronomy for 30+ years. I am very familiar with the sky and most things people confuse for UFO\u2019s,\u201d one member commented.\n\n\u201cThis footage, however, is the first I can\u2019t explain. The objected are physical. Not flying in a terrestrial sense and they\u2019re neither planets, comets, or meteors/bolides.\n\n\u201cVery interesting. Was there any sound/noise?\u201d\n\nMany believe that UFO activity has ramped up in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching this and other similar pages like this for a while now, and have observed a noticeable increase in activity in WA and for that matter, all over the world; particularly posts involving small orange lights off the coast,\u201d another member wrote.\n\nCamera Icon Strange lights were captured in the sky over White Hills this week. Credit: Supplied\n\n\u201cA couple of questions: (a) when and where should I go so see them for myself and (b) does anyone have any credible theories?\u201d\n\nThe night before, another video captured weird orange lights over Mandurah.\n\nThey behaved in a similar fashion, blinking in and out intermittently.\n\nThe video also captured the attention and imagination of UFO lovers.\n\n\u201cYes seen it in Fremantle out towards Rottnest. I rang the water police thinking it was a flare. I was told there we several calls and that it was likely space debris. I saw it about 5 times in the space of 10 minutes,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nA third video was captured over Forrestfield on Thursday night and the woman who shot the footage wrote: \u201cSaw these lights from the sky 9.30 Forrestfield so took 2 photos from the driver\u2019s seat in my car the lights were very bright shining through the clouds then saw in the photo this dark shape around the lights?\u201d\n\nIn recent days the Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS has been delighting astro-photographers across WA who have been capturing stunning images.\n\nBut typically comets don\u2019t jump around the sky.\n\nPerth Observatory tour administrator Matt Woods confirmed water police had reached out to them after receiving reports of the mysterious lights.\n\nWhile Mr Woods couldn\u2019t confirm what the lights were, he wondered if they were flares ejected by military planes."

        "article_content": "Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, \u2018CTRL\u2019 revolves around Nella Awasthi, a popular content creator whose social media relationship with her boyfriend, Joe Mascarenhas, comes to an end after she catches him cheating on her. Subsequently, Nella installs an AI app named CTRL that helps her erase Joe from her digital life. However, unbeknownst to her, the app takes rapid control over every aspect of her life, blurring the lines between reality and the virtual world.\n\nThe Netflix thriller presents a cerebral film that latches on to growing concerns within the modernizing digital world. With data, social media, and personal privacy colliding within the screenlife drama\u2019s plot, a grave and chilling account is presented with unflinching authenticity. It asks valid questions about individual awareness, the practices of the dark web, and how invasive technology can be when left unchecked and employed as a commodity. Therefore, the film\u2019s basis seems tied to prescient issues of the contemporary world and the reality faced by everyone with access to the internet. But is that really the case?\n\nCTRL Focuses on the Dark Side of Social Media\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is a fictional story penned by director Vikramaditya Motwane and co-writers Avinash Sampath and Sumukhi Suresh. The movie explores the pitfalls of social media culture through a gripping thriller storyline, punctuating it with incisive forays into the internet\u2019s toxic elements. While the story begins in a relatively happy place, it takes a slow descent into the issues plaguing ordinary people in relation to their digital interactions. Probing questions about authenticity are posed as the protagonist, Nella, finds herself living a lie in front of the camera but leading a completely different one offscreen. Additionally, the darkest aspects of the narrative come to the fore when an invasive AI begins exploiting the insecurities of human emotions through its own agendas.\n\nThe movie mainly examines the exploitative nature of social media and how memory, human emotion, and feelings can often get tied in a virtual setting, which often has no borders on its privacy. As people yearn for more, Nella finds herself catering to their needs by becoming the face of perfection but lacking the imperfections needed to sell reality. Director Vikramaditya stated that the film revolves around the concept of sharing oneself with the world without understanding the consequences that come from it. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s all about \u2013 how much sharing is too much sharing and the dopamine hits likes and favourites give you. It\u2019s about how much you end up doing for social media. It\u2019s like a doomsday scenario and it\u2019s not impossible to believe this.\u201d\n\nCTRL is a Topical Thriller About the Commodification of Human Experience\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 derives most of its central tension from the battle between human free will and an authoritarian AI app that wants to dictate everything for its users. There is an Orwellian fantasy lurking in its premise. Parallels can be seen with how rapidly modernizing internet practices attempt to take away control from people\u2019s lives, particularly in the manner in which it preys on insecurities. It serves as the burning question of the film. Even Ananya Pandey, who plays Nella, chimed in on the topical concern by emphasizing how it can be particularly damaging for mostly the younger generation, who find themselves victim to a lot of seedy online elements and the mental challenges they pose at times.\n\nMemory also plays a major role in \u2018CTRL.\u2019 With most people\u2019s lives today stored in digital archives, a person\u2019s memories can be attached to their social media avatar. In the movie, this becomes a central topic and one that was inspired by other films. During the development process, the scriptwriters discussed the enduring legacy of \u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019 as a key influence, particularly in the manner in which it explores erasing a loved one from one\u2019s life. The same concept rears its head throughout the Netflix screenlife thriller. The director also revealed that the Spike Jonze-directed science fiction movie, \u2018Her,\u2019 had some influence over the writing. However, he hailed the Michel Gondry directorial as a masterpiece, even if it does not touch upon the topic of AI.\n\nThe Ctrl App is a Fictional AI Service With an Invasive Protocol\n\n\u2018CTRL\u2019 is built around the futuristic service provided by the titular AI app that Nella installs on her laptop, which eventually takes control over her life. It is a made-up application conceived by the scriptwriters Vikramaditya Motwane, Avinash Sampath, and Sumukhi Suresh. While it is not based on any real-life apps, Vikramaditya stated that it would serve as an interesting reflection of how AI has become a major hot-button issue in today\u2019s society. \u201cGiven the conversations about AI, we realized that there was a lot more that we could say about social media, data and privacy in the guide of a straightforward thriller,\u201d the director said. As such, some vague parallels can be drawn between the CTRL app and chatbot AIs like ChatGPT, especially how it is capable of mimicking natural human dialogue.\n\nHowever, in terms of the app\u2019s personalized aspects, digital assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa have more similarities. The story focuses primarily on the CTRL app\u2019s invasive nature and how it eventually takes over Nella\u2019s life and dictates every aspect, including her schedule and emotional needs. In many ways, it also provides an outlet for people to alleviate their loneliness, which is a prime concern in the case of Nella, who goes through a very public breakup and finds herself ostracized on the internet. It speaks to a greater issue converging on modern society, specifically in the domain of ethics, and whether human insecurities might be harnessed to the advantages of AI services like CTRL. Still, for the time being, it is a fictional service with no ties to reality.\n\nRead More: Best Thriller Movies on Netflix"

        "article_content": "\u00d7\n\nMilford to hold talks, signings in Durango and Farmington\n\nRetired Navajo Ranger Stanley Milford Jr. has seen some things in his life that can\u2019t always be explained.\n\n\u00d7\n\nMilford, who split his time growing up between his mother\u2019s house in Oklahoma and with his father on the Navajo Reservation, said not only was his upbringing between two different geographic areas, the two were culturally different as well: Oklahoma was more \u201cmainstream and Western\u201d while the reservation was steeped in \u201cNative American culture.\u201d\n\nWhen he grew up, he graduated from the United States Indian Police Academy and became a Navajo Ranger, where he and his partner, Jonathan Dover, investigated paranormal cases called in by residents. For those who have been in the area a while, he also cut his teeth in law enforcement by helping during the 1998 Four Corners manhunt for the three men \u2013 Jason McVean, Robert Mason and Alan \u201cMonte\u201d Pilon \u2013 who killed Cortez Police Officer Dale Claxton and took off into the Colorado/Utah desert.\n\nHe\u2019s just released his memoir, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger,\u201d and will be at Maria\u2019s Bookshop and in Farmington to discuss it. He\u2019s also been featured on shows, including Nexflix\u2019s reboot of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nIf you go WHAT: Author Event and Book-Signing With Stanley Milford Jr. and his new release, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger.\u201d WHEN: 6-8 p.m. Oct. 10. WHERE: Maria\u2019s Bookshop, 960 Main Ave. MORE INFORMATION: Visit https://tinyurl.com/y67bn8sx.\n\nThe memoir is a mix of Milford\u2019s autobiography interspersed with chapters about the Navajo origin story.\n\nMilford and Dover first got into paranormal investigations when they were called to take over the case of a Navajo grandmother, who lost a sheep.\n\n\u201cShe recounted this story of this Bigfoot stepping over into her sheep corral and taking off with one of her sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cShe called the department, and two Rangers were assigned, and one of the Rangers was a comedian; he\u2019s just constantly joking and laughing and carrying on. It\u2019s just his personality, but I think the grandmother was probably offended by that, and she contacted the chief ranger and probably chewed him out.\u201d\n\nBecause of her call, the chief called a department meeting, and told everyone that no matter how strange a case may seem, it\u2019s real to the person making the call, and every case was to be investigated as such, even if responding officers didn\u2019t believe it. And then, Milford said, the chief looked over at him and Dover and said they were going to oversee these cases and manage them.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as us being assigned to it, we weren\u2019t sitting over there raising our hands to be the Navajo \u2018X Files\u2019 or whatever. That wasn\u2019t the case. We were assigned to do it, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nMilford said the idea to include the origin story into his memoir was inspired by a case in 2009 of a haunting he investigated in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt was an office space, and the director had said \u2018my staff are experiencing all kinds of what they\u2019re describing as paranormal phenomena.\u2019 She approached the chief ranger at the time and asked if he had anybody that could come in and validate any of the stuff that they were claiming,\u201d he said. \u201cI put together a team of four individuals. We went in on two nights, and one of the prominent things about that case was coins would materialize and fall out of nothingness, out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnd even after all this time, he said the coins appearing followed him: \u201cLast month, I had the most coins that I\u2019ve ever experienced ... this phenomenon still happens to me to this very day. Witnessing that with your own eyes, it really changes your worldview.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize that, like with the Navajo, in their creation story, they talk about this idea of coming through these different worlds into the physical world that we\u2019re in right now. Some of them describe either four worlds or five worlds, depending on the version of it. It got me thinking that, like with these coins, these coins are manifesting in our physical world from somewhere else. It got me to thinking about string theory and the idea of other planes of existence or dimensions.\u201d\n\nMilford said he starting thinking even further about different paranormal phenomenon that people refer to, \u201clike Bigfoot and UFOs and extraterrestrials, even the witchcraft, even the skinwalkers and things like that. I think they use the these other dimensions coming and going into our physical world from these other dimensions. That\u2019s how we experience it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn and I lived in the woods at times, being Navajo Rangers right in the heavily forested high mountain areas, and we did not find the evidence that supports these things live out there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can find all of that with bears, mountain lions, cougars, coyotes and everything that lives out there. You can see where it beds down. You can see where it goes out and hunts and drinks. You can find all of that evidence of that ... but the thing with the Bigfoot, you don\u2019t see all of that evidence, although twice I\u2019ve witnessed this thing that people refer to as Bigfoot. And so I know that these things do happen, and they do exist. So it could interdimensional.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s had his share of people who don\u2019t believe in what he\u2019s seen and believes, Milford said the key is to be open-minded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have people that are going to take the opposite 180 view from what you\u2019re talking about, and I understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message that John and I are conveying out there is much more important than listening to those people that are going to put it down. And John and I are open minded; we were very open minded. I remember one time we presented in Dulce, New Mexico, at one other UFO thing. There was an elderly Native woman that came up to us. She was in her mid 80s, and she came up to us with tears in her eyes and hugged us after we did our presentation. She said, \u2018Thank you for doing what you do.\u2019 She went on to convey a story about when she was a young girl encountering her UFO and her family members are standing around her with their jaws wide open because she never, ever shared that experience with them. I think, out of fear of being ridiculed or shunned, or whatever it might be, she never shared that experience. She thanked us and she said, you\u2019re giving people that have these experiences more or less a forum to be able to come together and share these experiences with like-minded people that are willing to listen.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s really, ultimately what the book is: to let people know that these experiences do happen, and to be respectful of others that do have these experiences, and letting people know these people aren\u2019t crazy, and they\u2019re not alone. And I would dare to say worldwide, if you looked at every family on this planet, if you looked in the history of their family, there\u2019s probably somebody within that family that has had some type of so-called supernatural or paranormal experience, whether it\u2019s seeing UFOs and lights in the sky or hauntings. I think it\u2019s much more common than we could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nkatie@durangoherald.com"

But if you stuck a powerful enough microphone in the soil, you\u2019d be surprised at how hopping it is, acoustically speaking. That has led some microbiologists to wonder: Are there sounds that actually encourage microorganisms to grow? And could serenading a fungus make it twist and shout?\n\nThe answer, published in a study on Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters, is yes. Playing sound to Trichoderma harzianum, a green microscopic fungus that defends tree roots from pathogens, led to growth rates seven times as fast as those of fungus grown in the sound of silence. If the laboratory findings can be replicated in nature, then sound could be an unexpected new tool for improving the health of forests, encouraging beneficial microbes to take root and thrive.\n\nIn recent years, scientists have put microphones in environments of all kinds, including tropical trees and coral reefs. In the process, they have discovered that an environment\u2019s sound can be linked to its biodiversity \u2014 often, the more complex the soundscape, the more diverse and healthy the inhabitants.\n\nResearch also shows that playing the sounds of intact ecosystems can help damaged ones recover. Off the coast of Adelaide, Australia, for instance, scientists found that the recorded sounds of healthy oyster reefs could lure new oyster larvae to areas destroyed by overfishing."

        "article_content": "When Also Capital managing partner Mike Annunziata walks around New York City these days, he sees lots of vans \u2014 and opportunity.\n\nIt\u2019s something he admits he never noticed until he met former SpaceX engineer Sam Shapiro, who is the founder of a new Detroit-based modular electric RV startup called Grounded.\n\nSometimes, Annunziata told TechCrunch, \u201cyou don\u2019t realize how how prevalent something is until you start to think about it, and then you see it everywhere.\u201d\n\nWhen Shapiro founded Grounded in 2022, he initially set out to customize electric Transit vans from Ford for recreational outdoor use. A year later, he began upfitting General Motors\u2019 BrightDrop vans, which are bigger and have more range. Shaprio told TechCrunch in an interview that Grounded has already logged sales in the double digits of the $200,000 RVs, accounting for around $3 million in revenue.\n\nBut Shapiro wants Grounded to be more than just an electric RV provider for the well-off. He says Grounded has received a lot of inbound interest from small businesses that want custom-designed vans for services like mobile medicine, pet grooming, food transport, and more.\n\nThe commercial opportunity is one of the driving factors that sparked investor interest. Also Capital and Chicago-based early-stage firm The 81 Collection announced Friday that they\u2019ve led a $3.5 million pre-seed funding round for Grounded.\n\nNow when Annunziata sees those vans, he thinks: \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re coming for this. We\u2019re gonna make it.\u201d\n\nShapiro told TechCrunch in a separate interview that Grounded is already trialing a van in Honolulu for the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Hawaii, as well as one geared toward making deliveries for a logistics startup in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\u201cA lot of those industries and customers want to go electric for all the same reasons of [lower] long-term maintenance costs, yeah, and the sustainability angle. And it just happened that the modular system we developed originally for the RV customer just sort of automatically worked, almost out of the box for some of these other verticals,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything just sort of becomes like optional Lego blocks.\u201d\n\nShapiro noted that there are already some pretty big aftermarket companies that do custom upfitting, oftentimes working closely with the automakers they\u2019re sourcing the vehicles from. But he says there\u2019s a \u201chuge, long tail\u201d of smaller players that is pretty fragmented.\n\nHe believes Grounded\u2019s advantage will be the modular system it has designed \u2014 which it describes as \u201cLego-like\u201d \u2014 that lets it custom design vans for drastically different verticals. It\u2019s doing all this work at a 13,000 square foot warehouse around the corner from its headquarters inside Newlab, the mobility startup incubator located in Detroit\u2019s Michigan Central.\n\nDespite some of the recent hesitance to invest in hard tech, Annunziata said he prefers it; Also Capital\u2019s portfolio includes a number of space startups like Varda Space Industries, Radiant, and K2 Space. As he evaluated Grounded, he looked for the qualities he has found valuable at those other startups, like a strong founding team and \u201can exceptional engineering culture.\u201d He added that he highly regards Shapiro\u2019s background and his drive and called the investment a \u201cno brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality is, I think it takes a truly exceptional human with a long-term vision that everybody aligns with to get [funding] rounds done today,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Sam meets that bar and exceeds it by a lot.\u201d"
