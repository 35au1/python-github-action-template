            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

            "article_content": "In the vast skies over Wyoming, things aren\u2019t always as they seem. That\u2019s why the Cowboy State is one of the best places to see and possibly explain the unexplainable.\n\nThe National UFO Center keeps records of every sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reported in the United States since 1995.\n\nThe website Stacker used that data to compile a list of the top 10 with the most reports of strange, inexplainable sights in the night sky.\n\nThe world of UFO and UAP sightings has gotten more serious in the last several years, and more people are looking up and looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI can tell you is that quite a few sightings in Wyoming remain unexplained,\u201d said Richard Beckwith, Rock Springs city attorney and part-time UFO investigator.\n\nHe\u2019s spent decades investigating UFO sightings in Wyoming, but had his first personal experience with one spotted near Green River earlier in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is real,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the Pentagon has admitted UFOs and UAFs are real, and they can\u2019t explain them. It was treated as a joke for most of the time I\u2019ve been doing it, and now it\u2019s become real.\u201d\n\nThe List\n\nOverall, the National UFO Center has 421 reports of UFOs and UAFs in Wyoming. Cheyenne tops the list of Wyoming places with the most sightings, reporting 50 aerial phenomena since 1995.\n\nSeeing Cheyenne at the top doesn\u2019t surprise Beckwith at all. One would expect more sightings in Wyoming\u2019s most populated city, but Cheyenne is also home to a critical U.S. Air Force base.\n\n\u201cWyoming\u2019s UFO sightings, from my perspective, primarily appear over the Warren Air Force Base and the nearby missile silos,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been quite a few sightings, going back to the 1950s.\u201d\n\nCasper is second with 37 UFO sightings, followed by Laramie with 29, Rock Springs with 17 and Gillette with 15. Cody, Sheridan, Riverton and Evanston round out the bottom half of the list.\n\nYellowstone National Park sits at the bottom with eight UFO sightings. Sasquatch isn\u2019t the only elusive and mysterious thing hanging around the pristine wilderness of northwest Wyoming.\n\nThe state that\u2019s seen and reported the most UFOs is California, with more than 16,500 sightings. The Pentagon attributes most of these sightings to balloons, drones, aircraft and other terrestrial sources.\n\nOne thing Wyomingites won\u2019t want to do is try to shoot down any UFOs they spot. If that UFO happens to be a neighbor\u2019s drone, that would violate federal law and could come with a fine and a jail sentence .\n\nNot Explaining The Unexplainable\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that the number of sightings corresponds with Wyoming\u2019s most populated areas. Beckwith said that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, but that doesn\u2019t make these phenomena any easier to explain.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, we had the simple explanation that these were aliens from another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the longer I\u2019ve done this, the explanations have become more elusive. It\u2019s much more complex than that.\u201d\n\nModern-day theories for UFOs and UAP include black technology programs, foreign espionage and astronomical events in addition to the extraterrestrial. If there are any probable explanations for what\u2019s been seen over Wyoming and elsewhere, the federal government has declined to comment or elaborate.\n\n\u201cThey continue to say emphatically that we have no evidence that these objects are extraterrestrial in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThat begs the question \u2014 if they can\u2019t explain it, how can they determine that these objects are also simultaneously not manufactured elsewhere? It's almost like, \u2018Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecently, there have been three congressional hearings on UFOs and UAFs, and Beckwith said he\u2019s spoken with two members of U.S. Congress about the phenomenon. Wyoming scientists are skeptical of their findings, but Beckwith described it as one of the rare bipartisan issues that has reached Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople who looked at this phenomenon were ridiculed about this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed since 2017, now that the government has admitted they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\nWyoming Watchers\n\nBeckwith is one of four Wyoming field investigators for the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of civilian volunteers that follow up on and report UFO and UAF sightings. The number of investigators shows Beckwith how much interest has grown for these unexplainable phenomena in the last decade.\n\n\u201cI have investigators in Cheyenne, Riverton, and two in Rock Springs that investigate sightings all over the state,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil a couple of years ago, I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBeckwith described his first experience with a UFO back in March. He used his Sony SR4 camera to capture a video of \u201canomalous nocturnal lights\u201d hovering near Green River.\n\n\u201cI got the radar records from that night, but haven\u2019t been able to correlate what I saw with any particular targets on the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly didn't have a transponder. So, to that extent, I can't explain it. But I saw and filmed it.\u201d\n\nBeckwith hopes more Wyomingites will report any UFO or UAF sightings to the National UFO Center or the Mutual UFO Network. Regardless of what people believe they've seen in the sky, he and many others want answers.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of space and open sky in Wyoming. Beckwith believes the Cowboy State could be the key to getting better data and information to shine more light into the darkness surrounding UFOs and UAFs.\n\n\u201cWyoming is the ninth-largest state in land area, and we have the lowest population,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, we have sightings with several witnesses in different locations. They\u2019re rarer than other places, but they still occur.\u201d\n\nAndrew Rossi can be reached at arossi@cowboystatedaily.com."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s a weird time to be a UFO enthusiast \u2014 especially one who finds lights in the sky inspiring rather than frightening. As real-life conspiracy theories flourish and big screen space horror is set lightyears away, I find myself contextualizing my UFO feelings in a surprisingly rural story. To me, the quintessential UFO horror movie is M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s 2002 film Signs.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nSigns is a sci-fi thriller set on a farm in rural Pennsylvania, starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix as brothers Graham and Merrill Hess. For what it\u2019s worth, if you haven\u2019t seen this movie you may still be familiar with the parody Scary Movie 3. However, if you\u2019re around my age you may also remember Signs as the first time you consciously thought of UFOs as frightening rather than fascinating. The movie tells an original story while still playing with the archetypal concept of UFOs in American pop culture.\n\nThe movie begins by tackling a hot topic in the Ufology community: crop circles. In real life, these have mostly been debunked as pranks, contrivances or environmental coincidences, and in the movie the Hess family brushes them off first as well. Instead, the beginning of the movie focuses on their family struggles \u2014 Graham was an Episcopal priest until his wife died in a car crash about six months ago, and he lost his faith. Merrill\u2019s minor league baseball career stopped short and now he is here on the farm trying to help his brother, niece and nephew all process their grief.\n\nIn the midst of this, crop circles begin to take over the mainstream news, and they get harder and harder for Graham and Merrill to ignore. The brothers begin to see strange figures appearing in their field but they\u2019re unable to catch them. They also hear odd, inhuman noises through a baby monitor. Before they know it, a worldwide alien invasion is underway.\n\nAside from the Hess brothers, the key cast members are Graham\u2019s son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin). They are also visited by their friend and local police officer Caroline Paski (Cherry Jones) and their neighbor Ray Reddy, who is played by Shyamalan himself. Behind the scenes, the credits were stacked as well \u2014 producers included Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Sam Mercer.\n\nSigns was filmed in Pennsylvania on a budget of $72 million, and was considered a box office success with an international gross of over $408 million. It was Shyamalan\u2019s second-biggest earner at the time behind The Sixth Sense. The movie also sold well on VHS and DVD, and is beloved by film buffs for its extensive bonus content including deleted scenes, documentary featurettes and storyboards. This movie alone earned nearly $35 million in DVD rental revenue between January and March of 2003.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Signs has a 75 percent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.9 out of 10 among 240 trusted critics. Those that loved the film praised its pacing, suspense and jump scares while those who disliked it questioned its approach to collective terror in the wake if the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That last issue may be part of the reason Signs has seemed to age well \u2014 when its allowed to be considered outside of that context, it feels more authentic.\n\nAs for its take on the aliens themselves, Signs is far from the scariest. However, it does what other space horrors fail to do in making the danger feel close to home \u2014 like it could happen to you just as you leave the theater. The logical part of my mind knows I\u2019d have a better chance against the creatures from Signs than I would against that thing from Alien: Romulus, yet the emotional response comes from seeing the alien in an earthly home rather than a distant space station.\n\nSome viewers complain that the ending of Signs is abrupt and contrived. Without spoiling anything, I can say I hope the headlines about drone sightings and military UAP disclosures turn out to have simple endings as well. At the time of this writing, Signs is not available on any subscription-based streamers, but it is on PVOD stores as well as physical media."

            "article_content": "> Tech\n\nA viral video reshared by Myra Moore, who goes by \u2018The Paranormal Chic\u2019 on social media, shows several beings brooding over the canopy of clouds.\n\nThe entities captured on film by a passenger on a commercial airline show them casting shadows as well, sparking curiosity among netizens. At the cursory glance, the video doesn\u2019t appear to be digitally altered or produced with any AI tools. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there,\u201d the narrator quipped. Humans cannot (if it isn\u2019t obvious) stand on clouds. They cannot stand over a sea of clouds either without some mechanism involving the modern technological marvel of parachutes, gliders, or planes. Are there entities out there? Or the aliens are just being too brazenly out in the open now? Or is there a sinister supernatural angle to the story?\n\nEven as the Internet debated, the mystery was quickly solved by online sleuths who presented evidence debunking the claim that the alleged beings on the video are sentients. Others took hilarious jibes on the video. Meanwhile, a few netizens shared similar shots from their own travels earlier. Per some, the figures are nothing but cloud stakes or pillar formations that stand out of the fluffy layer. A few suggested that these could also be smoke released from factory chimneys.\n\nMost likely industrial stacks pushing up warm moist air through the cloud bank.

            "article_content": "Viral Video: A new video circulating on social media has ignited wild speculation and widespread curiosity, as a mysterious sighting captured by a passenger on a commercial flight is stirring up online chatter. The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

The footage, showing shadowy figures in the clouds, has left viewers both intrigued and baffled, fueling debates across the internet.The video, shot by a passenger in a commercial plane, first shows, what seems like, two human beings standing on a cloud. Not just that, the camera then pans to show several such human-like shapes standing on clouds. The clip was posted by Myra Moore, a content creator who identifies as a paranormal expert and has since received about 5 million views. The caption of the post reads as follows, \u201cA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?\u201dIn the video, Myra explains that the video was shot by a passenger on a plane. \u201cThey were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture,\u201d she continued.Reacting to the post, one user commented, \u201cThis is crazy, is that aliens or humans in the cloud?\" However, some were a little more skeptical, \u201cWhy does the person with the camera keep panning around? Why can't they focus on those \"people\" and see if they move or see what they are doing?\u201d Some even straight-up called this a creation of AI, \u201cEveryone is getting fooled so hard by AI! If you haven\u2019t seen it in the last 30-40 years, then it\u2019s probably AI!\u201dOne user in the comment section reasoned that maybe what one can see in the video is an interplay of light, shadows, and human imagination. The human mind tries to find patterns and assigns meaning to random shapes\u2014a phenomenon known as pareidolia, where we see familiar forms, such as faces or figures, in otherwise abstract visuals. It is thus suggested, to not spread fear based on such videos until they are not authenticated."

            "article_content": "Scientists have demonstrated that atoms can exhibit wave-like behavior, challenging long-held assumptions that experiments of this nature were impossible and opening new doors in quantum physics. The experiment uses atoms and a one-atom-thick graphene sheet to recreate a classic quantum phenomenon: Particle diffraction.\n\nThis research could pave the way for revolutionary technologies, including highly sensitive gravitational wave detectors. The story begins several decades ago, in 1927, when physicist George Paget Thomson revealed that electrons, when passed through a crystal grating, produce a diffraction pattern\u2014a hallmark of wave-like behavior.\n\nThomson\u2019s discovery not only earned him a Nobel Prize but also fueled advancements such as the electron microscope. For nearly a century, scientists have sought to replicate this diffraction effect in an impossible experiment with atoms. However, traditional methods required specially engineered gratings with relatively large gaps, limiting the sensitivity of the resulting patterns.\n\nImage source: aapsky / Adobe\n\nThe crux of the issue was that using a crystal grating for atoms was deemed impossible because high-energy atoms, necessary for the process, were expected to damage the crystal. However, researchers at the German Aerospace Center have now achieved the seemingly impossible.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Remarkably, after 100 hours of exposure, the graphene showed no damage, and a distinct circular diffraction pattern was recorded. This experiment marks the first successful demonstration of atomic diffraction through a crystal grating.\n\nThe secret lies in the energy dynamics of the atoms. By exchanging energy with graphene atoms undetectably, the atoms retained their quantum wave properties. Bill Allison from the University of Cambridge explains this phenomenon with a vivid analogy: it\u2019s like opening and closing a door silently in a crowded room\u2014no one knows which door was used, preserving the wave-like behavior.\n\nThe implications are profound. This discovery could lead to the development of atomic interferometers with unmatched sensitivity, potentially detecting gravitational waves beyond the capability of current technology. Scientists are optimistic about the potential applications of atomic diffraction, hailing the experiment as a bold leap forward in quantum research.\n\nThis achievement not only redefines what\u2019s possible in quantum mechanics but also highlights the ever-evolving nature of science, where seemingly insurmountable challenges inspire innovations that shape the future."

            "article_content": "The largest site of dinosaur tracks ever discovered in England has paleontologists excited for what they can learn about how the prehistoric creatures lived. About 200 huge dinosaur footprints \u2014 made in the Jurassic period, more than 160 million years ago \u2014 have been found so far in a quarry in Oxfordshire, northwest of London.\n\nA worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \"dinosaur highway\" and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.\n\nThe extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June 2024 expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.\n\n\"These footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\" said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.\n\nFour of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 18 metres in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious nine-metre predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.\n\nA view of a dinosaur footprint uncovered on five extensive trackways that formed part of a 'dinosaur highway,' found at Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, England, is seen in this undated photo provided on Thursday by Oxford University Museum of Natural History and the University of Birmingham. (Emma Nicholls/Oxford University Museum of Natural History via The Associated Press)\n\n\"When we have footprints ... we have a snapshot, a moment in the life of an animal. And we can see that animal walking across a surface, so we can understand exactly what the environment in which that animal lived was like,\" said Richard Butler, paleobiologist at the University of Birmingham, speaking to CBC's As It Happens guest host Stephanie Skenderis.\n\n\"We can also understand things like how it was walking, how fast it was walking. Potentially when we have somewhere like this site where we have lots of different trackways, we might start to understand something about behaviour.\"\n\nUniversity of Birmingham professor Kirsty Edgar stands beside a trackway made by a sauropod, a giant long-necked plant-eating dinosaur. (Richard Butler/University of Birmingham)\n\nAn area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.\n\n\"Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.\n\nThe group that worked at the site last summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.\n\nThe excavation team digs out intersecting trackways at Dewars Farm. (University of Birmingham)\n\n\"[If] you walk along the beach yourself today and leave footprints behind you, they're going to be gone by the end of the day,\" Butler said.\n\n\"But, of course, what happened in this case was something unusual. Probably a large storm came and dumped a whole load of sediments over the top of the footprints soon after they formed, and that buried them and that allowed them to be preserved. And that is the kind of thing that might only happen once every thousand years.\"\n\nThe findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's Digging for Britain program next week."

But seven months later, this feature has yet to see the light of day.\n\nCalled Media Manager, the tool would \u201cidentify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video,\u201d OpenAI said at the time, to reflect creators\u2019 preferences \u201cacross multiple sources.\u201d It was intended to stave off some of the company\u2019s fiercest critics, and potentially shield OpenAI from IP-related legal challenges.\n\nBut people familiar tell TechCrunch that the tool was rarely viewed as an important launch internally. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a priority,\u201d one former OpenAI employee said. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it.\u201d\n\nA non-employee who coordinates work with the company told TechCrunch in December that they had discussed the tool with OpenAI in the past, but that there haven\u2019t been any recent updates. (These people declined to be publicly identified discussing confidential business matters.)\n\nAnd a member of OpenAI\u2019s legal team who was working on Media Manager, Fred von Lohmann, transitioned to a part-time consultant role in October. OpenAI PR confirmed Von Lohmann\u2019s move to TechCrunch via email.\n\nOpenAI has yet to give an update on Media Manager\u2019s progress, and the company missed a self-imposed deadline to have the tool in place \u201cby 2025.\u201d (To be clear, \u201cby 2025\u201d could be read as inclusive of the year 2025, but TechCrunch interpreted OpenAI\u2019s language to mean leading up to January 1, 2025.)\n\nIP issues\n\nAI models like OpenAI\u2019s learn patterns in sets of data to make predictions \u2014 for instance, that a person biting into a burger will leave a bite mark. This allows models to learn how the world works, to a degree, by observing it. ChatGPT can write convincing emails and essays, while Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, can create relatively realistic footage.\n\nThe ability to draw on examples of writing, film, and more to generate new works makes AI incredibly powerful. But it\u2019s also regurgitative. When prompted in a certain way, models \u2014 most of which are trained on countless web pages, videos, and images \u2014 produce near-copies of that data, which despite being \u201cpublicly available,\u201d are not meant to be used this way.\n\nFor example, Sora can generate clips featuring TikTok\u2019s logo and popular video game characters. The New York Times has gotten ChatGPT to quote its articles verbatim (OpenAI blamed the behavior on a \u201chack\u201c).\n\nThis has understandably upset creators whose works have been swept up in AI training without their permission. Many have lawyered up.\n\nOpenAI is fighting class action lawsuits filed by artists, writers, YouTubers, computer scientists, and news organizations, all of whom claim the startup trained on their works illegally. Plaintiffs include authors Sarah Silverman and Ta Nehisi-Coates, visual artists, and media conglomerates like The New York Times and Radio-Canada, to name a few.\n\nOpenAI has pursued licensing deals with select partners, but not all creators see the terms as attractive.\n\nManaging media\n\nOpenAI offers creators several ad hoc ways to \u201copt out\u201d of its AI training. Last September, the company launched a submission form to allow artists to flag their work for removal from its future training sets. And OpenAI has long let webmasters block its web-crawling bots from scraping data across their domains.\n\nBut creators have criticized these methods as haphazard and inadequate. There aren\u2019t specific opt-out mechanisms for written works, videos, or audio recordings. And the opt-out form for images requires submitting a copy of each image to be removed along with a description, an onerous process.\n\nMedia Manager was pitched as a complete revamp \u2014 and expansion \u2014 of OpenAI\u2019s opt-out solutions today.\n\nIn the announcement post in May, OpenAI said that Media Manager would use \u201ccutting-edge machine learning research\u201d to enable creators and content owners to \u201ctell [OpenAI] what they own.\u201d OpenAI, which claimed it was collaborating with regulators as it developed the tool, said that it hoped Media Manager would \u201cset a standard across the AI industry.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has never publicly mentioned Media Manager since.\n\nA spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tool was \u201cstill in development\u201d as of August, but didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up request for comment in mid-December.\n\nOpenAI has given no indication as to when Media Manager might launch \u2014 or even which features and capabilities it might launch with.\n\nFair use\n\nAssuming Media Manager does arrive at some point, experts aren\u2019t convinced that it will allay creators\u2019 concerns \u2014 or do much to resolve the legal questions surrounding AI and IP usage.\n\nAdrian Cyhan, an IP attorney at Stubbs Alderton & Markiles, noted that Media Manager as described is an ambitious undertaking. Even platforms as large as YouTube and TikTok struggle with content ID at scale. Could OpenAI really do better?\n\n\u201cEnsuring compliance with legally required creator protections and potential compensation requirements under consideration presents challenges,\u201d Cyhan told TechCrunch, \u201cespecially given the rapidly-evolving and potentially divergent legal landscape across national and local jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nEd Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that certifies AI companies are respecting creators\u2019 rights, believes that Media Manager would unfairly shift the burden of controlling AI training onto creators; by not using it, they arguably could be giving tacit approval for their works to be used. \u201cMost creators will never even hear about it, let alone use it,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cBut it will nevertheless be used to defend the mass exploitation of creative work against creators\u2019 wishes.\u201d\n\nMike Borella, co-chair of MBHB\u2019s AI practice group, pointed out that opt-out systems don\u2019t always account for transformations that might be made to a work, like an image that\u2019s been downsampled. They also might not address the all-to-common scenario of third-party platforms hosting copies of creators\u2019 content, added Joshua Weigensberg, an IP and media lawyer for Pryor Cashman.\n\n\u201cCreators and copyright owners do not control, and often do not even know, where their works appear on the internet,\u201d Weigensberg said. \u201cEven if a creator tells every single AI platform that they are opting out of training, those companies may well still go ahead and train on copies of their works available on third-party websites and services.\u201d\n\nMedia Manager might not even be especially advantageous for OpenAI, at least from a jurisprudential standpoint. Evan Everist, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney specializing in copyright law, said that while OpenAI could use the tool to show a judge it\u2019s mitigating its training on IP-protected content, Media Manager likely wouldn\u2019t shield the company from damages if it was found to have infringed.\n\n\u201cCopyright owners do not have an obligation to go out and preemptively tell others not to infringe their works before that infringement occurs,\u201d Everist said. \u201cThe basics of copyright law still apply \u2014 i.e., don\u2019t take and copy other people\u2019s stuff without permission. This feature may be more about PR and positioning OpenAI as an ethical user of content.\u201d\n\nA reckoning\n\nIn the absence of Media Manager, OpenAI has implemented filters \u2014 albeit imperfect ones \u2014 to prevent its models from regurgitating training examples. And in the lawsuits it\u2019s battling, the company continues to claim fair use protections, asserting that its models create transformative, not plagiaristic, works.\n\nOpenAI could well prevail in its copyright disputes.\n\nThe courts may decide that the company\u2019s AI has a \u201ctransformative purpose,\u201d following the precedent set roughly a decade ago in the publishing industry\u2019s suit against Google. In that case, a court held that Google\u2019s copying of millions of books for Google Books, a sort of digital archive, was permissible.\n\nOpenAI has said publicly that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train competitive AI models without using copyrighted materials \u2014 authorized or no. \u201cLimiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today\u2019s citizens,\u201d the company wrote in a January submission to the U.K.\u2019s House of Lords.\n\nShould courts eventually declare OpenAI victorious, Media Manager wouldn\u2019t serve much of a legal purpose. OpenAI seems to be willing to make that bet \u2014 or to reconsider its opt-out strategy.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday."

            "article_content": "#OpenAI #PublicBenefitCorporation #BCorp #SocialImpact OpenAI announced on the 27th that it will transition its for-profit entity into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) by 2025. Industry experts view this move as a \"defining moment\" for the AI sector. Competitors in the AI space, such as Anthropic and xAI (founded by Elon Musk), are already PBCs. In other industries, notable PBCs include Patagonia, Kickstarter, Lemonade (a publicly traded company), and Veeva Systems (also publicly traded). They are B Corps as well. The PBC structure was created as a legal framework stemming from the private sector's social responsibility movement, B Corporations (B Corps). In the U.S., all B Corps are required to transition to PBC status within a certain timeframe after obtaining B Corp certification. Unlike traditional corporations that focus solely on maximizing financial returns, PBCs are required by their charters to pursue both shareholder profits and stakeholder benefits. This structure offers protection from lawsuits driven by activist investors or those pressuring for profit maximization. Additionally, PBCs are mandated to publish social impact reports every two years. It will be interesting to see how OpenAI concretizes its social impact in this new framework. As a Public Benefit Corporation, what path will OpenAI take going forward? This decision is likely to inspire many AI startups to seriously consider adopting the PBC or B Corp model. While PBC as a legal entity does not yet exist in South Korea, we may soon see domestic AI startups aspiring to become B Corps. As MYSC, a certified B Corp, this development is particularly exciting and resonates deeply with our mission. OpenAI's transition to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) sets a powerful precedent that aligns with the values we champion\u2014balancing profit and purpose while driving social impact. It also opens up new possibilities for fostering global collaboration and inspiring more organizations, including startups and corporates, to embrace these progressive frameworks. Looking forward to seeing how this movement evolves and contributes to a more sustainable and inclusive future! \ud83c\udf31 I plan to share a more detailed analysis and outlook through an upcoming column."

            "article_content": "An app's performance is key to make users want to use it, say Meta engineers Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson. This includes making the app lightning-fast, battery-efficient, and reliable across a range of devices and connectivity conditions.\n\nTo improve Threads performance, Meta engineers measured how fast the app launches, how easy it is to post a photo or video, how often it crashes, and how many bug reports people filed. To this aim, they defined a number of metrics: frustrating image-render experience (FIRE), time-to-network content (TTNC), and creation-publish success rate (cPSR).\n\nFIRE is the percentage of people who experience a frustrating image-render experience, which may lead to them leaving the app while the image is rendering across the network. Roughly, FIRE is defined as the quotient of the number of users leaving the app before an image is fully rendered by the sum of all users attempting to display that image. Measuring this metric allows Threads developers to detect any regressions in how images are loading for users.\n\nTime-to-network content (TTNC) is roughly the time required for the app to launch and display the user's feed. Long loading time is another experience killer that may lead users to abandon the app. Reducing the app's binary size is paramount to keeping the binary small:\n\nEvery time someone tries to commit code to Threads, they\u2019re alerted if that code change would increase our app\u2019s binary size above a configured threshold.\n\nAdditionally, they removed unnecessary code and graphics assets from the app bundle, resulting in a binary one-quarter the size of Instagram.\n\nAs to navigation latency, this is possibly even more critical than launch time. Meta engineers carried through A/B tests to find out that:\n\nWith the smallest latency injection, the impact was small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app.\n\nTo ensure that no changes cause a regression in navigation latency, Meta engineers created SLATE, a logger system that tracks relevant events like triggers of a new navigation, the UI being built, activity spinners, and content from the network or an error being displayed.\n\nIt\u2019s implemented using a set of common components that are the foundation for a lot of our UI and a system that measures performance by setting \u201cmarkers\u201d in code for specific events. Typically these markers are created with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nCreation-publish success rate (cPSR) measures how likely it is for an user to successfully complete the process of posting some content. On iOS, posting a video or large photo is especially tricky, since the user could background the app after posting their content without waiting for the upload to complete, in which case the app may be terminated by the OS.\n\nHere, the approach taken by Meta was aimed at improving the user experience in those cases when posting failed. This was accomplished by introducing a new feature, called Drafts, to allow users to manage failed posts in more flexible ways instead of just providing the option to retry or abort the operation.\n\nWe discovered that 26 percent fewer people submitted bug reports about posting if they had Drafts. The feature was clearly making a difference.\n\nAnother approach was trying to reduce perceived latency, as opposed to absolute latency, showing a request has been received when the data upload completes but before it\u2019s been processed and published.\n\nLast but not least, Meta engineers saw a great improvement in app stability after they adopted Swift's complete concurrency, which, they say, does a great job at preventing data races and reducing hard-to-debug problems caused by data races."

            "article_content": "Scientists have demonstrated that atoms can exhibit wave-like behavior, challenging long-held assumptions that experiments of this nature were impossible and opening new doors in quantum physics. The experiment uses atoms and a one-atom-thick graphene sheet to recreate a classic quantum phenomenon: Particle diffraction.\n\nThis research could pave the way for revolutionary technologies, including highly sensitive gravitational wave detectors. The story begins several decades ago, in 1927, when physicist George Paget Thomson revealed that electrons, when passed through a crystal grating, produce a diffraction pattern\u2014a hallmark of wave-like behavior.\n\nThomson\u2019s discovery not only earned him a Nobel Prize but also fueled advancements such as the electron microscope. For nearly a century, scientists have sought to replicate this diffraction effect in an impossible experiment with atoms. However, traditional methods required specially engineered gratings with relatively large gaps, limiting the sensitivity of the resulting patterns.\n\nImage source: aapsky / Adobe\n\nThe crux of the issue was that using a crystal grating for atoms was deemed impossible because high-energy atoms, necessary for the process, were expected to damage the crystal. However, researchers at the German Aerospace Center have now achieved the seemingly impossible.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nThey\u2019ve directed high-energy helium and hydrogen atoms at a graphene sheet\u2014a single layer of carbon atoms. Remarkably, after 100 hours of exposure, the graphene showed no damage, and a distinct circular diffraction pattern was recorded. This experiment marks the first successful demonstration of atomic diffraction through a crystal grating.\n\nThe secret lies in the energy dynamics of the atoms. By exchanging energy with graphene atoms undetectably, the atoms retained their quantum wave properties. Bill Allison from the University of Cambridge explains this phenomenon with a vivid analogy: it\u2019s like opening and closing a door silently in a crowded room\u2014no one knows which door was used, preserving the wave-like behavior.\n\nThe implications are profound. This discovery could lead to the development of atomic interferometers with unmatched sensitivity, potentially detecting gravitational waves beyond the capability of current technology. Scientists are optimistic about the potential applications of atomic diffraction, hailing the experiment as a bold leap forward in quantum research.\n\nThis achievement not only redefines what\u2019s possible in quantum mechanics but also highlights the ever-evolving nature of science, where seemingly insurmountable challenges inspire innovations that shape the future."

            "article_content": "The largest site of dinosaur tracks ever discovered in England has paleontologists excited for what they can learn about how the prehistoric creatures lived. About 200 huge dinosaur footprints \u2014 made in the Jurassic period, more than 160 million years ago \u2014 have been found so far in a quarry in Oxfordshire, northwest of London.\n\nA worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \"dinosaur highway\" and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.\n\nThe extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June 2024 expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.\n\n\"These footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\" said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.\n\nFour of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 18 metres in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious nine-metre predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.\n\nA view of a dinosaur footprint uncovered on five extensive trackways that formed part of a 'dinosaur highway,' found at Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, England, is seen in this undated photo provided on Thursday by Oxford University Museum of Natural History and the University of Birmingham. (Emma Nicholls/Oxford University Museum of Natural History via The Associated Press)\n\n\"When we have footprints ... we have a snapshot, a moment in the life of an animal. And we can see that animal walking across a surface, so we can understand exactly what the environment in which that animal lived was like,\" said Richard Butler, paleobiologist at the University of Birmingham, speaking to CBC's As It Happens guest host Stephanie Skenderis.\n\n\"We can also understand things like how it was walking, how fast it was walking. Potentially when we have somewhere like this site where we have lots of different trackways, we might start to understand something about behaviour.\"\n\nUniversity of Birmingham professor Kirsty Edgar stands beside a trackway made by a sauropod, a giant long-necked plant-eating dinosaur. (Richard Butler/University of Birmingham)\n\nAn area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.\n\n\"Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.\n\nThe group that worked at the site last summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.\n\nThe excavation team digs out intersecting trackways at Dewars Farm. (University of Birmingham)\n\n\"[If] you walk along the beach yourself today and leave footprints behind you, they're going to be gone by the end of the day,\" Butler said.\n\n\"But, of course, what happened in this case was something unusual. Probably a large storm came and dumped a whole load of sediments over the top of the footprints soon after they formed, and that buried them and that allowed them to be preserved. And that is the kind of thing that might only happen once every thousand years.\"\n\nThe findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's Digging for Britain program next week."

In terms of departure from normal temperatures, the coldest weather will actually be south of us, but it will be plenty chilly here.\n\nA storm system that brought rain to the area the middle part of the week will be in northern Quebec at the same time a new massive ocean storm starts developing hundreds of miles to our east this weekend. This upper-level pattern is going to pull down much colder air than we saw at the end of December and the start of the new year.\n\nWith the new year and a new month upon us, our first weekend of January is looking calm and tranquil \u2014 although it will be cold. If you\u2019re looking to partake in outdoor activities, at least you won\u2019t have to worry about any snow or ice.\n\nTemperatures on Friday will be mostly in the 30s across New England. Boston Globe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriday will be the least cold day with temperatures reaching the mid- to upper 30s, but the wind will make it feel a lot colder. Morning wind chills will be in the upper teens to 20s.\n\nLook for highs only reaching around 30 degrees on Saturday and Sunday. The wind will continue to be gusty throughout the weekend, knocking wind chills back into the teens and perhaps even single digits first thing in the morning.\n\nWind chills on Saturday will keep temperatures feeling bitterly cold. Boston Globe\n\nHighs will hover around 30 degrees on Saturday in Boston. Boston Globe\n\nBoston should stick around 30 degrees on Sunday with colder temperatures north and west of the the city. Boston Globe\n\nThe cold will cause an icy layer on many lakes and ponds, although it will not be at its required 4 inches or greater depth for safety just yet. Older ice is also weaker, so we have to wait for the new ice to form and grow for the greatest support.\n\nSaturday morning will also mark something we call \u201cperihelion.\u201d This is when the Earth is at its closest to the sun as our planet follows its elliptical orbit orbit. This may seem counter-intuitive since it\u2019s the coldest time of the year, but the angle of the sun is much more important than the changing distance throughout the year.\n\nBut the good news is this weekend means our sunrises start getting earlier, so now we are gaining time in both the afternoon and the morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeekend breakdown\n\nSouthern New England: Look for breezy and cold conditions throughout the weekend with temperatures around 30 degrees, starting near 20 each morning.\n\nWestern Mass.: Look for partly the mostly cloudy skies this weekend with temperatures in the 20s. The winds will continue to be gusty especially in the afternoon both days.\n\nCape and Islands: Look for blustery conditions both Saturday and Sunday. Temperatures will reach near freezing but start in the 20s each morning.\n\nNorthern New England: Wind will be the main weather feature this weekend along with colder temperatures. Readings will be in the 20s during the day and single digits and teens at night."

            "article_content": "It's been a topsy-turvy year for Super Micro Computer (SMCI -1.41%). Once seen as the next big artificial intelligence (AI) stock, it has come crashing down to reality in recent months due to concerns about the reliability of its numbers and accounting controls.\n\nHowever, after hitting a low of $17.25 on Nov. 15 on concerns that it could get delisted from the Nasdaq exchange, the stock has rallied heavily, and recently traded at about $30. With a new auditor in place and a plan to file its financials (which are late) by February, investors appear to be much more at ease with the stock these days.\n\nBut while you might be tempted to buy into the rally, there's still significant risk here, and multiple reasons the stock could be due for a big pullback in 2025.\n\nIs Super Micro's growth rate starting to slow down?\n\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, the name of the game is growth. Super Micro has experienced significant demand for its servers and storage products as companies race to develop AI models.\n\nSince the company is still transitioning to a new auditor, it hasn't posted a full set of quarterly numbers since August. In November, however, the company did release preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30). What was a bit concerning is that Super Micro projects net sales to be within a range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion. That's considerably lower than its previous estimate, which projected sales of between $6 billion and $7 billion. These aren't final numbers, but it looks like a significant miss, and it raises questions about whether the business is seeing a slowdown in demand.\n\nEven if Super Micro does release its financials in a timely fashion, that doesn't mean that the results will necessarily be great or what investors will want to see. While $6 billion in sales would still represent an incredible increase of 183% year over year, the problem is that Super Micro's gross margins still remain incredibly low.\n\nGreater controls and procedures could squeeze Super Micro's thin profit margins\n\nTo alleviate concerns about accounting controls and procedures, it seems inevitable that Super Micro may need to hire more staff and spend money on implementing additional protocols to help maintain the accuracy and integrity of its financials.\n\nThat additional overhead could mean that Super Micro's profit margins will become even narrower. The tighter those margins are, the less benefit the company gets from any incremental dollar of revenue. In its preliminary numbers for Q1, Super Micro's gross margin was just 13.3%. While that's technically an improvement from the 11.2% it reported a quarter earlier, that's still dreadfully low -- and gross margin comes before overhead and other indirect expenses. The company's actual profit margin will be even narrower.\n\nThis will be the key metric that investors will want to focus on when Super Micro finally reports its full quarterly results -- what its profit margin looks like after factoring in all the changes it has made. If margins deteriorate significantly, that could quickly cripple the stock. The seemingly cheap 9 times forward earnings that it trades at today could be due for an adjustment, as analysts will likely update their future earnings expectations for the stock.\n\nSuper Micro's stock is a gamble right now\n\nThere are so many unknowns surrounding Super Micro today that it can be next to impossible to predict how it might perform in 2025. If it releases its annual report and quarterly filings as planned, and its numbers still look great, then it could certainly take off. But if it doesn't, or if it releases the numbers but its growth rate or its bottom line don't look as good anymore, any one of those reasons could trigger a sell-off. Of course, if it fails to report its financials by the Nasdaq's latest deadline, that too could quickly send the stock spiraling.\n\nSuper Micro is one of the more volatile stocks on the market right now. Unless you have a high risk tolerance, you may want to just take a wait-and-see approach with it for now."

            "article_content": "The federal landscape is constantly shifting due to technological breakthroughs, modernization needs, leadership change-overs and emerging priorities. This is never more true than at the beginning of a new presidential administration, and 2025 is sure to be a transformational and pivotal year in determining how the remainder of this decade and beyond will take shape on an organizational level.\n\nMeriTalk recently interviewed Federal CIOs to understand their top tech priorities for 2025. They found that cybersecurity, workforce transformation, and AI rank as the top technology priorities in the Federal government, but that funding and skills gaps are hindering progress in these areas.\n\nGovCon Wire spoke with Ben Baldi, senior vice president of global public sector at automated software testing company Tricentis, to get his unique perspective on how the federal government is evolving and how the industrial base can accommodate the transformations. He touched on the ins and outs of data management, differences one might see in procurement processes and much more.\n\nGovCon Wire: Despite ongoing efforts to close the skills gap, year over year, workforce transformation remains a challenge for the federal government. What needs to change, and where do you think agencies can make progress in this area in 2025?\n\nBen Baldi: Workforce transformation has been a perennial challenge for the federal government, and I don\u2019t see that changing in 2025. What I do see, though, are opportunities for progress if agencies take a more focused and strategic approach.\n\nFirst, automation will be key. By adopting test automation, agencies can free up IT personnel from repetitive, time-consuming tasks and allow them to focus on higher-value priorities like cybersecurity and innovation. Additionally, leveraging low-code and no-code tools can democratize technology adoption across the workforce, enabling non-technical employees to contribute to digital transformation efforts. These are smart ways to stretch tight budgets while optimizing skilled resources, accelerating modernization and reducing operational bottlenecks.\n\nSecond, we need to rethink training. The federal workforce operates in an increasingly complex environment, so employees must be prepared to wear multiple hats. Agencies should offer cross-disciplinary training in areas like cybersecurity, quality assurance, data analytics and cloud computing. Partnering with private sector organizations and building strong mentorship programs can also help employees stay agile and ready for emerging challenges.\n\nFinally, agencies must double down on creating a purpose-driven culture. People stay when they feel their work matters, whether it\u2019s advancing national security, improving public health, or driving innovation that will impact society at large. Leaders can inspire commitment by celebrating successes, showing the real-world effects of their teams\u2019 work and involving employees in meaningful decision-making.\n\nIn 2025, agencies that integrate these strategies\u2014automation, training and mission-driven culture\u2014will be better positioned to close the skills gap and build a workforce that\u2019s ready to tackle future challenges.\n\nGCW: From the same survey, federal CIOs reported that improving data readiness was one of their top AI goals for 2025. What steps do agencies need to take in 2025 to improve data readiness?\n\nBaldi: In 2025, I predict we\u2019ll see data readiness take center stage as agencies ramp up their AI and generative AI initiatives. The message is clear: without high-quality, well-structured data, even the most sophisticated AI tools will fall short. That\u2019s why improving data readiness is becoming a top priority for federal CIOs\u2014and rightly so.\n\nData readiness means having data that\u2019s clean, structured and ready to be used for analysis and decision-making. But you can\u2019t have true data readiness without data integrity\u2014that is, ensuring the data is accurate, consistent and reliable from start to finish. The two go hand in hand, and both are essential for successful AI programs.\n\nIn 2025, agencies will need to adopt smarter, more proactive approaches to improve both. I expect to see a big push for automation to handle routine data checks, like identifying errors, inconsistencies, or missing values before they cause bigger problems. Agencies will also likely lean on real-time dashboards and alerts to monitor data quality and address issues like data drift as soon as they arise.\n\nAnother prediction? Strategic checkpoints will become standard practice. As data flows through increasingly complex systems\u2014think hybrid environments, multi-cloud setups, and diverse applications\u2014agencies will need built-in safeguards to detect changes in data structures to prevent biases from creeping in.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing new use cases emerge for data integrity, from validating data during migrations to ensuring operational accuracy in enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems and meeting compliance demands. These are areas where agencies can make immediate progress while preparing for the bigger AI picture.\n\nUltimately, 2025 will be about laying the groundwork. Agencies that prioritize data readiness and integrity now will position themselves to unlock AI and generative AI\u2019s full potential\u2014driving efficiency, innovation, and better services for citizens.\n\nGCW: How have you seen government IT procurement evolve over the last year, and what changes do you envision in 2025?\n\nBaldi: Another key trend we\u2019re observing is the growing prioritization of automated software testing in government procurement. Requests for proposals are increasingly mandating software testing\u2014especially automated testing\u2014as a standard requirement. This shift highlights a recognition among agencies of the critical role continuous testing plays in minimizing operational risks and achieving mission objectives. Additionally, we\u2019re seeing an emphasis on embedding security testing early in the software development lifecycle, reflecting broader DevSecOps trends and enabling public sector IT teams to deliver secure applications more efficiently.\n\nAt the same time, agencies are navigating heightened complexity within their technology ecosystems. From on-premises setups to multi-cloud and hybrid environments, and across microservices and enterprise applications like Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Oracle, and Workday, agencies must ensure seamless and consistent testing across diverse systems and platforms. Automated software testing allows agencies to do just that.\n\nGCW: What other emerging trends or challenges do you foresee shaping government agencies\u2019 strategies in 2025, particularly in anticipation of a new administration?\n\nBaldi: In 2025, many are expecting government agencies will face significant pressure to adapt to shifting priorities under the Department of Government Efficiency . This initiative will emphasize leaner, more independent teams, pushing agencies to streamline operations and embrace automation to replace outdated manual processes. Agencies will need to accelerate modernization efforts, as efficiency and speed will be paramount to meeting tighter fiscal demands. Those that fail to adopt scalable and automated solutions risk falling behind, particularly as federal and state budgets increasingly prioritize innovation and agility. Software testing, particularly automated testing, will be a cornerstone of these efforts, enabling agencies to modernize faster and with greater efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, I expect unspent infrastructure funds and shifting budget allocations will create urgency for agencies to act strategically. Departments like the Department of Homeland Security are expected to receive substantial funding increases, presenting opportunities for targeted modernization efforts. However, as the 2026 budget cycle looms, agencies must prepare for unpredictable shifts in funding and priorities. Success will require a forward-looking approach\u2014balancing compliance with efficiency mandates while leveraging data-driven insights to address program demands and unlock growth opportunities in a competitive and evolving environment."

Israel has devastated Gaza after the October 2023 attack led by Hamas. Syria\u2019s civil war took a shocking turn with rebels ousting Bashar al-Assad. A brutal civil war has broken out in... Read More\n\nSyrian opposition fighters celebrate after the Syrian government collapsed in Damascus, Syria, on December 8, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nThe Ukraine-Russia war that began in February 2022 led to a series of conflicts for various reasons in different parts of the world, including Israel, Gaza, Syria, Sudan and Myanmar, taking a huge toll on not only the stakeholders, but the world at large.\n\nWill 2025 continue to witness the rage or will be there an end to this violence? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nrelated stories\n\nWhat Is The Status Of The Gaza War?\n\nGaza Strip, which is small territory along the Mediterranean Sea, became the hotbed of violence in October 2023 when Palestinian extremist group Hamas unleashed attacks on Israel, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities in the area.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said. Israel\u2019s military said it \u201celiminated\" Hamas fighters.\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has warned that Hamas will \u201csuffer blows of a magnitude not seen in Gaza for a long time\" if it doesn\u2019t release the remaining hostages and stop firing at Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military has stated quite often that it only targets militants and has blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army said it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nSome 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million have been displaced, many of them multiple times, due to the war.\n\nThe US and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until \u201ctotal victory.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in November issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former defence chief Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe war has impacted Israeli citizens. More than 82,000 Israelis moved abroad in 2024 and 33,000 people immigrated to the country, Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics said. Another 23,000 Israelis returned after long periods abroad.\n\nBut there is a chance that the war could end this year. Donald Trump had told Netanyahu that he wanted the conflict to end before he returns to the White House on January 20. After he was declared a winner, Trump had said in his address that he wants all wars to end.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel will keep hold of Gaza for the \u201cforeseeable future\" after the war ends. He also wants the Palestinian Authority to take a role in Gaza\u2019s administration.\n\nJosef Federman, Associated Press\u2019 news director (Israel-Palestinian territories-Jordan), said there are signs that the war is in its final stages. \u201cBut even if it ends, I don\u2019t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that\u2019s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think.\"\n\nIs Putin Ending The Ukraine Conflict?\n\nExperts predict that Russian President Vladimir Putin could up the ante against Ukraine as he would be set to reclaim the territories that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nProfessor Anthony Glees from the University of Buckingham told the Mirror that Putin is unlikely to be satisfied with a peace deal imposed by the West and aim for further expansion, targeting post-1997 NATO states.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, Putin will advance his strategic plan to undermine and force post-1997 NATO states, including Poland, Finland, and the Baltic nations, to leave the alliance,\" Glees warns. He told the Mirror that this \u201cbig grab\" could cause a global war.\n\nWith Trump promises his electorate to end the Ukraine war within a day by negotiating a peace deal, reports suggest his plan may embolden Putin rather than deter him. Trump proposed deal includes freezing the current front lines, establishing a buffer zone, and delaying Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership by 20 years.\n\nAs per Kyiv Independent, Putin had said Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia and disavowed its goal of joining the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin has also demanded that Ukraine acknowledge Crimea and Sevastopol as Russian territory.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,\" Putin had said at the time.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, and since then, Moscow has made steady gains in eastern Ukraine. Russian troops have taken over 30 square kilometres of Kyiv\u2019s territory.\n\nUkraine had responded to Russia\u2019s offensive by using US long-range Army Tactical Missile System. Though experts insist that Kyiv being given permission to use these missiles is not a game changer, Moscow has responded by lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term was due to end in May 2024 has been extended due to martial law. He would need to be re-elected for Russia to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, Putin had said.\n\nSamya Kullab, Associated Press correspondent in Ukraine, told the Guardian that the situation is far different from when the war began. \u201cThe jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly,\" Kullab wrote.\n\nEuropean Union leaders believe Ukraine needs to hold on and maybe placate Trump to open ideas for negotiations with Russia. The EU will have to continue to sanction individuals and companies in Russia.\n\nWho Is In Charge In Syria After The Government Collapse?\n\nIn Syria, protests began against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, who came to power in 2000. Pro-democracy protesters during the peak of Arab Spring in 2011 took to the streets in Syria, calling for the ouster of the dictator. But the movement was crushed by Assad\u2019s forces, leading to the establishment of small militias and armed opposition groups from the Syrian military.\n\nAs anti-establishment forces grew, the Syrian allies stepped up support. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s proxy Hezbollah helped the armed rebel groups, while Russia bolstered the Syrian Air Force with warplanes. Soon, al-Qaeda started taking interest in the cause of Syria\u2019s opposition forces. By 2014, extremists, including ISIS swept the country.\n\nThe US then created the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 comprising Kurdish fighters \u2013 to eliminate ISIS without confronting the Syrian regime. The SDF fought against the ISIS and ended their territorial existence in Syria. In 2020, Russia and Turkey agreed to a ceasefire in the opposition-held region of Idlib.\n\nIn 2024, the war was triggered by a coalition of rebel forces calling themselves the Military Operations Command. They swept through the villages outside Aleppo\u2014the second largest city in Syria \u2013 and eventually seized Damascus \u2013 the capital city.\n\nAssad has vowed that Syria will continue \u201cto defend its stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their supporters\". The defence ministry said it was preparing to launch a counteroffensive. \u201cJoint Syrian-Russian warplanes\" have intensified precise strikes on rebel positions, killing and wounding dozens, it said in a statement.\n\nBut some experts have already expressed scepticism over Assad\u2019s chances. Aron Lund of the Century International think tank told CBS, \u201cAleppo seems to be lost for the regime. And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\"\n\nThey cited the fact that Russia was heavily distracted by the war in Ukraine and that Iran and Hezbollah were left weakened by their conflict against Israel.\n\nThe experts said the rebels had been biding their time for years. \u201cThis has to do with geopolitics and local opportunity,\" Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies told The Washington Post. \u201cThe rebellion at large had regrouped, rearmed and retrained for something like this.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden had called the fall of Assad a \u201cfundamental act of justice\" but also a \u201cmoment of risk and uncertainty,\" and said rebel groups are \u201csaying the right things now\" but the US would assess their actions.\n\nExperts predict that West Asia could see massive changes in 2025. A US official told CNN that developments in Syria mark the collapse of \u201cIran\u2019s artifice\" across the region.\n\nWhatever happens in Syria will have a major impact on its neighbours Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, Iran lost its pillars in the Axis of Resistance. After the heavy blow that Hezbollah suffered at the hands of Israel, the fall of Assad is a fatal strike on Iran\u2019s influence efforts in the Middle East,\" Danny Citrinowicz, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Middle East Programs, told Council for Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nWhat\u2019s The Status Of Civil War In Sudan?\n\nThe Sudanese civil war between two military factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in September 2024. It started as a power rivalry between the military heads of the SAF and the RSF, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Hamdan Dagalo respectively. What began as a conflict in the capital city of Khartoum has spread to Omdurman, Bahri, Port Sudan, El Fasher and the Port Sudan cities, as well as the Darfur and Kordofan states.\n\nThe war is taking place as both warring parties are adamant about gaining ground and legitimising their power. The SAF, which came to power through a coup in 2021, claims to be the legitimate government, with the UN just about recognising them. However, the RSF has territorial gains around the capital and other war zones. It opposes the SAF\u2019s efforts to represent Sudan internationally, claiming legitimacy. The RSF, a former Arab militia known as Janjaweed, seeks alliances from several Arab countries to support its claim to power.\n\nSudan has been under the UN arms embargo, since the 2004 Darfur crisis, which has been now been extended for another year. However, the embargo has not blocked the flow of weapons. A Human Rights Watch report in July claimed that the warring parties have been using armed drones, anti-tank guided missiles, truck-mounted multi-barrel rocket launchers, and mortar munitions produced by companies registered in China, Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the UAE.\n\nAround nine rounds of peace talks led by the US and Saudi Arabia have been held, but all failed in the initial stage. The latest round of US-led peace talks was held in Geneva, Switzerland, on August 14, 2024. But, neither of the warring parties attended.\n\nAny new administration ruling Sudan would be a challenge to the internationally recognised and army-led national government which was forced out of Khartoum last year and now operates on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan. A group of civilian politicians and armed group leaders have agreed to set up a \u201cpeace government\", RSF members told Reuters.\n\nThey said it would be civilian-led, independent of the RSF and set up to replace the government in Port Sudan which they accused of prolonging the war.\n\nThe civil has impacted several regions, with more than 2 million people seeking shelter in neighbouring Chad, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The refugee camps are overflown and have raised concerns in Europe that many will attempt to reach the continent. In February, dozens of Sudanese drowned when a migrant boat capsized along the Tunisia-Italy route. A lack of law and order has triggered ethnic clashes along the South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea borders. More than 100 deaths were reported in ethnic violence in the Abiey region, a disputed land between Sudan and South Sudan, according to the UN.\n\nThere is a fear that the military rivals would divide Sudan, leading to a similar situation in Libya. Unlike Ukraine and Gaza, the Sudanese war has not gained international traction, but the repercussions have been the same \u2014 fatalities, fear and destroyed livelihood.\n\nWhere Does Myanmar Stand In 2025?\n\nThe ongoing civil war in Myanmar, since the military toppled the civilian government in 2021, has killed more than 50,000 people and displaced around 3 million.\n\nThe fighting between the junta and armed resistance groups in the first two years of the war led to a stalemate while 2024 saw the military on the back foot. With the active Ukraine and Middle East wars, violence in Myanmar conflict has been received global attention.\n\nIn February 2021, the Myanmar\u2019s military staged a coup to overthrow the civilian government\u2014on the same day the parliament is set to swear in the winners of the 2020 election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won by a landslide. As a result, international condemnation and pro-democracy protests swept across the country, with the junta responding with a brutal crackdown. Nearly 500 were killed in the first two months of the coup.\n\nIn May 2021, the National Unity Government (NUG), comprising ousted lawmakers, protesters and ethnic minorities, announced its armed wing \u2013 the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF). But in August, Min Aung Hlaing named himself the Prime Minister, and announced a potential extension to the state of emergency.\n\nIn 2022, resistance forces become more united, with many PDF units and ethnic armies forming partnerships to launch joint attacks against junta troops.\n\nIn October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a coalition of ethnic armies, launched \u2018Operation 1027\u2019, seizing control of key areas from the military, marking a key victory for the resistance and a turning point in the war.\n\nIn January 2024, China brokered ceasefire between junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But the junta announced mandatory conscription for all men between 18 and 35 years old and all women between 18 and 27 in February. The embattled military proposed a peace agreement with the resistance in September, urging them to \u201csolve political problems politically,\" but it is widely snubbed by the NUG.\n\nRebels in December took control of the country\u2019s western border with Bangladesh after insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA) drove out the junta\u2019s Border Guard Police (PGP5) in northern Rakhine State. The 270 km border with Bangladesh is now governed by the rebels.\n\nThe AA will likely be the first insurgent group to take complete control of a state in Myanmar, as per BBC.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nMyanmar\u2019s neighbours are tense. Thailand in December held talks to resolve the political crisis. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers and high-level representatives from Myanmar as well as Laos, China, India, Bangladesh and host Thailand. But experts think the approach is unlikely to fructify.\n\nDavid Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst working on conflict and human rights issues on Myanmar, told Deutsche Welle, \u201cUnless the Myanmar military is serious about peace, these talks will be extremely limited. You can\u2019t approach any diplomacy on Myanmar without a clear understanding that the military is the root cause of all the problems.\"\n\nFirst Published: January 02, 2025, 18:04 IST"

            "article_content": "The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act is designed to regulate the behaviour of major digital firms with significant market power in the U.K.\n\nThe legislation grants the Competition and Markets Authority new powers to impose requirements on tech companies with \u201cStrategic Market Status,\u201d reminiscent of the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d organisations that must abide by the E.U.\u2019s Digital Markets Act.\n\nHowever, while these laws share similarities, the new legislation is less one-size-fits-all: Under the DMCCA, the CMA can apply bespoke regulations, so-called \u201cConduct Requirements,\u201d to companies with SMS to address their specific issues.\n\nIssues might relate to:\n\nThe DMCCA was created in response to a report published in 2019 by the Digital Competition Expert panel, chaired by Jason Furman an economic policy professor at Harvard University and former chief economist to U.S. President Barack Obama. It contained recommendations to open up digital markets in the U.K.\n\nWhile the DMCCA was greenlit in 2020, due to various delays, it was only passed by Parliament in April 2023 and given Royal assent in May 2024. It is expected to come into force in January 2025.\n\nSEE: Google Abusing Dominant Position in Ad Tech Sector, Says U.K. Government\n\nWhat is the aim of the Act?\n\nThe DMCCA aims to improve competitive conditions in digital markets by enabling interventions that encourage investment, innovation, and growth in all U.K. tech companies, ultimately providing consumers with access to the best possible technologies for them.\n\nThe CMA stated in a press release that the legislation will enable it to investigate Google, Apple, and other large tech firms\u2019 potentially anticompetitive practices \u201cmore holistically.\u201d The rules \u201cwill build on and leverage its experience in areas it has already studied, such as mobile ecosystems, which includes app stores.\u201d\n\nIn a January 2024 interview, Sarah Cardell, CEO of the CMA, said: \u201cThe new regime is specifically designed to keep pace with developments in fast-moving digital markets, complementing our existing competition and consumer protection powers.\n\n\u201cThe DMCC Bill will establish a very targeted approach to address the substantial and entrenched market power of a small number of firms. This will ensure that challenger firms can bring forward genuinely disruptive and exciting new innovations that will create great new products for consumers.\u201d\n\nWho will the Act impact?\n\nAfter a formal investigation, the CMA will designate \u201ca very small number\u201d of firms as having SMS and, therefore will be subject to the DMCCA. These firms must have:\n\nA \u201csubstantial and entrenched market power in a digital activity that is linked to the UK.\u201d\n\nA \u201cposition of strategic significance.\u201d\n\nA global turnover of more than \u00a325 billion or a U.K. turnover of more than \u00a31 billion.\n\nSMS designations will be reviewed a minimum of every five years. According to Cardell, between three and four will be launched in the first year of the new regime.\n\nIn August, the CMA rejected Google\u2019s proposed policy changes regarding purchases made within apps listed on its Play Store, which had spurred an investigation. This suggested that the company would be one of the first to achieve SMS because, if the CMA accepted the changes, it would be limited in what actions it could take under the DMCCA.\n\nWhat will the Act enable the U.K. government to do?\n\nThe DMCCA gives new enforcement powers to a new group established inside the CMA called the Digital Markets Unit. It counts existing CMA directors and a former Ofcom exec as members.\n\nThe DMU will draft a unique set of \u201cconduct requirements\u201d for each company that has SMS. They must abide by these behaviours even before exhibiting anti-competitive practices to prevent them from ever occurring. This approach differs from other competition laws, where remedies are delivered after an investigation uncovers a violation.\n\nSEE: Regulator CMA to Scrutinize Microsoft and Other Cloud Service Providers in the UK\n\nAs well as conduct requirements, the DMU can make \u201cpro-competition interventions\u201d that will actively address a company\u2019s adverse effects on competition that stem from its disproportionate market power.\n\nExamples of how the DMU might support healthy competition in digital markets include:\n\nPreventing bundling or tying of products or services.\n\nPreventing self-preferencing of products or services.\n\nMandating competitor access to data or functionality.\n\nRequiring interoperability of products or services.\n\nRequiring \u201cchoice screens\u201d that allow users to select their preferred default apps or services over the company\u2019s own.\n\nRequiring transparency concerning aspects of companies\u2019 algorithms.\n\nRequiring fairer trading terms.\n\nFurthermore, the DMU will require SMS companies to report any merger valued at least \u00a325 million and a U.K. connection.\n\nWhat are the penalties for non-compliance?\n\nUnder the DMCCA, the CMA is empowered to impose penalties for failures such as non-compliance with enforcement or final orders. Businesses and individuals may be required to produce testimonies or other documentation to aid the DMU\u2019s work. Cardell said the CMA has legal obligations to maintain confidentiality regarding information and whistleblowers.\n\nFor fixed penalty amounts, businesses can face fines of up to \u00a330,000 or 1% of their turnover. For penalties calculated at a daily rate incurred by individuals, the maximum is \u00a315,000 or 5% of total turnover per day of non-compliance.\n\nSEE: Data (Use and Access) Bill: What Is It and How Does It Impact UK Businesses?\n\nCardell said that the CMA \u201chope(s) that in many cases we will be able to secure timely and beneficial changes without resorting to formal action,\u201d and instead resolve disputes by engaging directly with SMS firms.\n\nWhat are critics saying about the Act?\n\nDespite mostly positive feedback in a government consultation in late 2024, the Act has not been met with universal acclaim. Critics are concerned that, instead of complying with the CMA, tech companies will simply exclude the U.K. from the rollout of new products.\n\nEvidence of exclusion has already taken place in Europe. For example, Apple will not be making its new suite of generative AI capabilities, Apple Intelligence, available on devices in the E.U. initially, citing \u201cregulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nSEE: Apple Intelligence EU: Potential Mac Release Amid DMA Rules\n\nRegulatory pushback may have also contributed to the delayed arrival of Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot and Meta withholding its future AI products from Europe.\n\nThere are concerns that the CMA could use its power to arbitrarily create bespoke regulations for different companies, making it more difficult for them to comply. But, Cardell said that the principles the Act is based on fit under four themes; firstly, taking a targeted, evidence-based and proportionate approach.\n\nThe other themes are ensuring the regime complements the CMA\u2019s existing tools, engaging with various stakeholders, including Big Tech, and promoting competition to deliver better user outcomes. However, choice screens, interoperability, and sideloading can actually worsen the user experience through a phenomenon known as feature creep.\n\nThe Act can prevent any potentially anticompetitive merger where one party has a 33% market share in the U.K. and a turnover of around \u00a3350 million, and the target company is U.K.-based. According to law firm Linklaters, \u201cit will be hard in most cases to establish that an acquirer does not have a 33% share on some cut of the market or permutation of supply that the CMA could use to establish jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nIn November 2024, the CMA provisionally found competition concerns in the mobile browsers market stemming from Apple and Google\u2019s duopoly. It recommended mitigations that could be imposed under the DMCCA when it comes into force. However, Apple told TechRepublic that such mitigations \u201cwould undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.\u201d"

            "article_content": "BY MARO AKPOBI\n\nThe naira, Nigeria\u2019s once-proud currency, has become a shadow of its former self. Over the past year, its value has plummeted dramatically, signalling not just a crisis in exchange rates but a larger, systemic failure in the country\u2019s economic management. Once heralded as a symbol of sovereignty and potential, the naira now stands as a stark reminder of the deep economic woes Nigeria faces today.\n\nBetween June 2023 and September 2024, following the introduction of the managed float system on June 14, 2023, the USD has appreciated against the naira by approximately 156.7 percent. Lower denominations of the naira have become virtually useless, as they can no longer purchase basic food items\u2014an alarming contrast to the purchasing power of the lowest denominations in many Western countries.\n\nThe currency depreciated by 61.05 percent from the period the managed float was implemented. Despite the CBN\u2019s short-term interventions, including the launch of the EFEM platform and periodic market stabilisation efforts as seen in Q1 in 2024, the naira\u2019s trajectory highlights the deep structural issues in Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile economists debate methodologies, ordinary Nigerians feel the real impact. Inflation has surged to historic highs, and the cost of living has skyrocketed.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u25cfA loaf of bread now costs over \u20a61,500, up from \u20a6900 a year ago.\n\n\u25cfThe minimum wage was recently increased to \u20a670,000/month, which barely covers essential expenses.\n\nThe World Bank declared the naira among the top three worst-performing currencies in the Sub-Saharan region in its October Africa\u2019s Pulse report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigerian government has recently adopted new methodologies for calculating key economic indicators, leading to figures that many analysts believe do not accurately reflect the country\u2019s economic realities. For instance, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported a significant drop in the unemployment rate\u2014from 33.3 percent in Q4 2020 to 4.1 percent in Q1 2023\u2014after revising its calculation methods.\n\nSimilarly, official inflation rates have been reported at 39 percent for 2024, a figure that many Nigerians find inconsistent with their daily experiences of rising prices. Another organisation has challenged this, arguing that the actual inflation rate is at least 92 percent. The removal of fuel subsidies and the devaluation of the Naira have significantly increased inflation, eroded purchasing power, and led many into poverty.\n\nThese statistical adjustments appear to downplay the severity of economic challenges, potentially serving political interests rather than providing an accurate basis for policy-making. By presenting more favourable economic indicators, the government may be attempting to project stability and progress.\n\nTurning data into a political tool, rather than a reflection of reality, impedes the development of policies that can genuinely improve the economic well-being of Nigerians. Accurate data is essential for formulating effective strategies to combat inflation, reduce unemployment, and alleviate poverty. Without it, efforts to implement meaningful fiscal reforms are likely to fall short, prolonging the economic hardships faced by the population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the 1980s, we have been told to liberalise the economy and exchange rate, with promises that this would attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and spur economic growth. Each time we heeded this advice, more Nigerians fell into poverty. The claim that liberalisation would unlock FDI has proven false once again.\n\nIn Q2 2024, FDI into Nigeria dropped to a historic low of $29.83 million. This marks a 65.33 percent decline from Q2 2023 and a 74.97 percent drop from Q1 2024. Despite government claims of securing $30 billion in FDI commitments, the actual inflows barely scratch the surface, making up just 1.15 percent of total capital importation for the period.\n\nWorse still, most of the inflow consisted of loans rather than actual investment, reflecting a growing reliance on debt rather than sustainable economic growth.\n\nLocal companies have not fared any better. Multi-million-dollar losses are being declared across industries, with many businesses shutting down or exiting the country altogether. This economic devastation has been further compounded by the central bank\u2019s implementation of IMF recommendations, which have worsened inflation and eroded consumer purchasing power. The GDP has also declined, reflecting a deeper crisis than ever before. These outcomes make it abundantly clear that the so-called reforms are not working, and liberalisation without structural reforms continues to be a recipe for economic collapse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe combination of a VAT increase, subsidy removals for fuel and tuition, and electricity tariff hikes is set to bury the economy unless exports are ramped up by at least tenfold. Wages have not increased, yet the cost of imports and exports has risen dramatically, compounded by significant capital flight. On top of this, interest rates have been raised\u2014a move that defies economic logic in the current environment. Instead of gradual adjustments, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has pursued a reckless approach, wiping out purchasing power without stimulating any meaningful economic growth.\n\nInvestors remain unprotected due to a broken security and criminal justice system. For example, Landmark reportedly invested $24.9 million only to wake up one day to find bulldozers destroying the beach and other infrastructure. Indiscriminate land seizures by the government are rampant. The economy remains heavily dependent on imports, despite being a crude oil exporter. Ironically, Nigeria also imports refined fuel, with imports from Malta increasing by 100 percent. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has failed to achieve self-sufficiency, relying instead on loans to keep operations afloat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe national grid collapsed at least ten times in 2024, forcing businesses to adopt alternative energy sources that are prohibitively expensive due to rising fuel costs and currency devaluation. Generators and solar panels are the only options, but their costs continue to climb. Businesses have no choice but to pass these increased operational costs onto consumers, leading to reduced consumption. However, prices have not fallen. Instead, businesses are either shutting down, selling to larger competitors with deeper pockets, or maintaining higher prices despite lower revenue rather than absorbing losses. Privatisation of the electricity industry has been catastrophic as highlighted by senators in the national assembly.\n\nThe surprising thing about listening to the senators during their meetings is that some of them are actually sound. The problem is that nothing happens after all the plenty talk. Godswill Akpabio, the senate president had this to say during the meeting: \u201cThe essence of privatisation was to inject new funds to revamp the sector but what we are seeing is something else. They never paid for the infrastructure provided by the federal government. It\u2019s similar to what happened in the oil sector\u2014oil wells producing up to 80,000 BPD dropped to 15,000 BPD after privatisation, without any significant investment. Some wells even declined to as low as 5,000 BPD, but the man is still flying his private jet because he made no investment and he\u2019s recovered his money within a year. The DisCos have failed as far as I am concerned; they increase the tariff in other to make up for the infrastructure collapse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing you need to notice here is that it was mostly local investors that profited from this; there was barely any FDI.\n\nFor startups, the situation is even more dire. Many raised funding in USD, and the naira\u2019s devaluation has caused their revenues, when converted to USD, to plummet. Investor updates are worsening, and the already small domestic market has shrunk further as consumers prioritise essentials like food and shelter. The combination of poorly implemented reforms and systemic inefficiencies has left businesses and individuals alike struggling to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCustoms tariffs are also priced in USD, meaning they increase the cost of imports as the exchange rate rises. This adds to inflationary pressures and further burdens businesses and consumers. Meanwhile, the national budget has ballooned by \u20a610 trillion, forcing the government to sell $2 billion in Eurobonds at an exorbitant 10% interest rate just to finance the deficit.\n\nTo make matters worse, new agencies are springing up, compounding the problem of ballooning governance costs\u2014a crisis initially fueled by widespread corruption. Despite previous calls for austerity, inefficiency and waste persist at all levels of government.\n\nCorruption exacerbates this situation: stolen funds are converted from naira into dollars, intensifying the demand for foreign currency (\u201ctoo much naira chasing limited dollars\u201d). These funds are then stashed outside Nigeria, worsening the already dire dollar shortage and further depreciating the naira.\n\nDevaluation creates an inflationary, not a deflationary, environment. The cost of imports rises, driving up prices for goods and services domestically. Wages must also increase to keep up with the higher cost of living, and this typically occurs either through government measures like raising taxes or by expanding the money supply.\n\nMost countries that devalue under IMF recommendations often lack sufficient export revenue. Expecting devaluation alone to increase revenue without substantial structural reforms, such as diversifying the economy or improving export competitiveness, is overly simplistic and ineffective.\n\nYou will never negate the impact of devaluation on wage earners completely. The factors required to completely nullify its effects are extreme and rarely achievable. This is why, in a country like Nigeria, structural reforms and economic diversification must come first.\n\nAttempting to implement these reforms after devaluation\u2014or even simultaneously\u2014is not only impractical but also counterproductive. Devaluation exacerbates inflation and erodes purchasing power, leaving wage earners and the broader population more vulnerable. In today\u2019s interconnected markets, where technology facilitates real-time price adjustments, the effects of devaluation are felt almost immediately so both the cost of import and export go up except the local companies selling to foreigners decide not to raise prices and eat the loss.\n\nWithout a solid economic foundation, devaluation becomes a tool of economic destabilisation rather than a catalyst for growth. Neoliberalism has failed before and will continue to fail in Nigeria. Structural development economics is the only way forward.\n\nThe exchange rates used in this piece are the official exchange rates from CBN, Calculations are significantly worse when the parallel rates are used.\n\nMaro Akpobi can be contacted via [email protected]"

            "article_content": "Ever since Microsoft first introduced its Arm-based Copilot Plus laptops in June, I\u2019ve been wondering when we might see Copilot Plus features appear on desktop PCs. Six months on, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to see mini PCs that deliver the AI performance required for features like Recall, Click To Do, and AI-powered image generation and editing in Windows 11. These mini PCs might even help Microsoft compete with Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nAsus became the first PC manufacturer to announce a mini PC that\u2019s Copilot Plus capable in September. It then revealed the full specs of its upcoming NUC 14 Pro AI last month, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that kicks off next week. Asus\u2019 mini PC even has a Copilot button on the front and is almost identical to the size of Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nThe timing of Asus\u2019 spec drop came on the same day that Taiwanese company Geekom revealed three new mini PCs that it will showcase at CES. Geekom is releasing a mini PC with AMD\u2019s Strix Point CPUs inside and one with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor, meaning both will be Copilot Plus compatible. The third model is powered by Intel\u2019s unannounced Arrow Lake-H laptop processors, which are unlikely to have an NPU sufficient enough to be Copilot Plus compatible.\n\nI\u2019m going to be paying close attention to CES next week to see if there are any other Windows OEMs that are ready to launch Copilot Plus mini PCs. CES is usually a launch point for Microsoft\u2019s latest laptop or tablet initiatives, and last year the company convinced OEMs to put a Copilot key on their laptop keyboards. Asus wouldn\u2019t be adding a Copilot button on the front of its own mini PC without Microsoft\u2019s involvement, so I wonder how many other PC makers Microsoft has been working with to add dedicated Copilot buttons.\n\nGeekom\u2019s mention of Qualcomm chips inside its mini PC means we\u2019ll start to see Qualcomm\u2019s latest chips venture beyond laptops for the first time. Qualcomm was supposed to ship its mini PC Snapdragon Dev Kit in June alongside Copilot Plus laptops, but it ended up canceling it months later after issues with manufacturing the device. Qualcomm has also teased that its Snapdragon X Elite chips could appear in mini PCs or even all-in-one PCs, so perhaps we\u2019ll see some Copilot Plus all-in-one PCs next week, too.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see when we might get Copilot Plus features on traditional powerful desktop PCs. Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra desktop CPU arrived in October with an NPU inside, but it wasn\u2019t capable enough to hit the 40 TOPS requirement that Microsoft mandates for Copilot Plus features. We\u2019re going to have to wait until next-gen desktop CPUs from Intel and AMD arrive to see if more capable NPUs are a priority for chipmakers. Until then, mini PCs and all-in-one PCs that use laptop processors are going to be the only way to get Copilot Plus features in a desktop PC form factor.\n\nWhile Copilot Plus features remain limited to Windows PCs, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see the main Copilot assistant appear on more devices. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans that the company is keen to get Copilot on devices beyond just PCs, phones, and tablets.\n\nWe might well see Copilot appear on some unexpected hardware at CES next week, just as Microsoft has also been hinting about its ambitions for dedicated AI hardware in recent months. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri admitted in an October Notepad interview that the power of modern AI models \u201cwill free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.\u201d\n\nDavuluri stopped short of detailing what dedicated AI hardware would look like for Microsoft, but weeks later Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, dropped some additional hints in an underreported interview with YouTuber Austin Evans.\n\n\u201cThese devices that see the world, that you wear on your body, on your person, I think that those combined with AI will be very valuable,\u201d said Mehdi in late October. \u201cIt can do image recognition, it can talk to you about what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s a fascinating place that we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Mehdi also describes wearable health-related devices as exciting and \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the future. Microsoft then confirmed last month that Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has hired multiple former colleagues to help run a new AI health unit. It\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft venturing into fitness wearables again after the Microsoft Band was scrapped in 2016, but I could definitely see the company wanting to partner with device manufacturers and offer up AI-powered health services for these types of devices.\n\nEither way, 2025 won\u2019t see Microsoft slow down with its ambition to get Copilot on all the screens we look at every day.\n\nThe pad:\n\nThanks for subscribing and reading to the very end. I\u2019ll be reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history in Notepad later this year, so if there\u2019s a particular period of time you\u2019re interested in hearing more about,please get in touch: notepad@theverge.com."

            "article_content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is a guest post from Ang Troy, senior director analyst at Gartner.\n\nMost IT organizations have cloud services in place or have made conscious decisions regarding its adoption. Such decisions may include adopting the cloud quickly and wholly, to proceed methodically with cloud services or to delay for a period of time.\n\nIn any of these strategies, IT organizations face major obstacles building, deploying, consuming, managing, securing and integrating cloud services.\n\nThe adoption of cloud computing is multidimensional, and it must be run like a multiyear program, not a fixed-duration project. As a result, the complexity of cloud adoption requires at least one accountable architectural leader to guide the organization through the transformation. This is the task of a role that many IT organizations are now finding to be mandatory: the enterprise cloud architect.\n\nMany organizations can clearly point to their lead enterprise cloud architect, but others have yet to formally name this individual or have piled the cloud responsibilities onto an already overburdened enterprise architect. Organizations that are the most successful have formally assigned cloud architecture responsibilities to ensure that a single, accountable architect is in charge.\n\nWhat is an enterprise cloud architect?\n\nAn enterprise cloud architect is responsible for the cloud computing initiatives in an organization and for directing the architectural aspects of the cloud team across all aspects of IT and the business.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect should be the foundation of a cloud center of excellence, or what will become the CCOE \u2014 the enterprise architecture function that governs the organization\u2019s approach to the cloud.\n\nCommon alternative names for a CCOE include: the cloud business office, the cloud transformation office, the cloud brokerage team and the cloud enablement team.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is usually a senior individual contributor who serves as the leader of the CCOE \u2014 or, if there is no cloud EA function, then as the leader of cloud initiatives.\n\nOften, the role of the enterprise cloud architect is largely self-directed, and day-to-day responsibilities are usually fluid. The specific tasks vary, depending on the level of the organization\u2019s cloud maturity and the maturity of its CCOE.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are typically not \u201chands-on.\u201d They will make decisions, but hand off responsibility for their technical implementation to a cloud engineering function. Cloud technical architects may be hands-on, but they are associated with the cloud engineering function, not the CCOE.\n\nWhere cloud sits in the organization\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is the foundation of the CCOE, and may be the only member of this hub in some organizations.\n\nCompanies may not have a structured center of excellence in name, and may rely on the enterprise cloud architect to effectively assume the role of this center. This is a common and acceptable practice, though Gartner recommends building out the CCOE with additional members.\n\nRegardless of the organizational design, the enterprise cloud architect has six key relationships:\n\nAdvisory-level access to senior IT leaders, either directly or through the EA team Direct and collaborative access to senior EA teams Direct and collaborative access to domain architecture teams Collaborative access to technical architects and teams Collaborative access to central function architects and teams Collaborative access to business unit representatives to discern business needs for specific solutions\n\nSkill sets of enterprise cloud architects\n\nDue to the broad applicability of cloud computing in an organization, it\u2019s unlikely that any individual will possess all the skills that the enterprise cloud architect role demands. However, the enterprise cloud architect should possess as many of the desired skills as possible.\n\nWhere a specific skill is lacking, the enterprise cloud architect should be able to collaborate or engage the relevant, resident experts in the organization. For example, if the enterprise cloud architect does not have a skill or strength in IT service management (ITSM), that individual needs to build a strong relationship with an ITSM expert to drive objectives to completion.\n\nAt the core, enterprise cloud architects are enterprise architects. Therefore, they need to have the competencies of good enterprise architects in order to drive business outcomes, empower business partners and develop and build effective architecture disciplines\n\nCloud computing is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d; it\u2019s a matter of \u201chow.\u201d Adopting cloud services is similar to a complex IT program that has no clear end in sight. Guiding cloud adoption requires strong leadership, not just at an executive level, but also at an architectural level.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are paramount to the eventual success of cloud adoption. Organizations should not delay placing the right individual into this crucial IT role."

Her discovery this week puts an end to one of Great Britain\u2019s oldest missing person cases.\n\nFox, now 68, disappeared from Coventry in 1972. On Sunday, West Midlands police released a grainy photo of her from around the time she vanished to the public asking for help one more time. The police stated in their plea that Fox had been living with her parents when she disappeared and could have been in a relationship with a man at the time. They also suggested that she may have moved out of the area.\n\n\u201cWe searched through every piece of evidence we could find and managed to locate a photo of Sheila,\u201d said Detective Sergeant Jenna Shaw, a member of the West Midlands police cold case investigation team.\n\nJust a few hours later, the 52-year-old mystery had finally been solved. Sheila Fox was alive and well and living in another part of the country.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, members of the public reached out to police with information that led to her being found.\n\nCoventry woman who vanished 52 years ago found alive and well https://t.co/7AoZVIUQyD\n\nMystery of Sheila Fox\u2019s disappearance at 16 solved after fresh police appeal A woman who went missing 52 years ago has been found alive and well after police release\u2026 https://t.co/cYMYt2RIuX \u2014 The Protector (@The_Protect0r_) January 1, 2025\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to announce the conclusion of one of West Midlands Police\u2019s longest-running missing person investigations,\u201d a police spokesperson said. \u201cA single photo of Sheila from around the time of her disappearance was found by officers investigating and published on our website and social media.

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it?

Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

            "article_content": "In the vast skies over Wyoming, things aren\u2019t always as they seem. That\u2019s why the Cowboy State is one of the best places to see and possibly explain the unexplainable.\n\nThe National UFO Center keeps records of every sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reported in the United States since 1995.\n\nThe website Stacker used that data to compile a list of the top 10 with the most reports of strange, inexplainable sights in the night sky.\n\nThe world of UFO and UAP sightings has gotten more serious in the last several years, and more people are looking up and looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI can tell you is that quite a few sightings in Wyoming remain unexplained,\u201d said Richard Beckwith, Rock Springs city attorney and part-time UFO investigator.\n\nHe\u2019s spent decades investigating UFO sightings in Wyoming, but had his first personal experience with one spotted near Green River earlier in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is real,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the Pentagon has admitted UFOs and UAFs are real, and they can\u2019t explain them. It was treated as a joke for most of the time I\u2019ve been doing it, and now it\u2019s become real.\u201d\n\nThe List\n\nOverall, the National UFO Center has 421 reports of UFOs and UAFs in Wyoming. Cheyenne tops the list of Wyoming places with the most sightings, reporting 50 aerial phenomena since 1995.\n\nSeeing Cheyenne at the top doesn\u2019t surprise Beckwith at all. One would expect more sightings in Wyoming\u2019s most populated city, but Cheyenne is also home to a critical U.S. Air Force base.\n\n\u201cWyoming\u2019s UFO sightings, from my perspective, primarily appear over the Warren Air Force Base and the nearby missile silos,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been quite a few sightings, going back to the 1950s.\u201d\n\nCasper is second with 37 UFO sightings, followed by Laramie with 29, Rock Springs with 17 and Gillette with 15. Cody, Sheridan, Riverton and Evanston round out the bottom half of the list.\n\nYellowstone National Park sits at the bottom with eight UFO sightings. Sasquatch isn\u2019t the only elusive and mysterious thing hanging around the pristine wilderness of northwest Wyoming.\n\nThe state that\u2019s seen and reported the most UFOs is California, with more than 16,500 sightings. The Pentagon attributes most of these sightings to balloons, drones, aircraft and other terrestrial sources.\n\nOne thing Wyomingites won\u2019t want to do is try to shoot down any UFOs they spot. If that UFO happens to be a neighbor\u2019s drone, that would violate federal law and could come with a fine and a jail sentence .\n\nNot Explaining The Unexplainable\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that the number of sightings corresponds with Wyoming\u2019s most populated areas. Beckwith said that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, but that doesn\u2019t make these phenomena any easier to explain.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, we had the simple explanation that these were aliens from another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the longer I\u2019ve done this, the explanations have become more elusive. It\u2019s much more complex than that.\u201d\n\nModern-day theories for UFOs and UAP include black technology programs, foreign espionage and astronomical events in addition to the extraterrestrial. If there are any probable explanations for what\u2019s been seen over Wyoming and elsewhere, the federal government has declined to comment or elaborate.\n\n\u201cThey continue to say emphatically that we have no evidence that these objects are extraterrestrial in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThat begs the question \u2014 if they can\u2019t explain it, how can they determine that these objects are also simultaneously not manufactured elsewhere? It's almost like, \u2018Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecently, there have been three congressional hearings on UFOs and UAFs, and Beckwith said he\u2019s spoken with two members of U.S. Congress about the phenomenon. Wyoming scientists are skeptical of their findings, but Beckwith described it as one of the rare bipartisan issues that has reached Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople who looked at this phenomenon were ridiculed about this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed since 2017, now that the government has admitted they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\nWyoming Watchers\n\nBeckwith is one of four Wyoming field investigators for the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of civilian volunteers that follow up on and report UFO and UAF sightings. The number of investigators shows Beckwith how much interest has grown for these unexplainable phenomena in the last decade.\n\n\u201cI have investigators in Cheyenne, Riverton, and two in Rock Springs that investigate sightings all over the state,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil a couple of years ago, I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBeckwith described his first experience with a UFO back in March. He used his Sony SR4 camera to capture a video of \u201canomalous nocturnal lights\u201d hovering near Green River.\n\n\u201cI got the radar records from that night, but haven\u2019t been able to correlate what I saw with any particular targets on the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly didn't have a transponder. So, to that extent, I can't explain it. But I saw and filmed it.\u201d\n\nBeckwith hopes more Wyomingites will report any UFO or UAF sightings to the National UFO Center or the Mutual UFO Network. Regardless of what people believe they've seen in the sky, he and many others want answers.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of space and open sky in Wyoming. Beckwith believes the Cowboy State could be the key to getting better data and information to shine more light into the darkness surrounding UFOs and UAFs.\n\n\u201cWyoming is the ninth-largest state in land area, and we have the lowest population,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, we have sightings with several witnesses in different locations. They\u2019re rarer than other places, but they still occur.\u201d\n\nAndrew Rossi can be reached at arossi@cowboystatedaily.com."

            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

            "article_content": "A combination of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity and quantum physics may help explain the expansion of the universe from a singular entity, P. Ajith, astrophysicist with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, has said.\n\nHe was at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium (RSCP) in Kozhikode on Thursday (January 2) to deliver a lecture demonstration on \u2018Universe: yesterday, today and tomorrow\u2019. It is the first in the \u2018Cosmic Snapshots\u2019 series of lectures being organised by the RSCP.\n\nMr. Ajith pointed out that the concept of a primordial atom, proposed in the early 20th century by Georges Lemaitre, who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, was just a \u201cstory\u201d and not a scientific fact. According to Lemaitre, the universe began with an explosion from a single particle at a specific moment in time. \u201cThe primordial atom is just a way of explaining what might have happened. At some point, the universe shrank into one tiny entity. To understand what happened then, we need to combine Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity with quantum physics,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ajith traced the history of our understanding of the universe, starting with Nicolaus Copernicus, who first suggested a sun-centered universe, and Galileo Galilei, who proved it through observations. \u201cGalileo\u2019s discoveries changed how we saw the universe and sparked the age of enlightenment and the Renaissance, leading to modern science and technology,\u201d he said. German astronomer Kepler improved Copernicus\u2019 ideas, discovering that planets move in elliptical orbits. Isaac Newton later proposed that the same force making an apple fall also keeps planets revolving around the Sun.\n\nMr. Ajith highlighted that Newton\u2019s laws of motion are still used today, especially in rocket science. He explained how the sun-centered universe concept evolved, revealing the Sun as just a small part of the Milky Way. Later, astronomers debated whether Earth was part of a single galaxy or many. Edward Hubble then developed a telescope to measure the distance to distant galaxies. Mr. Ajith also mentioned Einstein\u2019s theory, which described gravity not as a force, but as the effect of space-time, a concept he introduced to explain how gravity impacts space and the flow of time."
