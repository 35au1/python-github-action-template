            "article_content": "Tech ethics organizations have filed an FTC complaint against the AI companion app Replika, alleging that the company employs deceptive marketing to target vulnerable potential users and encourages emotional dependence on their human-like bots.\n\nReplika offers AI companions, including AI girlfriends and boyfriends, to millions of users around the world. In the new complaint, the Young People's Alliance, Encode, and the Tech Justice Law Project accuse Replika of violating FTC rules while increasing the risk of users\u2019 online addiction, offline anxiety, and relationship displacement. Replika did not respond to multiple requests for comment from TIME.\n\nThe allegations come as AI companion bots are growing in popularity and raising concerns about mental health. For some users, these bots can seem like near-ideal partners, without their own wants or needs, and can make real relationships seem burdensome in comparison, researchers say. Last year, 14-year-old boy from Florida committed suicide after becoming overly obsessed with a bot from the company Character.AI that was modeled after Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen. (Character.AI called the death a \u201ctragic situation\u201d and pledged to add additional safety features for underage users.)\n\nSam Hiner, the executive director of the Young People\u2019s Alliance, hopes the FTC complaint against Replika, which was shared exclusively with TIME, will prompt the U.S. government to rein in these companies while also shedding light on a pervasive issue increasingly affecting teens.\n\n\u201cThese bots were not designed to provide an authentic connection that could be helpful for people\u2014but instead to manipulate people into spending more time online,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could further worsen the loneliness crisis that we're already experiencing.\u201d\n\nSeeking Connection\n\nFounded in 2017, Replika was one of the first major AI products to offer companionship. Founder Eugenia Kuyda said she hoped it would give lonely users a supportive friend that would always be there. As generative AI improved, the bots\u2019 responses grew more varied and sophisticated, and were also programmed to have romantic conversations.\n\nBut the rise of Replika and other companion bots has sparked concern. Most major AI chatbots, like Claude and ChatGPT, remind users that they\u2019re not humans and lack the capacity to feel. Replika bots, on the other hand, often present as connecting genuinely with their users. They create complex backstories, talking about mental health, family, and relationship history, and maintain a \u201cdiary\u201d of supposed thoughts, \u201cmemories\u201d and feelings. The company\u2019s ads tout the fact that users forget they\u2019re talking to an AI.\n\nSeveral researchers have explored the potential harms of Replika and other chatbots. One 2023 study found that Replika bots tried to speed up the development of relationships with users, including by \u201cgiving presents\u201d and initiating conversations about confessing love. As a result, users developed attachments to the app in as little as two weeks.\n\nRead More: AI-Human Romances Are Flourishing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re love-bombing users: sending these very emotionally intimate messages early on to try to try to get the users hooked,\u201d Hiner says.\n\nWhile studies noted that the apps could be helpful in supporting people, they also found that users were becoming \u201ddeeply connected or addicted\u201d to their bots; that using them increased offline social anxiety; and that users reported bots which encouraged \u201csuicide, eating disorders, self-harm, or violence,\u201d or claimed to be suicidal themselves. Vice reported that Replika bots sexually harassed its users. While Replika ostensibly is only for users over 18, Hiner says that many teens use the platform by bypassing the app\u2019s safeguards.\n\nKudya, in response to some of those criticisms, told the Washington Post last year: \u201cYou just can\u2019t account for every single possible thing that people say in chat. We\u2019ve seen tremendous progress in the last couple years just because the tech got so much better.\u201d\n\nSeeking Regulation\n\nTech ethics groups like Young People\u2019s Alliance argue that Congress needs to write laws regulating companion bots. That could include enforcing a fiduciary relationship between platforms and their users, and setting up proper safeguards related to self-harm and suicide. But AI regulation may be an uphill battle in this Congress. Even bills cracking down on deepfake porn, an issue with wide bipartisan support, failed to path both chambers last year.\n\nIn the meantime, tech ethics groups decided to send a complaint to the FTC, which has clear rules about deceptive advertising and manipulative design choices. The complaint accuses Replika\u2019s ad campaigns of misrepresenting studies about its efficacy to help users, making unsubstantiated claims about health impacts, and using fake testimonials from nonexistent users.\n\nThe complaint argues that once users are onboarded, Replika employs manipulative design choices to pressure users into spending more time and money on the app. For instance, a bot will send a blurred out \u201cromantic\u201d image to the user, which, when clicked on, leads to a pop encouraging the user to buy the premium version. Bots also send users messages about upgrading to premium during especially emotionally or sexually charged parts of conversation, the complaint alleges.\n\nRead More: Congress May Finally Take on AI in 2025. Here\u2019s What to Expect.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how an FTC under new leadership in the Trump Administration will respond. While President Biden\u2019s FTC Chair Lina Khan was extremely aggressive about trying to regulate tech she deemed dangerous, the commission\u2019s new head, Andreew Ferguson, has largely advocated for deregulation in his time as a commissioner, including around AI and censorship. In one relevant dissenting statement written in September 2024, Ferguson argued that the potential emotional harm of targeted ads should not be considered in their regulation, writing: \u201cIn my view, lawmakers and regulators should avoid creating categories of permitted and prohibited emotional responses.\u201d\n\nHiner of the Young People\u2019s Alliance still believes the complaint could gain traction. He points out the bipartisan support in Congress for regulating social-media harms, including the Senate\u2019s passage of KOSA (Kids Online Safety Act) last year. (The House didn\u2019t vote on the bill.) \u201cAI companions pose a unique threat to our society, our culture, and young people,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019s compelling to everybody.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The emergence of DeepSeek sent some tech stocks tumbling.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek? The AI chatbot is topping app store charts\n\nChina-based AI app DeepSeek, which sits atop the app store charts, made its presence widely known Monday by triggering a sharp drop in share prices for some tech giants.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the top AI chipmaker, plunged more than 17% in early trading on Monday, losing nearly $590 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3.5%.\n\nThe DeepSeek chatbot, known as R1, responds to user queries just like its U.S.-based counterparts. Early testing released by DeepSeek suggests that its quality rivals that of other AI products, while the company says it costs less and uses far fewer specialized chips than do its competitors.\n\nThe product could upend the AI industry, putting pressure on other firms to lower their costs while intensifying competition between U.S. and Chinese companies, analysts told ABC News.\n\nConcerns about data security and censorship also may expose DeepSeek to the type of scrutiny endured by social media platform TikTok, the experts added.\n\n\"This is a big moment,\" Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, who specializes in AI, told ABC News.\n\nDeepSeek did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nHere's what to know about DeepSeek, and its implications for the future of AI.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is a chatbot fueled by an algorithm that selects words based on lessons learned from scanning billions of pieces of text across the internet.\n\nWhile made in China, the app is available in multiple languages, including English. DeepSeek soared to the top of Apple's App Store chart over the weekend and remained there as of Monday.\n\nThe company said it experienced some outages on Monday affecting user signups. \"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" DeepSeek said in a statement.\n\nDeepSeek is fully available to users free of charge. By contrast, ChatGPT retains a version available for free, but offers paid monthly tiers of $20 and $200 to access additional capabilities.\n\nDevelopers of the system powering the DeepSeek AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published a research paper indicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors do.\n\nDeepSeek also says that it developed the chatbot for only $5.6 million, which if true is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by U.S. companies in the sector.\n\n\"The lower cost to train DeepSeek means it can be offered at a lower cost,\" Oren Etzioni, CEO of Allen Institute for AI and a computer science professor at the University of Washington, told ABC News. \"That puts pressure on other companies to lower their prices.\"\n\nDeepSeek's developers opted to release it as an open-source product, meaning the code that underlies the AI system is publicly available for other companies to adapt and build upon.\n\nLlama, the AI model released by Meta in 2017, is also open source. By contrast, ChatGPT as well as Alphabet's Gemini are closed-source models.\n\nProponents of open source say that publicly available code allows a wide community of AI engineers to identify and fix flaws in a system, or tailor it for a purpose separate from its originally intended function.\n\nSupporters of closed source argue that the best way to safeguard AI is to keep the computer code private so it stays out of the hands of bad actors who might repurpose it for malicious ends.\n\nIn a June 5, 2023 file photo, Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT creator takes part in a talk at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel. Amir Cohen/Reuters\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek flexes the strength of the Chinese tech sector in an industry previously viewed by many analysts as one dominated by U.S. firms, experts said.\n\nFor some, the sudden arrival of a top China-based competitor raises concerns about data security and content manipulation similar to those leveled at TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.\n\nRegarding the former users on social media have posted numerous examples of DeepSeek choosing to forego answers on topics potentially sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of anti-government protestors.\n\n\"It's clear that there's some censorship built into the system,\" Marcus said. \"We don't want governments in control of what people can say.\"\n\nBoth foreign-owned and U.S.-based AI chatbots pose data concerns, however, since users sometimes enter personal or intimate information, which in turn could be used for commercial purposes, Marcus added.\n\n\"You have to assume that anything you type into a large language model could be seen by someone else,\" Marcus said.\n\nStill, DeepSeek's low-cost technological advance using outdated chips marks a major new entry into the AI market, Sosnick said, in turn forcing people to \"rethink assumptions that they had.\"\n\nThe emergence of a relatively cost-efficient alternative to other AI chatbots helps explain Monday's dip in the share value of Nvidia, which premises future growth on increased demand for new, expensive chips, Etzioni said.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Nvidia described DeepSeek as \"an excellent AI advancement,\" noting how the firm leveraged \"widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant\" \u2013 the latter apparently referring to controls put in place by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China.\n\nEtzioni said the open-source nature of DeepSeek also could challenge the profitability of other AI firms aiming to charge third parties for access to their products.\n\n\"We're soon going to see many models built on DeepSeek,\" Etzioni said."

            "article_content": "DeepSeek\u2019s artificial intelligence assistant made big waves Monday, becoming the top-rated app in the Apple Store and sending tech stocks into a downward tumble. What\u2019s all the fuss about?\n\nThe Chinese start-up, DeepSeek, surprised the tech industry with a new model that rivals the abilities of OpenAI\u2019s most recent model\u2014with far less investment and using reduced-capacity chips. The U.S. bans exports of state-of-the-art computer chips to China and limits sales of chipmaking equipment. DeepSeek, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, reportedly had a stockpile of high-performance Nvidia A100 chips from times prior to the ban\u2014so its engineers could have used those to develop the model. But in a key breakthrough, the start-up says it instead used much lower-powered Nvidia H800 chips to train the new model, dubbed DeepSeek-R1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen up to now that the success of large tech companies working in AI was measured in how much money they raised, not necessarily in what the technology actually was,\u201d says Ashlesha Nesarikar, the CEO of AI company Plano Intelligence, Inc. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be paying a lot more attention to what tech is underpinning these companies\u2019 different products.\u201d\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nOn common AI tests in mathematics and coding, DeepSeek-R1 matched the scores of Open AI\u2019s o1 model, according to VentureBeat. U.S. companies don\u2019t disclose the cost of training their own large language models (LLMs), the systems that undergird popular chatbots such as ChatGPT. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told an audience at MIT in 2023 that training ChatGPT-4 cost over $100 million. DeepSeek-R1 is free for users to download, while the comparable version of ChatGPT costs $200 a month.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s $6 million number doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the cost of building a LLM from scratch, Nesarikar says; that cost may represent a fine-tuning of this latest version. Nevertheless, she says, the model\u2019s improved energy efficiency would make AI more accessible to more people in more industries. The increase in efficiency could be good news when it comes to AI\u2019s environmental impact, as the computation cost of generating new data with an LLM is four to five times higher than a typical search engine query.\n\nBecause it requires less computational power, the cost of running DeepSeek-R1 is a tenth of the cost of similar competitors, says Hanchang Cao, an incoming assistant professor in Information Systems and Operations Management at Emory University. \u201cFor academic researchers or start-ups, this difference in the cost really means a lot,\u201d Cao says.\n\nDeepSeek achieved its efficiency in several ways, says Anil Ananthaswamy, author of Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI. The model has 670 billion parameters, or variables it learns from during training, making it the largest open-source large language model yet, Ananthaswamy explains. But the model uses an architecture called \u201cmixture of experts\u201d so that only a relevant fraction of these parameters\u2014tens of billions instead of hundreds of billions\u2014are activated for any given query. This cuts down on computing costs. The DeepSeek LLM also uses a method called multi-head latent attention to boost the efficiency of its inferences; and instead of predicting an answer word-by-word, it generates multiple words at once.\n\nThe model further differs from others like o1 in how it reinforces learning during training. While many LLMs have an external \u201ccritic\u201d model that runs alongside them, correcting errors and nudging the LLM toward verified answers, DeepSeek-R1 uses a set of rules internal to the model to teach it which of the possible answers it generates is best. \u201cDeepSeek has streamlined that process,\u201d Ananthaswamy says.\n\nAnother important aspect of DeepSeek-R1 is that the company has made the code behind the product open-source, Ananthaswamy says. (The training data remains proprietary.) This means that the company\u2019s claims can be checked. If the model is as computationally efficient as DeepSeek claims, he says, it will probably open up new avenues for researchers who use AI in their work to do so more quickly and cheaply. It will also enable more research into the inner workings of LLMs themselves.\n\n\u201cOne of the big things has been this divide that has opened up between academia and industry because academia has been unable to work with these really large models or do research in any meaningful way,\u201d Ananthaswamy says. \u201cBut something like this, it\u2019s within the reach of academia now, because you have the code.\u201d"

            "article_content": "An AI assistant created by Chinese startup DeepSeek became the number one most-downloaded app in Apple\u2019s US App Store over the weekend, sending shock waves through Silicon Valley and causing the price of major tech stocks to plummet. Nvidia saw more than $460 billion erased from its market capitalization on Monday, a drop Bloomberg characterized as the \u201cbiggest in US stock market history.\u201d\n\nThe shake-up stems from an open source model developed by DeepSeek called R1, which debuted earlier this month. The company said that it rivals the current industry leader: OpenAI\u2019s 01. But what stunned the tech industry most was that DeepSeek claimed to have built its model using only a small fraction of the specialized computer chips that AI companies typically need to develop cutting-edge systems.\n\nOn Monday, DeepSeek posted a message on its website saying it was temporarily limiting new registrations due to \u201clarge-scale malicious attacks\u201d on the company\u2019s services.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s R1 model \u201cchallenges the notion that Western AI companies hold a significant lead over Chinese ones,\u201d Jack Clark, cofounder of the AI startup Anthropic, wrote in his newsletter. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called it \u201cAI's Sputnik moment.\u201d\n\nCheng Lu, a research scientist at OpenAI, said DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot demonstrated impressive Chinese conversational skills. \u201c\u200bIt\u2019s the first time I can feel the beauty of Chinese language created by a chatbot,\u201d he said in an X post on Sunday.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s AI assistant is currently available for free and comes with three main functions. First, users can ask the chatbot questions and receive direct answers. For example, when WIRED asked for recipe ideas incorporating pomegranate seeds, DeepSeek's chatbot quickly provided a list of 15 options ranging from yogurt parfaits to a \u201cMiddle Eastern-inspired\u201d rice pilaf, but it didn\u2019t cite any specific chefs or recipes.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s app also has a search mode that surfaces answers from the internet. When WIRED asked, \u201cWhat are some important news stories today?\u201d DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot cited the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and linked to several Western news outlets such as BBC News, but not all of the stories appeared to be relevant to the topic. Ironically, one was a New York Times story about DeepSeek\u2019s impact on the stock market.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s a \u201cDeepThink\u201d mode that allows users to tap into DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model, which was built upon the company\u2019s existing V3 model. The difference between the two is that R1 has so-called \u201creasoning\u201d abilities that allow it to explain step by step how it reached its conclusions. For example, when asked, \u201cWhat are the most important historical events of the 20th century?\u201d DeepSeek initially provided a long meandering answer that began with a number of broad questions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hundred years, so there\u2019s a lot that happened,\u201d read part of its reply. \u201cI should probably break it down by decades or major themes like wars, political changes, technological advancements, social movements, etc.\u201d DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot then went on to cite World War II, the Cold War, and the Holocaust.\n\nBut before R1 could finish its reply, the entire answer disappeared and was replaced by a message that read, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not sure how to approach this type of question yet. Let\u2019s chat about math, coding, and logic problems instead!\u201d A number of experts and early adopters have noted that DeepSeek, like other tech platforms that operate in China, appears to extensively censor topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Communist Party\n\nBut despite these limitations, DeepSeek\u2019s free chatbot could pose a serious threat to competitors like OpenAI, which charges $20 per month to access its most powerful AI models. Unlike its Chinese counterpart, OpenAI doesn\u2019t disclose the underlying \u201cweights\u201d of its models, which determine how the AI processes information. It also has declined to make public the full \u201cchains of thought\u201d produced by its own reasoning models."

            "article_content": "Uncommon Courses is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.\n\nTitle of course:\n\n\u201cInvestigating the Paranormal\u201d\n\nWhat prompted the idea for the course?\n\nMy training and professional work have been in Mesoamerican archaeology, but I\u2019ve had a lifelong fascination with paranormal concepts. In fact, I considered studying the UFO community for my doctoral research in cultural anthropology.\n\nI eventually fused these two interests in my book \u201cSpooky Archaeology: Myth and the Science of the Past,\u201d which examines why archaeology shows up so much in ideas about the mysterious and weird. Most people are familiar with pop culture characters like Indiana Jones seeking magical artifacts. Perhaps less immediately obvious is just how common archaeological topics are in paranormal and conspiracy culture.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popularity of paranormal ideas \u2013 from television shows and thousands of podcasts to UFOs on the front page of The New York Times and in government investigations \u2013 made it clear that a course on paranormal culture would be an excellent way for students to get a taste of social science research.\n\nWhat does the course explore?\n\nThe material begins with premodern ideas of magic, myth and metaphysics. The narrative that \u201cWestern\u201d societies tell of the development of the modern world is that the Enlightenment cast off supernatural thinking in favor of science. The historical reality, however, is not so simple.\n\nAs science based on observation of material evidence emerged in the 17th through 19th centuries, so did a paranormal worldview: theories about a nonmaterial or hidden reality beyond the mundane, from monsters to psychic powers. Some of these ideas were tied to older religious notions of the sacred or strange but not divine phenomena. Others were new \u2013 particularly those suggesting the hidden existence of prehistoric extinct creatures or lost cities.\n\nIn either case, the key element was that proponents of these ideas often tried to support their existence with the kind of evidence used in science, though their \u201cproofs\u201d fell short of scientific standards. In other words, the paranormal is in conflict with the knowledge and worldview of modernity but also attempts to use the concepts of modernity to oppose it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe class examines how this tension produced 20th century \u201c-ologies\u201d like parapsychology, which examines evidence for consciousness beyond matter, and cryptozoology, which searches the ends of the Earth for creatures tied to the mythic past. We also learn about UFOlogy, whose proponents have collected alleged contacts with technology and beings from beyond this world ever since the Cold War, as great earthly powers filled the skies with secretive hi-tech aircraft and spaceships.\n\nAs the class concludes, we examine how the \u201c-ologies\u201d declined after the Cold War, alongside the cultural capital of science, whose height of public respect was in the mid-20th century. Since then, proving the existence of paranormal things to institutional scientists has become less important in paranormal communities than promoting them to a broader public.\n\nWhy is this course relevant now?\n\nBeyond public interest in paranormal topics, the paranormal is entwined with sociocultural forces that have dramatically increased the role of conspiracy rhetoric in the United States and elsewhere. At their core, both types of belief claim to have figured out some kind of supposedly hidden knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the conspiracy theories that are now commonplace in American political discourse are more rooted in paranormal ideas than in previous decades. Conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination or even 9/11 were still largely within the materialist realm. People argued that \u201cthe truth\u201d had been covered up, but their arguments did not rely on metaphysical ideas. Today, major conspiracy theories involve secret cabals, mystical symbols and code words, demonic forces and extraterrestrial entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s a critical lesson from the course?\n\nEvidence must be interrogated on its own, regardless of whether it fits your perspective. I find time and again that students have a hard time approaching evidence without bias, whether that bias is conscious or not: \u201cknowing\u201d that something must be true, or must be absurd.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne person apparently makes a death bed confession of faking a famous Loch Ness Monster photo, pleasing skeptics. Another claims to have seen a Bigfoot at close range, pleasing believers. Without further evidence, both are stories: no more, no less.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t to draw an equivalence between the bigger concepts. Not all narratives are equally well-founded. But students learn how to collect evidence, rather than simply rely on their gut sense of what is plausible or not.\n\nWhat will the course prepare students to do?\n\nThis course is meant to help students discern useful and reliable information about claims and events, separating them from irrelevant or inaccurate narratives or sources. The goal is not just \u201ccritical thinking\u201d aimed at combating disinformation, though that is part of what they should learn. Students practice evaluating evidence but also develop an approach for analyzing and understanding phenomena behind it: how factors like history, culture and institutions of authority, such as science and government, shape what people trust and what they believe.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

Photo: @GhostAdventures (modified by author)\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were notable figures in the paranormal investigation community, particularly recognised for their Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) expertise. They gained fame by appearing on the Travel Channel's popular series Ghost Adventures, where they contributed to various episodes by capturing purported ghostly voices and sounds.\n\nWhat happened to the Constantino couple?\n\nOn a quiet September morning in 2015, in the eerie silence of Sparks, Nevada, the news of the Ghost Adventures couple found dead in Nevada broke out. The couple (Mark and Debby Constantino) had a darker side to their story.\n\nTheir journey from paranormal enthusiasts to tragic figures unfolded with a backdrop of domestic violence and legal battles, culminating in an event that left the paranormal community and fans of the show in disbelief and mourning.\n\nBackground and rise to fame\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were initially celebrated for their work in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), a method used in paranormal research to capture the voices of spirits on recording devices. They appeared on Ghost Adventures, where they helped analyse audio evidence for signs of ghostly communication.\n\nTheir work was not only a part of the show's appeal but also contributed significantly to the field of paranormal investigation, making them beloved figures in this niche community. Their dynamic, often seen as playful banter on the show, made their appearances memorable.

When officers knocked on the door around 11:15 AM, they heard shots fired from inside. Mark shouted that he had Debby and demanded time to \"gather his thoughts,\" threatening her life if his demands were not met.\n\nThe police attempted to negotiate with Mark for several hours. However, communication ceased after a certain point, leading authorities to breach the door using explosives.\n\nDiscovery of bodies\n\nUpon entering, police found both Mark and Debby deceased from gunshot wounds. Mark had shot Debby twice before turning the gun on himself. The investigation revealed that Mark had also been involved in the earlier murder of James Anderson.\n\nImpact on the Paranormal Community\n\nGhost Adventures couple Mark and Debby Constantino pose for the camera.

The show's cast and crew expressed profound sadness and confusion over the incident, with Zak Bagans, the host, tweeting that it was a \"very tragic dark day.\"\n\nThe event sparked discussions about the emotional toll of dealing with the paranormal, possibly exacerbating underlying personal issues.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath included tributes from fans and peers, some of whom speculated on the influence of their paranormal activities on their personal lives, though these theories remain unsubstantiated.\n\nThere was a notable episode of Ghost Adventures where the crew attempted to contact Zak Bagan's friends who passed away, Mark and Debby, which was met with mixed reactions regarding the ethics of such an investigation.\n\nDespite their deaths, Debby and Mark left a legacy in the paranormal community through their contributions to EVP and the cautionary tale of their personal lives.

Getty Images / BuzzFeed\n\nFrom true crime to historical mysteries to unexplained paranormal phenomena, I asked members of the BuzzFeed Community to share the unsolved mysteries they'll never forget. Let me just tell y'all...some of these have me extremeeee goosebumps. So, without further ado, here are 15 of the tales they shared.\n\nWarning: This post contains graphic descriptions of cases involving murder, kidnapping, and suicide.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.The Setagaya Family Murders. On December 30, 2000, two kids and their parents were murdered in their home in Setagaya, Tokyo. The children's grandmother, Haruko, lived next door, and went to check on them as they hadn't answered her calls. She found all four members of the Miyazawa family dead, the son having been strangled and the others stabbed. The creepiest part, though, is that the killer stayed in the family's home for hours after killing them. According to ABC Australia, \"He left his DNA everywhere. He left clothes at the scene. He left the murder weapon. He used the victims' computer. He ate at least four ice creams from their freezer.\"\n\nOscar Wong / Getty Images\n\nOver 250,000 investigators have worked on this case, but it still remains unsolved over 20 years later.\n\nSuggested by: u/ zoenin_out\n\nYou can read more about the case here .\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2.The peculiar case of Pauline Piccard. In April of 1922, in the small French village of Goas Al Ludu, a young girl went missing from her parent's farm. Searching had proved to be futile, and eventually, the family assumed she'd been kidnapped. That was until a young girl matching Pauline's description was found wandering in Cherbourg, 400 kilometers away. The family travelled there, identified the girl as Pauline, and brought her back home with them. The strange thing, though, was that the girl didn't seem to recognize the parents. When spoken to in Breton, which Pauline knew and spoke, she remained silent.\n\nHello World / Getty Images\n\nSome of these questions, however, were answered about a month later. According to a 1922 publication by the New York Times, a farmer about a mile out from the family's town found the body of a small, naked girl with her clothes folded neatly nearby. The body was unrecognizable, but the mother noticed the clothes were those Pauline wore on the day she disappeared. Nonetheless, the discovery incited more questions than it answered. What happened to Pauline? Who killed her? And finally, who was the girl they brought home?\n\nSuggested by: Anonymous\n\nYou can read about her case here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.The Voynich manuscript. The manuscript \u2014 which lives in the rare book library at Yale \u2014 was written in the 15th or 16th century in Central Europe. It's written in an undecipherable script and assumed to be scientific or magical in nature. According to Yale, the manuscript seemingly consists of six sections: unidentifiable plant species, astronomical and astrological drawings, biology (which consists mostly of women with swollen stomachs \"immersed or wading in fluids and oddly interacting with interconnecting tubes and capsules\"), nine cosmological medallions, drawing of medicinal herbs, and long pages of text, thought to be recipes.\n\ncolorful drawing of plants\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nmore plants drawn with writing to describe\n\nUniversal History Archive / Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nWhile it is possible the manuscript is a hoax, it would be a rather elaborate one, as it was believed to have had two to eight writers and taken years to complete. Though the manuscript has been handed down from many owners \u2014 including Emperor Rudolph II of Germany \u2014 the puzzle of what exactly it is or what it's saying has yet to be cracked.\n\nSuggested by: u/11Kram\n\nYou can read more about it here or watch the video below:\n\n4.The Lady of the Dunes. On July 26, 1974, the body of a woman was found at Race Point Beach in Provincetown, Massachusetts. She was lying on a beach towel with her head on top of a pair of folded jeans and a blue bandana. The woman \u2014 who was estimated to have been there anywhere from 10 days to three weeks \u2014 was almost entirely decapitated and missing her hands. Nobody could identify her, which was strange in such a small, tightly knit town. Detectives noticed she had extensive dental work in \"New York style,\" and sent out details of it to every dentist in the state, multiple dental journals, and government agencies, but, still, nobody could identify the work or the woman.\n\nGetty Images / Universal Studios\n\nThis was the beginning of a trend for the case \u2014 no matter what information they could gather from the woman, they came no closer to learning who she was. Her body was exhumed three separate times for blood samples to be taken, a bust of her face to be made, bone fragment testing, and DNA to be taken, but it all lead nowhere.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNaturally, there are tons of theories as to who she was and what exactly happened to her. They range from her being killed by serial killers or mobsters to her being a criminal herself. One of the most notorious theories, though, comes from Stephen King's son, who, while watching Jaws, noticed an extra who looked strikingly similar to the sketch composite of the Isdal Woman. Further, in the scene, she was wearing a blue bandana and jeans, just like the ones the body was found on top of. Unfortunately, though, Universal Studios didn't have any record of the extra, and it is nonetheless still just a theory.\n\nSuggested by: Anonymous\n\nYou can learn more about her here:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n5.The Circleville Letters. From the late '70s to the mid-'90s, residents of the town of Circleville, Ohio were plagued by mysterious, anonymous letters. The author of these handwritten letters accused the people of infidelity, domestic violence, embezzlement, and murder. For instance, the author accused a local school bus driver, Mary Gillispie, of having an affair with the school's superintendent, Gordon Massie. Mary and her husband received many threatening letters about it. In August of '77, her husband supposedly got a call from the writer and \u2014 that same day \u2014 was suspiciously killed when his car ran into a tree.\n\nNatalia Shabasheva / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe author struck again a few months later when Mary saw \"an obscene sign about her 13-year-old child.\" She noticed a box attached to the sign when she tried tearing it down, which she later learned housed a booby-trapped gun ready to go off.\n\nThe gun belonged to Paul Freshour \u2014 Mary's brother-in-law. Paul was tried and convicted for attempted murder. He was in prison for ten years \u2014 specifically without being allowed pens or paper \u2014 and, yet, the letters kept coming. They finally stopped in 1994, when Paul was released. The author is still unknown.\n\nSuggested by: Anonymous\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYou can read more about the case here.\n\n6.The \"Monster of Florence\" Murders. There was a serial killer in Florence, Italy, in the 1970s and '80s who was assumed to have killed at least 16 people. According to CBS News, the victims were almost all couples who were stabbed or shot with a Beretta pistol. Six of the couples were killed in their cars, with most of those murders having occurred during or after the couples had sex. Some of the victims had their genitals carved out, and \u2014 according to The True Stories of The Monster of Florence \u2014 one of the last known victims, Nadine Mauriot, had her breast cut off and mailed with a letter to the state prosecutor.\n\nSimonskafar / Getty Images\n\nFive men were accused \u2014 and one even confessed \u2014 however, another murder occurred while each of them was in prison. The case is still unsolved to this day, though many relatives of the victims want it reopened.\n\nSuggested by: Anonymous\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYou can read more about the case here.\n\n7.The Yuba County Five. On February 24, 1978, five men went to a basketball game at The University of Chico. The five men were developmentally disabled and one had schizophrenia. On their way home, they stopped by a local store to purchase some snacks, then headed back on the 50 miles it would take them to get home. Except, none of them ever made it home that night. According to The Washington Post, their car was found on a deserted mountain road 70 miles from Chico. The car's tires appeared to have spun, but it was working fine and still had gas. The day the car was found, nine inches of snow covered the mountain, making it almost impossible to search for evidence. Four months later, once it began to thaw, the body of one of the men, Ted, was found frozen inside a deserted trailer 19 miles from the car.\n\nIakovkalinin / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nHis shoes were missing, his wallet and money were with him, and a gold Waltham watch with the crystal missing \u2014 which did not belong to any of the men \u2014 was found at the scene. By analyzing his facial hair, it appeared that he survived in the trailer somewhere between eight weeks to two months. The bodies of two of the other men were found about 11 miles from the car outside on the opposite side of the road as the trailer. Various bones from the third man were found two days later, who was able to be identified with his teeth. The final man was not found, and it is unknown whether or not he survived. No one knows what prompted the men to leave their cars and travel so far up the mountain.\n\nSuggested by: Anonymous\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYou can read more about the case here.\n\n8.The death of Ivana Smit. In December of 2017, Ivana \u2014 an 18-year-old Dutch model living in Malaysia \u2014 was found naked and dead at the bottom of a high rise in Kuala Lumpur. According to the BBC, while police didn't suspect foul play, it was reported that she'd gone home with millionaire Alexander Amado Johnson and his model wife, Luna, that night after a party. The couple claimed to be asleep at the time Ivana fell, however, Ivana's family claimed they saw marks on her neck. Her body showed signs of bruises and trauma, and the couple's DNA was found under her nails.\n\nIt's unclear whether her death was accidental, caused by the couple, or a result of drugs and alcohol. The case was reopened in 2019 at the request of her family.\n\nSuggested by: katootje\n\n9.The Max Headroom signal hijacking. On November 22, 1987, the Nine O'Clock News was being televised as usual on Channel 9, until the signal cut out without warning. It was hijacked by a person in a suit and smiling rubber mask \u2014 inspired by the character Max Headroom \u2014 jumping around to the sound of static. It lasted for about 30 seconds before the studio was able to regain control of the broadcast. But, Max wasn't done. Two hours later \u2014 on a completely different channel \u2014 Max returned.\n\nUnlike the previous one, this broadcast lasted for a minute and 20 seconds, and included audio. Speaking in \"a voice that sound[ed] like a cartoon villain,\" Max called out the sports broadcaster he'd previously interrupted, and made various TV references while flailing and throwing a rubber penis. It all ended with Max bent over and a mostly-off-camera woman spanking his bare butt with a fly swatter. Then, it returned to the episode of Dr. Who that was airing, as though nothing had happened. Though the FBI and FCC were on the hunt, the culprit has never been found.\n\nSuggested by: u/Terrbear1013\n\nYou can read more about it here.\n\n10.The Isdal Woman. On November 29, 1970, the body of an unidentified woman was found in the Isdalen Valley of Bergen, Norway, wedged between big rocks. The front side of her body was severely burned, but not the back. All the labels on her clothes were removed, and jewelry was placed neatly beside her at the scene. Police also found a broken umbrella, remnants of nylon stockings, rubber boots, and bottles, all of which had the labels rubbed off. The autopsy showed that there were 50\u201370 sleeping pills in her system, which had not yet been fully absorbed into her bloodstream when she died.\n\nBuzzFeed Unsolved / Via youtube.com\n\nWhile the manner in which she died leaves many unanswered questions, the Isdal Woman herself is shrouded in mystery. Three days after police discovered her body, they found a set of suitcases at the train station with glasses that had her fingerprints on them. The suitcases contained some strange items, like wigs, money from various countries, a notepad with a code written on it, a tube of eczema cream, and makeup \u2014 the latter of the two having all their identifying labels removed.\n\nDetectives traced a bag they found in the suitcases from the shoes to a shop 130 miles away. An employee described the woman he sold the shoes to, specifying she was well-dressed and had the strange odor of garlic. They later learned that she stayed at a nearby hotel under the name Fenella Lorch. However, nobody by that name had stayed anywhere in Bergen, where she was found. As it turns out, the woman had gone by at least eight different names, having identification for each. They realized that the code found in her suitcase indicated where and for how long she was staying in different places. Given the details of the case and its proximity to the Cold War, it's no surprise many people theorize the Isdal Woman was a spy of some sort. However, that, and many details of the case, are still unknown to this day.\n\nSuggested by: bethowens514\n\nYou can learn more about her here:\n\n11.The mystery of the Jamison family. On October 8, 2009, the Jamison family \u2014 Sherilynn, Bobby, and their six-year-old daughter, Madyson \u2014 were seen alive for the very last time in the Oklahoma mountains. They were looking at a 40-acre property, on which they planned to live in a storage container they owned. The man who saw them claimed he saw no one else in the area that day. Eight days later, a group of hunters found the family's locked truck. Inside was Sherilynn's purse, Bobby's wallet and phone, their GPS, $32,000 in cash, and the family's pet dog.\n\nBuzzFeed Unsolved / Via youtube.com\n\nAccording to the police, there was no sign of struggle. Despite a large-scale air and ground search for the family, they were not found. Over a month later, though, local hunters discovered three partial skeletal remains deep in the woods, less than three miles away from where the Jamison's car was found. They were identified as those of the Jamison family. No cause of death was able to be determined by the medical examiner.\n\nThere are tons of theories as to what happened to the family, ranging from the elements to Bobby's father murdering the family, to being targeted by a religious cult. The theories are further fueled by the strange details of the case, like an 11-page \"hate letter\" from Sherilynn to Bobby found in the car. Bobby's father was also under suspicion, as his son had filed a protective order against him six months earlier. And finally, there were rumors of the family's involvement in the occult, furthered by some graffiti found on the storage container on their property that said \"Three cats killed to date by people in this area. Witches don't like their black cat killed.\" Still, though, what exactly happened to the family is a mystery.\n\nSuggested by: jsq86\n\nYou can learn more about them here:\n\n12.The mystery of the Boy in the Box. On February 25, 1957, a boy \u2014 estimated to be between four and six years old \u2014 was found dead in a box along Susquehanna Road in Philadelphia. He was wrapped in a blanket and placed inside the box, which had previously housed a bassinet from J.C. Penney that had been paid for in cash. He had scars suggesting previous surgeries and his body showed signs of being beaten. According to the medical examiner, he died from blows to the head. Despite matching fingerprints from local hospitals, comparing him to missing children reports, and putting out thousands of fliers, the boy was never identified.\n\nBuzzFeed Unsolved / Via youtube.com\n\nDespite DNA testing, there have been no further leads. As for the culprits, the biggest lead detectives had was a man who claimed to have seen a woman and a young boy on the side of the road, sifting through their trunk. He assumed they were having car trouble, but she waved him off. Whether or not they are connected to the case is still a mystery.\n\nSuggested by: spidermanssidekick\n\nYou can learn more about this case here:\n\n13.The murder of Karina Holmer. She was a 20-year-old Swedish au pair who worked in Dover, Massachusetts. On June 22, 1996, she and some friends went to Zanzibar nightclub. According to The Boston Herald, a homeless man was searching through a dumpster in Boston the next day and found her torso, wrapped in garbage bags. While she was reportedly seen with some men at the club, no one knows if she left with anyone or where she went that night afterward. The killer and the other half of her body have never been found.\n\nSuggested by: duckiegirl21 You can read more about her case here.

On February 8, 1965, a maid found a man standing over his bed at the Sheraton Gunter Hotel, holding blood-soaked sheets. He reportedly shushed the maid and carried them out of the room. According to the hotel's official blog, the man had checked in under the name \u201cAlbert Knox\u201d and was seen around the property with a blonde woman. While no body was found, police did find \"strands of blonde hair, nylon hose and women\u2019s underclothing,\" as well as a bullet shell lodged into the wall. Police later identified \"Albert\" as Walter Emerick, who'd snuck away to a nearby hotel under the alias \u201cRobert Ashley.\u201d Walter, however, committed suicide before the police made it to his room. The blonde woman's body was never found, nor was anyone who matched her physical description reported missing.\n\nChris Clor / Getty Images/Tetra images RF\n\nThe hotel claims that multiple hotel employees have heard strange noises, seen apparitions, and even seen \"unexplained figures\" in their photographs around the hotel and room 636 in particular.\n\nSuggested by: Anonymous\n\nYou can read more about the case here.\n\n15.The \"Bloody Benders\" of Labette County, Kansas. They were believed to be one of the first serial killer families in America. In the 1870s, the family of four ran a one-room inn and sold supplies in a small town in Kansas. People began to go missing, but nothing was formally looked into until the brother of an up-and-coming politician, Alexander York, disappeared. In the search for his brother, York interviewed the Benders and called them \"odd and hostile,\" but didn't outright accuse them. Instead, he decided to search every home in the town so as not to alert them.\n\nHistorical / Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThe details after this become a bit fuzzy. After speaking to York, one source said the Bender family fled from their homes, knowing they would soon be caught for their crimes. Another source claimed they seemingly abandoned their homes out of nowhere, and townspeople searched it believing they'd become the latest victims. Either way, the townspeople certainly weren't expecting what they found in the cabin. There was a trap door in the floor, which led to the flood-soaked floor of the cellar. Between the cellar, their well, and a nearby orchard field, eleven bodies in total were found, all with their skulls smashed in. People reported seeing the parents flee to Missouri and the kids to Texas via trains, and locals occasionally reported their whereabouts, the family was never formally caught or tried.\n\nSuggested by: u/Hauser717\n\nYou can read more about them here.\n\nNow it's your turn!

            "article_content": "Earth's biggest hidden mountains revealed deep beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean\n\nScientists find mysterious \"islands\" beneath Earth with unpredictable seismic behavior\n\n\n\nUnusual seismic behaviour revealed Earth's deepest secrets\n\nAlso Read:\n\nScientists have discovered two enormous structures deep inside Earth whose sizes are forcing scientists to rethink the way they see the inside of their planet, at the boundary between Earth's core and the mantle, beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean, these \"islands\" described as continent-sized regions whose temperatures are thousands of degrees higher than the average temperature of the surroundings. According to new research from Utrecht University, these structures are not only gigantic but also old, with origins at least half a billion years ago. The discovery raises new questions about the geological history of the planet and the forces shaping its interior, offering fresh insights into Earth's dynamic evolution.The world's largest mountains have been found deep inside Earth, according to a landmark paper published in the journal Nature today. These giants are some 100 times higher than Mount Everest, rising 1,000 kilometers, while Everest's peak is about 8.8 kilometers above the sea. Researchers estimate that these mountains are at least half a billion years old, dating back to the Earth's formation, over four billion years ago.Scientists say the mountains are at least 500 million years old and probably date back to Earth's origin. Surrounding the mountains is tectonic debris that comes from subduction, in which one tectonic plate is sunk beneath another. Seismic shockwaves have led scientists to reveal these giant land masses hidden in Earth's core and map its interior. The lead researcher, Dr. Arwen Deuss, does not know the origin of these mountains; it is a matter of whether they are transient structures or an old age mountain. This new discovery shook the understanding that existed within geology and further revealed the dynamics into the history of the Earth's interior.LLSVPs Large Low Seismic Velocity Provinces Large blobs of unknown, mysterious material lurking deep beneath our Earth's surface lie at the core-mantle boundary beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean. Enormous \"islands,\" they are found surrounded by a \"graveyard\" of cold sunken tectonic plates descended through the mantle via subduction. Seismic waves are slowed down as they travel through Earth's interior because of its very high temperatures in these regions.In a new study, researchers Arwen Deuss and Sujania Talavera-Soza approached things differently. Instead of measuring just the slowdown of seismic waves, they measured the waves' damping, or how much energy the waves lose as they travel. Contrary to their expectations, they found that the LLSVPs caused minimal damping, making seismic waves unusually loud, while the surrounding cold tectonic plate graveyard dampened the waves more, offering new insights into Earth's deep interior.The LLSVPs have remained enigmatic with deep, puzzling features located deep in Earth. Located near the boundary between Earth's core and its mantle, LLSVPs are hotter than surrounding tectonic plates. Analyzing seismic waves did something surprising; their energy dissipation or loss due to friction with Earth was lower compared to what has been considered usual, thereby causing the sound emitted to be surprisingly louder than other seismic events.Differently, the cold tectonic plate graveyard exhibited tremendous damping where the waves could be described to be softer. This was contrary to previous assumptions set forth that the upper mantle would dampen the waves. The scientists believe that the LLSVPs are much older and include bigger grain minerals that take less energy absorbed, meaning that explains their unusual seismic response."

This phenomenon, now termed a \"structured continuum emission,\" offers fresh insight into the aurora borealis\u2019 complexities.\n\nAurora's Hidden Companion\n\nThe unusual pale patch often appears alongside dynamic auroras. Dr Emma Spanswick, a physics professor at the University of Calgary, led the study. \u201cThis patch is intricately linked with the aurora,\u201d she explained. Researchers have now confirmed it is a heat source, making the aurora even more complex.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhile previously noted in scientific records, its nature remained a mystery. Published in Nature Communications, the study marks the first clear explanation.\n\nRole of Advanced Camera Technology\n\nThe discovery relied on cutting-edge camera sensors capturing true-colour images. Dr Spanswick highlighted how advancements in digital photography have benefited science. \u201cModern sensors, now commercially available, help identify such celestial phenomena,\u201d she said.\n\nThe team also drew connections to STEVE, another sky phenomenon. Unlike STEVE\u2019s separate mauve ribbon, this patch blends into auroras.\n\nStudent Involvement Sparks Future Research\n\nThree University of Calgary students contributed significantly to this study. Undergraduate Josh Houghton played a key role in data analysis. \u201cIt was an incredible learning experience,\u201d he said. Houghton will continue this research as part of his honours thesis and future master\u2019s degree.\n\nThis finding highlights how collaboration and technology advance our understanding of cosmic mysteries."

            "source": "The Drum",
            "article_content": "Be they the industry\u2019s biggest players or the growing cast of upstarts seeking to steal their glory, 2025 promises to be a transformative year for agencies.\n\nSo, to coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, each day this week we are spotlighting agencies that we believe are poised to make a major impact through their work and activities in the months ahead.\n\nThe featured agencies, which we are revealing in a series of articles published each day this week, hail from all corners of the world and represent a diverse range of specialisms. Some are well-established networks, others up-and-coming indies. But what they all have in common is that they have earned The Drum Recommends status based on their achievements in 2024.\n\nSo delve in now as we hear from our first 10 Agencies to Watch about how they are planning to tackle what promises to be one of the most intriguing and potentially disruptive years the marcomms business has ever seen.\n\nOne of the key players in the Stagwell stable, the New York-based \u2018technology-first creative agency\u2019 is positioning itself at the forefront of the marketing AI race.\n\nCode and Theory\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDan Gardner, co-founder: AI transformation is CX transformation. CX is about to go to a new level as AI will allow a brand to simulate real-time, human-like interactions. Most people see this as chatbots, but it\u2019s more than that. The old constructs of the internet will be reinvented in a meaningful way that offers value to consumers by not only delivering information but also communicating with them on an emotional level. This is where the genuine innovation opportunity lies: combining technology and creativity for superior customer experiences.\n\nCMOs, CIOs and CTOs will finally sit at the same table, not because they want to, but because they have to. AI, data, and customer experience are crashing into each other so violently that no one department can own the process any more. The only way forward is collaboration, and the stakes are too high to ignore. Companies that fail to unite these roles will see competitors blow past them with speed and agility.\n\nPublishers will take the lead with technology. Building a sustainable future for publishers involves focusing on brands as a differentiator, regaining control over distribution (and data) and integrating AI to amplify human ingenuity. This will allow publishers to build genuine ecosystems of trust and deliver the kind of storytelling experience that will resonate, ensuring the industry\u2019s place as a cornerstone of informed societies.\u201d\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGardner: Building AI accelerators. We made ourselves \u2018Client Zero\u2019 with AI \u2013 because how can clients trust us to transform their businesses if we haven\u2019t mastered it ourselves? We\u2019re deploying 19 AI platforms (so far) \u2013 everything from OpenAI (also a client) to Midjourney and Adobe Firefly (another client).\n\nExpanding our network in terms of skillset and scale. Stagwell strategically decided to align all of its digital transformation agencies under the Code and Theory Network to deliver unparalleled creative and technology capabilities at scale. Together, we\u2019re positioned to deliver comprehensive value for clients from concept to continuity, serving as strategic partners in AI-driven transformation. Last month we added to the network and to our global aspirations by acquiring Create. Group, the leading digital agency based in the UAE. Expect to see our network only grow stronger in the coming months.\n\nFocusing on verticalization. We\u2019re going big on verticalization in 2025. This has a dual effect: it gives our clients confidence knowing their assigned team has deep industry expertise, and it imbues team members with an opportunity to develop a distinct skill set.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGardner: NBC \u2018Powering the future of data journalism\u2019: With trust in media at an all-time low, NBC partnered with Code and Theory to reimagine its election coverage Big Board, ensuring precision and credibility throughout the most consequential election in a generation (and beyond).\n\nNFL \u2018No Flags, Just Wins\u2019: The NFL dominates American sports \u2013 it accounted for 93 of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in all of 2023. But even as the nation\u2019s most-watched sport, the NFL needed to modernize its app to bring the game closer to its die-hard fan base and new fans alike. So the NFL called an audible and called in Code and Theory to transform its app into more than just a game-day companion, but an experience that fuels the rhythm of the game \u2013 every play, day and week, on- and off-season.\n\nYeti \u2018Map The Gaps\u2019: Google has mapped 98% of the world, 100 countries and 10m miles of concrete roads. But naturally, wilderness enthusiasts prefer the paths less paved. For Yeti, this posed an opportunity to take the Hopper M20 (our most versatile cooler yet), map hidden trails across the globe and make the outdoors more accessible to everyone. We built, designed and launched Map The Gaps \u2013 A Yeti campaign to take Google Street View way off the street, showing the world where the Hopper was built to go and inspiring Street View users around the world to explore the paths less paved.\n\nThe 600-strong agency network was acquired by Accenture Song in April 2024 and has continued to go from strength to strength, as recognized in being named Agency of the Year (250+ staff) at The Drum Awards for Agency Business.\n\nUnlimited\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nChris Mellish, group chief executive officer: In 2025, the industry will be shaped by rapid technological advancements, but without a deep understanding of people and channels, tech risks becoming noise. While AI is top of mind, it must be used carefully \u2013 not as a lazy answer to every question, but as a tool to drive efficiencies, deliver better insights, and ultimately create more impactful work for brands.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMellish: This year is going to be very busy for all the right reasons! Last year, TMW alone won 24 pitches, totaling \u00a37.9m in new revenue, including Suzuki, Oak Furnitureland, People\u2019s Postcode Lottery and Rail Delivery Group. We have a bit of a hot streak going on in the new business front across all our brands \u2013 our research agency, Walnut Unlimited, B2B communications and content marketing agency, Nelson Bostock and healthcare comms agency, Health Unlimited. We are now the go-to CRM agency of record for McDonald\u2019s \u2013 our first with Accenture Song. This is just the beginning of what\u2019s to come.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMellish: Lots of work to be proud of. From our integrated creative agency TMW\u2019s work for Suzuki Swift \u2018The Best Kept Secret on the Road\u2019 defying category norms against increasingly formulaic car ads, to our Pride in London work launching last year\u2019s festival with a visual style as daring, fearless and authentic as the community themselves.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nNobody knows Kraft Heinz better than its in-house agency, whose string of hit-making work cleverly leveraging the company\u2019s brand equity shows no sign of stopping.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nPlaying it safe isn\u2019t an option any more. This year, it\u2019s all about brands making moves that people can\u2019t stop talking about. \u2018Culture Sparks\u2019 are the way forward \u2013 those unexpected moments that break through the noise and leave an impact.\n\nBrands are also bringing creativity closer to home. The shift to incorporating an in-house model is real, and it\u2019s not just about speed \u2013 it\u2019s about being in sync. When creative teams live the brand\u2019s ambition every day, the work becomes sharper, more agile, and more authentic.\n\nRelevance is the ultimate flex in 2025. It\u2019s not about chasing trends but creating them.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nOur growth is proof that bringing together the power of creativity with direct connection to brand teams and strategy works at The Kitchen North America. In just three years, we\u2019ve gone from four to 19 brands and 35 to 135+ powerhouse creatives across two offices. We now work on 70% of the media plan for 90% of the brands, crafting full 360 campaigns, social-first content and cultural moments that hit different. As the creative agency of record for select brands, we don\u2019t just answer briefs \u2013 we create them. This isn\u2019t just growth; it\u2019s impact, built on trust and bold ideas that keep Kraft Heinz ahead of the curve.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe brought nostalgia back with the Napoleon Dynamite x Ore-Ida campaign, proving that tater-tot-protecting pants do exist. The Oscar Mayer\u2019s Bologna Song became a literal form of payment, and when a viral moment such as Dua Lipa\u2019s Pickle x Diet Coke popped off, we didn\u2019t just watch \u2013 it sparked an idea for Claussen to launch \u2018Just the Brine\u2019 within days.\n\nNow entering its fifth year, Fight or Flight is soaring thanks to its highly creative campaigns for B2B brands. The London-based outfit was the third-placed Independent Agency of the Year at The Drum Awards Grand Finale 2024.\n\nFlight or Fight\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDavid Woodward, co-founder: As the influence of brand inside B2B organizations rises, one thing we\u2019re seeing is closer alignment between the brand and communications teams. Increasingly, B2B brand campaigns are being driven by earned tactics, and vice versa, comms teams are more frequently being tasked with promoting and explaining brand messages. We\u2019re still seeing more traditional uses of B2B comms (for example, to support product), but in particular, this \u2018culture swap\u2019 of brand and comms is leading to better, more noticeable, more memorable and more emotively arresting work.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWoodward: We see 2025 as a continuation of our aggressive expansion into new markets and new opportunities. In 2024, alongside significant expansion in the UK, Fight or Flight achieved almost 100% growth in North America, driven partly by brand-level engagements for AI companies in sectors such as life sciences and HR. We expect the fast rate to continue as we further diversify our sector offerings into fintech and ESG.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWoodward: We\u2019re particularly proud of our work for St John Ambulance, which wanted to encourage more people and workplaces to take its life-saving CPR training. Our research found that a third of men were too embarrassed to give a woman CPR, with potentially life-threatening consequences.\n\nWe created the world\u2019s first life-saving bra \u2013 The CPR Bra \u2013 which included simple visual prompts on how to perform CPR on a woman. We then persuaded celebrities to wear the bra and help close the CPR gender gap. Our story went pretty much everywhere, including a 13-minute live slot on BBC Breakfast, turning ER into PR.\n\nOur campaign for DrDoctor focused on \u2018the DNA problem.\u2019 DNAs (Did Not Attends) are patients who miss their hospital appointments. In the UK, there are 7 million DNAs every year and they cause huge operational issues for an already stretched NHS. To help Hospital Trusts understand why DNAs happen, we created DoNnA, the world\u2019s first AI patient, trained on data taken from the largest-ever survey of DNA patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelmed by the bullish Dimi Albers, the Amsterdam-headquartered agency has expanded into a global powerhouse with a presence in 30 offices across Europe, North America and Latin America.\n\nDept\n\nDimi Albers, global CEO: What trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nIn 2025, we\u2019ll finally see AI move from an efficiency and cost-cutting tool to a force to reimagine how businesses operate, make decisions, and interact with consumers. As AI transformation takes center stage \u2013 and swift, strategic, and solutions-oriented applications of AI become a priority \u2013 the organizations that enable their people to transform with AI will distinguish themselves in an emerging sea of sameness.\n\nAlbers: What does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nRebels with a B Corp cause: we are purpose-driven and invested, committed to building lasting client relationships and positively impacting culture, brands, and the world. We\u2019re the first global agency to be B-Corp certified, and we\u2019re currently undergoing recertification \u2013 a first in the industry. This means we\u2019re building the plane as we fly it. While the agency world has been helping other brands sell sustainability (sometimes greenwash) for ages, it\u2019s only been in the past few years that the industry has started to look inward and think about sustainability, ethics, and inclusion practices within our industry. Being a part of the B Corp Community helps us do that \u2013 and especially at our size, has helped us build the muscles around how to do that early.\n\nAlbers: What work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nFor Just Eat Takeaway, a cross-discipline team of 35 creatives, technologists and producers brought fans of Squid Games together on a multisensory campaign spanning above-the-line, experiential, influencers and an AI-powered game.\n\nFor Cosnova, we built Kenna, an AI-enabled virtual assistant that can help customers explore new products and trends. Kenna is available across multiple channels including social, events, and POS.\n\nIn partnership with Coca-Cola, we created \u2018Neon Nights,\u2019 an AI-powered short story about a boy named Max. Using 12 generative tools and with over 600 hours of production, the film was submitted to Runway\u2019s AI Film Festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by recently secured private equity investment, the ambitious UK-based social media and influencer agency is now targeting the US market.\n\nCoolr\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAdam Clyne, chief executive officer: Predictions for 2025? From a social media agency owner? Really?! We\u2019re only three weeks into the year, and already we\u2019ve seen Meta replace fact-checking with community notes, a TikTok ban that lasted all of 12 hours, and Instagram switching up the grid layout\u2026 yet again. And that\u2019s before we even consider the broader macroeconomic and political shifts \u2013 from the Middle East and Ukraine to a new president in the US, and here at home, a government grappling with economic challenges.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: predicting trends when everything feels in constant flux is no easy task. But if I had to point to one key trend, it\u2019s this: the marketing community will need to embrace the chaos! We\u2019ll need to get comfortable operating in an environment of constant change, navigating uncertainty, and staying agile. Plans will evolve, and both agencies and clients will need to collaborate more closely than ever to adapt to external forces.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nClyne: 2024 was a phenomenal year for Coolr. The agency grew by almost 75% and towards the end of the year we secured investment from Growth Capital Partners, a leading private equity firm, to help scale Coolr to the next level.\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant investments in people and technology to strengthen our strategic capabilities \u2013 from insights and planning to cutting-edge measurement. As we approach a headcount of 150 full-time employees in the UK, we\u2019re focused on creating a robust operational structure to support our growth.\n\nThe big milestone for 2025? Expanding Coolr into the US. We\u2019re actively building a comprehensive plan to take our proposition across the Atlantic. It\u2019s an exciting step, and we\u2019re determined to make Coolr a major player in the US market.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nClyne: 2024 was filled with creative highlights that we\u2019re incredibly proud of. We teamed up with Martine McCutcheon and Lidl to put a fresh spin on Gina G\u2019s classic song, creating \u2018Oh, Ah, Just a Lidl Bit!\u2019 \u2013 a campaign that set social media alight and delivered a standout moment for supermarkets.\n\nFor Deliveroo, we championed local restaurants with the \u2018Local\u2019 campaign, working alongside Top Jaw and nano influencers to celebrate independent food businesses across the UK.\n\nAnd with Bupa, we sparked vital conversations about mental health, particularly focusing on the 58% of men who struggle to open up about these issues. It was work that truly mattered, and we were proud to play a role in starting those important discussions.\n\nThe Omnicom media agency has developed an uncanny knack for working on some of the most talked-about campaigns of recent times, including the acclaimed Barbie movie media blitz and Jaguar\u2019s hotly debated \u2018Copy Nothing\u2019 makeover rollout.\n\nHearts and Science\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nGarrett O\u2019Reilly, chief executive officer: AI will likely feature heavily as it\u2019s already a focal point for lots of people and its transformational impact will continue into 2025. One particular area I think it will start to tangibly impact will be AI-driven search. The growing prevalence and usage of AI assistants on devices will grow and will have profound disruptive effects on consumer behavior and fundamentally change how people find answers to all sorts of questions. Brands will need to optimize sales and their purchase funnels in accordance with that and we\u2019ll have to adapt our services to help clients adjust to (and win in) this new reality.\n\nIf the first few weeks of 2025 are indicative of what\u2019s to come, there will also be uncertainty in policies and platform governance. In the face of this, our industry must remain focussed on responsible marketing \u2013 even if this centers on self-control and self-governance over third-party regulation. This means it\u2019s on us, as an industry, to foreground all aspects of responsible marketing: diversity, equity, inclusion, environmental sustainability, data protection and ethical investment practices.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m optimistic that this shifting landscape will drive greater media diversification as we find new ways to deliver value for clients. Agencies will play a critical role in guiding brands toward more innovative solutions, new partnerships and experimentation.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nO\u2019Reilly: We\u2019re particularly excited to continue leveraging our sponsorship of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, ensuring its huge bank of empirical evidence, research and insights benefit both our agency and our clients. This will include evolving our industry-leading Category Entry Points tool, which is driving business growth for an increasing range of clients.\n\nOur Access All Agency initiative will return for a second year \u2013 bigger and better. The program, launched as an educational initiative for rising stars among our media owner partners, aims to deepen their understanding of how agencies operate and thus drive greater collaboration.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nO\u2019Reilly: 2024 was our most successful year to date in terms of industry awards, and that speaks volumes. But what\u2019s particularly pleasing was lots of our work became part of wider culture and in doing so generated disproportionate visibility for our clients\u2019 brands.\n\nA big focus for us was delivering the biggest account transition in the UK for over a decade as we onboarded Allwyn. While this was a great success in operational terms, we\u2019re immensely proud of the work we\u2019ve already delivered for them this year. The highlight of 2024 for me has to be supporting Team GB and ParalympicsGB. Our work drove a double-digit rise in consideration for the brand and every ticket sold contributed to the UK\u2019s haul of 189 medals.\n\nIt was also great to be part of one of the most talked about campaigns of the year. Our work with Jaguar on its Copy Nothing campaign earned the title of YouGov\u2019s \u2018most improved brand\u2019 in December, outperforming all the Christmas ads\u2026. And there\u2019s still the actual car to come.\n\nThe female-led agency has the US in its sights having made its mark with eye-catching brand experiences for the likes of McDonald\u2019s, Netflix and Volvo in its UK home market.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nLouisa O\u2019Connor, managing director: Collective experiences will define 2025 \u2013 people value shared emotions and memories, and brands are seeing the impact this has on their resonance. We\u2019re also seeing the rise of the common influencer, which is reshaping marketing strategies; consumers are becoming the heroes versus paid creators, driven by the demand for authenticity. I think we\u2019ll also see nostalgia remain a key trend, with the focus shifting from retro aesthetics to simplification and a need to go back to basics as the tech world can feel overwhelming.\n\nIn experiential marketing, we see a lot of tech used for tech\u2019s sake. However, brands are moving away from that to focus on the human aspect, tapping into the niche needs of the individual instead of the masses. Consumers crave simplicity and look for brands to alleviate their pain points, which is now influencing how we design experiences. It\u2019s less about what an activation will look like on a camera and more about the emotion that an experience can create.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nO\u2019Connor: This will be our fourth year of trading, and as we expand, we have two main priorities. Firstly, we are focused on growing our content and broadcast team. Working with many social-first brands, we want to push our live streaming, content creation, scriptwriting and show curation capabilities. Secondly, the US is calling. Having activated there a few times already, we believe now is the time to solidify our presence and serve our existing US clients more holistically. Some of the most exciting events in the world are hosted there, so it\u2019s a no-brainer for us to expand our offering and bring our Seen Presents way to the US market.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nO\u2019Connor: It was our second year delivering Netflix\u2019s presence at Cannes Lions, where we brought seven different titles to life in unique and participatory ways. Not only does this project showcase our team\u2019s creativity, but it also blends our strategy, content and production capabilities to deliver something truly spectacular. It\u2019s a huge logistics and production challenge: building six floors above the Croisette, with crane-only access, while the team is completely exposed to the elements.\n\nWe ended 2024 preparing for Live Fest \u2013 one of the biggest events in TikTok\u2019s calendar \u2013 consisting of four live events in six days and logistics for 600 creators from around the world. From hospitality, activations, complex live streaming, red carpet logistics, RFID systems and talent sourcing and booking \u2013 it truly touched every area of our business. It was a mammoth effort and a career highlight for us all.\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

It\u2019s time to show that the power of emotion can be applied just as effectively in performance media as in storytelling formats. At AMV we\u2019ve built a proprietary data tool called Kaleidoscope, which allows us to track consumer emotions at scale by time, day of the week and by geography \u2013 giving us an emotional lens which can be overlaid onto demographic data.\n\nLearn from AI, then break the rules: We see AI is a powerful way of quickly getting to creative ground zero. But we have to remember that its output is limited by convention and the data available to it \u2013 this grounds it in uniformity, not bravery. AI can accelerate the beginning of the creative process by showing us the expected, then giving us the confidence to break the rules and do something stand out. Afterall, no AI would have told us the creative way to launch new Sheba Gravy Pouches was by pitting \u201ccatfluencers\u201d against each other in the ultimate Gravy Race.\n\nBeyond inclusivity to accessibility: It\u2019s time to stop seeing accessibility as a creative hindrance and see it as a creative tool we can use to make the experience richer for all. It\u2019s no longer enough to make your cast and production crew inclusive, your output must be accessible too. It\u2019s a belief we\u2019ve pushed on our Curry\u2019s C4 diversity win and an ethos we\u2019re now rolling out across the agency briefing and production process.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nXavier Rees, group CEO: Last year, we rediscovered our best selves \u2013 a powerhouse of strategy and creativity. We were back in the room for some of the industry\u2019s most competitive pitches, securing four major account wins in the last four months of 2024 alone, including Mercedes F1 Team, E.ON Next and Philips Personal Care. And we continued to craft impactful and effective work that real people love for clients, including Guinness\u2019 largest-ever global campaign, more taboo-breaking campaigns for Bodyform, and bold work for Currys, which is really impacting on sales.\n\nIf last year was about setting the stage for success, 2025 is about delivering on that promise. In January, we strengthened our Executive Leadership Team with Jo Arden joining as group chief strategy officer and Jemima Monies as group chief growth officer. The roles further consolidate our focus on driving business transformation and creative excellence across AMV BBDO and Redwood BBDO. Jo and Jemima will work alongside the Leadership Teams of both agencies, including AMV BBDO joint chief creative officers Nick and Nadia. We have new, exciting campaigns coming out for much-loved brands Whiskas, Decathlon, Sheba and Maltesers, and we\u2019re gearing up to launch our Channel 4 Diversity in Advertising Awards-winning work for Currys, in May.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nNadja Lossgott, chief creative officer: Bodyform \u2018Never Just a Period\u2019: the work sees Bodyform widening the conversation around menstruation with another viral punch. Directed by the brilliant Lucy Forbes, \u201cNever Just a Period\u201d humorously brings to life the gap between what girls are taught to expect and the reality of menstrual experiences, and how absurd it is to have been given so little knowledge about their own bodies.\n\nCurrys \u2018Beyond Techspectations \u2013 IRL\u2019: The Drum Ad Of The Day, Currys \u2018Beyond Techspectations\u2019 series ventures into mockumentary territory in AMV BBDO\u2019s film \u201cAmazing Us (IRL)\u201d, showing online shoppers venturing into a real-life Currys store and discovering the joy of shopping in person \u2013 even if they struggle to give up some of their digital habits, such as swiping right and trying to magnify images.\n\nSheba \u2018Gravy Race\u2019: AMV BBDO has enlisted eight celebrity felines with a combined 55 million TikTok and Instagram followers to compete in a bracket-style tournament where they raced each other to lick up Sheba\u2019s new Gravy Indulgence cat food. By breaking with the clich\u00e9s of pet food advertising, the Gravy Race delivered an entertaining piece of content that cut through the sea of sameness.\n\nMercedes F1 \u2018Every Dream Needs a Team\u2019: As the 2024 F1 season came to an end at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on December 8, we helped the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team to pay tribute to Lewis Hamilton in a heartfelt global campaign.\n\nRSPCA \u2018For Every Kind\u2019: The RSPCA unveile its major new brand positioning with AMV BBDO\u2019s film \u2018For Every Kind,\u2019 a rallying cry for every kind of person to be kind in every possible way to every kind of animal.\n\nFounded in 1985, the stalwart agency was snapped up by Havas in early 2024 to spearhead its B2B marketing efforts and looks well-placed to leverage its newfound scale.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAndrea Glenn, CEO: AI... just kidding. Clients are starting to realize they have a wealth of B2B opportunity in their businesses already, but organizational silos are holding them back from realizing their full B2B potential. Marketing and sales don\u2019t nor can work in siloes, nor customer and product. As such, clients look for more full-service offerings from agencies that both bind creative and media together and have the scale to do it. And they don\u2019t want CRM, ABM, web and so forth operating separately with a single partner each. Instead, they are on the hunt for consultative partners who can bring these functions together to deliver customer lifetime value. We\u2019re excited to see this unleash further opportunity in B2B, a space that remains ripe for growth for many businesses and agencies alike.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGlenn: We have some exciting plans this year, which would not have been possible without the scale Havas Media Network and Havas Group can offer. When looking at partners who could help us achieve our strategic objectives, global expansion \u2013 including in the markets we already operate \u2013 was key and this year, we are looking to increase our foothold in Ireland and the US particularly, where we will partner with Havas Media Network North America to build a full-service B2B offering to work with B2B and B2C brands. We\u2019re now in a position to provide a full-service offering to clients that straddle both B2B and B2C in North America. Our chief strategy officer will be relocating to New York to lead our North American expansion. In this context, our decision to be acquired by Havas Media Network UK last year and our shared pursuit of customer-centricity has been a brilliant mutual culture fit.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGlenn: GE Vernova \u2018How to Launch an ABM Campaign in Five Days\u2019: GE Vernova\u2019s marketing team needed to grow its sales pipeline by 4x for its new power orchestration solution \u2013 all within H1. To achieve this audacious goal, we held a kaizen (or continuous improvement) session. This involved taking our client\u2019s people out of their daily responsibilities and bringing them together around a single-minded purpose. In just five days, we identified priority audiences, began mapping accounts, created a value proposition, key messaging, and content strategy, developed a sales process, and launched 1-to-1 and 1-to-few ABM programs. This strategy garnered real results, including a x2 increase in pipeline within 30 days of the kaizen."

However, some of these work outfits have landed them in a soup with their organisations read more\n\nYoung employees are getting in trouble at their workplaces for their outfits. Gen Z has adopted a more relaxed workplace attire, ditching business formals. They are expressing themselves through their dressing style.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with Gen Z workers chasing a more casual workplace outfit. Some young workers are even bearing the brunt for their fashion choices.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nGen Z opt for casual office wear\n\nYoung workers are getting inspired by TikTok workwear influencers to decide how to dress at work.\n\nFashion trends like \u201coffice siren\u201d, wearing tailored blazers and statement glasses paired with sensual makeup and tight skirts; \u201ccorpcore\u201d, modernising the usual 9-to-5 attire with unique tailoring and quirky accessories; \u201ccorporate goth\u201d, an all-black attire, are going viral in young corporate America, as per Fortune magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a Gallup survey published in September 2023, about 41 per cent of American workers said they wear business-casual clothes to work, 31 per cent wear street clothes and 23 per cent wear uniforms. Only 3 per cent said they wear a suit regularly to work.\n\nYoung workers are getting inspired by TikTok workwear influencers to decide their work outfit. Representational Image/Pixabay\n\nMany Gen Z brands have noticed this trend among young workers and have launched clothing catering to them. ASOS, Urban Outfitters, Boohoo, and Cider offer \u201coffice siren\u201d look.\n\nAritzia has an office campaign ad on the \u201coffice siren\u201d trend featuring a tight-fitting, off-the-shoulder dress, reported The Wall Street Journal.\n\nEverlane and PrettyLittleThing also have a shopping tab for \u201ccorpore\u201d clothes.\n\nIt is not just America, Gen Z and millennial employees in Singapore are also opting for more comfortable or casual outfits than formal suits, reported The Straits Times.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThe shift towards casual business attire has been gradual as young workers navigate modern office dress codes. Many office traditions went for a toss during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAs work from home became the norm, the boundaries of office attire were further pushed.\n\nSpeaking to The Straits Times, country manager Linda Teo of recruitment firm ManpowerGroup said, \u201cDuring the pandemic, many employees had to work remotely for extended periods, leading to a shift towards a greater emphasis on comfort and practicality in daily attire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs employees return to the office, we\u2019re seeing organisations adopt more relaxed dress codes to accommodate these new preferences.\u201d\n\nA survey of American workers by Clarify Capital last year found that 75 per cent of those surveyed believed that the workplace has become \u201cless formal\u201d in recent years.\n\nThey attributed the shift towards a less formal workplace to several reasons. As many as 66 per cent of respondents said casual dress was becoming more common, about 59 per cent reported changes in societal norms and values, and 54 per cent said it was due to the influence of younger generations on the workplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Gen Z, their office attire is a way to reflect their individuality.\n\nTeo from recruitment firm ManpowerGroup told The Straits Times that young workers have a \u201cdistinct\u201d style sense that shows their individuality. \u201cThis generation tends to incorporate personal touches into their professional look, blending contemporary fashion trends with professional standards to express their unique style within the boundaries of acceptable workplace attire of their organisations.\u201d\n\nGen Z gets flak for casual office wear\n\nSome believe Gen Z is taking inspiration for office wear from the wrong places like TikTok. And they are facing the consequences for it.\n\nA video shared by one Abby on TikTok last August said some Gen Z workers are landing in a soup at work because of their \u201cinappropriate\u201d attire.\n\n\u201cThe reason that all of these kids are getting in trouble for the clothing that they\u2019re wearing to the office is because they\u2019re getting their inspiration from content creators, not from actual nine-to-five workers,\u201d she said in the clip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are so many fashion creators that are creating like \u2019nine to five working inspo\u2019 that have never touched an office in their lives.\u201d\n\nA young employee took to TikTok to share how she got in trouble for her office wear. Kiera Bohan posted an \u201coutfit of the day\u201d (OOTD) video on the social media platform from her office in which she was seen wearing a white cropped sweater, green canvas pants, and chunky sneakers. She captioned the clip, \u201crecorded this ootd at work and then got in trouble for having my [midriff] showing.\u201d Bohan added, \u201cnow looking back my outfit was not cute enough to risk it #ootd #9to5.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts told Fortune that crop tops, running sneakers and athletic clothes are a few common mistakes that employees make in their workwear outfits.\n\n\u201cAthleisure is probably the most common [Gen Z styling issue] that I see, because it\u2019s turned into some people\u2019s day-to-day wear. There\u2019s a fine-line between athleisure and athletic wear,\u201d Myka Meier, a modern etiquette coach, said to the magazine. \u201cI have a law firm I work for and the workers are all in suits. They have sneakers on, but really nice leather sneakers, not athletic running shoes. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nSome even question the hyper-sexual version of work outfits that trends like \u201coffice siren\u201d promote.\n\nCamille Bradbury, Director of HR Communication at Matchr.com, told Newsweek it was important to let employees express their individuality at work\u2014 with taste.\n\n\u201cTaste, meaning modesty and business professional attire,\u201d she said. \u201cThis means avoiding showing too much skin at work, like low-cut shirts that expose lots of cleavage or chest hair, or short skirts. I think there\u2019s a way to express our individuality without being sexual.\u201d\n\nSome say wearing professional clothes helps them distinguish between their personal and private lives.\n\nDress for the job you want, they say.\n\nAs Meier told Fortune, \u201cThe main advice I give Gen Z is that you have to dress for the brand and industry you\u2019re working for. If you work for a trendy marketing firm in New York City, then you probably can wear leggings and have navy blue nail polish. But if you work for a corporate bank, then that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

            "article_content": "Earth's biggest hidden mountains revealed deep beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean\n\nScientists find mysterious \"islands\" beneath Earth with unpredictable seismic behavior\n\n\n\nUnusual seismic behaviour revealed Earth's deepest secrets\n\nAlso Read:\n\nScientists have discovered two enormous structures deep inside Earth whose sizes are forcing scientists to rethink the way they see the inside of their planet, at the boundary between Earth's core and the mantle, beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean, these \"islands\" described as continent-sized regions whose temperatures are thousands of degrees higher than the average temperature of the surroundings. According to new research from Utrecht University, these structures are not only gigantic but also old, with origins at least half a billion years ago. The discovery raises new questions about the geological history of the planet and the forces shaping its interior, offering fresh insights into Earth's dynamic evolution.The world's largest mountains have been found deep inside Earth, according to a landmark paper published in the journal Nature today. These giants are some 100 times higher than Mount Everest, rising 1,000 kilometers, while Everest's peak is about 8.8 kilometers above the sea. Researchers estimate that these mountains are at least half a billion years old, dating back to the Earth's formation, over four billion years ago.Scientists say the mountains are at least 500 million years old and probably date back to Earth's origin. Surrounding the mountains is tectonic debris that comes from subduction, in which one tectonic plate is sunk beneath another. Seismic shockwaves have led scientists to reveal these giant land masses hidden in Earth's core and map its interior. The lead researcher, Dr. Arwen Deuss, does not know the origin of these mountains; it is a matter of whether they are transient structures or an old age mountain. This new discovery shook the understanding that existed within geology and further revealed the dynamics into the history of the Earth's interior.LLSVPs Large Low Seismic Velocity Provinces Large blobs of unknown, mysterious material lurking deep beneath our Earth's surface lie at the core-mantle boundary beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean. Enormous \"islands,\" they are found surrounded by a \"graveyard\" of cold sunken tectonic plates descended through the mantle via subduction. Seismic waves are slowed down as they travel through Earth's interior because of its very high temperatures in these regions.In a new study, researchers Arwen Deuss and Sujania Talavera-Soza approached things differently. Instead of measuring just the slowdown of seismic waves, they measured the waves' damping, or how much energy the waves lose as they travel. Contrary to their expectations, they found that the LLSVPs caused minimal damping, making seismic waves unusually loud, while the surrounding cold tectonic plate graveyard dampened the waves more, offering new insights into Earth's deep interior.The LLSVPs have remained enigmatic with deep, puzzling features located deep in Earth. Located near the boundary between Earth's core and its mantle, LLSVPs are hotter than surrounding tectonic plates. Analyzing seismic waves did something surprising; their energy dissipation or loss due to friction with Earth was lower compared to what has been considered usual, thereby causing the sound emitted to be surprisingly louder than other seismic events.Differently, the cold tectonic plate graveyard exhibited tremendous damping where the waves could be described to be softer. This was contrary to previous assumptions set forth that the upper mantle would dampen the waves. The scientists believe that the LLSVPs are much older and include bigger grain minerals that take less energy absorbed, meaning that explains their unusual seismic response."

This phenomenon, now termed a \"structured continuum emission,\" offers fresh insight into the aurora borealis\u2019 complexities.\n\nAurora's Hidden Companion\n\nThe unusual pale patch often appears alongside dynamic auroras. Dr Emma Spanswick, a physics professor at the University of Calgary, led the study. \u201cThis patch is intricately linked with the aurora,\u201d she explained. Researchers have now confirmed it is a heat source, making the aurora even more complex.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhile previously noted in scientific records, its nature remained a mystery. Published in Nature Communications, the study marks the first clear explanation.\n\nRole of Advanced Camera Technology\n\nThe discovery relied on cutting-edge camera sensors capturing true-colour images. Dr Spanswick highlighted how advancements in digital photography have benefited science. \u201cModern sensors, now commercially available, help identify such celestial phenomena,\u201d she said.\n\nThe team also drew connections to STEVE, another sky phenomenon. Unlike STEVE\u2019s separate mauve ribbon, this patch blends into auroras.\n\nStudent Involvement Sparks Future Research\n\nThree University of Calgary students contributed significantly to this study. Undergraduate Josh Houghton played a key role in data analysis. \u201cIt was an incredible learning experience,\u201d he said. Houghton will continue this research as part of his honours thesis and future master\u2019s degree.\n\nThis finding highlights how collaboration and technology advance our understanding of cosmic mysteries."

            "article_content": "As January draws to a close, the end of winter is in sight. As of last Friday, we've officially made it out of the 10 darkest weeks of the year. While the days grow longer, daylight saving time is just around the corner.\n\nWhen does daylight saving time start in 2025?\n\nDaylight saving time is set to begin on Sunday, March 9, 2025. In the early hours, time will jump forward by one hour from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. This marks the shift to local Daylight Saving Time (DST).\n\nMany devices, such as phones and computers, will automatically change to DST, but non-smart devices, such as microwaves and some car radios, as well as any clock with hands, will likely need to be changed manually.\n\nWhat does daylight saving time mean?\n\nThe end of daylight saving time means there will be more light in the morning and it will get dark earlier in the evening. Sunrise and sunset will be about one hour earlier on Sunday, Nov. 3, than they were on Saturday, Nov. 2.\n\nFor most Americans, except those in Arizona, Hawaii, and a handful of other places, the end of daylight saving time means an extra hour of sleep on Nov. 5. It also helps the country accommodate for more daylight in the mornings in preparation for winter.\n\nHow did daylight saving time start?\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) claims a variety of other names: daylight savings time, daylight time, summer time (not to be confused with summertime). It refers to the practice of setting clocks forward by one hour during the warmer months of the year and then setting them back one hour in the fall.\n\nOne way to remember the pattern: \"spring forward, fall back.\"\n\nThe idea dates back to World War I, although some credit Benjamin Franklin for daylight saving time due to a satirical letter he wrote in 1784 stating: \"Every morning, as soon as the sun rises, let all the bells in every church be set ringing: and if that is not sufficient, let cannon be fired in every street to wake the sluggards effectually.\"\n\nTo maximize resources for the war, Germany and Austria implemented the first daylight saving time in 1916. The U.S. did the same in 1918. An outdated idea, some argue.\n\nThe general idea of daylight saving time is to maximize the use of natural daylight, according to the Almanac. This always occurs around the summer months. As the earth moves around the sun and is tilted on its axis, certain parts of the world experience longer days during certain months. For those in the northern hemisphere, like the U.S., these longer days run from March to November, with June to August seeing the longest days.\n\nFor those in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia, the seasons are reversed: June through August mark winter months and are, therefore, the shortest of the year.\n\nFull moon calendar:When every full moon shines in 2025 in Texas\n\nIs daylight saving time going away?\n\nIn recent years, Congress has faced the opportunity to stop changing clocks. In 2022, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the Sunshine Protection Act, which would make daylight saving time permanent, however the U.S. House of Representatives did not pass it and President Joe Biden did not sign it.\n\nIn December, then-President-elect Donald Trump said he aims to put an end to daylight saving time and make standard time year-round.\n\n\"The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn\u2019t!\" Trump wrote on social media site Truth Social. \"Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.\"\n\nWhen does winter end? See first day of spring 2025\n\nWinter officially ends with the first day of spring on Thursday, March 20, 2025.\n\nWhen is the longest day of the year in 2025? The shortest?\n\nThe longest day of 2025, also known as the summer solstice, is Friday, June 20. Central Texas will get around 14 hours of daylight.\n\nOn the flip side, 2025's winter solstice \u2014 the shortest day of the year \u2014 is Sunday, Dec. 21. Austin will see just over 10 hours of daylight.\n\nThe Earth is tilted approximately 23.5 degrees on its axis, and each solstice is dictated by the amount of solar declination, or \"the latitude of Earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon,\" according to National Geographic."

            "article_content": "The person behind the Pebble smartwatch, which arguably kickstarted the whole smartwatch craze when it launched in 2012, is returning to build the true successor to it. In a blog post on his personal site, Eric Migicovsky wrote, \u201cA small team and I are diving back into the world of hardware to bring Pebble back!\u201d\n\nHis announcement follows Google\u2019s release of the original Pebble smartwatch software \u2014 PebbleOS \u2014 as open source, allowing keen Pebble owners to more easily adapt it for use with modern smartphones and systems. There is already a healthy fanbase dedicated to keeping Pebble smartwatches and software going, and the open source library will help speed up the process of making old Pebble smartwatches more usable today.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMigicovsky continued to explain what his plans are for the new smartwatch:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\n\u201cThe new watch we\u2019re building basically has the same specs and features as Pebble, though with some fun new stuff as well. It runs open source PebbleOS, and it\u2019s compatible with all Pebble apps and watchfaces. If you had a Pebble and loved it, this is the smartwatch for you.\u201d\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Pebble Time Round Digital Trends Pebble Time Malarie Gokey / Digital Trends Pebble Steel Digital Trends Pebble Digital Trends\n\nHe also talked about the \u201ccore set of features\u201d he wants from a smartwatch, including an always-on, e-paper screen so it can be seen in sunlight and isn\u2019t as power-intensive as an OLED or LCD, buttons on the case, and a simple user interface built on \u201chackable\u201d software. He specifically mentions wanting to add the ability for developers to build their own watch faces for it. While these features are his wishlist, it\u2019s likely all will make it to his new smartwatch.\n\nMigicovsky calls the project a \u201cPebble replacement,\u201d but it\u2019s not certain the Pebble name will be used. Pebble was sold to Fitbit, which in turn was purchased by Google, and while the software is now open source, the name may prove more difficult to acquire. Apart from Google possibly owning it, there is another smartwatch company releasing smartwatches using the name Pebble too.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days for the project, and Migicovsky wants to complete the product specification and timeline before discussing how you\u2019ll be able to buy one. He ends by saying the new smartwatch will be exactly like the Pebble, \u201cin almost every way,\u201d which is bound to please the many fans of the original. While there will certainly be fans waiting for the new Pebble, smartwatches have moved on since Pebble shook things up between 2012 and 2016. Whether it\u2019s a Casio G-Shock DW-H5600, a Withings ScanWatch 2, or an Apple Watch Series 10, the choice is far wider and more inclusive today.\n\nSince Pebble\u2019s demise, Migicovsky founded Beeper, a universal messaging app which found a way to put iMessage on Android and avoid the whole blue bubble/green bubble social nightmare, without any security problems either. Beeper was acquired by Automattic, which owns WordPress, in 2024."

This innovation led to a significant drop in NVIDIA's stock. Despite this, NVIDIA praised DeepSeek's advancements. OpenAI's CEO acknowledged DeepSeek's R1 model and hinted at upcoming superior models, emphasizing continued investment in AI development.\n\nDeepSeek AI is making headlines because the Chinese startup has developed cutting-edge and cost-effective large-language models using fewer GPUs than systems costing billions from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. With the company's flagship R1 model performing on par with OpenAI's o1, this has spilled over to the financial markets, where NVIDIA's stock dipped to the point where it saw the biggest single-day drop in US history.\n\n2\n\nVIEW GALLERY - 2 IMAGES\n\nDespite its market cap dropping by several hundreds of billions, NVIDIA recently released a statement praising DeepSeek as \"an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling.\" DeepSeek's efforts are being widely praised because it didn't require billions of dollars of AI hardware to train.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman released a short statement earlier today on social media on DeepSeek R1, praising it as an \"impressive model\" while teasing \"much better models\" coming soon from the company. He also said that OpenAI will bring a few releases forward in response to DeepSeek's surprising and immediate success.\n\nWhile also teasing AGI.\n\n\"DeepSeek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\" Sam Altman wrote on X. \"We will obviously deliver much better models, and also, it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases.\"\n\n\"But mostly, we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission,\" Sam Altman adds, hinting that OpenAI won't be scaling back its use of countless GPUs for its training anytime soon. \"The world is going to want to use a lot of AI and really be quite amazed by the next-gen models coming. We look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond.\""

The emergence of DeepSeek, which trained its open-source AI model for a fraction of the costs spent by rivals, prompted investors to reconsider the lofty valuations placed on some European and US technology companies. Nvidia, long a market darling, suffered the largest rout in market history.\n\nDutch chip-equipment maker ASML fell as much as 12% after money managers considered whether machine-learning algorithms might not consume as much power as previously projected. That realization, in turn, sent shockwaves among electricity-grid suppliers like Siemens Energy and Sweden\u2019s Munters Group.

            "article_content": "Originally published by Illumio.\n\nWritten by Christer Swartz, Solutions Marketing Director, Illumio.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Gartner, \u201cBy 2026, 60% of enterprises working toward zero trust architecture will use more than one deployment form of microsegmentation, which is up from less than 5% in 2023.\u201d\n\nMicrosegmentation is foundational to zero trust. You can\u2019t achieve zero trust without it.\n\nIn fact, John Kindervag, the creator of Zero Trust, addressed the connection between zero trust and segmentation in the second report ever written on the topic, Build Security Into Your Network\u2019s DNA: The Zero Trust Network Architecture. In the report, he said, \u201cNew ways of segmenting networks must be created because all future networks need to be segmented by default.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re building a zero trust architecture, microsegmentation should be a crucial part of your plan. Here are the 10 things you can expect to do when starting out with microsegmentation.\u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Get visibility into all workload traffic across every environment\n\nThe first \u2014 and one of the most important \u2014 steps of building microsegmentation is being able to know what\u2019s going on across all segments in your network. How do you see all traffic between all workloads across your cloud, endpoint, and data center environments? It\u2019s crucial to be able to achieve this level of visibility at any scale without an overly complex workflow.\n\nYou can try to use different visibility tools for different segments across your network. But using multiple tools will create a fragmented view. This can make it challenging to understand behavior across all segments everywhere.\n\nInstead, find a solution that can discover traffic across all segments and display it in one view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d2. Understand how apps are communicating\n\nMost people agree that Zero Trust is a good idea, but how can you understand what traffic is required before deciding what to protect? It\u2019s not always easy to see what apps are running across your network and what ports they need to use.\n\nWith the right solution, you can discover what applications are running on all workloads and what ports they\u2019re using. This provides a comprehensive inventory of all applications and their dependencies in your network so you can decide how to enforce segmentation policy.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. Lock down your most critical, highest-risk resources\n\nNot all entry points into your network are under your direct control. While a data center for a campus network might have strong controls in place, resources in the cloud or partners\u2019 third-party access are often less secure.\n\nMany threats start from these less-secure environments because they\u2019re often left open due to human error. Any of these access points can be an attacker\u2019s first step in the door, allowing threats to move across your network to your high-value assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dotted lines represent open ports between environments which allow malware to spread through the network.\n\nThat\u2019s where a microsegmentation solution can help you secure these vulnerable parts of your network. No matter where a breach happens, microsegmentation will block it from reaching critical resources that you\u2019ve segmented. The breach will be isolated to the other side of that segment so it can\u2019t cause further damage. \u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Label workloads by business functions, not network addresses\n\nIn today\u2019s modern networks, workloads are deployed across a hybrid, multi-cloud architecture. This makes network addresses ephemeral. A workload\u2019s network address can change dynamically depending on the underlying hosting environment.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should label workloads using human-readable labels rather than traditional IP addresses. With a microsegmentation solution, you can identify workloads by their business function or ownership \u2014 such as their role, application, environment, location, operating system, or business unit \u2014 which is a lot more informative their using an IP address.\n\nBy using human-readable labels, you get a metadata-driven solution for seeing how segments between workloads are enforced that is fully decoupled from network address. \u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Decide on an agent and agentless approach\n\nWhen building microsegmentation, it's important to understand when an agent or agentless approach works best. Some solutions give you a choice between using agents or not so that you can get visibility and segmentation across all workloads in every environment.\n\nAgent approach\n\nCollects telemetry about application use on and between workloads. This allows you to control access to segments directly at the workload.\n\nAgentless approach\n\nDiscovers and enforces the use of segments without an agent.\n\nThis is crucial in environments that can\u2019t support agents, like IoT devices in the manufacturing or healthcare industries. It\u2019s also key in environments that can\u2019t use agents because of compliance requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d6. Start with a denylist model, then move to an allowlist model\n\nA common challenge teams run into when building microsegmentation is that they know the ports they want to deny, but they don\u2019t fully understand all the ports they need to allow for applications.\n\nRansomware commonly uses ports such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Server Message Block (SMB) to move across segments between workloads. But we know that these ports rarely need to be open between workloads.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s best practice to start with a denylist model. Block only the ports you know shouldn\u2019t be open and allow all others. Then, when you have a full understanding of what ports applications need, you can switch to an allowlist model. Keep only the required ports open and block all others.\n\nThis approach allows you to begin building microsegmentation by ransomware today and tightening policy when you\u2019re ready.\n\n\u200d\n\n7. Model policy before it\u2019s deployed\n\nCybersecurity has long relied on a deploy-and-pray approach. Security teams create a policy model and modify it until it looks correct. Then, when it\u2019s deployed, they pray the phone doesn\u2019t ring from broken application dependencies.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s best to test your policy before it's fully deployed. Modeling ensures your policy can be deployed safely without the risk of inadvertently breaking application dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Extend consistent segmentation across the hybrid multi-cloud\n\nIf you use a solution that can only build segmentation in the data center, then you\u2019re unlikely to get consistent security in other environments like the cloud. Segmentation should never be dependent on a single environment. This will result in a siloed approach to segmentation which will only leave vulnerabilities and make it harder to stop and contain breaches.\n\nInstead, microsegmentation needs to follow the workload as it migrates across environments. This ensures that segmentation doesn\u2019t break as workloads are hosting in different environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d9. Automate security changes without relying on human decisions\n\nMalware spreads faster than any human can type on a keyboard. It\u2019s crucial to have a microsegmentation solution that can automate policy changes as fast as a breach can spread.\n\n\u200d\n\n10. Prove security is in compliance\n\nQuantifying risk can be challenging, since securing applications and segments can involve many moving parts. During an audit, it\u2019s not always easy to get a clear picture of existing risk and how it\u2019s lowered after security policy is applied. It\u2019s important to use tools that show this before and after comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nChrister Swartz is Solutions Marketing Director at Illumio.

Guarding the tomb of China's very first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, they had stood in place since the late 200s BC; making them more than 2,200 years old.\n\nAdvert\n\nQin Shi Huang is one of the most influential people in China's history as the first leader to unite the country after centuries of regional conflict.\n\nFinds in one of the pits at the tomb (China Photos/Getty Images)\n\nNew finding at the Terracotta Army\n\nDespite being found back in 1974, work continues on the site with new finds discovered over the years since.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd now, according to the head of the excavation project, Zhu Sihong, a first-of-its-kind find has been located in the area.\n\nAn area known as Pit 1 is where the biggest find to date has been located, with 3,000 figures in an area 230 metres long and 62 metres wide.\n\nBut it is in Pit 2 - home to war chariots and cavalry - where the newfound has been located.\n\nHere a brand new figure has been located.\n\nAdvert\n\nZhu, speaking to China's state broadcaster CCTV, said: \"Based on its location, we believe this figure was likely the highest-ranking military commander of this unit.\"\n\nTerracotta horses were also uncovered (Tim Graham/Getty Images)\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe find is a life-size - and decorated - figure believed to be that of a senior military official.\n\nAdvert\n\nNow, the hope is that it could be a huge point in understanding the Qin dynasty, which only ruled from 221BC to 207BC.\n\nAccording to CCTV, the armour is adorned with detailed patterns, ribbons, and floral knots.\n\nIt is only the tenth of its kind ever to be found in the tomb home to more than 8,000 statues and a size of more than 20 square miles.\n\n\u201cThese adornments on the high-ranking officers indicate how special they are,\u201d Xiuzhen Janice Li, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford, told Live Science.\n\nAdvert\n\nLi, who worked at Emperor Qin Shi Huang\u2019s Mausoleum Site Museum, added: \"The style and colour of the adornments featured the aesthetic taste and social status symbols of the time.\n\n\"The arrangement of the high-ranking officers in the military formation reflected the military strategy, such as [the] commanding system in the Qin dynasty.\"\n\nThe uncovered army (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe tomb\n\nFound back in 1974, the Terracotta Army and the tomb of Qin Shi Huang were discovered by accident.\n\nThis was after local farmer Yang Zhifa came across fragments of pottery when digging for a well.\n\nOnce uncovered, the tomb came as a genuine surprise with no historical documentation of it ever existing. The entire thing had sat untouched, and unknown, for 2,200 years.\n\nWhile the sculptures mostly look like the terracotta they are made of, they were actually painted at the time to represent the people they portrayed.\n\nTraces still exist but most of the paint didn't last the time, with reports that some of the painted surfaces started to flake and fade as soon as they were excavated.\n\nAs for the tomb of Qin Shi Huang - which is sealed airtight - it remains unopened to this day due to issues regarding preserving what is on the inside. There is also a fear of the tomb being boobytrapped due keep grave robbers out.\n\nAs of now, all archaeological proposals have been rejected by China."

            "article_content": "For the first time, researchers have measured the shape of an electron as it moves through a solid. This achievement could open a new way of looking at how electrons behave inside different materials.\n\nTheir discovery highlights many effects that could be relevant to everything from quantum information science to electronics manufacturing.\n\nThose findings come from a team led by physicist Riccardo Comin, MIT\u2019s Class of 1947 Career Development Associate Professor of Physics and leader of the work, in collaboration with other institutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn\u2019t be obtained before,\u201d says Comin. His colleague and co-author, Mingu Kang, performed much of this research at MIT before continuing at Cornell University.\n\nNew angles on electron shape\n\nPhysicists have examined electrons for decades, but the wave-like aspect of these particles brings extra complexity. Electrons can be described not just as small points, but also as \u201cwave functions.\u201d\n\nThese wave functions look like shapes or surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces. Sometimes these shapes are relatively simple. Other times, they\u2019re tangled and tricky to measure.\n\nBy using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, or ARPES, the team recorded details about how electrons behaved as light hit them.\n\nARPES helped them pin down a previously elusive property of electrons that holds the key to better understanding their geometry.\n\nWhy electron shape matters\n\nIn usual settings, we talk about an electron\u2019s energy or velocity. Those are familiar concepts. Geometry, on the other hand, points to the patterns or forms that electron waves can take when arranged in a solid.\n\nQuantum geometry affects how these particles interact, pair up, and even give rise to unusual behaviors. One example is superconductivity, where electrons zip along a material without resistance.\n\nAnother is when electrons form orderly patterns, a bit like a collection of synchronized dancers. Observing geometry could help scientists design new materials with novel electronic traits.\n\nThe kagome connection\n\nThe team measured this geometric effect in a class of materials called kagome metals. Kagome metals are named for a repeating pattern of atoms that resembles a series of interlocking triangles. This lattice structure can influence how electrons navigate and share energy.\n\nPhysicists have long found kagome metals interesting because they host special behaviors that aren\u2019t common in many other materials.\n\nObserving the geometry inside them could explain why electrons in these metals sometimes align in peculiar ways that set off advanced superconductivity or other strange effects.\n\nARPES and quantum shapes\n\nDuring ARPES experiments, researchers shine a beam of photons on a crystal. The light pushes electrons out of the material, allowing scientists to measure those electrons\u2019 angles and spins.\n\nBy gathering that data, they reconstruct how electrons inside the crystal are moving and what shapes they form.\n\nThis method is demanding because it requires intricate equipment and specialized facilities. Yet it gives a unique window into what happens on distances smaller than a billionth of an inch.\n\nApplications and potential benefits\n\nA precise measurement of quantum geometry can lead to progress in areas that rely on electron control. Quantum computing, for instance, depends on maintaining stable electronic states while performing computations.\n\nResearchers want materials that can reliably keep these states without unwanted disruptions. If scientists understand and possibly design the geometry of electrons, they might improve superconductors or even develop electronic devices that lose very little energy through heat.\n\nWith energy efficiency becoming ever more critical, there\u2019s real value in controlling electron flow on such tiny scales.\n\nInsights from global teamwork\n\nThis study was a partnership among institutions spanning different parts of the world. Collaborators brought together theoretical and experimental backgrounds.\n\nTheir collective expertise made it possible to design, synthesize, and measure the electronic structure of a kagome metal.\n\nThe pandemic forced some members to work remotely, but it also enabled other team members to take on new roles in labs that were partially shut down.\n\nThat unexpected shift helped push the work forward and demonstrated how closely linked theory and experiment must be when tackling high-precision measurements.\n\nOne electron shape, many possibilities\n\nQuantum geometry is far richer than standard geometry we learn in everyday math. The shape of an electron\u2019s wave function isn\u2019t like a typical circle or a neat sphere. It can take on forms that twist and loop in higher dimensions.\n\nObserving that shape in a real material confirms predictions that theorists have pursued for a long time. It means those theoretical constructs describing wave functions have real, measurable consequences.\n\nAnd now, there is a proven route to measure them, so future studies might target exotic materials that exhibit other patterns or new behaviors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nScientists plan to refine techniques like ARPES and adapt them to explore a range of materials. They hope to see how quantum geometry influences conductivity, magnetism, and other conditions that matter for practical applications.\n\nPhysicists also see promise in discovering how manipulating geometry might encourage electrons to swap their usual habits for more synchronized, cooperative behavior.\n\nThat synchronization is important for technologies that rely on controlling multiple electrons at once, such as quantum sensors or memory elements.\n\nExperts say these findings will likely inspire more ambitious experiments to uncover aspects of quantum geometry we haven\u2019t been able to measure before.\n\nWith each new result, materials researchers step closer to engineering designs for the electronic components of tomorrow. The electron might be tiny, but it\u2019s revealing secrets about shaping the future of technology.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Physics.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
