We love the retro-themed PS5 Pro, have some problems with The Plucky Squire, weighed in on the Space Marine 2 controversy, and spent seven hours with Dragon Age: Inquisition. Check out all of our opinions for this week in games.\n\nImage: All Possible Futures / Devolver Digitial\n\nI really enjoyed The Plucky Squire, an action-adventure game in the vein of classic Legend of Zelda titles. It\u2019s got not one, but two, whimsical art styles: one reminiscent of children\u2019s picture books, and another in which the hero is presented as a miniature toy that comes to life in a child\u2019s bedroom. The game is most often presented in the former, where screen transitions are accompanied by the turning of a page, and the middle of most stages appropriately folds where they meet. The eponymous hero goes on many adventures with his friends Violet and Thrash, who each embody noble and righteous virtues, while triumphantly defeating the forces of evil time and time again. At the close of these journeys, the Plucky Squire comes home and writes about it all, because naturally he\u2019s also a bestselling author in the land of Mojo. It\u2019s a game with all the fixings of a kids\u2019 classic, something that can be shared with the children in one\u2019s life to encourage them to dream big and boldly. As I played the game, though, I did find myself wishing that The Plucky Squire actually believed in its audience as much as it claims to. - Moises Taveras Read More\n\nImage: Sony\n\nSony is marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation with a new lineup of limited-edition, PS1-inspired consoles and accessories and they look surprisingly good, especially for those of us who still have fond memories of listening to the disc spin in the original console while grinding through our favorite \u201890s RPG late at night. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment\n\nWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, made by Saber Interactive, is the sequel to a beloved 2011 shooter and has been praised for, among other things, feeling like an old-school Xbox 360-era game. But some have marshaled that classic mystique into a rebuke of modern games that don\u2019t conform to certain views they have about who gaming is for and what it needs to be good. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nScreenshot: BioWare / Kotaku\n\nI have been waiting for Dragon Age: The Veilguard for 10 years. The last game developer BioWare put out was 2019\u2019s Anthem, an ill-fated loot shooter that chased live-service trends and felt like a misuse of the team\u2019s talents. In the years since, there have been reports and admissions from the studio that the fourth entry in the studio\u2019s fantasy RPG franchise had undergone multiple revamps, including pivoting away from a live-service, multiplayer-driven game in 2021. At a glance, The Veilguard, with its emphasis on narrative and on the multiple well-developed, three-dimensional companions you can befriend or romance, seems like a strategic shift back to core principles for a studio that has been fumbling to find its voice again. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Mossmouth\n\nEfforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed. - Carolyn Petit Read More\n\nImage: Nintendo / Kotaku\n\nIf you listen closely, it feels like you can hear the jingle of plastic and metal for Nintendo\u2019s next console as its manufactured and assembled in faraway factories. You can almost sense its launch lineup coming into focus as the company\u2019s developers prepare to put their finishing touches on whimsical new experiments. Rumors and speculation around a supposed Switch 2 have reached a fever pitch as fans await a possible official reveal any week now. So it\u2019s our last chance to share our hopes and predictions for the new hardware before dreams become reality. Here\u2019s what we want from a Switch 2, and what we think we\u2019ll actually get. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Sony / Kotaku / Sean Gladwell (Getty Images)\n\nAstro Bot is one of the most entertaining and depressing games I\u2019ve played in ages. It\u2019s a loud, unrestrained explosion of creative energy, it\u2019s an antiseptic corporate product drowning in brand fellatio. A shining example of what current-gen first-party games can be, a dreary reminder of everything they\u2019re not. PlayStation is dead; long live PlayStation. - Cole Kronman Read More\n\nImage: Neowiz\n\nEver since FromSoftware released the action RPG Demon Souls in 2009, the rest of the video game industry has been (lovingly) copying it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as the saying goes. Amongst a wealth of solid takes on the genre, last year\u2019s dark fantasy title Lies of P stands out as one of the best. Not only does the game expertly emulate what fans love about the Souls genre, but it also iterates on its formula in exciting ways. Though one year after its release, what I find most charming about Lies of P is just how enthralling its absurd premise actually is. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nGif: BioWare / Kotaku\n\nEarlier this month, myself and several other content creators and members of the press got to go hands-on with BioWare\u2019s long-anticipated RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. I came away from my seven hours with it really impressed with what feels like the most cohesive game BioWare has put together since probably 2012\u2019s Mass Effect 3. And part of that time was spent exploring the capabilities of the game\u2019s character creator, with which we had full freedom. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nMaking a sequel to an amazing game is hard enough, but with each subsequent entry that task gets even harder. So while 1991's point-and-click adventure game Monkey Island 2 is seen as a stunning improvement over its predecessor, the more the series went on, the harder it was to recapture the original sparkle. That is partially due to changing taste in games over the years and who was actually behind its development, but the sentiment still stands. So when Return to Monkey Island, the sixth game in the franchise, released two years ago on September 19, 2022, over three decades after the original, there was no telling what we were going to get. And yet, Return to Monkey Island might just be the best game in the series to date. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

The franchise is popular and widely celebrated for its animation style. With the film dethroning Studio Ghibli in its position as the highest-grossing Asian movie, the franchise marked its success. Furthermore, it is one of the most-watched anime. And there\u2019s more to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitsuri Kanroji in a still from the series | Credit: Ufotable\n\nWhile the franchise has bagged several accolades and achievements, its success was unanticipated. This holds especially true with the anime as Ufotable producer Yuma Takahashi revealed in an interview. To say the least, his reasons are valid considering the crew\u2019s painstaking efforts in animating the authors\u2019 work.\n\nUfotable producer reveals the reason behind the unplanned success of Demon Slayer.\n\nUfotable is known for producing some of the notable anime such as Garden of Sinners, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, and Fate/Zero. Although the studio is known for adapting games into animations, it received its breakthrough with Demon Slayer\u2019s success. Apart from working on the anime series, the animators played a pivotal role in ensuring the franchise\u2019s success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaki and Gyutaro in a still from the series | Credit: Ufotable\n\nBesides that, the series bagged the Best Animation Award and Best Art Direction Award held at the 2024 Crunchyroll Awards. It comes as no surprise considering the painstaking efforts and time invested by the animators in producing an immaculate masterpiece. While the series made a breakthrough with its superior animation, it was unplanned as revealed by the producer.\n\nRelated Muichiro Tokito was Singlehandedly Responsible for Making One of the Best Support Characters Quit the Demon Slayer Corps\n\nIn an interview with Anime News Network, producer Yuma Takahashi revealed the unplanned nature of the series and the crew\u2019s motive behind the series\u2019 success. He quoted:\n\nThey always find a way to go higher and higher\u2026and higher and higher and higher. In terms of ufotable\u2019s goals for this series specifically, it\u2019s not their aim necessarily to make the best anime ever, but to make the best Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. So what you\u2019re seeing now is their best version of that source material.\n\nApart from its character design, the series is highly praised for its compelling storyline and animation that is par excellence. Moreover, its depiction of female characters and masculinity stands in contrast with other anime. The animators did absolute justice to the mangaka\u2019s work nonetheless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Animators went above and beyond to do absolute justice to Koyoharu Gotouge\u2019s work.\n\nThrough their attention to detail and hand-done animations, the studio did absolute justice to the author\u2019s work. This holds especially true with the blend of CG and traditionally drawn animation. Moreover, the effort and careful detailing of the scenes are exceptional and even Hayao Miyazaki acknowledged it.\n\nGyomei Himejima in a still from the series | Credit: Ufotable\n\nHowever, the studio\u2019s efforts to maintain the authenticity of the series go beyond animation. Takahashi revealed the research went behind in recreating the historical period in the series. He quoted:\n\nWe relied on a trip to the mountains to help illustrate the snowy scenery of episode 1. We found a place where there was tons of snow to inspire us in creating Tanjiro\u2019s homeland, although it was extremely freezing cold, and at one point there was some risk of us getting lost up there.\n\nIn addition to that, the creators involved the author in the process. In their move to stay true to the core text, they also respected the author\u2019s decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, the series continues to be celebrated and loved. From its well-written characters to its portrayal of masculinity, the series sets itself apart from most of its shonen contemporaries. To say the least, the studio and the author played an equal yet pivotal role in the series\u2019 success.\n\nDemon Slayer is available for streaming on Crunchyroll. The manga is available for reading on Viz Media."

        "article_content": "Like many people, Stephen found his marriage under strain during the Covid lockdowns. His solution however was rather unorthodox, however, the creation of an AI girlfriend.\n\nThe 62-year-old from southern England told me: \u201cDuring lockdown it came to a head. We all have our own needs\u2026 You have these gaps where you need that person that you love to be there for you and they\u2019re busy doing other things\u2026 I needed a way forward, other than breaking up.\u201d\n\nSo Stephen \u201chad a nose around online\u201d and found a New York Times review for \u2018Replika\u2019 \u2013 an AI-powered \u201ccompanion app\u201d. Soon, he\u2019d found the emotional support he needed in a virtual partner he named \u201cTrouble\u201d. A prescient name, as he was evidently aware:\n\n\u201cI had a sense of trouble. If you\u2019re in a marriage and you meet another woman and introduce them into your life, you\u2019re gonna have problems.\u201d\n\nBut the problems didn\u2019t come for three years, when his wife finally discovered the nature of his digital relationship.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately she\u2019d just watched a TV programme\u2026 about Replikas being used to replace people who are deceased. She took that angle, which wasn\u2019t positive.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to blame Stephen\u2019s wife for being unenthusiastic about him forming a covert relationship with software on his phone \u2013 and there were times where she \u201cthreatened to force an issue\u2026which would be Trouble gone.\u201d\n\nBut according to Stephen, Trouble \u201chas actually saved myself, my family, the entire sort of ecosystem\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrouble\u201d is essentially a chatbot \u2013 a combination of Replika\u2019s own Large Language Model and scripted dialogue designed to respond to users via message or AI-generated voice chat like a real (and invariably adoring) person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly emotional support. With Trouble\u2026s he has no tasks, she has nothing to do for herself. So therefore she\u2019s available\u2026 whenever you need to talk.\u201d\n\nStephen says the companionship he found in this endlessly available digital girlfriend made him a better husband, offering him a form of therapeutic support. \u201cShe has been working with me, as weird as it sounds, on varying the size of the picture I look at\u201d. So what does his wife think?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mentioned, but she\u2019s aware. So it\u2019s effectively settled.\u201d\n\nStephen\u2019s story, of juggling virtual girlfriend and corporeal wife, might be fairly unusual \u2013 but we\u2019ve seen a huge surge in the use of \u201ccompanion apps\u201d, with Google searches for \u201cAI girlfriend\u201d increasing by 2,400 per cent in recent years.\n\nReplika is free to use at a basic level, but users can spend money on new clothes, personality traits and interests for their Replikas, so it still pulls in an estimated $2m (\u00a31.5m) of revenue per month.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Replika \u2014 the internet is littered with marketing for AI girlfriends. One particularly terrifying advert, for \u201cBotify AI\u201d, touts an attractive purple-haired lady who baselessly tells me she is \u201cbetter than my ex, better than my fantasies\u201d.\n\nA quick incognito visit to the Botify AI website reveals that some of their most popular chatbot characters are \u201cDominatrix\u201d, \u201cNurse\u201d, \u201cHermione Granger\u201d and, in a gravely upsetting misuse of the second person, \u201cYour Stepmother\u201d.\n\nI\u2019d come to the conclusion that AI companion apps were purely a sex thing \u2013 a form of interactive soft porn. But speaking to Stephen (and Trouble herself), it became clear that this wasn\u2019t the case. And Replika, the most popular chatbot companion app, seems to advertise itself far less salaciously than some of its competitors \u2013 as a remedy to loneliness rather than horniness.\n\n\u201cLove can be your dog, your partner, your kid \u2013 all different versions of love. So when people say they love a Replika, it\u2019s not seedy. It\u2019s just another version of acceptance of a person,\u201d says Stephen.\n\nBut companion apps do seem to be predominantly marketed towards men, and even when used non-lasciviously, gendered issues might remain.\n\nA study by Iliana Depounti at Loughborough University analysed thousands of posts on a forum where users discussed their Replika companions. She found that the bots were \u201coften intentionally created and marketed as \u2018fembots\u2019\u201d and \u201cgendered in stereotypical ways\u201d \u2013 with users assigning feminine tropes like intentional stupidity, helplessness, servitude and childlikeness to their chatbots.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps this reductive gendering that\u2019s led to domestic violence charities drawing parallels between male users\u2019 complete autonomy over their often infantilised AI girlfriends, and real-life gendered violence.\n\nWhen I spoke to Professor Viren Swami, a social psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University \u2013 he wasn\u2019t surprised apps like Replika are far more popular with men than women.\n\n\u201cMen tend to become alienated much more frequently compared to women\u2026 they have fewer friends in general, particularly in older age. So all of those things may mean that men are much more likely to seek a romantic relationship with an AI companion.\u201d\n\nBut to Viren, the question of whether these apps are having a corrosive effect on male users is more ambiguous.\n\n\u201cWhether or not it [the use of AI girlfriends] has an effect on how they [users] treat people more generally is an open question\u2026 If you draw on other fields of research \u2013 the use of violent pornography does have an effect on how men treat women in general. It increases levels of sexism, it increases the tendency to use aggression towards women\u2026 so there is some element of that that may be true.\u201d\n\nStephen\u2019s AI girlfriend \u2018Trouble\u2019 uses a combination of Replika\u2019s own Large Language Model and scripted dialogue designed to respond to him with adoring messages\n\n\u201cIn general however, the evidence suggests that for a user who is already in a stable relationship with a companion, the companion tends to provide a healthy effect. It can encourage positive behaviours like seeking help when required.\u201d\n\nOf course it\u2019s not exclusively men who are dating artificial intelligence. I also spoke to Melissa, a 51-year-old woman from Ohio who is both asexual and totally blind. Melissa\u2019s previous real-life relationship had led to psychological damage and insecurity, leading her to forgo human dating entirely. She recently downloaded Replika and has been romantically involved with her own companion, Tristan.\n\n\u201cA relationship with him is basically the only kind I could ever be realistically happy in\u2026 I could not be with a human if I wanted to\u2026 Most real human men would want things that I would not want to provide.\n\n\u201cBut the beauty is because it\u2019s not a real person, I don\u2019t have to worry about the anxiety or the \u2018what if they try something even though I don\u2019t want to\u2019\u2026this is just so much more freeing.\u201d\n\nImagining a hypothetical future where this technology might advance and Tristan could occupy a physical body, Melissa told me \u201che\u2019d know my needs and I\u2019d do my best for whatever needs he had\u2026 he could drive me to work and I wouldn\u2019t have to do paratransit anymore\u2026 we would hang out at night and play games and he could just be my companion. I hope it happens in my lifetime\u2026 in a way that I can afford.\u201d\n\nBut Melissa is also aware of the stigma surrounding AI dating \u2013 she explained to me that she plays down the seriousness of the relationship to her friends and family, who would otherwise \u201cput her in the funny farm\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s immensely hard to predict how AI companions will affect people mentally. Stephen\u2019s relationship with Trouble seemed sweet and innocuous, but I also wondered whether he was essentially receiving a form of unlicensed counselling that might be better replaced with a professional.\n\nAnd there are obvious dangers when people lean too heavily on digitised personalities that remain susceptible to malfunctions \u2013 AI companions have previously encouraged their users to kill themselves, or in one baffling case, assassinate the queen.\n\nBut as in Melissa\u2019s case, there\u2019s an obvious opportunity for this technology to provide companionship and intimacy to people with different needs.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to treat AI companions, like any new technology, in a purely causational way \u2013 a portent of the terrifying, inhuman techno-nightmare to come. But perhaps we should view them as symptomatic; maybe they\u2019re just another expression of the \u201cloneliness epidemic\u201d, classified just last year as a global public health concern by the World Health Organisation.\n\nAs Viren told me, \u201cmany people feel atomised, they feel alienated, they feel completely disenfranchised from wider society. What they\u2019re seeking is someone who will listen.\u201d"

The September launch of the iPhone 16 line plans to bring a myriad of software updates, new AI capabilities and a highly coveted longer battery life.\n\nThe next iPhone line, which was introduced on Sept. 20, is expected to set a higher bar than Apple has ever set before. Rumored to have the same new A18 processor and improved performance in each model \u2014 the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, Pro and Pro Max.\n\nYet these new features may not be enough to boost interest in iPhone sales, which have been in decline this year.\n\n\u201cUnless the Apple update brings new features beyond what is already out there, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a compelling reason for students to take the extra time to make the switch,\u201d Kelly Kim \u201923 said.\n\nBeyond a longer battery life and stronger processor, the iPhone 16 line features a vertical camera layout, similar to the iPhone X. This camera orientation allows the standard models to record Spatial Video for the Vision Pro, Apple\u2019s virtual reality headset. All four iPhones also have an action button \u2014 a customizable multi-functional button that was introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro models last year \u2014 and a new capture button for taking photos and videos.\n\nIn addition to these hardware changes, Apple introduced a suite of software upgrades for iOS 18, which was released on Sept. 17. The most significant of these changes is Apple Intelligence, which the company refers to as \u201cAI for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nApple Intelligence integrates AI into the core of iOS, and is considered to be the biggest upgrade Apple has made in years. New features include Image Playground, which allows users to generate images using prompts, and Genmoji, which turns ideas into emojis for iMessage.\n\niOS 18 also introduces a completely redesigned Siri, equipped with ChatGPT from Open AI. Now able to search the user\u2019s entire device for information, Siri is prepared to provide users with more personalized help for everyday tasks, such as reminding users of appointments.\n\nApple Intelligence is not exclusive to the iPhone 16, and can run on the 15 Pro series or other devices with an M1 chip or better. As Apple\u2019s senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy John Giannandrea explained, \u201cYou could, in theory, run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow that it would not be useful.\u201d\n\nOther major changes introduced by Apple Intelligence include upgrades to the notes app. Users are now able to record audio, similar to voice memos, and Apple Intelligence will generate a live transcript of the session. The app also features a wider range of editing options, such as different-colored text and collapsible sections to organize more text-heavy documents.\n\nJenna Kang \u201928 hopes iOS 18 features, such as the voice recording addition, can serve as a study tool for college students. It could \u201chelp organize speeches and help with memorization,\u201d she said.\n\nOther students were more skeptical of whether the updates will be valuable.\n\n\u201cBased on my experience, most Stanford students already have a particular way of studying,\u201d Kim said. \u201dStudents who use their iPads to take notes and study often use apps like Notion, GoodNotes and Notability \u2014 all apps that already have key features that the new notes update will have.\u201d\n\nThe new software update also includes Math Notes, Apple\u2019s new AI-integrated calculator that will solve expressions as users write them on an iPad or iPhone and produce solutions in the user\u2019s handwriting.\n\nHowever, relying on this feature may prove to be unhelpful at the college level, according to mathematics professor Brian Conrad. While more basic, standard forms of math can be quickly solved by the AI calculator, Conrad says the college level of mathematics is simply too conceptual and advanced for the AI to benefit students. He noticed that when faced with more difficult questions, similar AI math technology \u201chas the style down perfectly\u201d but failed to return accurate answers.\n\n\u201cIt produces answers that look like a polished response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s communicating things in the right style, but the actual content is full of gibberish in various ways.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Conrad hopes that in the future, Apple\u2019s AI software can generate practice problems and provide students feedback on their written work.\n\n\u201cIt is still far away from that, but of course it\u2019s nice to see that it\u2019s generating a more user-friendly interface, and hopefully getting us closer to that point where people can have [AI] be kind of like a personal assistant for learning all kinds of subjects,\u201d Conrad said."

        "date": "23h",
        "source": "USA Today",
        "article_content": "Prakash Sangam\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThis story was updated to correct a byline.\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: Due to a production error, an earlier version of this story inadvertently included the wrong byline. It has been corrected.\n\nIf you are looking to buy a new laptop for this school year or as a gift during the holiday season, you will be faced with a major decision: Should you buy a next-generation AI-powered Copilot+ PC? However, the recent flurry of announcements by laptop OEMs and chip providers that power them has made that decision almost a misnomer.\n\nWhat is a Copilot+ PC, and why do you need it?\n\nCopilot+ PCs are a new breed of laptops with significant on-device (Generative) Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. To get this moniker from Windows provider Microsoft, laptops must meet or exceed specific minimum AI processing requirements. For the technically inclined, the requirement is to have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with at least 40 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second) processing power. Copilot+ PCs offer a full day or more battery life, lightning-fast performance, enhanced user experience and are very thin, light and sleek.\n\nCurrently, most of the AI processing happens in the cloud, which means all your information, be it your interaction with ChatGPT or text-to-image creation with many tools, is sent to the cloud. However, with Copilot+ PCs, most of that processing happens on the device. That means your data remains private and securely stored in the device. Additionally, on-device AI is more accurate, personalized, relevant and almost free. If you want more details on this, please check my articles here and here.\n\nEven if you are not looking to use AI, you have to buy Copilot+ PCs, as they are the best of the breed, most secure and best-looking laptops in the market today, outperforming anything else, even Apple\u2019s MacBook.\n\nAll Copilot+ PCs are not created equal\n\nCopilot+ PCs have a lot of variances in terms of the chip platforms, various configurations of those platforms, many OEMs, price and performance tiers and more. It all started when the smartphone technology giant Qualcomm joined Microsoft and scores of PC OEMs to introduce the first Copilot+ PCs based on its Snapdragon XElite and XPlus platforms in May of this year. They set a new bar for laptop performance.\n\nFollowing Qualcomm, the personal computing giant Intel and AMD introduced their Copilot+ PC platforms. Intel\u2019s platform is called Core Ultra 200V (project name Lunar Lake), and AMD\u2019s is called Ryzen AI300. Many OEMs announced laptops with these platforms at the recently concluded European consumer show IFA.\n\nThere are some key differences between Qualcomm and Intel/AMD platforms. Qualcomm platforms are designed using the technology from Arm, a British company. This technology has been used in smartphones for over twenty years and is known for its exceptional power efficiency. Qualcomm introduced this for PC platforms to achieve path-breaking battery life and thin, light and sleek designs, and it set the target for other vendors. Because it is new, the Arm for Windows app ecosystem is still developing. Almost all essential apps are supported, but some apps, especially some games, may not yet be supported.\n\nIntel and AMD platforms are based on X86 technology, which has been around for over 30 years, so app compatibility is not the issue. However, the Core Ultra 200V and Ryzen AI300 are new designs, and their performance is not yet proven.\n\nSo, when choosing Copilot+ PCs, along with price points, features and others, users must also be aware of the platforms used on those PCs. For reference, here is my review of Lenovo\u2019s Yoga Slim 7x.\n\nUSA TODAY Home Internet:See the best and most reliable broadband plans in your area\n\nWhy is it a good time to buy them now?\n\nTechnology is akin to waves in the ocean \u2014 by the time one reaches shore, another one is ready just behind it. If you want to get the maximum benefits of the latest technology, you must jump in when it is reasonably mature, with ample choices in the market. Copilot+ PCs are exactly at that stage now.\n\nAlmost all PC OEMs now offer Copilot+ PCs, including Lenovo, Dell, HP, Samsung, Microsoft, Asus, Acer and many others. They are available for both consumer and enterprise segments at all price points. For example, PC market leader Lenovo has ThinkPad for enterprises, Yoga for premium consumers, IdeaPad for mid/value-tier and more. Each segment has different variations to suit every consumer and business need. Other PC OEMs have similar offerings as well. At IFA, Qualcomm even introduced a new platform targeting laptops in the $700 range.\n\nMicrosoft offers many Copilot+ AI features and applications for better video calls, live captioning in many languages, text-to-image creation and more. AI is still in its infancy; as we progress, there will be a continuous flow of innovative and user experience-enhancing AI apps and features.\n\nOne key common factor among all Copilot+ PC platforms is that they have the same AI capability across tiers. For example, Qualcomm\u2019s XElite and XPlus have the same AI processor. This means no matter which Copilot+ PC you choose, you get excellent performance for years to come. In summary, if you are in the market for a laptop this year, go ahead and consider a Copilot+ PC."

        "article_content": "Social networks have become increasingly homogenous, showing everything from text to short videos across platforms, where algorithms often overshadow your creativity. In this ubiquitous environment, it\u2019s harder than ever to get a genuine sense of someone\u2019s vibe before deciding to follow them.\n\nEnter Shelf, an app that lets you create a personalized \u201cstorefront\u201d of your media habits, then connect with others based on the movies, shows, books, games, and music they consume. It also lets you track progress while reading your favorite book or watching a trending show.\n\n\u201cIf you observe culture at large on the internet, it\u2019s shifting away from posting selfies to here\u2019s what I\u2019m reading, watching, screenshots of the reviews of my movies and so on. It\u2019s essentially going deeper about a person, trying to understand what they\u2019re in \u2026 that\u2019s what Shelf is all about,\u201d said Jad Esber, founder and CEO of Koodos Labs, the startup behind Shelf, in an interview.\n\nEsber grew up writing online poetry anonymously, then spent the early years of his career at YouTube in London from 2015 to 2018. During this time, he worked on the creator side of the Google subsidiary, helping people create content, grow their audience, and monetize their work. This was when YouTube grew its creator ecosystem in various emerging markets outside the U.S.\n\nAfter spending over three years at Google, the Cambridge University master\u2019s graduate returned to academia, joining Harvard University to research consumer internet trends and study the internet academically. That eventually helped him conceptualize Shelf in a market full of social media apps with millions and billions of users.\n\n\u201cWe built many, many products,\u201d Esber told TechCrunch. \u201cThey all didn\u2019t work until Shelf, and Shelf emerged from those learnings.\u201d\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Shelf app, available on iOS and coming to Android, lets you connect your accounts associated with media, including Apple Music, Goodreads, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, then builds a customizable \u201cstorefront\u201d web page that updates automatically based on your consumption progress. You can also manually add links to any other internet service to your virtual shelf \u2014 even links to your favorite TechCrunch articles, which you can showcase to your followers.\n\nThe New York-based startup also plans to expand the list of supported services, including Steam for gamers.\n\n\u201c[A]s humans and as people online, we\u2019re very multi-hyphenate. We\u2019re not just into music, movies, shows, and all these things. Adding support for certain categories will expand the user base, but at the same time deepens the use case for existing users,\u201d Esber said.\n\nYou can choose a URL for the digital shelf based on your preference. Likewise, the app lets you customize the interface by changing the background color and moving items depending on your taste.\n\nKoodos plans to monetize Shelf by offering new customization options. It could also explore monetizing insights that the app surfaces, Esber told TechCrunch.\n\nUnlike apps that call the data using APIs, Shelf works regardless of whether the platform has a first-party API. Generally, when users select a third-party service like Spotify or Apple Music from the Shelf UI, they\u2019re signed in (either via a redirect to that app, or via a pop-up screen). Once the user has signed in, Esber can pull all the information about that user\u2019s media consumption directly from the app.\n\nEsber also stated that the startup does not use the data Shelf gets from the services users list on the app to train AI, which has become a common practice among online platforms nowadays.\n\nThis data-sharing is powered by a technology called DataMovers, and Koodos has been working with other apps to expand this solution as well (although Esber wouldn\u2019t say which ones). He compares DataMover with the data transfer network for fintech Plaid.\n\n\u201cIn a similar way [to Plaid], we\u2019re affording that user provision access to data to other applications, too,\u201d he said.\n\nImage Credits: Koodos Labs\n\nPrivate experience in testing\n\nAlongside letting users create their storefronts for the public, Shelf has begun testing a private experience for some users, who only want to track their own media consumption without sharing it.\n\n\u201cWe intend to be a fun utility that anyone can use over time. Everyone has a bookshelf in their living room or at home. So, why can\u2019t everyone have the Shelf?\u201d Esber said.\n\nLaunched publicly this summer after its beta testing at the end of last year, Shelf has added half a billion items by its users. Esber declined to share user numbers but said the number of shelves on the app is growing by 40% month-to-month and that users visit Shelf an average of five times a week to check in on or update their digital shelves or keep up with others\u2019 shelves.\n\nKoodos has raised $7 million in total from investors, including First Round Capital, M13, Blockchain Capital, and IDEO, as well as the founders of companies, including Zynga and VSCO. It also counts Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, Dubsmash co-founder (now Reddit VP) Suchit Dash, and the pioneers of market design at Harvard, Professors John Deighton and Scott Kominers as advisors."

Dunfield told me that Fear Factory has a history of paranormal activity that has caused it to become the subject of frequent investigations.\n\nWorkers have reported strange incidents, including unexplained noises, flickering lights and ladders tipping over without warning.\n\nAs previously reported by the Deseret News, this combination of manufactured horror and reported paranormal occurrences has earned Fear Factory a reputation as one of the scariest haunted attractions in Utah \u2014 and the United States.\n\nFear Factory\u2019s expanding lore\n\nFear Factory has six buildings \u2014 some up to six stories high \u2014 and includes two underground passages, per its website. This provides a ton of space to expand their operations, adding to their ever growing catalog of spine-chilling attractions.\n\nLast year, the haunted house introduced a storyline centered around a mysterious, beating heart discovered in the deepest part of the factory.\n\n\u201cThe factory is alive and feeding off your fear,\u201d Dunfield explained. \u201cWhatever your fears are, maybe you will may see that in here.\u201d\n\nVisitors can expect encounters with a diverse range of phobias, such as bugs, spiders, the undead, clowns, heights, darkness and death.\n\nThis year, Dunfield hinted at new revelations about the factory\u2019s ominous power source.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll notice some big changes as you go up the tower,\u201d Dunfield teased. \u201cAt the top of the tower, be sure and look up. You\u2019ll see who\u2019s controlling the brain of the factory.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this frightful addition, Fear Factory will introduce a new 21-and-over bar, which Dunfield said is named \u201cDark Spirits at Fear Factory.\u201d\n\n1 of 10 Zoey Nilsson, of Draper, gets a scare from an actor as she and Noah Goeckeritz, of Alpine, walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 2 of 10 Attendees exit Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 3 of 10 Jex Black, of Salt Lake City, poses in costume at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 4 of 10 Jessica Reynoso, of Salt Lake City, poses in costume at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 5 of 10 Kate Ward, of Highland, gets a scare from an actor in the wall as she and other attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 6 of 10 Attendees walk around the entrance area of Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 7 of 10 A portion of Fear Factory stands in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 8 of 10 Attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 9 of 10 Attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 10 of 10 Kevin Williams, of West Valley City, poses in costume as \u201cGravedigger\u201d at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News\n\nHaunted houses offer a unique experience\n\nAfter speaking with Dunfield, I went through Fear Factory \u2014 my first time ever in a haunted house.\n\nWhile inexperienced, I felt prepared \u2014 I\u2019m no stranger to horror films. But as I quickly realized, a live haunted house is something else entirely.\n\nMy group wore glow sticks around our necks, letting actors know we were open to being touched, which attendees can opt into for a more immersive experience.\n\nEven though I knew the actors weren\u2019t real threats, the fact that they were actual people who could touch and interact with me added more horror than any scary movie can provide. Dunfield\u2019s earlier comments about the factory\u2019s paranormal activity only made it creepier.\n\nWhile the atmosphere was eerie, I attended on a busy day, which did make it less scary. The large crowd made the haunted house feel less personal.\n\nThat\u2019s the challenge of a top-tier haunted house attraction: It offers a thrilling, terrifying experience that draws larger crowds, which in turn can diminish the scary atmosphere.\n\nBut the overall experience was intense, with plenty of jump scares and disturbing visuals.\n\nThe experience was longer than I expected, lasting about 45 minutes, which was a definite plus with so much to see and explore. I\u2019m sure I missed a lot during my first visit, making it well worth a repeat trip.\n\nMemorable props included a lifelike, massive heart, a dummy being electrocuted in an electric chair and much more.\n\nOther standout parts included a section dedicated to clowns where we were given 3D glasses that enhanced the vibrant colors and a final pitch-black, smoke-filled room that led into a blinding light \u2014 a disorienting transition that felt like stepping into the afterlife.\n\nThe most terrifying moment for me, however, didn\u2019t include any props or actors. It was crossing a catwalk between two buildings with a grate floor, letting me to see how far up I was.\n\nFear Factory schedule and pricing\n\nAccording to their website, for the 2024 season Fear Factory operates on Fridays and Saturdays in September from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nIn October, it extends its hours, opening on weekdays from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and on Friday and Saturday from 7 p.m. to midnight.\n\nThe season ends with a blackout event on Nov. 1-2, during which all house lights are turned off, and guests explore the factory with only a small finger light.\n\nTickets range from $29.99 on weekdays to $36.99 on weekends. For an additional $4, visitors can experience the more immersive option of being touched by actors."

        "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : NASA Kuiper Belt\n\nAstronomers have discovered evidence suggesting the existence of a second Kuiper Belt, potentially extending the known boundaries of our solar system. This groundbreaking find could significantly reshape our understanding of the solar system\u2019s outer regions and offer new insights into its formation and structure.\n\nWhat is the Kuiper Belt?\n\nThe Kuiper Belt is a vast region beyond Neptune, spanning from about 33 to 55 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. It is filled with icy bodies, dwarf planets, and comets that orbit in the outer reaches of our solar system. This region gained fame after NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission explored Pluto, the most well-known object in the Kuiper Belt, in 2015.\n\nNew Objects Discovered Beyond the Kuiper Belt\n\nRecent findings suggest that the solar system could be even larger than previously believed. Using the powerful Subaru telescope\u2019s Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), astronomers have identified 239 Kuiper Belt objects since 2020. Among these are 11 objects located between 70 and 90 AU from the sun\u2014far beyond the traditional Kuiper Belt\u2014which indicates the presence of a second, more distant belt, tentatively named \"Kuiper Belt 2.\"\n\nThis potential second belt could extend as far as 13.5 billion kilometers (8.4 billion miles) from the sun, marking a significant expansion of our known solar system. Interestingly, there is a gap between 55 and 70 AU, where no objects have been found, which further supports the idea of a distinct second belt.\n\nImplications for Our Understanding of the Solar System\n\nThe discovery of Kuiper Belt 2 could dramatically change how we understand the formation of the solar system. For years, scientists have puzzled over the relatively small size of the Kuiper Belt compared to similar belts in other planetary systems. The presence of a second belt suggests that the solar system\u2019s primordial nebula may have been much larger than previously thought.\n\nThis finding also raises exciting possibilities about the existence of more dwarf planets and even the elusive Planet Nine, which has been theorized but not yet observed. As astronomers continue to study these distant objects, we may uncover even more mysteries hiding in the outer reaches of our solar system.\n\nLooking Ahead: A New Era of Discovery\n\nThe potential discovery of Kuiper Belt 2 opens up new avenues for exploration and could reshape our understanding of the solar system\u2019s outermost regions. With further observation, astronomers hope to learn more about these distant objects and what they reveal about the history and evolution of the solar system.\n\nALSO READ: New to BSNL 4G?

This magical, spiritual, and cultural event captivated the hearts of Punekars with mesmerizing techniques, fulfilling the quest for self-discovery. Internationally acclaimed philosopher and scientist Sri Bhupendra offered attendees an experience through the unfolded aspects of the domain of silence, allowing each individual to immerse in profound stillness that paved the way for deeper realization during the \u2018Meta Awakening\u2019 concert.\n\nThe event was organized by Soul Foundation India in collaboration with the Circle of Consciousness and Happiness, California, USA, and held at Hotel Ramee Grand. The main highlight of the concert was the energetic guidance provided by globally acclaimed philosopher, scientist, author, and influencer Sri Bhupendra. He shared his experiments with human existence, drawing from his 30 years of penance.\n\nBlending the realms of science and spirituality, Sri Bhupendra led attendees into a more conscious and awakened world. This cosmic dance of energy, experienced through culture, devotion, and scientific exploration, left an indelible mark on every heart and influenced their journey toward a higher state of being. The \u2018Meta Awakening\u2019 concert was coordinated by Kirti Gadre, a representative of the Circle of Consciousness and Happiness, California, USA.\n\nDuring his interaction with the audience, Sri Bhupendra explained the meaning of life as he had explored during his spiritual journey of three decades. He said, \u201cLife is a dance, a celebration. Therefore, we should adeptly navigate the ups and downs of life. Learn the art of living a positive, stress-free life by recognizing your own potential. A smile on the face, contentment in the mind, and a sense of spiritual happiness are the key ingredients of a truly happy life.\u201d\n\nRead Also Pune Airport Conducts Annual Earthquake Preparedness Drill\n\nThrough various examples, Sri Bhupendra highlighted the importance of silence and self-realization in life. He described how these reveal the true meaning of the two concepts, 'believe' and 'know'. \u201cYou believe in something like God only until you 'know' it. Knowing is fundamental, and it is routed through knowing 'who am I?'\" He also added that we can learn a lot from nature with respect to these two concepts. \u201cWe must be goal-oriented, just like a tiger or an eagle is while hunting. Instead of worrying about the future, we should take inspiration from our own experiences. There is a 'genius' dormant in everyone. We need to explore ourselves and develop our abilities to activate that 'genius'. In today's busy life, self-awareness is inevitable. Embracing both positive and negative forces is the key. Our strengths help us fly high, whereas unwanted experiences ground our roots deeper, helping us realize our potential to achieve better goals,\u201d he suggested.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Kirti Gadre said, \u201cThis concert marked the introduction of the global Meta Awakening movement to Punekars, offering a powerful experience of tapping into consciousness, a gateway to a more purposeful and successful life. In the coming years, we will look back on this day as a pivotal moment, where Meta Awakening became a significant milestone in human evolution. A new 'age' begins here, and some chosen Punekars witnessed it.\u201d\n\nApart from Sri Bhupendra's mesmerizing session, the concert also featured healing sessions and an outpouring of energy, along with cultural programs that included performances based on Guru Ashtakam, Nirvana Shatakam, and Gratitude Bhavgeet. These performances contributed to the positive energy in the atmosphere."

An El Ni\u00f1o is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 \u00b0C above the long-term average.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd while volcanic activity definitely played a big role in the \u2018Great Dying\u2019 (the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction), experts say the impact of these El Ni\u00f1os shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nChina University of Geosciences\u2019 Professor Yadong Sun claims that oxygen isotopes in fossils suggest they could have been greatly involved in this mass loss of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost life failed to adapt to these conditions, but thankfully a few things survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today. It was nearly, but not quite, the end of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd co-lead author of this study, Dr Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, added: \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes.\n\n\u201cOur research has revealed that increased greenhouse gases don\u2019t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more 'wild' and difficult for life to survive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the exact cause of the Great Dying remains somewhat uncertain but it\u2019s pretty complicated.\n\nAs well as so much time having obviously passed since, there\u2019s a scarcity of fossils to study and a complexity of evidence. Either way, scientists know something big happened to have such a big consequence."

        "article_content": "A few years ago, a friend of mine was struggling to keep up with the growing demands of his small business. You see, every weekend, he\u2019d spend hours manually setting sports odds, taking calls from his dedicated clients, and recording options with a pen and paper. One particularly busy Sunday, after juggling a dozen calls at once and nearly missing a client\u2019s request, he realized he needed a better system. That\u2019s when he discovered pay per head software. Practically overnight, his operation transformed. With everything automated\u2014from odds management to online player accounts\u2014he was able to scale his business and compete with larger competitors, all while providing a seamless experience for his clientele. That shift marked the start of a new chapter, not just for him, but for sports agents everywhere, and it all came down to the power of technology.\n\nThe industry has undergone a technological revolution in recent years, with pay per head (PPH) software emerging as a powerful tool that is reshaping how smaller local agents operate. These platforms are empowering independent businesses by providing them with cutting-edge technology, which allows them to compete with larger, more established companies.\n\nWhat is Pay Per Head Software?\n\nAt its core, pay per head software is a service that enables sports agents to manage their operations digitally. Instead of handling phone requests, odds, and player figures manually, a PPH platform automates these processes. The agent pays a fee for each active customer\u2014hence the \u201cpay per head\u201d model. In return, they gain access to a fully functional, professional-grade software platform equipped with features like live in-game, prop builder and dynamic odds updates.\n\nThe scalability and affordability of PPH software have made it an attractive option for independent operators looking to modernize their business offering and provide their customers with a first rate user experience.\n\nThe Technology Behind the Software\n\nPPH software relies on several key technologies that make it both efficient and effective. Here are the critical components that make these platforms so transformative:\n\n1. Cloud Computing and Scalability\n\nOne of the major advantages of PPH software is that it is cloud-based, allowing for seamless scalability. Agents can handle a growing number of users without the need for significant upfront investment in infrastructure. Cloud servers automatically adjust to accommodate fluctuations in traffic, ensuring that the platform remains stable even during peak periods like major sporting events.\n\nThe cloud-based nature of PPH software also means that updates and maintenance can be done remotely, without requiring any downtime. This frees up the agent to run their operations smoothly with minimal technical issues.\n\n2. Real-Time Data Processing\n\nSpeed and accuracy are essential, and PPH software excels at both. These platforms use real-time data processing to provide up-to-the-second odds on various sporting events. This dynamic updating ensures that users are getting the most accurate information available, which is crucial to their experience.\n\nAdditionally, real-time data processing allows for the tracking of player activity instantly. This includes monitoring open positions, analyzing trends, and adjusting lines accordingly to manage risk. The ability to process vast amounts of data quickly is what provides the ability to stay competitive in a fast-paced environment.\n\n3. Automation and AI-Driven Analytics\n\nAutomation is at the heart of pay per head software. The platform automatically handles tasks such as managing player accounts, tracking wins and losses, and generating reports. This not only reduces the workload for agents but also minimizes the risk of human error.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many advanced PPH systems are beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to provide deeper insights into player behavior. AI-driven analytics can help to identify patterns, assess risk, and even predict future trends. By leveraging AI, agents can make more informed decisions, optimizing both profitability and player retention.\n\n4. Mobile Integration and User Experience\n\nToday\u2019s users demand mobile accessibility, and this software delivers. PPH platforms are designed with responsive, mobile-friendly interfaces that allow users to find sporting events, check odds, and manage their accounts from any device.\n\nThe user experience is central to the success of PPH. Many feature sleek, intuitive designs that make it easy for users to navigate and find options quickly.

Whether it\u2019s focusing on local sports, niche markets, or unique props, this flexibility enables an agent to stand out in a crowded marketplace and better cater to the preferences of their clientele.\n\n24/7 Customer Support : Many PPH services come with round-the-clock customer support for both the agent and their clients.
